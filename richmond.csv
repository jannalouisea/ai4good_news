Vancouver Police says it's investigating the death of Shakur, who was shot near Main Street and East 48th Avenue just after 11 p.m. Monday.

Shakur, who didn’t have an extensive police history according to the VPD, died at the scene.

Early Tuesday the scene of the shooting was blocked off by police tape, and evidence markers were seen on the ground while investigators combed the site.

Nearby residents told CBC they heard “four loud pops” shortly before 11 p.m. Monday.

The “rail footprint” of the Ray-Mont Logistics terminal, located at 15900 River Road near No. 7 Road, will be increased to accommodate unit trains, while the terminal’s specialty grain and container handling equipment will be upgraded, according to a spokesperson for Transport Canada.

The expansion will increase terminal capacity by about 160 per cent, or 1.7 million tonnes per year.

“Our government is investing in Canada’s economy by making improvements to our trade and transportation corridors,” said Transport Minister Marc Garneau in a statement announcing the investment June 30.

The facility receives and unloads grain from a variety of Canadian agricultural producers, according to Transport Canada. Once unloaded, those products are loaded into shipping containers, before heading to port terminals for overseas export.

By expanding the facility to accommodate unit trains – a train where all cars carry the same commodity bound for the same destination – supply chain efficiency will be improved and congestion reduced.",[]

Todd Norman John Bezzasso raised approximately $5 million from 85 investors through his companies, Bezzaz Holdings Group Ltd. (Bezzaz) and Nexus Global Trading Ltd. (Nexus).

article continues below

During this time, Bezzasso engaged fellow Richmond resident Wei Kai (a.k.a. Kevin) Liao to find investors on his behalf.

The British Columbia Securities Commission (BCSC) panel found that instead of using all of investor funds as promised, Bezzasso was actually operating a Ponzi scheme.

A large portion of the investors’ funds was being used to pay earlier investors, meaning many people who invested later during the scheme lost some or all of their money.

While the panel found that Bezzasso, Bezzaz and Nexus committed fraud against all 85 investors, the panel found that Liao committed fraud against one investor, traded in securities without being registered and acted as an adviser to investors without being registered.

As a result of their misconduct, Bezzasso is ordered to pay an administrative penalty of $4.5 million, and Bezzasso, Bezzaz and Nexus are jointly ordered to pay a financial sanction of $1,619,563, representing the amount they obtained or avoided losing as a result of the misconduct.

In ordering these sanctions, the panel noted that they “engaged in a deliberate and extensive fraud which deprived investors of a large portion of their invested funds.”

For his misconduct, Liao is ordered to pay $100,000 in administrative sanctions and a financial sanction of $68,530, representing the amount he obtained or avoided losing as a result of his misconduct.

In addition to the financial sanctions, Bezzasso is permanently banned and Liao is prohibited for 15 years from:

• relying on any exemption under the Securities Act

• being a director or officer of any issuer or registrant

• being or acting as a registrant or promoter

• acting in a management or consultative capacity in connection with the securities market

• and engaging in investor relations activities

They are also banned for the same time periods from trading in or purchasing securities or exchange contracts, although Liao is allowed to do so for personal use through a registered dealer.

He says when he initially checked his ticket, he wasn’t quite convinced he was a big winner.

“I checked at the self-checker,” said Gill. “I told my son, and then I had to go to another gas station to make sure it was correct. After I told my wife, they both thought I was joking and didn’t believe me.”

Gill says the $1 million means he can take a step back from work.

“It’ll be nice to not have to work so hard,” laughed Gill. “I’ll still continue to … I want to start my own business.”

On top of starting a new business, Gill will put some of his money towards the new house that he’s building, so the timing of the win is perfect.

9,richmond-news,https://www.richmond-news.com/news/steves-plans-to-hang-up-richmond-council-hat-1.24171365,Steves plans to hang up Richmond council hat,['Maria Rantanen'],,"Harold Steves campaigned 50 years ago for a new museum for Steveston — he’s hoping before he ends his last term on council in 2022, it will finally be well underway.

With original plans for a museum in Steveston waylaid for several years by more grandiose ideas for a destination museum closer to the current city centre, Richmond council has now approved reconstructing the former Phoenix Net Loft with preliminary plans to make it into a museum.

article continues below

“Some things take a long time,” Steves told the Richmond News with a chuckle.

Getting a museum built has only been one of his priority projects on council.

Steves announced his “retirement” from council in a tweet this past weekend, saying “the realtor farmers are waiting like vultures for the next election when I retire, leaving a vacancy, and voters forget to be vigilant.”

Steves was first elected to council in 1969, and then served as an NDP MLA in the Dave Barrett government between 1972-1975. During this time, he helped establish the Agricultural Land Reserve (ALR), overseen by the Agricultural Land Commission, which regulates activities on any ALR land.

He was re-elected to Richmond council in 1977 and has served as a councillor ever since.

One of the most important issues he’s advocated for was keeping the Garden City Lands as a centrepiece for agriculture. Council was able to buy the lands, which are located in the ALR.

“It probably ended up being the most important thing … we saved land in downtown Richmond and now we’re going to farm it,” Steves said.

Steves has been a vocal advocate for farming and local food security. He and his wife Kathy run an 11-acre cattle farm in Steveston.

Richmond Mayor Malcolm Brodie said Steves’ work on council and his contribution to community life has been “immeasurable,” with him regularly bringing interesting initiatives to the table “mixed with a very good dose of pragmatism.”

“Harold will bring in actual ideas… that impact on the evolution of our city, with an environmental flavour, but solid in many, many different ways,” Brodie said.

During council meetings, Steves will often give a quick historical synopsis on agenda items, often dipping into his archives, which Brodie said rival city archives for council documents, to find relevant background information on the topic of the day.

“The history that Harold Steves brings to the council table and the knowledge, the corporate knowledge, is irreplaceable,” Brodie said.

“There will definitely be a hole to be filled, and (Steves) does have very large footprints, which he will leave on the city,” he added.

Steves has often said he wouldn’t retire until Michael Wolfe was elected to council and after several runs, Wolfe was successful to get on council in the last election.

Steves still has two years left in his term, and one of his biggest priorities is to make sure the Garden City Lands become a stronger centre for farming.

In fact, he is hoping to see a greenbelt stretching from the Garden City Lands, the Department of Defence lands to its east and the Richmond Nature Park joined together as a centrepiece of agricultural viability within the city and region.

His other dream is to have all the original groups in the city, the First Nations, the Chinese, the Japanese and the Europeans, recognized for their historical role in establishing the first townsite of Richmond – Steveston – while the rest of the city was just a smattering of farms.

A museum at the soon-to-be-rebuilt Phoenix Net Loft is where it could all come together, he said.",[]

Britannia has been a popular favourite for many in Richmond and is known for their food, their own line of brews on tap and their bar program.

article continues below

Lloyd Kinney, co-founder and operating director of the Britannia Brewing Company, said they are feeling “very excited” for the opening.

“We’re just waiting for the city to provide us with a building permit and then from there we can proceed to stage two which is the fit out,” said Kinney, adding that they expect to open before Christmas.

“It’s always been part of our business plan as a brewery to have restaurant partners we would support with our craft beer.”

Their Ladner location will be a newly-renovated space of the former Ladner Village Hardware store, also known as Clayton’s Hardware store in the movie Fifty Shades of Grey.

And it will run as a restauarant with a larger space and no brewing facilities compared to Steveston's location.

However, it will feature a new “corporate private room” that large groups can book for private and public gatherings.

“We’ve always gotten requests to completely book out our restaurant in Steveston, but to be fair to our locals, we’ve never accepted full private bookings,” said Kinney.

“It’s a larger space than what we have now and so there’ll be a little more of that social atmosphere by having the bar or lounge area being bigger.”

“Advance fee loans, the second riskiest scam in Canada for 2019, continues to wreak havoc for B.C. residents in a financial bind because of the pandemic,” according to the BBB, which is warning consumers, who may be urgently trying to acquire funds, to be on “high alert” to avoid losing money and exposing their personal information.

article continues below

The BBB says that the reports its received from victims across the province show consumers are extremely susceptible to the scam.

As part of the scam, the BBB says consumers may receive an email or phone call, or – as in the case of more recent reports to the bureau’s Scam Tracker – a pop-up ad online or find a website while searching for a loan company.

In this con, scammers disguised as loan brokers and other lending institutions advertise and promise loans to those in a financial bind. The loan, which is guaranteed regardless of credit history, comes with upfront charges labelled as “taxes,” “insurance” or “processing fees.”

However, when the charges are paid, the loan never materializes and the applicant is left with larger debts. The BBB says that requiring advance fees for loans is illegal in Canada

“Typically, the scammers will ask you to pay a fee for a seemingly legitimate reason,” said Karla Laird, the BBB’s manager for community and public relations.

“Oftentimes, they require that payment to be made by wire transfer, bitcoin or some other hard-to-recover method. However, once the fee is paid, the phony loan company stops communication and the consumer cannot get a refund.”

Vancouver man loses nearly $1,500

In one instance of the scam, which was reported to the BBB, a Vancouver resident lost nearly $1,500 to a company he found online with an Ontario address on its website.

The company told the Vancouver man his loan was approved for $10,000 at the rate of seven per cent for four years, however, the company needed a three-month advance payment in order to release the funds – a total of $718.

The company also told the man that his credit is high risk, so he would need to pay $1,500 insurance for the lender, although the company would cover half. The company wanted the Vancouver man to send the money using Bitcoin.

The company, Kingsway Lending, according to the BBB, is using the address of a Canada Revenue Agency office in Ontario.

“Scammers understand that consumers are searching for websites that look professional, and will put effort into making your loan application process feel like the real deal,” said Laird.

“With this in mind, thorough research on a company before initiating any transactions, is the best way to avoid being tricked out of your money and personal information.”

What to look out for

The BBB says consumers should look out for the following red flags is they are searching for a lender or loan broker:

You receive unsolicited communication (phone call, text message, email) offering an easy loan.

OTTAWA — The first of multiple parliamentary investigations of the federal government's aborted deal with WE Charity to run a volunteering program begins this afternoon.

The House of Commons finance committee is set to hear from Youth Minister Bardish Chagger and some senior public servants as it probes how WE got a sole-sourced contract to administer the $900-million program.

The Canada Student Service Grant is aimed at students who haven't been able to find work this summer, offering up to $5,000 toward education costs in exchange for 500 hours of volunteering.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has admitted he should have recused himself from the decision to award the contract, given his family's links to the group co-founded by brothers Craig and Marc Kielburger.

WE gave up the contract amid the controversy two weeks ago.

The government has since taken control of the program, but has been struggling with the details while the summer ticks by.

TORONTO — Torontonians will have a final chance to weigh in on public consultations about police reform today, while protesters are set to take to the streets demanding that the force be defunded.

The Toronto Police Services Board's fourth and final town hall on ""police accountability, reform and community safety priorities"" is due to begin at 9 a.m.

Late last month, city council voted against a cut to the force's budget, but proposed a series of changes to policing including anti-racism measures and the implementation of body cameras.

But the group organizing the protest, called No Pride in Policing Coalition, says that doesn't go nearly far enough.

They advocate against body cameras for officers and are also calling for the force's budget to be cut by 50 per cent, with the money going towards community programs.

The protest is set to begin at noon outside police headquarters.

What we are watching in the U.S. ...

WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump is shaking up his campaign amid sinking poll numbers less than four months before the election, replacing campaign manager Brad Parscale with veteran GOP operative Bill Stepien.

The president announced the move Wednesday night on Facebook.

Trump and Parscale's relationship has been strained since a Tulsa, Okla., rally that drew a dismal crowd, infuriating the president.

Parscale was a political novice when he ran Trump's digital advertising in 2016 and was credited with helping bring about his surprise victory.

Stepien has been in politics for years, working for former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and serving as Trump's national field director in 2016.

LONDON — The European Union's top court has ruled that an agreement that allows big tech companies to transfer data to the United States is invalid, and that national regulators need to take tougher action to protect the privacy of users data.

Today's ruling does not mean an immediate halt to all data transfers outside the EU, as there is another legal mechanism that some companies can use.

But it means that the scrutiny over data transfers will be ramped up and that the EU and U.S. may have to find a new system that guarantees that Europeans' data is afforded the same privacy protection in the U.S. as it is in the EU.

In sports news ...

As one of America's most familiar sports franchises finally confronts its controversial identity, experts warn against assuming Canada is farther along than the United States in combating racist attitudes towards Indigenous Peoples.

Washington's National Football League team confirmed this week it would drop its 87-year-old name and logo, long deemed offensive to Native Americans.

The decision comes with the United States at the centre of a global reckoning with long-standing systemic and institutional racism against Black people and other racialized communities.

Lynn Gehl, an Indigenous author and scholar in Peterborough, Ont., says Canadians should resist the belief that their country is any further along than the U.S. in acknowledging and protecting First Nations, Inuit and Metis communities.

Gehl notes that both the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and a public inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls concluded that Canada has been engaged in acts of genocide.

The CFL's Edmonton Eskimos are under pressure to change a nickname long considered a derogatory, colonial-era term, while in Morden, Man., a minor-league hockey team faces similar demands to drop the same moniker just abandoned in Washington.

TORONTO — A painting by Alex Colville shattered a price record for work by the Canadian master at an auction held in Toronto on Wednesday.

Colville's 1976 canvas ""Dog and Bridge"" sold for more than $2.4 million — doubling its estimated value. The work had been owned privately for decades and had never appeared at auction before.

Pablo Picasso's 1939 ""Tete de femme"" sold for more than $1.3 million — about in the middle of its estimated range.

Abstract Expressionist painter Joan Mitchell's oil on canvas triptych, ""Untitled,"" sold for nearly $1.2 million, well above its estimated price of about $500,000.

Quebec artist Jean Paul Riopelle's commanding, large-scale ""Le reveil"" sold for about $1.2 million.

Five works by Lawren Harris were also sold, two for well above their estimates. His ""North East Corner of Lake Superior (Lake Superior Sketch XXXVIII)"" fetched $481,250 and the abstraction ""LSH 89A"" went for $277,250.

ICYMI (In case you missed it) ...

PORT ALBERNI, B.C. — This is quite a fish tale.

A commercial fisherman knew he was staring at a fish out of place when a barracuda landed in his net on Vancouver Island.

Tyler Vogrig, 24, says he'd seen the long, silvery body of the muscular fish with giant teeth before, but in Hawaii.

Vogrig says he and his father Brian were catching sockeye at Alberni Inlet as part of their stock-assessment work for Fisheries and Oceans Canada when they hauled in the barracuda.

""We couldn't believe it,"" he says from his home in Vancouver. ""The fish was docile because it was being chased by some seals and one of the seals actually nipped it on its tail so it had a little gash on it.""

The duo placed the weak, predatory fish in a tank to recover for about 30 minutes before releasing it.

Jackie King, a research scientist with the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, says the presence of Pacific barracuda in British Columbia waters is rare.

The fish are normally found in Baja California in Mexico, bordering the state of California, but have also recently been seen as far north as Washington state neighbouring B.C., likely due to warming waters at home.

Police said they found evidence Wednesday night Martin Carpentier was in a trailer in the area where police have focused their search since the bodies of Norah and Romy Carpentier, aged 11 and 6, were discovered Saturday.

Carpentier took items from the trailer, suggesting he may visit other barns, sheds or cottages in the region, police said in a news release.

""We are dealing with an individual who is probably desperate and who must be looking for equipment to ensure his survival,"" Sgt. Audrey-Anne Bilodeau said in a pre-recorded audio message sent to reporters.

Police asked residents of Lotbiniere and surrounding areas west of Quebec City to check their cottages, trailers or buildings for signs of a break-in, such as missing or moved clothing, food, or equipment. Hunters who have set up cameras in the woods are also being asked to check their recordings.

Police are also suggesting worried citizens search in groups or with a police escort and to call 911 with any relevant information.

Sgt. Ann Mathieu, another provincial police spokeswoman, told reporters Thursday there's no evidence to suggest Carpentier poses a danger to the general population.

""It's an individual who is currently, if he is still alive — and the elements we have lead us to believe he is — is looking to ensure his survival and to hide,"" she said.

Investigators have said the girls and their father were believed to have been in a serious car crash on Highway 20 in the Quebec City suburb of St-Apollinaire July 8, but there was nobody inside the vehicle when they arrived on scene.

An Amber Alert was issued last Thursday but cancelled two days later after the bodies were found.

In recent days police have focused their search on a 50-square-kilometre wooded area around St-Apollinaire, where ""items of interest"" were found on Sunday.

Autopsies were performed on the two girls, but police said they won't reveal the cause of death until Carpentier is found.

Provincial health officer Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix announced July 15 that there were 21 new cases in the past 24 hours, including two cases that they call ""epi-linked,"" or presumed cases that have not been proven through testing but are being treated as official cases.

The province has now recorded 3,149 cases since the novel coronavirus first appeared in B.C. in late January.

More than 87.4% of those infected, or 2,753 people, have recovered. Of those who haven't, 189 people have died and 207 people are actively fighting the virus. Only 14 people are hospitalized, with five of those in intensive care units. The rest are self-isolating at home. There were no new deaths recorded in the past 24 hours.

Recording at least 20 new COVID-19 cases in a 24-hour period has become common in B.C., and Henry said yesterday that she found that number ""distressing,"" even though, she added, the good news is that the province knows where the clusters of infection are, many of the infections are linked and the number is not really that large given the province's population of more than five million residents.

The numbers in the past week were:

• 20 new cases on July 9;

• 25 new cases on July 10;

• 21 new cases on July 11;

• 20 new cases on July 12;

• 21 new cases on July 13;

• 13 new cases on July 14; and now

• 21 new cases on July 15.

In June, the number of daily new cases many times was in the single digits.

""There is one active community outbreak, in addition to several community exposure events,"" Henry and Dix said. ""There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks.""

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,023 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1,659 in Fraser Health;

• 135 in Island Health;

• 216 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

• 51 people who reside outside Canada.

Mahy, who has doggedly persisted in having the police and courts pursue this case, said he was recently told by the crown prosecutor that the man charged in the fatality, Erjon Kashari, has been arrested in Bulgaria and will be sent back to Richmond when COVID-related travel restrictions are lifted.

article continues below

“She (the prosecutor) congratulated me on my persistence. In six years I haven’t given it up. I couldn’t,” said Mahy.

In an email to the Richmond News, Alisia Adams with the BC Prosecution Service, would only confirm, as she did a year ago, that Kashari has been charged with criminal negligence causing the death of Christy.

However, she directed inquiries about his arrest and extradition to the federal Department of Justice's International Assistance Group. The News reached out but did not hear back by the time of publication.

It was July 30, 2014 when Ron’s daughter, Christy Mahy, 36, was standing with her bike at the Dinsmore Bridge intersection on Russ Baker Way on her way home to Burkville, when an SUV, bearing an N, jumped the curb and plowed into her.

The driver stayed at the scene and there were numerous witnesses.

However, the driver was not charged and soon after left the country.

For the first few years after the tragic accident, Mahy said he was given little information regarding the case and, to this day, he still doesn’t understand why the driver wasn’t charged immediately, particularly as there were so many witnesses prepared to give statements.

Determined to not let his daughter’s story be forgotten, however, Mahy, a Harley Davidson rider, organized a motorcycle ride in Christy’s name in 2015, which has run every years since -- and this year will be no different.

Riders will convene at the parking lot beside the Flying Beaver Bar and Grill on Inglis Drive on July 25 at 2 p.m. and the ride will get underway at 2:30 p.m.

“It will be a good ride this year. We’ll have about 40 or 50 riders.”

The ride will end with a barbecue in Langley -- albeit with tables spread out, and masks and hand sanitizer on hand to guard against COVID, said Mahy.

Mahy, who worked in the film industry, but has since retired to the Sunshine Coast, will make his annual pilgrimage to Richmond for the event.

But before he joins the other riders, Mahy said he will take a few minutes to sit on the bench in Flight Path Park that has been dedicated to his daughter.

There, just metres away from where the crash happened, he will think about his daughter and the sad irony that this was the very same spot that he and Christy’s mother had their first date, “watching the planes.”

Christy’s mom died of cancer in 2005.

In past years, when Mahy has sat on that bench, the sadness has been mixed with bitterness and frustration at the thought that someone may never face the consequence of having taken his daughter’s life.

This year, however, he said there is a touch of hope that justice will be served, as well as a sense of appreciation for those within the court system who have not let this case go.",[]

Here's how the list reads on Facebook, as shared in a public post from a user the morning of Wednesday, July 15:

Wisdom from Dr Bonnie Henry

We may have to live with C19 for months or years. Let's not deny it or panic. Let's not make our lives useless. Let's learn to live with this fact. You can't destroy C19 viruses that have penetrated cell walls, by drinking gallons of hot water you'll just go to the bathroom more often. Washing hands and maintaining a two-metre physical distance is the best method for your protection. If you don't have a C19 patient at home, there's no need to disinfect the surfaces at your house. Packaged cargo, gas pumps, shopping carts and ATMs do not cause infection. If you wash your hands, live your life as usual. C19 is not a food infection. It is associated with drops of infection like the 'flu. There is no demonstrated risk that C19 is transmitted by food. You can lose your sense of smell with a lot of allergies and viral infections. This is only a non-specific symptom of C19. Once at home, you don't need to change your clothes urgently and go shower! Purity is a virtue, paranoia is not! The C19 virus doesn't hang in the air for long. This is a respiratory droplet infection that requires close contact. The air is clean, you can walk through the gardens and through parks (just keeping your physical protection distance). It is sufficient to use normal soap against C19, not antibacterial soap. This is a virus, not a bacteria. You don't have to worry about your food orders. But you can heat it all up in the microwave, if you wish. The chances of bringing C19 home with your shoes is like being struck by lightning twice in a day. I've been working against viruses for 20 years — drop infections don't spread like that! You can't be protected from the virus by taking vinegar, sugarcane juice and ginger! These are for immunity not a cure. Wearing a mask for long periods interferes with your breathing and oxygen levels. Wear it only in crowds. Wearing gloves is also a bad idea; the virus can accumulate into the glove and be easily transmitted if you touch your face. Better just to wash your hands regularly. Immunity is greatly weakened by always staying in a sterile environment. Even if you eat immune boosting foods, please go out of your house regularly to any park/beach. Immunity is increased by EXPOSURE TO PATHOGENS, not by sitting at home and consuming fried/ spicy/sugary food and aerated drinks.

Be smart and stay informed!

Live life sensibly and to the fullest.—

Dr Bonnie Henry

The list isn't new to the internet, with roots going back to mid-May and a connection to a U.S. physician in Maryland. However, the list is newly showing Dr. Henry as its author.

That doctor is Dr. Faheen Younus, the Chief of Infectious Diseases, University of Maryland Upper Chesapeake Health. The list actually has its roots in the multiple tweets Dr. Younus shared into May on his personal Twitter feed. The paraphrased format first appeared, and was widely shared, thanks to an article on the site TheAZB.com.

If you take the first piece of ""wisdom,"" in the now-circulating Dr. Henry-attributed posts, it reads: ""We may have to live with C19 for months or years. Let's not deny it or panic. Let's not make our lives useless. Let's learn to live with this fact.""

TheAZB.com begins their recap of Dr. Younus' tweeted items as follows: ""He Tweets We will live with Covid19 for months. Let’s not deny it or panic. Let’s not make life unnecessarily difficult. Let us learn to be happy and live with that fact.""

Similarly, the items in the list are paraphrased and tweaked as they are adapted by each re-poster or re-formatter of the list. For example, while The AZB.com summarizes a thought attributed to Dr. Younus as ""You cannot be protected from the virus by drinking / eating vinegar, sumac, soda and ginger."" The Dr. Henry-attributed phony list reads as follows: ""You can't be protected from the virus by taking vinegar, sugarcane juice and ginger! These are for immunity not a cure.""

Dr. Younus himself discredited the viral post, which moved rapidly on WhatsApp, in a tweet on June 6:

IMPORTANT:



These are not my words. There are errors and typos in this viral post on FB/WhatsApp that someone adapted from my tweets without approval.



I share COVID info only on twitter. Just read through my TL here if you’d like accurate info.



Spread the word please. Thx pic.twitter.com/tplGscusMh — Faheem Younus, MD (@FaheemYounus) June 6, 2020

On July 15, a site called The Dallas Orthodox Jewish Life presents the list as ""Dr. Bonnie Henry’s Down to Earth Advice,"" featuring an image taken without permission from the New York Times' recent profile of B.C.'s top doc.

Forms of the list show up on Google as being reproduced all over, with varying attribution or none at all, from church newsletters to personal blogs.

Many B.C. residents are sharing the list on their Facebook pages today, however many more are trying to get the word out that the list is not Dr. Henry's.

Dr. Henry's COVID-19 provincial case media updates are published on the Province of British Columbia's website, and reputable sources readily cover the regular press conferences here in B.C. Further, B.C. has a robust online section dedicated to COVID-19, which includes reliable and accurate information.

There is no press conference scheduled for Wednesday, July 15. A representative who assists with media requests for Dr. Henry said the following via email to V.I.A.: ""[T]he information was not developed by Dr. Henry nor anyone in her office. While some of the recommendations are similar to her remarks over the past several months, there are inaccuracies and errors in the guidance that is provided. She rather recommends British Columbians refer to the excellent guidance found on the B.C. Centre of Disease Control’s website at www.bccdc.ca and share that information through their social networks.""",[]

The Federal Bureau of Prisons is expected to take Sidoo into custody on September 23 and release him from a Pacific Northwest area facility just before Christmas.

article continues below

Sidoo, 61, appeared online via Zoom in front of United States District Judge Nathaniel Gorton of the United States District Court for District of Massachusetts, as well as his lawyers and prosecutors. He wore a plaid suit while sitting in an office space inside his $31.7 million home in Vancouver’s Point Grey neighbourhood.

Sidoo, now a convicted felon, initially pled innocent to fraud and money laundering charges; he teared up before being sentenced and read a prepared statement:

“The last several months have been the hardest in my entire life and today I accept the court’s decision without reservation. No words can express how sorry I am for my decisions and actions that led to this day. I make no excuses, your honour. I broke the law and pled guilty and I now must pay for my actions.

“To my wife and boys, all I ever wanted was your love and respect and to be a good role model. And I know I have made a terrible mistake that has deeply affected our family. To my friends and colleagues and former teammates over the years, I am deeply ashamed today. To the young men and women who looked up to me as a role model, you deserve better. To the court and all of you, I wish to apologize for my actions.

“I will serve my sentence and am committed to returning to the community and doing everything possible to make a positive impact. I hope in time people will not judge me for the worst mistake in my life but for the work in the days, weeks and years ahead in which I am committed to being a better man.”

Gorton told Sidoo he was “impressed” by the businessman’s “obvious remorse.”

But Gorton pointed out two omissions in Sidoo’s statement.

“You expect to put this behind you and go forward and make up for what you called mistakes. I would call it a crime, not a mistake, but nevertheless, it is important that you acknowledge it and realize how many constituencies you have disappointed,” said the judge.

Sidoo also did not explicitly acknowledge that his crimes resulted in two students missing an opportunity to attend the universities his sons, Dylan Sidoo and Jordan Sidoo, were admitted to.

“What you accomplished, along with getting them into college, is to deprive two other deserving students of admittance into those universities — an act that is the very antithesis of one you want to be known for,” said Gorton.

Likewise, United States Attorney Andrew Lelling submitted to Gorton: “Sidoo engaged in serious criminal conduct involving fraud and deception that stretched over multiple years.

“His crimes warrant significant punishment. By engaging in the scheme, with [scheme mastermind Rick Singer] and others, Sidoo was able to steal two college admissions slots for his sons, including one from the University of California at Berkeley, one of the top public universities in the nation.”

Sidoo, said Gorton, “committed a crime that displayed an unbelievable lack of integrity, morality and common sense.

“You have let your selfish desire, your pride and your enormous wealth overcome all of what you apparently want to stand for with your works of charity,” Gorton told Sidoo.

Sidoo’s philanthropy, derived from his earnings in the capital markets, was central to his sentencing defense. According to Sidoo he has donated several million dollars to charitable causes, such as the University of B.C. football program.

In pleading guilty to fraud, Sidoo avoided a maximum prison term of 20 years and prosecutors subsequently agreed to 90 days behind bars, plus a $250,000 fine and one-year of supervised release, which will not be enforced in Canada by the U.S. Probation Department. Prosecutors also agreed to drop the money laundering charge.

The prison Sidoo goes to is expected to have harsher conditions since his options are limited due to his foreign citizenship. His attorney Martin Weinberg said he is expected to spend 14 days in isolation in a “maximum security setting,” due to COVID-19.

Sidoo will get four days credit for time already served. If he serves the full 90 days he will be released December 17 but will have to spend 14 days in isolation at home should B.C. public health rules for international travellers and COVID-19 continue into the fall.

Gorton said Sidoo’s crime would normally warrant more time in jail but there are mitigating circumstances, such as his remorse, lack of criminal record, philanthropy and “collateral consequences,” such as not being able to enter the U.S. as a felon and being stripped last month of his Order of B.C. medal for community service. Sidoo’s attorneys also previously noted he did not directly pay the universities but that his fraud was limited to cheating on the tests.

The former B.C. Lions football player worked as a stock broker in the 1990s and an investment banker between 2000 and 2010. Since 2010 he has made millions of dollars directing a handful of public companies that have failed to generate wealth for retail investors.

Sidoo was arrested March 8, 2019, in San Jose, California, on charges by the U.S. Department of Justice of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering related to the high-profile U.S. college admissions and bribery scandal, brought to light by a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe dubbed Operation Varsity Blues.

One of dozens of parents to be charged, Sidoo initially pled innocent to paying $200,000 total to scheme mastermind William ‘Rick’ Singer, who hired corrupt exam expert Mark Riddell to take Dylan and Jordan’s SAT exams, in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Sidoo also helped falsify one of his son Jordan’s university applications in October 2013 with an essay that originally included a fake claim of Jordan being held up at gunpoint by gangsters, while he was purported to be an intern for an anti-gang organization.

Co-conspirators Singer and Riddell pled guilty last year in exchange for cooperating with the government’s investigation.

The guilty parties in the case, who used Singer’s criminal services, were generally well-off individuals. Celebrities such as actress Lori Loughlin and her clothing designer husband Mossimo Gianulli and actress Felicity Huffman also pled guilty for related crimes and brought much media attention to the investigation.

Sidoo’s sons had no involvement in their father’s crime.

Jordan is now a 2018 history graduate from University of California Berkeley. Dylan graduated in cinematic arts in 2016 from the University of Southern California (USC). The two previously attended Vancouver’s prestigious St. George’s School.

Neither university has announced whether or not their degrees will remain valid. Dylan, according to the sentencing documents, had scored a 1,460/2,400 SAT score until Riddell, using a fake ID in December 2011, bumped up the score to 1,700, which was high enough for Dylan to enter Chapman University (and later transfer to USC). Riddell then scored 2,280/2,400 for Jordan in December 2012, paving the way to Berkley.

Riddell also took a high school test for Dylan. The B.C. Ministry of Education has issued no statement on how its testing process was so vulnerable to fraud.

Both sons have since entered into penny stock promotion with their father.

22,richmond-news,https://www.richmond-news.com/huawei-hopeful-it-can-provide-5g-to-canada-despite-trump-five-eyes-pressure-1.24170835,"Huawei hopeful it can provide 5G to Canada despite Trump, Five Eyes pressure",[],,"OTTAWA — Huawei Canada says it is collateral damage in the Trump administration's trade war with China and remains hopeful that it might still be able to sell next-generation internet equipment to Canada.

That characterization comes one day after Britain became the last of Canada's ""Five Eyes"" intelligence-sharing allies to ban the Chinese telecommunications firm from its 5G wireless internet.

article continues below

The next generation of wireless internet technology is to be dramatically faster than the current standard, with more bandwidth and faster response times. It's expected to be crucial to technologies such as autonomous vehicles and remote medicine.

Alykhan Velshi, Huawei Canada's vice president of corporate affairs, says the company hopes the Trudeau government's ongoing 5G review steers clear of political machinations by administration of U.S. President Donald Trump to undermine the company.

""We see ourselves as being caught in the middle of the U.S.-China trade war. Canada is also unfortunately caught in the middle of it,"" Velshi said in an interview on Wednesday.

""That is the context in which a lot of announcements and decisions are made, as the Trump administration is demanding that everyone pick a side whether it is actually in their interest to go all in on one side or that other.""

Britain's decision brought it firmly in line with Trump's campaign to have Huawei banned from allied countries, including Canada.

The United States views Huawei as a security threat and says its equipment and technology would serve as a back door for China's communist leaders and military to spy on other countries as they adopt 5G technology — a charge the company firmly denies.

The Trudeau government has delayed a long-awaited decision on whether to allow Huawei to participate in Canada's new 5G network largely because of China's ongoing imprisonment of two Canadian men, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor.

Kovrig and Spavor were arrested nine days after Canada detained Huawei's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, on an American arrest warrant in December 2018. That move is widely seen as retaliation by China to force Canada to release Meng.

Velshi, a lawyer and former Conservative political staffer, called the case against Meng a ""politically driven"" prosecution by Trump, and pointed to a 2018 musing by the president that she could be used as a bargaining chip in his trade negotiation with China.

He said Meng will be vindicated by the Canadian courts when the extent of Trump's political motivation is properly presented.

(The Green party issued a statement along the same lines Wednesday, saying the United States is abusing its extradition treaty with Canada for political purposes and calling on the Canadian government to demand U.S. charges against Meng be dropped.)

But at the same time, Velshi also expressed sympathy for Kovrig and Spavor and reiterated the view of the Canadian arm of his company that diplomats can somehow win their freedom.

""Like all Canadians we're concerned about their detention, we're concerned about their treatment and we want to see them home as soon as possible.""

The tensions between Beijing and Washington intensified on Wednesday following Tuesday's announcement by Britain that Huawei would be excluded from work on the 5G network because U.S. sanctions made it impossible to ensure the safety of Chinese-supplied equipment.

The Trump administration decided in May to block non-U.S. companies from using American technology to produce processor chips and other components for Huawei without Washington's approval.

On Wednesday, the Chinese government accused Britain of colluding with the U.S. to hurt Huawei. The Trump administration fired back by announcing travel bans on employees of Huawei and other Chinese companies that the U.S. determines are assisting authoritarian governments in violating human rights, including against Uighurs in western China.

Velshi said Huawei has faith in the Canadian government's ongoing 5G review and the company has nothing to say about how long it has taken for a decision to be made.

In the meantime, Velshi said that despite the tensions between Beijing and Ottawa, Huawei's revenues in Canada grew in 2019, as did its workforce, which stands at about 1,200 employees. Velshi said the company has not yet made public its 2019 financials.

""We attribute that growth to the fact that our customers … have largely stood by us and continued to buy our products,"" said Velshi.

David Reed, Britain's deputy high commissioner to Canada, had no comment on what Canada should do next, but noted the two countries enjoy strong co-operation in the Five Eyes, which also includes Australia and New Zealand.

Reed said all countries must focus on allowing more companies to thrive in the 5G market.

""The reason we're in this position is there's a global market failure,"" Reed said in an interview. ""That's the conversation we started, particularly with Five Eyes partners, earlier in the year and we're trying to make progress on that.""

John Power, the spokesman for Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains, gave no indication as to when the government would make its decision on which companies can sell 5G gear in Canada. He reiterated that the government would ""not compromise on matters of national security"" but declined to reference specific companies.

""Our government's review will consider technical and security factors, including advice from our security agencies and consider decisions from our allies and partners,"" he said in a statement, adding that it would take into account ""important domestic and international considerations.""

In one cluster, at least 17 cases have been traced to a group of people who met up in Kelowna, some from the Interior and Alberta, others from the Lower Mainland.

article continues below

“There are a number of people who have been exposed in those events,” said Henry Tuesday.

More troubling still is the emergence of new cases at the Krazy Cherry Fruit Company in Oliver, where two have been identified among migrant workers. They were among 62 cases identified in B.C. between Friday and Monday.

“Public health teams are monitoring the situation closely and have placed restrictions on those living and working on the farm to limit the potential for further transmission,” said Dr. Henry in a written statement today.

But others have expressed concerns that not enough is being done to prevent outbreaks among vulnerable groups. Where newly arrived immigrants were disproportionately affected at earlier outbreaks at poultry plants in Coquitlam, others say migrant agricultural workers still run higher risks due to inadequate housing.

“As anticipated,” said Byron Cruz of Sanctuary Health, an organization that works to protect migrant workers from predatory practices. “We knew that something was going to happen because the situation for housing in that farm is terrible. They were all crowded.”

‘WAY ABOVE MY COMFORT ZONE’

Yesterday, Dr. Henry warned 25 cases a day was “distressing” and “cautionary to us.” And while not unexpected due to the increased travel and social interaction of phase 3, she said “That’s way above my comfort zone.”

Dr. Henry urged anyone who attended Canada Day parties in the vicinity of the Kelowna cluster to self-monitor for even the mildest of symptoms, noting that anyone can be tested should they feel they’ve been exposed.

Just how quickly a province or state can backslide has been painted in stark relief among our neighbours to the south.

In comments to the press Tuesday, Health Minister Adrian Dix pointed to surges in several U.S. states where record breaking daily caseloads in several states have led jurisdictions like California to re-introduce physical distancing protocols, in what Dix described as “lockdown 2.0.”

“All our neighbouring jurisdictions continue to see an increase, whether it’s our neighbouring province to the east, Alberta, or others, Washington, Oregon and California, in Nevada, Arizona and in other American states — we’ve seen record days of new cases of COVID-19 recently,” said Dix.

Here in B.C., Henry said that on Monday, she checked how weekly caseloads are tracking with the province’s modelling that suggests British Columbians keep their social contacts to 65% of normal.

“We are still skirting that line. The RT, the reproductive number, is hovering around one… which is sort of pushing the limits of where we need to be,” she said.

While health officials work to contain the outbreak in Oliver, it’s unclear how a potential surge in cases will affect that calculation, and Byron Cruz of Sanctuary Health said he expects more cases to crop up in coming days due to their tight living quarters.

What is clear is the more cases are contained to a single cluster, the easier they are to track.

“This is going to be our dance over the next few months, where we do what we can do, we travel, we have those social interactions, but we do it in a thoughtful way so we do it with the people we know we’re with,” said Dr. Henry.",[]

The man and woman, who have asked not to be identified, were taken in by what appeared to be a call from their grandson in dire need of help.

article continues below

“The guy sounded so much like our grandson. If he had said ‘Grandma,’ we’d have known [it wasn’t him] right away, but he said ‘Nan’ and so does my grandson,” said the man.

The imposter grandson, who used their grandson’s name, called on Monday and told them he had been driving a friend’s car and struck a vehicle with Quebec licence plates that had turned sharply in front of him.

The fake grandson went on to say he had been taken to jail, but a judge would free him if he could pay for the damage, estimated to be $5,000. The grandparents were told to send money to the car’s owner in Montreal.

“I wasn’t cluing in at all [that this was a scam], he sounded so much like our grandson,” the man said.

The dutiful grandparents then took cash from their bank and went to the Bank of Montreal and using an account number the scammer had provided via an accomplice posing as a lawyer, they sent money to a BMO branch in downtown Montreal.

“The kid said, ‘Please don’t tell Dad,’ ” the man said. It wasn’t until he later talked to his grandson that it became clear they had been scammed.

The couple has since been in touch with police and the Bank of Montreal, which they say has been very helpful.

“They are doing their best to try and get the money back,” said the man, who thinks the scammers “took a shot in the dark and got lucky.”

But according to the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre, it’s likely the scammers mined information like the grandson’s name from social media to make the pitch more convincing.

The centre calls these types of scams “the emergency scam.” It preys on the fear of a loved one being hurt or in trouble. The scammer claims to be someone you know and says they need money immediately. They tend to use scenarios like needing bail money because they’ve been arrested, or being in a car accident, or having trouble returning from a foreign country.

The targets are often seniors and the scammer pretends to be a grandchild, who begs them not to tell their parents that they’re in trouble, the Anti-Fraud Centre said. As a result, the grandparent doesn’t find out until after they’ve sent the money that their grandchild was not the person who asked for help.

Const. Cam MacIntyre said scammers will go to any lengths to defraud a victim.

“They will pose as a family member, a trusted member of the public, or even the police. We strongly recommend that people never deposit money into accounts of people or entities they do know personally,” he said.

“It’s so important to verify where your money is going. Call a family member, a friend, or the police if you are suspicious.”

The Anti-Fraud Centre says there were 18,803 reports of fraud, and 6,671 victims reporting losses of $22.6 million in Canada in the first four months of this year.

MacIntyre suggests if you are in the process of providing financial information or sending money to potential fraudsters, stop immediately.

“Contact your financial institutions and ensure all payments that you have not authorized are stopped. Inform them of the fraud and change both passwords and access information,” he said.

Suspected frauds can be reported to your local police or the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre at 1-888-495-8501.

Kevin McIntosh, who launched the petition on change.org in late May, sent it to politicians on both sides of the border, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump, on Monday.

article continues below

“I propose that the current list of essential reasons for persons to cross the border between Canada and the U.S. be expanded to include those persons owning personal property outside of their home jurisdiction,” McIntosh told lawmakers.

McIntosh, who is now under 14-day quarantine at home following an odyssey to get his boat out of the Point Roberts Marina, told the Optimist he expects the political powers that be to expand the list of essential reasons to cross the border into the American peninsula, hopefully prior to an expected extension of the border closure next week.

Earlier this month McIntosh flew from YVR to Sea-Tac, drove a rental car to Bellingham and then took a chartered flight to Point Roberts, where he prepped his vessel to sail back to Canada.

He said with his boat now back in Canada, his personal situation has been resolved, but he’d like to see others who signed the petition get access to their boats and cottages.

He’s hopeful politicians will agree to expand the definition of essential travel so Canadians with property in Point Roberts can cross the border, so long as they don’t have any contact with local residents and don’t stay for any length of time.

Many who have signed the petition own cottages and worry that without regular maintenance they will fall into disrepair. They raise concerns over rats and raccoons causing damage to vacant buildings as well as the possibility of leaks and other issues. There are also worries about insurance not being valid if structures are unattended for months on end.

Many suggest that crossing the border to check on property should be deemed essential travel so long as those who cross only go to and from their properties.

Delta MP Carla Qualtrough previously told the Optimist she has “a ton of sympathy” for Canadians who can’t get to their cottages and boats, but isn’t sure when they’ll be able to cross the line again.

Qualtrough said she has been in talks with cabinet colleagues in Ottawa as well as people locally in an effort to find a solution that might suit the geographic anomaly, but has yet to come up with one.

“Unfortunately, I don’t see a world where we don’t treat the whole border the same,” she told the Optimist when asked about the unique circumstances in Point Roberts.

She said the best hope for those with property in Point Roberts might be a gradual reopening of the border by region or by type of visitor that could broaden the definition of essential travel.",[]

The Canadian director of the hospitality union, Unite Here, says the challenges facing their workers are unprecedented.

Ian Robb says over 90 per cent of hospitality employees in the country's hotels, airports, stadiums, universities and schools haven't worked since March.

He says too few employers are using the federal wage subsidy program to keep workers tied to their jobs and all levels of government need to work creatively to avoid long-term unemployment in the sector.

The union wants governments and employers to ensure their jobs are protected, that there is a safe way back to work and that there is income support for the duration of the crisis.

Robb says analysts predict the industry may not fully recover until the summer of 2022, leading to uncertainty for tens of thousands of workers and their families.

Police say there were heavy brake marks at the scene, and they believe the semi crossed into the oncoming lane after the driver failed to safely make a turn on the highway.

The truck flipped onto its side and skidded down the highway before striking the five other vehicles travelling eastbound.

Police say the driver has been charged with crossing a double line under the B.C. Motor Vehicle Act.

The Mounties say speed may have been a factor in the crash but there's no evidence to suggest impaired driving was involved.

The survey of 1,401 member businesses from groups including the BC Chamber of Commerce, Greater Vancouver Board of Trade and Business Council of B.C. indicates owners want a bold, long-term recovery plan.

Only 16 per cent of businesses were confident in B.C.'s restart plan and 47 per cent were not.

Two-thirds of those surveyed were relying on some form of government support and owners were braced for a ""second wave"" of shutdowns or other problems if programs expire too quickly.

Some 28 per cent believed they'll return to normal once programs end, 32 per cent expected to cut workers' hours, 27 per cent anticipated layoffs, and one business in every 10 forecast either temporary or permanent closure.

Owners say payroll and wage supports must remain key components of B.C.'s recovery plan, along with fee and tax cuts.

The survey also identified expectations that the province must create better investment conditions.

Bridgitte Anderson, president and CEO of the Greater Vancouver Board of Trade, says business viability hinges on those measures.

Val Litwin with the BC Chamber of Commerce urges policy-makers to ""stay sensitive"" to the vulnerability of the business sector.

""A bold economic recovery plan that helps small businesses compete is non-negotiable for a prosperous B.C., and when small businesses thrive so do communities and people,"" Litwin said in a statement.

""Governments must keep focused on delivering their recovery plans swiftly.""

The joint study by researchers at the B.C. Centre for Disease Control, University of B.C., LifeLabs and public health scientists is posted on the health research website medRxiv and a news conference on the findings is scheduled for Thursday morning.

article continues below

The authors say the findings indicate successful suppression of community transmission in B.C., with an estimated overall infection rate of less than one per cent.

The study looked at anonymous blood samples collected for reasons unrelated to COVID-19 by LifeLabs in March and May, before and after public health measures were introduced.

The first samples in March found two of 869 specimens were positive, for a prevalence of 0.28 per cent, while the May sample found a prevalence of 0.55 per cent.

Health Minister Adrian Dix described the estimated infection rate as ""very low"" and says it shows the effectiveness of British Columbia's public health measures and co-operation of the public.

""It reinforces the fact that we're on the right track,"" Dix says.

""Of course, this is as the study suggests a dual-edged question, a low level of transmission but also very few people with antibodies to deal with potential future spikes of COVID-19.""

If the study's prevalence rate is applied to the whole provincial population, it could mean about 28,000 people have had the novel coronavirus, while 3,149 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed to date, however Dix noted the results are specific to the Vancouver area.

Health officials have repeatedly said that more people have been infected with the virus than have tested positive and Dix calls the estimated prevalence rate in B.C. ""encouraging.""

""Overall the level of infection in B.C. was low and that's due to the actions of people in B.C. That said, there are more people who were infected with COVID-19 than tested positive and that's something we've said clearly, especially in the period of March and April when we were focusing our testing program particularly on specific groups including health-care workers,"" Dix says.

The study is the first of its kind in Canada, he says.

The study is also important because it involved people who did not self-select for COVID-19 testing, so they likely didn't believe they had the virus, Dix says.

The study was authorized by provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry and approved by the clinical research ethics board of the university. It has not yet been peer reviewed.

British Columbia recorded 21 new cases Wednesday and no new deaths. There are 207 active cases while 2,753 people who tested positive have recovered, the government said in a news release.

The fiscal and economic report released a week ago detailed the Liberals' financial expectations, including a $343.2-billion deficit due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Parliamentary budget officer Yves Giroux says in a report that there are other numbers behind the biggest ones that MPs and senators should question.

He points to projections that enterprise Crown corporations, such as the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. and Business Development Bank of Canada, will collectively lose $12 billion this fiscal year.

Giroux notes that loss is a sharp turnaround from the $7.3 billion in gains for the 12-month period ending in March.

He says losses are unusual for these Crown corporations and adds that each should provide detailed projections to Parliament as soon as possible about its COVID-19 liquidity programs.

Similarly, Giroux says the Liberals should provide details of their own borrowing, which his office estimates will exceed by $150 billion the ceiling set by federal legislation.

The budget office estimates the government's planned debt issuance this fiscal year of $713 billion will cost $2.2 billion annually in interest.

The report released Thursday also notes $4.4 billion in spending for measures the government has yet to announce.

All the spending is expected to push the federal debt past the $1-trillion mark.

The Liberals had previously made a declining debt-to-GDP ratio key to their fiscal plans, but skyrocketing spending will push the ratio to 49 per cent from 31.1 per cent.

Giroux says fiscal transparency and accountability would be enhanced if the Liberals identify their new ""fiscal anchor,"" how they'll measure their own successful handling of the budget and national economy, which wasn't specifically laid out in the update last week.

""The ruin of the First Nations and peoples of Canada is not just statistics. As seen here, it is real pain,"" Justice Chris Martin said in a written decision delivered July 10.

article continues below

Anthony McKay was sentenced to four years after pleading guilty to manslaughter in the death of his mother, Shirley McKay. He faces two years behind bars, after receiving credit for time already served, and will be subject to three years of supervised probation after that.

""As a human, Mrs. McKay deserved better. And, like anyone born in this bountiful country, her son, her killer, deserved a better start, a better chance, in life,"" Martin wrote.

The judge said the killing on the Berens River First Nation, about 300 kilometres north of Winnipeg, was a ""calamity of almost 150 years of government policy, actions and inactions affecting the Indigenous community.""

Anthony McKay, who was 21 at the time, went to his mother's home after a night of drinking on June 22, 2018.

Court was told there was blood everywhere when a cousin came over about 8 a.m. The cousin found Shirley McKay unconscious and badly beaten. Her son has said he doesn't know why he viciously beat her.

The woman was taken to a nursing station before being transported to a hospital in Winnipeg. Her son visited her in hospital daily and was overheard at her bedside sobbing and apologizing.

Court heard he was confronted by a stepbrother and admitted that he had hurt his mother.

Shirley McKay died that September. Her son was arrested the following month.

""She did not recover and died months later, another victim in a mass of slain Aboriginal women,"" Martin said. ""He pled guilty to manslaughter, joining an appalling line of young Aboriginals ending up in prison.""

Crown prosecutors were asking for a seven-year sentence in a federal penitentiary. The defence asked for two years behind bars plus the probation so that McKay could have access to programming available in provincial custody.

The judge pointed to impacts of colonization, the pass system which restricted Indigenous Peoples' movement, residential schools and the '60s Scoop in his sentencing.

""It is well accepted that the government's role, since the early days of dealing with First Nations peoples, has had the effect of isolating, infantilizing, marginalizing, and traumatizing Indigenous societies like the Ojibwa (or Anishinaabe) of Berens River,"" Martin wrote.

""Mr. McKay is a person shaped by a system historically designed to 'take the Indian out of the Indian.'""

Reports provided to the judge on McKay's background said he has partial fetal alcohol syndrome.

One of 13 siblings, he spent most of his time in foster homes on the First Nation or more often in Winnipeg. His parents struggled with alcohol and sniffing substances, and McKay followed a similar path starting when he was 13. His father died in 2010.

McKay was neglected and not cared for, files from child and family services said. He asked to become a permanent ward of child welfare in 2013 because he didn't feel safe with his family.

Martin said McKay's troubled upbringing doesn't excuse his behaviour, but does help explain why he is who he is.

Occasionally it is incumbent on a judge to underscore systemic issues, he said, adding Indigenous people are disproportionately affected by serious crime and disproportionately incarcerated.

""Like so many other cases, this case is troubling, not only for its specific facts, but because it reminds that core issues affecting many in the Indigenous population are not really being addressed sufficiently or urgently enough,"" Martin wrote.

""Many in this and the next generation of Indigenous people are at risk.""

Mohammed Shahed, a member of the governing party who regularly appeared on TV talk shows, was arrested Wednesday by the Rapid Action Battalion near the Indian border after a nine-day manhunt.

Shahed is chairman of the Regent Group and owner of two Regent hospitals in the capital, Dhaka.

Abdul Baten, a commissioner of the Detective Branch in Dhaka, said Shahed admitted after his arrest that his hospitals did not have proper equipment to conduct coronavirus tests.

A court in Dhaka on Thursday allowed investigators to keep Shahed in custody for 10 days for questioning.

Officials said the hospitals had issued more than 10,000 coronavirus test results and about 60% were fake even though patients were charged for them. The hospitals allegedly arranged for the remaining tests to be conducted by another hospital.

The two hospitals had not renewed their medical licenses for years, but the Ministry of Health nevertheless signed a deal with Shahed to dedicate the hospitals to coronavirus testing and treatment as the number of cases rose in Bangladesh.

Bangladesh on Thursday was nearing 200,000 confirmed coronavirus cases, including 2,496 deaths. Public health experts say the actual number is much higher because only about 70 testing facilities are available in the country of 160 million people.

Shahed belongs to the governing Awami League party headed by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and is a member of its foreign affairs subcommittee. He has more than 50 illegal cases pending against him across the country on various charges including forgery and cheating.

Another doctor and her husband were also arrested recently on similar charges of falsifying test results.

Local media reports say the scams could hurt Bangladesh’s earnings from overseas workers. Last week, Italy suspended all flights from Bangladesh to Rome after some Bangladeshis reportedly presented fake negative test reports for the coronavirus.

Bangladesh earns about $19 billion a year from about 10 million overseas workers. Authorities said about 15,000 Bangladeshi workers with jobs in Italy remain stranded in Bangladesh and it is unclear whether they will be able to travel to the European country.

The Anti-Defamation league and some Jewish leaders had condemned what they called anti-Semitic theories expressed by Cannon and demanded the apology.

article continues below

""First and foremost I extend my deepest and most sincere apologies to my Jewish sisters and brothers for the hurtful and divisive words that came out of my mouth during my interview with Richard Griffin,"" Cannon said on his Twitter account.

""They reinforced the worst stereotypes of a proud and magnificent people and I feel ashamed of the uninformed and naïve place that these words came from. The video of this interview has since been removed.""

ViacomCBS cut ties with the TV host and producer Tuesday in response to his comments on a podcast where he discussed racial bias.

Rabbi Abraham Cooper, the Simon Wiesenthal Center’s associate dean, told The Associated Press that Cannon reached out to him Wednesday and during a 30-minute telephone conversation he apologized to the Jewish community and Cooper asked him to post it on social media.

""He started out the right way, he said the right things. Half an hour is a long time, and we'll probably meet tomorrow in the LA area,"" Cooper said.

""He understood that the words and references that he thought were based on fact, turned out to be hateful propaganda and stereotypical rhetoric.""

The TV host and producer wrote earlier a lengthy Facebook post defending himself and criticizing his firing for what the company deemed ""bigotry"" and ""anti-Semitism,"" prominent members of the U.S. Jewish community said the post fell well short and demanded an apology.

""It’s not enough to say, ‘I’m not a racist, I’m not a bigot,’"" Cooper had told the AP earlier. ""The statements he made are hurtful, and they’re false.""

Cooper said Cannon should read and heed the words of Martin Luther King Jr., who ""dedicated his life for civil rights for all and a colour-blind America."" Cooper also had advised him to seek out the guidance of basketball Hall of Famer-turned-writer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who has condemned several sports and entertainment celebrities for anti-Semitic posts.

In the hour-plus episode of ""Cannon's Class"" released last month that prompted his firing, Cannon and Richard ""Professor Griff"" Griffin, formerly of the rap group Public Enemy, contended that Black people are the true Hebrews and Jews have usurped that identity.

Cannon then argued that lighter-skinned people — ""Jewish people, white people, Europeans"" — ""are a little less"" and have a ""deficiency"" that historically caused them to act out of fear and commit acts of violence to survive.

""They had to be savages,"" he said.

""When I first heard about the comments Mr. Cannon made, it was very, very disappointing,"" said Oren Segal, director of the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism. ""We’re in a time where hatred of all kinds is very much apparent. It’s in the news every day.""

""Anti-Semitism in particular over the past several years has been something that we've seen in increase , as well as racism and other issues,"" Segal added. ""So when you hear an individual who has a public profile, who has influence over people, make statements that are highly offensive to the Jewish community, the first reaction is disappointment.""

Anti-Semitic violent attacks rose worldwide by 18% in 2019 compared with the previous year, according to a report published in April by Tel Aviv University’s Kantor Center for the Study of Contemporary Jewry.

Segal said some members of the Black Hebrew Israelite movement see themselves as the true ""chosen people,"" and believe that Blacks, Hispanics and Native Americans are the true descendants of the 12 Tribes of Israel. He noted that not all spew hateful rhetoric, although many adhere to an extreme set of anti-Semitic beliefs.

Bruce D. Haynes, a professor of sociology at the University of California, Davis, who has been studying Black Jews for more than two decades, agreed that the remarks echo the ideas of extreme Black Hebrew Israelites and of Minister Louis Farrakhan, the Nation of Islam leader who last year referenced ""Satanic Jews"" in a speech denying allegations of anti-Semitism. But Haynes took a more nuanced view.

""The danger is that those groups get confused with other self-identified Israelites like (Rabbi) Capers Funnye, who has a congregation in Chicago, and who is very much involved with the Ashkenazim Jewish community. So I want to make clear that the term 'Israelites' is a tricky term,"" he said.

""Is it anti-Semitic to say Black people are the real Israelites or the real Jews? I’m not sure I’d call it anti-Semitism,"" Haynes said. ""It’s not a good reading of history, but I wouldn’t call it anti-Semitism. On the other hand, some of those groups that call Jews impostors certainly cross the line.""

Until his firing, Cannon produced ""Wild ’n Out,"" a comedy improv series for VH1, the ViacomCBS-owned cable channel.

In an earlier Facebook post, he had said that he welcomes being held accountable and takes responsibility for his words, while also accusing the company of trying to silence an ""outspoken black man"" and demanding full ownership of the ""Wild ’n Out"" brand.

""I do not condone hate speech nor the spread of hateful rhetoric. ... The Black and Jewish communities have both faced enormous hatred, oppression persecution and prejudice for thousands of years and in many ways have and will continue to work together to overcome these obstacles,"" he wrote.

Cooper had said that Cannon should reject Farrakhan’s hate speech and ""reduce the long statement to two sentences"" — a simple apology, which he did after their conversation.

""I just had the blessed opportunity to converse with Rabbi Abraham Cooper director of global social action @SimonWiesenthal. My first words to my brother was, I apologize for the hurt I caused the Jewish Community"" Cannon tweeted.

""On my podcast I used words & referenced literature I assumed to be factual to uplift my community instead turned out to be hateful propaganda and stereotypical rhetoric that pained another community For this I am deeply sorry but now together we can write a new chapter of healing.""

""My hope is that this series can be a place to explore meaningful topics together and sort through so many of the questions we’re all trying to answer in our own lives,"" Obama said in a statement.

The new podcast is the first title in the ongoing collaboration between Spotify and Higher Ground, a production company founded by Barack and Michelle Obama. Last year, the former president and first lady partnered with Spotify to produce exclusive podcasts for the platform.

Michelle Obama’s new podcast expects to hold candid and personal conversations with a focus on topics concerning relationships and health. She expects to have several guests on the series including talk-show host Conan O’Brien and Valerie Jarrett, business woman and former senior advisor to Barack Obama.

""Perhaps most of all, I hope this podcast will help listeners open up new conversations — and hard conversations —- with the people who matter most to them,"" she said. ""That’s how we can build more understanding and empathy for one another.""

Obama released her Netflix documentary ""Becoming"" in May. The project was an extension of her 2018 bestselling memoir of the same name and a kind of authorized filmic portrait of Obama.

The Census Bureau reported Thursday that retail sales are 1.1% higher than their levels from a year ago, after a brutal plunge in March and April was offset by a decent rebound in May and June. But any gains might be short-lived as infections began to rise toward the end of June.

""While today’s report gives the illusion of a fearless consumer spending lavishly, the reality is more sobering: consumers are increasingly fearful amid new spikes in COVID-19 cases and a looming fiscal cliff,"" said Lydia Boussour, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics.

The report shows how shoppers and businesses are adjusting to life in a pandemic, changing their habits in hopes of halting an illness that can quickly flare-up and wreak financial havoc.

Bars in Texas shuttered again at the end of last month as infections surged in that state. Pennsylvania this week ordered that restaurants can only seat 25% of their potential customers. Gap, Kohl’s and other stores are withdrawing clothes worn in their changing rooms from sales floors for several days as a precautionary move. Adding to all this pressure are signs that the recovery in consumer spending began to stall at the end of last month, according to analysis of credit cards by the bank JPMorgan Chase.

""I suspect the modest pullback we have seen in our card spending data since late June is driven by concern about the resurgence of COVID-19,"" said Jesse Edgerton, an economist with the bank.

June's retail numbers showed the complicated nature of an uncertain recovery.

Non-store sales—which includes online shopping—slumped 2.4% over the past month but are 23.5% higher from a year ago. Spending at restaurants and bars jumped 20% last month, but it's still down 26.3% from last year. Sales at clothiers more than doubled between May and June, yet they've collapsed 23.2% from a year ago.

Shoppers have responded by shifting their spending, and not only to online retailers. Sales at building materials stores were up 17.3% annually. Stores in the sporting goods, musical instrument, books and hobbies categories have enjoyed yearly growth of 20.6%. Purchases at grocers have increased 11.7% over the past year.",[]

Asa Hutchinson issued an order Thursday requiring people to wear face masks in public throughout the state, which has had a surge in coronavirus cases over the past several weeks.

The Republican governor had resisted a statewide mask mandate and opposed issuing a stay-at-home order earlier in the pandemic, but he signed the order requiring masks when social distancing isn't possible in the hopes of slowing the disease's rapid spread in the state. The order takes effect Monday.

article continues below

Hutchinson’s decision comes amid growing support for mask requirements from business and health leaders and a day after Bentonville-based Walmart said it would require customers to wear masks in all of its U.S. stores. The state’s largest newspaper, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, also called for a statewide requirement on Thursday.

Hutchinson previously encouraged people to wear masks and allowed cities to pass ordinances requiring their use, but he stopped short of requiring them statewide. He’s the latest Republican governor to relent on the mask issue in the face of a surge in COVID-19 cases. Alabama's governor issued a similar mask mandate on Wednesday.

Arkansas' coronavirus cases have dramatically risen since May, when the state began allowing businesses that had closed because of the pandemic to reopen despite warnings from national health officials about the risks of doing so too soon. Arkansas was one of a handful of states that did not issue a broader stay-at-home order that kept most businesses closed.

Hutchinson previously questioned how a mask mandate could be enforced in a rural state such as Arkansas, but this week he left open the possibility of such a requirement. The chancellor of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences called for a statewide requirement last weekend.

Hutchinson's order was expected to face criticism from some conservatives in the state. Hours before he issued the order, a Republican legislator urged people to call Hutchinson to oppose any mask directive.

A poll by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business suggested tensions are flaring between workers and employers, with around 27 per cent of 3,389 employers polled indicating some of their laid-off staff have refused to return to work.

article continues below

Of the nearly 870 businesses that provided the reasons their employees gave for refusing to return to work, 62 per cent reported workers ""prefer the Canada Emergency Response Benefit."" Employers could choose more than one explanation for why a worker refused to return, and respondents also selected options such as concern for health (47 per cent), childcare obligations (27 per cent) or lack of hours in return offer (16 per cent).

CFIB president Dan Kelly said it's ""clear"" that CERB ""created a disincentive to return to work for some staff, especially in industries like hospitality."" Other sectors where conflicts are arising include child care, dental offices, home health care, amusement parks, gambling and spectator sports, the study suggested.

""CERB was created as emergency support for workers who had lost their job due to the pandemic, not to fund a summer break,"" Kelly said in a statement.

But Ian Robb, Canadian director of the Unite Here union that represents hospitality workers, disagrees. He said workers are impatient to return to work — for what is usually the lucrative summer season — but employers are the ones failing to adopt measures like frequent cleaning and wage subsidies. The union previously estimated that average wages in cities like Toronto are around $20 per hour for hospitality.

""A number of our members in the U.S. have gone to work and contracted (COVID-19),"" Robb said.

""There's just not enough safety in front of service. Nobody wants to stay home and make two grand when they can make double that by working.""

The survey suggested that the hospitality sector had the biggest share of employers, 45 per cent, who had trouble recalling workers. CFIB defines hospitality as including hotels, restaurants and bars.

The CFIB study suggests that in the hospitality sector, 56 per cent of hard-to-fill positions were ""unskilled, entry-level jobs"" that pay ""at or around minimum wage,"" although across sectors, skilled and semi-skilled jobs were harder to fill.

Employment and human rights lawyer Neena Gupta says she has heard of tradespeople unable to perform jobs because workers failed to return.

She said the reason an employee is refusing the work matters. Lack of childcare, like daycare and camps, can be a job-protected reason for staying home, as can disabilities such as being immunocompromised, says Gupta, a partner in Gowling WLG's Waterloo Region and Toronto offices.

The federal government's website states that workers seeking CERB, which offers $500 per week over a limited period, ""should be seeking work opportunities and/or return to work when their employer makes a request for their return, provided they are able and it is reasonable to do so."" The government's COVID-19 guidelines also provide for employees to refuse to do a dangerous job, although the worker must already ""be at work"" to refuse such a task.

However, notes Gupta, general apprehension about the pandemic is likely not enough to merit a job refusal. She said workplaces must comply with health and safety guidelines, and that a ministry inspection must find some sort of violation to justify a job refusal.

Managers should give workers a written ""come back to work"" recall and an indication that it will be treated as job abandonment if the worker doesn't return, says Gupta. After that process is completed, the employer could consider that worker terminated for cause, and hire a replacement.

While reporting misuse of CERB by a former employee might appear to give an employer some moral satisfaction, Gupta says it’s unlikely to help with staffing concerns or worker morale.

""I do ask people to be reasonable. You can’t call someone at noon on a Thursday and expect them in at 7 a.m. on Friday,"" she says.

The agreement will be presented Friday to the Superior Court of Quebec for approval to become the new so-called stalking horse bid for any rival offers that may be presented next month.

A lawyer representing Quebecor suggested last week that the media conglomerate intended to make a bid.

The shareholders — the Texan fund TPG Capital, the Chinese firm Fosun and the Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec — presented a US$420-million bid June 29 when Cirque filed for creditor protection. They were counting on a US$200-million loan from the Quebec government.

The shareholders and Cirque agreed to terminate the agreement, said a Cirque statement Thursday.

""The shareholder's proposed agreement, which had set the bar for other bids, assured a path to survival following the forced closure of all of the shows resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic by providing the company funding, support, and a clear road map to relaunch,"" said the statement.

The lenders, who hold about $1 billion of the Cirque's secured debt, would inject up to $375 million, create a fund to retain employees and pay ex-workers and artisans, and maintain the company's head office in Montreal, according to a source familiar with the matter, but who is not allowed to speak publicly.

""The co-operation of the group of creditors has been extraordinary in order to achieve our objective of recapitalizing the Cirque,"" Gabriel de Alba, the managing director and partner of Catalyst Capital Group, the main creditor, said in a statement.

Deprived of income since mid-March due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Cirque cancelled its 44 shows and cut nearly 3,500 people.

The Richmond standout has signed with Ryerson University in Toronto for the next four years following an extensive recruiting process.

What began with enquiries from 61 schools on both sides of the border back in 2018, Gillis’ emphasis on her studies created a shortlist of six potential destinations with four wanting to sign her last September. Impressed with Ryerson’s renowned design tech program, she made a verbal commitment to head coach Wayne Nishihama a month later and officially signed with the program on Monday.

The Rams play in the Ontario Intercollegiate Women’s Fastpitch Association with a fall schedule that typically concludes in early October.

What made Gillis an attractive recruit is being as a multi-positional player, capable of playing both infield and outfield — skills she learned while being coached by her dad in her grassroots years with the Richmond Girls Softball Association.

She stayed with the RSGA program through to U12 when her team won the provincial title. She then took her talents to the US for the next four years — playing on two teams and serving as a pick-up at showcase tournaments which are designed to draw the attention of college and university scouts. Along the way, Gillis won a pair of Washington State championships.

At the age of 15 she drew the attention of Tyron McKinney a batting coach with the US women's national team, along with Heather Tarr, head coach and assistant Lance Glasoe at the University of Washington, when she finished second in a senior batting competition. All three would become involved in her further development as a player.

Gillis eventually returned home to focus more on her education and played with the White Rock Renegades. She was joined by two other local players — Emma Perry and Caitlin Bradley-Tse — and won bronze at the 2019 Canadian Championships.

The Grade 12 McMath student is returning to the RGSA for her senior year to play for one of her favourite coaches — Eric Gee — bringing her minor softball career full circle.

Other coaches Gillis credits for her development include Charlotte Dolan (White Rock), Phil Smith (Washington State), along with Tyron, Tarr, coach Lance and her father Dave.

Making friends all over the United States, Canada and Japan has been an amazing experience with far too many girls to mention.

It’s almost hard to imagine the Vancouver tournament was such a short time ago given where the world is today.

“It’s crazy. Obviously we knew about COVID-19 and we talked about it but cancelling the tournament wasn’t even in question at that time. I didn’t even think about it,”recalled Hirayama. “Then a couple of days later (NBA player) Rudy Gobert tested positive and that’s when things kind of blew up.

“We were supposed to have been back on the field that Friday and it elevated even further. Training got cancelled. At that time we thought if (the Vancouver) tournament was held a weekend later it might not have even happened which would have been a shame.”

The Richmond native would soon learn the Canadian Olympic Committee would not be sending a team to Tokyo this summer. Fortunately, the Games were postponed 48 hours later.

“It seems silly for us to be worrying about playing a sport right now,” Hirayama continued. “Obviously a lot of us have sacrificed a lot of time and stuff for the Olympics and it was very, very important. It is my life and it is a lot of our lives but certainly there are a lot more important things going on right now in the world that should take precedent.”

Getting the opportunity to represent his country at an Olympic Games has provided Hirayama with motivation for much of his time with the national team program.

He recalls a decade ago when the process began of rugby sevens becoming an Olympic sport. Canada then missed out on a berth when it debuted at the 2016 Games in Rio.

“Some people wanted to go overseas and play professionally but it has kind of been my goal. Just how cool it would be to play rugby at the Olympics,” said the McRoberts graduate.

“There was a big group of us that stuck together for four or five years to hopefully achieve that goal. To not do it and just come (one game) short of going to Rio was heartbreaking. That being said who knows what would have happened the last four years had we gone there. Maybe some guys would have stopped playing after that Olympics.

“There’s a silver lining there. We have had some amazing accomplishments (like winning the Singapore tournament in 2017). Some of my most memorable things personally that I will always look back have happened over the last few years.”

The Olympics being pushed back doesn’t change Hirayama’s career outlook.

At 32, his game has never been better — earning all-tournament team honours in Vancouver. He attends regular work outs at the Rugby Canada training centre in nearby Langford with the same passion as his teenage days with the Richmond Rugby Club.

Once normality returns, he is looking at what could be an extended World Series schedule with the four postponed tournaments played in the fall before jumping into the 2020-21 season next December in Dubai and Capetown.

“I was just going to re-evaluate everything (if the Olympics did take place). This kind of makes my decision for me,” added Hirayama. “Just push it back and hopefully everything works out, not just for the Olympics, but for the world, first and foremost.”",[]

For the 2020-21 season, the cap was estimated to be $84 million to $88.2 million, depending on a few factors.

That has changed.

article continues below

The suspension caused by COVID-19 and the uncertain future of the 2019-20 season leaves next season’s salary cap in serious jeopardy.

That’s because the cap is tied to league revenues. There’s meant to be a 50/50 split in revenues between the owners and the players. If there’s a drop in revenue for the owners — from a loss of gate revenue for unplayed or unattended games, unplayed playoff games, or a crashing Canadian dollar — then the NHL’s Collective Bargaining Agreement leads to less money for the players the following season in the form of a reduced salary cap.

A significant increase in the salary cap would have been a major relief for a team close to the cap like the Vancouver Canucks. The Canucks were set to have a tough time navigating the cap next season, thanks to the combination of a few highly-paid veterans, performance bonuses for young stars rolling over from this current season, Roberto Luongo’s cap recapture penalty, and several restricted and unrestricted free agents they need to re-sign.

If the salary cap went up, it’s possible the Canucks wouldn’t have to choose between UFAs Jacob Markstrom, Tyler Toffoli and Chris Tanev, but could re-sign all three. A flat cap — one that stayed at $81.5 million — would force the Canucks to choose two and possibly lose another player like Troy Stecher or Josh Leivo.

If the cap goes down? Then the Canucks are in some serious trouble, with difficult decisions to make that will undoubtedly make the team worse for next season. And they’re not the only ones: plenty of other teams would feel the cap crunch from this unprecedented situation.

Potential solutions could include an artificially inflated cap, but one option that has come up in NHL circles is compliance buyouts, with Brian Burke discussing it recently on Oilers Now, a radio program with Global News.

“I’ve heard discussion of compliance buyouts to help teams get to this new cap, to solve some of their problems,” said Burke. “In the last CBA, each team got two cap-compliance buyouts which were exempt from the cap.”

A compliance buyout would differ from a regular buyout in that it wouldn’t cost money against the salary cap. For instance, the Canucks will still have a little over $1 million against next season’s cap from buying out Ryan Spooner, but the Canucks bought out Keith Ballard and David Booth in 2013 and 2014 at no cost to their cap as compliance buyouts after the 2012-13 lockout.

If teams do get a compliance buyout, it seems obvious who the Canucks would use it on. Loui Eriksson has a $6 million cap hit for two more seasons following this one and has found himself in an increasingly-diminished role, playing primarily as a shutdown, defensive forward, with little-to-no contributions offensively.

The Canucks do have other options, however. Brandon Sutter has lost several steps and has a $4.375 million cap hit next season. They could be proactive and buy out Tyler Myers’ $6 million contract for the next four seasons before his play starts to decline. Cutting their losses on Micheal Ferland’s $3.5 million cap hit for the next three seasons might be smart. They might even be tempted to buy out Sben Baertschi’s $3.37 million contract with him buried in the AHL.

Do any of those supersede Eriksson? Probably not. Where it gets interesting is if teams get two buyouts, as they did in 2013 and 2014. Buying out Eriksson would be a given, then, but who would be the second buyout? Sutter has just one year left on his contract, Ferland’s cap hit isn’t overly onerous, and Tyler Myers is still a good, useful player.

One compliance buyout would make it far easier for the Canucks to re-sign Markstrom and Tanev. Two might mean re-signing Toffoli as well.

Stick-taps and Glove-drops

A tap of the stick to Eddie Lackas he announced his retirement from professional hockey on Monday. The former Canuck said the “best time in my career” was in Vancouver and thanked the fans sincerely.

A big stick-tap to Bauer. The hockey equipment manufacturer has modified its production line to produce protective visors for healthcare workers, with Quebec already ordering 300,000 visors for their doctors, nurses, and first responders.

Big Numbers

89 In four seasons with the Canucks, Loui Eriksson has a total of 38 goals and 89 points. He had 30 goals and 63 points in just one season with the Boston Bruins prior to signing with the Canucks.

4 So far, four NHL players have tested positive for COVID-19: two from the Ottawa Senators and two from the Colorado Avalanche. The Senators’ radio colour commentator, Gord Wilson, has also tested positive, as has St. Louis Blues’ play-by-play announcer John Kelly.

A cracked bone? Good to go. What about a sore shoulder? No problem.

It's well-known NHLers battle through aches, pains and even illness. Almost like clockwork, a flu bug tears through more than a few locker rooms every season. Players often attempt to soldier on without missing any time, especially when the games matter most.

In the era of COVID-19, however, some of that old the definition of ""toughness"" is being thrown out the window.

Players and coaches are keenly aware that if they're feeling even the slightest bit off — and there are a laundry list of symptoms associated with the novel coronavirus, from chills to headaches to fatigue and weakness — it needs to be reported immediately.

""Doesn't matter if you're a tough hockey player or not,"" said Tippett, now the head coach of the Edmonton Oilers. ""I had a lot of games where I hid a broken finger or something like that from doctors. I didn't want them to know because they wouldn't let me play.

""But when you get sick, you're going to have to tell people. That's just the way of the new world.""

The NHL opened training camps this week as part of its plan to kickstart a campaign that was suspended in mid-March by the pandemic. Players and staff are getting tested every 48 hours — they're not currently quarantined — and that will be kick up another notch to once a day when the 24 teams involved in the resumption head to the hub cities of Edmonton and Toronto, where they'll be kept in a bubble separate from the general public.

Vancouver Canucks captain Bo Horvat said the mentality of the past has been turned on its head when it comes to illness.

""As hockey players you want to be in every single game, you want to play, and you want to help your teammate, and you want to be a difference-maker,"" he said. ""Before you played through colds, you played through injuries, you played through sickness and stuff like that.

""You have to step back and think a little bit now. It's a different animal, this virus. You have to be not only cautious of yourself and how you're feeling, but the people around you, too. It's not just your teammates, it's the medical staff, it's the trainers, it's everybody you're around every single day, and even obviously opposing teams. You've got to think of everybody. You've got to be very cautious.""

Edmonton Oilers centre and NHL leading scorer Leon Draisaitl said that caution is going to become the new norm.

""Every hockey player has played through certain things and we've all played through a flu or sickness or whatever it is,"" he said. ""But now with this going around, it makes it a little more dangerous.

""You have to be careful.""

Winnipeg Jets centre Andrew Copp said hockey's team-first mentality should kick in if someone isn't feeling right.

""You hope that everyone's pretty dialled in, and not only for everyone's health and safety, but for the team too,"" he said. ""If this guy gets it, he's not playing. Hopefully everyone can realize that we're all making a lot of sacrifices here.""

The NHL hasn't said how many positive tests would constitute the ""uncontrolled outbreak"" listed in its return-to-play protocol that could conceivably shut the league's resumption down. There's a difference between cases being spread out and a cluster of infections on a team or teams.

The league said earlier this week 30 players tested positive for COVID-19 during voluntary workouts at team facilities between June 8 and July 12. Another 13 positive results came outside of the league's protocol, while 10 other players tested positive in the spring. Training camps opened Monday, but individuals and teams won't be named moving forward with regards to positive tests.

It's no secret players have hid countless injuries in the past, and the league has been criticized heavily for how it dealt with the concussion issue, but Mathieu Schneider, special assistant to NHLPA executive director Don Fehr, said the virus is different territory.

""If concussions were contagious, I think players would feel differently about it,"" Schneider said. ""Guys certainly understand the notion that if they are not honest with symptoms or how they might feel, that they put their entire team in jeopardy.

""There's going to be a huge onus on the players here in (training camp) to make sure that they're taking care of themselves and looking out for their teammates — going to the rink, going home, going to the grocery store, social distancing, wearing mask, washing your hands. All the things that all of us are practising every single day now.""

Toronto Maple Leafs defenceman Morgan Rielly said it simply comes down to common sense is in this new reality.

""It's on the players and our staff to be honest with each other,"" he said. ""You don't want to put anyone else at risk.

""You want to do what's best for them.""

Matthews finished third in the NHL with a career-high 47 goals, one behind Maurice (Rocket) Richard Trophy co-winners Alex Ovechkin and David Pastrnak, while also topping the Maple Leafs with a career-best 80 points in 70 games.

The 22-year-old Scottsdale, Ariz., native also established a career-low with eight penalty minutes, tied for the fewest among the NHL's top 100 scorers. He did so while sharing second place in the League in takeaways (78) and ranking eighth among NHL forwards in total time on ice (1,467 minutes 52 seconds).

MacKinnon ranked fifth in the NHL with 93 points (35 goals, 58 assists) in 69 games to lead the Avalanche into the playoffs for the third consecutive season. The 24-year-old from Cole Harbour, N.S., registered a career-low 12 penalty minutes, the second-fewest among the league's top 25 scorers.

Ryan entered the NHL/NHLPA Players' Assistance program on Nov. 20 to get help for alcohol addiction. After going public with his story in an effort to help others with addiction issues, an emotional Ryan returned to the ice Feb. 27 and scored three times in a 5-2 win over visiting Vancouver.

Lindblom was diagnosed in December with Ewing's sarcoma, a cancerous tumour that grows in the bones or in the tissue around bones. He completed radiation treatments on July 2.

The 18-year veteran quarterback headlines the Canadian Football Hall of Fame's 2020 class that was unveiled Thursday. Burris, 45, got the nod in his first year of eligibility, becoming just the 21st player ever to do so but second in as many years after Calgary running back Jon Cornish in 2019.

article continues below

Joining Burris in the player category are offensive linemen Clyde Brock and Freddie Childress and quarterback Greg Vavra. John Hufnagel, the Calgary Stampeders president/GM, and Larry Uteck (posthumously), the former head coach/athletic director at Saint Mary’s University, were both named as builders.

Burris's family — wife Nicole and sons Armand and Barron — had known of his induction since February but managed to keep quiet about it until about two and a half weeks ago when the Hall of Fame informed Burris. Even then, the Burris clan was very nonchalant in asking the former quarterback to take in what he thought was a run-of-the-mill video.

Instead, Burris watched Hall of Famer Damon Allen (2012) outline his pro football journey to Canada, which drew a rather bewildered look from Burris. Then Allen detailed Burris's stellar CFL career before Mark DeNobile, the Hall of Fame's executive director, delivered the big news.

And the player, affectionately dubbed Smilin' Hank because of his outgoing personality, was lost for words as tears streamed down his face.

""Yeah, they got me good,"" Burris said with a chuckle. ""What's funny is whenever I've told the boys to keep anything quiet, they've always gone back to their mother and yet they didn't say a peep about this.

""I was lost for words just because to hear it shows you that people appreciated the things you did throughout your career. This is the way for the league and all the organizations and the fans saying, 'Thank you,' and for me I'm humbled by it . . . there's so many guys in there (Hall of Fame) who I looked up to and now to be able to join them is a dream come true.""

The six-foot-one, 190-pound Burris, a native of Spiro, Okla., played 20 pro seasons, 18 in the CFL with the Calgary Stampeders (1997-99, 2005-11), Saskatchewan Roughriders (2000, 2003-04), Hamilton Tiger-Cats (2012-13) and Ottawa Redblacks (2014-16). Burris also spent time with the NFL's Green Bay Packers (2001) and Chicago Bears (2002).

Burris appeared in five Grey Cups, winning three (1998, '08, '16) and being named the MVP twice (2008, '16). The CFL's outstanding player on two occasions (2010, 2015), Burris amassed 63,639 passing yards and 373 TD passes — both third all-time.

Burris retired shortly after leading Ottawa to a thrilling 39-33 overtime Grey Cup upset win over Calgary. He threw for 461 yards and three TDs despite suffering a knee injury during warmups.

Burris said his Hall of Fame induction is as much a testament to his family's resilience and perseverance as it is his on-field accomplishments.

""I had to take my wife all over Canada, drag my kids all over Canada and force them to make new friends just for dad to be able to play this game called football,"" said Burris, whose family still calls Ottawa home. ""And for them to understand and see just the emotions that ran through me . . . it just shows how big that moment is, just kind of when your whole life flashes before you.""

Burris and the other inductees will have to wait for their day in the sun due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2020 class will be honoured alongside the 2021 inductees next August.

When Burris is formally honoured, he'll be joined by former teammate Childress and Hufnagel, who served as Calgary's head coach (2008-2015) before moving into the front office full-time. Burris won Grey Cups with both ('98 with Childress, '08 with Hufnagel).

""Calgary is a machine right now and it all started in 2008 when Huf came in and we got that Grey Cup in his first year,"" Burris said. ""Calgary has always had double-digit wins and been in the playoffs each and every year Huf has been there, they've always been a strong contender for the Grey Cup and there's one reason why.""

Hufnagel, a 68-year-old native of Coraopolis, Pa., spent 12 seasons as a CFL quarterback with Calgary (1976-79), Saskatchewan (1980-83, 1987) and Winnipeg (1984-86) before getting into coaching. A five-time Grey Cup champion, Hufnagel also earned a Super Bowl ring as an assistant with the New England Patriots (2003).

Hufnagel amassed a 102-42-1 record as Calgary's head coach, his .712 win percentage being the highest among coaches with more than 100 games. He's been named the CFL's coach of the year twice (2008, 2014).

Childress, a 53-year-old native of Little Rock, Ark., played 13 CFL seasons with Shreveport (1994), Birmingham (1995), Calgary (1996-03) and Saskatchewan (2004-06). A former second-round pick of the NFL's New England Patriots, Childress won two Grey Cups with the Stampeders (1998, 2001) and in 1998 was named the CFL's top offensive lineman.

Brock, 79, of Los Angeles, played 12 seasons with Saskatchewan (1964-75), helping the club win its first Grey Cup in 1966. The former Dallas Cowboy-San Francisco 49er appeared in 169 regular-season CFL games and four times was named a league all-star before being inducted into Saskatchewan's Plaza of Honour in 1995.

Vavra, 59, of Red Deer, Alta., helped the Calgary Dinos win the Vanier Cup in 1983, his final season at the school. That year, he also became the first player in the program's history to capture the Hec Crighton Trophy as Canadian university football's top player and still holds the U Sports record for most passing yards in a game (627).

Vavra was drafted by the Calgary Stampeders in 1984 and also spent time with the B.C. Lions (1986-87) and Edmonton Eskimos (1988).

After playing seven CFL seasons as a defensive back with Toronto (1974-76), B.C. (1977), Montreal (1978-80) and Ottawa (1980), Uteck became an assistant coach at Saint Mary’s University in 1982. He was promoted to head coach the following year, a position he held until 1997.

Over that span, Uteck was named the Atlantic University Athletic Association coach of the year five times and twice Canadian university football's top coach.

Uteck served as athletic director from 1995 to 2002 and the Huskies captured two Vanier Cups (2001-02). The native of Thornhill, Ont., passed away Dec. 25, 2002 of Lou Gehrig's disease at the age of 50.

The Atlantic Bowl was renamed the Uteck Bowl in 2003.

The metaphor suggested by the title of Christian Sands’ new album is apt.

article continues below

The jazz pianist says he was trying to be freer and more flexible on ""Be Water,"" and it shows. The set's 10 cuts explore a wide range of moods and instrumental combinations, with Sands' trio at the core.

Much of the material is built on the same pattern of tension and release found in a body of water. That begins with the opening ""Intro,"" which settles on the tonic chord after nearly four minutes of shimmering undulation.

The reflective ""Still,"" featuring Marvin Sewell on acoustic guitar, rides a mere ripple of rhythm. On ""Be Water II,"" a string quartet plays against the lapping beat established by Sands' piano. Marcus Strickland's woodwind work makes ""Drive"" swing as it crests with a cascading electric guitar solo by Sewell.

Sands rarely cuts loose at the piano — his objective isn't to be splashy — but he takes an active role as the producer, overdubbing extra keyboards and including sound effects and brief recitations by martial artist Bruce Lee. ""Water can flow, or it can crash,"" Lee says. Forgive the flood of puns, but ""Be Water"" flows freely.",[]

Everything about this album is intimidating, including the growling, nether-worldly voice of singer Udo Dirkschneider, and the fact that his backing band is the official concert band of the German military. This album is not for the faint of heart.

The former Accept frontman's solo band U.D.O. teams with the Musikkorps der Bundeswehr to put some real metal in heavy metal on ""We Are One.""

The pairing has undeniable power and force on 15 tracks that deal with environmental threats to the planet (""Future Is the Reason Why"", ""Mother Earth""), the refugee crisis (""Children of the World""), and a reunited Germany (""Rebel Town""), among other topics. The band lends a sweeping grandeur to most of the tracks with horns and strings punching up already-rowdy guitar riffs.

And for those who still miss the diminutive singer's 1980s heyday with Accept, U.D.O. throws them a bone in ""We Strike Back,"" a close cousin of the classic Accept concert opener ""Fast as a Shark,"" with very similar speed, style and structure, right down to the harmonic twin guitar solos.

The newspaper explained the decision in a note by Bill Sternberg, editorial page editor, attached to the column online. Navarro's column originally moved online late Tuesday and was published in Wednesday's newspaper.

article continues below

Navarro wrote that Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, ""has been wrong about everything I interacted with him on.""

The newspaper on Wednesday evening also ran a fact-check story by Washington reporter Ledyard King examining five of Navarro's claims.

It wasn't clear how Navarro's column escaped such scrutiny before being published. Sternberg said in an email that he's letting his editorial note speak for itself. The incident is reminiscent of The New York Times saying last month that an opinion column by U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton hadn't been properly vetted, which led to the resignation of the paper's opinion editor.

Navarro did not immediately return a message for comment.

USA Today said it had sought Navarro's opinion to accompany an editorial that the newspaper ran calling Fauci ""a national treasure.""

That editorial said the fact that Navarro was writing the opposing viewpoint ""shows how hard it is to find an actual medical professional willing to undercut Fauci.""

It wasn't clear whether the newspaper sought those opinions.

Fauci has essentially been shelved by the White House as a prominent spokesperson on the coronavirus pandemic because he's publicly been more pessimistic than the president. He does webcasts but rarely gives television interviews anymore.

Trump distanced himself from Navarro's column, saying Wednesday that the column was Navarro's views and ""he shouldn't be doing that.""

Navarro claimed in the column that Fauci opposed travel restrictions from China that were imposed by Trump that ""might well have saved hundreds of thousands of American lives."" USA Today said there isn't enough data to conclude the restrictions made a significant difference, and that despite some initial skepticism, Fauci backed the president.

The fact-checker also gave more context to Navarro claims about masks, the drug hydroxychloroquine and Fauci's early statements of concern about the virus.",[]

He’s returned to the charts in 2020, working on songs for rising and established rap stars, including Lil Wayne, Juice WRLD, Saweetie and Doja Cat.

The songmaster, who has been entangled in a bitter lawsuit with former collaborator Kesha since 2014, has produced and co-written Saweetie’s new single ""Tap In,"" the follow-up to her double-platinum smash ""My Type."" Dr. Luke also co-wrote and co-produced Juice WRLD’s ""Wishing Well,"" taken from the rapper’s first posthumous album ""Legends Never Die,"" released last week.

article continues below

The recent successes mean all three major U.S. record label companies have worked with Dr. Luke this year, even if he hasn't always put his widely recognizable professional name to the new collaborations.

Dr. Luke marked a major comeback this year with the success of the Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 hit ""Say So"" by rapper-singer Doja Cat, who is signed to Dr. Luke's Kemosabe Records. Dr. Luke, born Lukasz Sebastian Gottwald, produced several songs on Cat’s sophomore album ""Hot Pink,"" including single ""Like That,"" which is No. 5 on Billboard’s Hot R&B songs chart. He is the only producer with two songs in the Top 10 on the latter chart (""Say So"" sits at No. 2).

For his work with Cat, he used the alias Tyson Traxe. He used the same pseudonym for his production credit on Toronto rapper-singer Benny Mayne’s ""Hokey Pokey,"" released this year. For Lil Wayne’s ""Shimmy,"" a track featuring Cat on the deluxe edition of his latest album ""Funeral,"" Dr. Luke used the name Loctor Duke.

Label representatives for Saweetie, Juice WRLD, Lil Wayne and Cat didn’t immediately reply to emails seeking comment. Neither did a representative for Dr. Luke.

Luke has sprinkled his comeback among the major labels. Cat is signed to Sony Music’s RCA Records, while Saweetie is part of the Warner Music family. Lil Wayne releases music through his Young Money imprint and Republic Records, a division of Universal Music Group.

Before Dr. Luke topped the charts this year with ""Say So,"" he last had a No. 1 with Katy Perry's ""Dark Horse"" in 2014. Months later, Kesha accused him of sexual assault during their yearslong partnership (Dr. Luke has vigorously denied the allegations.)

A New York court dismissed Kesha’s sexual abuse-related claims in 2016 because of legal issues, without ruling on whether the allegations were true. Kesha lost another round in February, when a New York judge said she made a defamatory statement about Dr. Luke on a different occasion: a 2016 text message telling Gaga the producer had also raped Perry. Both he and Perry have denied it, and the judge said there was ""no evidence whatsoever"" to support the claim.

Kesha’s lawyers have said they plan to appeal the ruling, but it didn’t resolve other aspects of his defamation and breach-of-contract suit, including the crucial question of whether Kesha’s allegation that he raped her is true. The judge said that’s for a jury to decide at trial.

Outside of rap in 2020, Dr. Luke has produced music for pop singer Kim Petras, using the pseudonym MADE IN CHINA.",[]

“As much as this has been a year of hardship and challenges, when we look back, I'm convinced we will find it has also been a year full of hidden and emerging opportunities.”

Awards will still be handed out in 10 categories: new business, young entrepreneur, outstanding workplace, business leadership, green business, innovative enterprise, association (non-profit), and small, mid-size, and large businesses of the year.

The changes returning nominees will see include questions centred on ways they have adapted for COVID-19, and a shorter nomination package, in recognition of the many pressures on everyone’s time.

In compliance with restrictions on gatherings, the awards gala itself will be adapting in 2020, pivoting to a virtual format.

“For an organization that’s used to throwing 400 person galas, this is going to be a big change,” said Chun.

“We’re doing a lot of work behind the scenes right now to make sure that the 2020 awards are the exceptional experience Richmond expects from us.”

Nominations will remain open until Sept. 8. Details of each category and the nomination form are available at RichmondChamber.ca.

This is the message from Richmond News publisher Alvin Chow.

The world has changed with COVID-19 and businesses have to rethink how they operate. Those who have pivoted to repurpose themselves, at least temporarily, have had a better chance of surviving. However, other business models don’t allow for the same flexibility, so staying afloat has been a challenge.

“COVID-19 has shone a light on holes in business models,” said Rob Akimow, Richmond News director of sales and marketing. “Some, for example those set up for e-commerce, fared better; others were left out in the cold.”

To support businesses in Phase 2 of the pandemic, with partial re-opening of services allowed by provincial health officers, some Richmond groups have launched websites to help spread the word on what businesses are open and what restrictions they are operating under.

Tourism Richmond, the Richmond Chamber of Commerce and the City of Richmond have partnered to build a business hub ­— WeAreRichmondBC.ca. Meanwhile, Richmond City Coun. Chak Au has launched SupportLocalBusiness.ca also to spread the word on the new normal in business.

Akimow notes that the News ­— with both its print and digital distribution channels — can also play a key role in the restart or boosting of businesses.

During the past 12 weeks, with health orders in place to stay close to home, buying patterns have changed, Akimow said. Businesses have to capitalize on those changes while also ensuring customers are aware they may be physically reopening as well, albeit with changes to ensure health and safety.

“All businesses need cash flow. Our objective at the Richmond News is to bring people in through their doors — virtually or in person,” Akimow said.

Akimow acknowledges businesses are hurting, but there are a lot of free and low-budget ways the News can help bring customers back, he stressed.

A directory called GuidedBy.ca is a free service where businesses can post information about their operation, location and business hours. The News also does free digital audits of businesses, meaning they analyze a company’s web traffic, SEO effectiveness and digital footprint to create a “report card of their online presence,” Akimow explained.

A fun initiative the News launched with local business Herbaland was a mental wellness contest, whereby readers post photos of how they take care of their mental health and are entered to win $250 in Herbaland products.

“These are all examples of unique and different ways businesses can look at marketing themselves differently. Print ads and basic digital services are just one piece to the marketing mix,” said Akimow. “We should be looking at any and all options, contesting, virtual events, even flyers; there is really nothing we cannot do.”

With its deep roots in the community as a source of news and advertising, the News reaches a wide local audience weekly in the paper and 24/7 online at richmond-news.com.

As businesses restart and rethink how they can serve their customers in this “new normal,” the News is open for business with “all hands on deck,” Akimow said, adding businesses shouldn’t be worried about asking for help, even if their advertising budgets have shrunk because of the pandemic.

“We have no illusions about how hard it will be for businesses to restart, but we are here to help,” he added.",[]

Each mask is decorated with the Christmas Fund logo and RCRG’s mascot bear, and will be sold for $20 online and at selected locations in Richmond.

Ed Gavsie, president and CEO of RCRG, said they are hoping to sell at least 500 masks, which will help provide $10,000 towards purchasing food carts to distribute to families during Christmas.

“We have lost a lot of our regular fundraising events for the Christmas Fund because of the pandemic,” said Gavsie, which is why they are kicking off their fundraising earlier.

“Decreasing fundraising and increased demand is what we are forecasting … and we can only anticipate a major increase because of people’s financial situation during COVID-19.”

Windows of Hope, Not So Silent Night and the Richmond RCMP’s toy drive are only some of the major events that have been impacted by the pandemic.

Gavsie told the Richmond News that RCRG is in the process of re-imagining these events in a way that will follow the guidelines and safety protocols put forth by the BC Health Ministry.

For example, Not So Silent Night, dubbed Not So Isolated Night for 2020, will most likely become a virtual event while plans for the RCMP toy drive and Windows of Hope are still being discussed.

The Beer, Wine and Sours fundraiser, which raised $13,000 in 2019, will be cancelled this year.

“We’re hoping that we can proceed again with most of our fundraisers especially the Windows of Hope since it’s a tremendous fundraiser that we need badly,” said Gavsie, adding that they are hoping the “public or organizations who can help will step up.”

However, like many volunteer-run organizations of its kind, they are constantly searching for new blood to infuse onto their board of directors.

And they’re hoping to see new faces appearing on screen at their forthcoming virtual AGM.

“People are leaving, which is normal, there’s always some coming and coming. We ask people to be on for two years, some stay a lot longer,” explained RFSS' vice-president Norm Goldstein.

“There are fresh challenges with the pandemic; it has been difficult to get our grants, so it’s always good to get fresh ideas and fresh perspectives.

“It’s always a challenge to get volunteers and to get volunteers with knowledge.

“But we’re a great bunch of people to work with and if food security and community is dear to your heart, then you should definitely take a look and maybe take part in our virtual AGM.”

This year, RFSS embarked on a new strategic plan on how to best serve Richmond, with a goal to provide education, services and policy that strengthen Richmond’s access to healthy and local food over a sustainable period of time.

As an example, RFSS’ passionate staff and volunteers have been able to work with community partners to provide 500 meals every week to vulnerable Richmond families during this crisis.

“We don’t know when the next crisis will impact our ability to put food on our tables. That is why we are looking for new directors who can help steer the direction of RFSS going forward,” added Goldstein.

The notion of establishing a framework to commercialize cannabis began as a promise by the Liberal Party in the 2015 federal election campaign that led to Justin Trudeau becoming prime minister. The implementation of the policy was not as smooth as first envisioned, and the provincial governments were put in charge of setting guidelines for the sale and consumption of marijuana.

article continues below

Research Co. and Glacier Media have been tracking perceptions about legalization every six months in British Columbia. Our latest survey shows that agreement with the new rules remains high across the entire province, that some residents are starting to ponder a future when other drugs could be treated in the same fashion as cannabis, and that – in stark contrast with what we found last year – marijuana users in British Columbia are starting to acquire all of their product through licensed retailers.

As more time passes, British Columbians appear happier with the decision to end prohibition. Seven in 10 of the province’s residents (70%) agree with marijuana being legal in Canada, while 26% disagree and 3% are undecided.

These findings represent a seven-point increase since a similar survey conducted in October 2019, as legal cannabis approached its first anniversary. The groups that are more likely to voice satisfaction with the new status quo are men (75%), British Columbians aged 35 to 54 (76%) and residents of northern B.C. (80%).

In recent weeks, we have seen more talk about creating a safe supply for drugs that are currently available only through illegal means. The impact of these discussions has led to a shift in the views of British Columbians about legalizing all drugs. It must be completely acknowledged that sizable majorities of the province’s residents continue to oppose a move to place any controlled substance inside a store, but the proponents of this option have grown since late last year.

At least two-thirds of British Columbians are opposed to legalizing ecstasy (66%), powder cocaine (70%), heroin (72%), crack cocaine (73%), methamphetamine or “crystal meth” (74%) and fentanyl (75%).

Support for making some of these drugs available in a fashion that would conceivably meet the same guidelines that govern cannabis has risen over the past six months, to 25% for cocaine (up from 18%) and to 24% for heroin (up from 19%). While these are still low proportions, the fluctuation could signal the start of a trend.

Just 10% of British Columbians say they only consumed marijuana after it became legal. Identical proportions of residents tried it before October 2018 (45%) or have never consumed it in Canada (also 45%). The incidence of “legal-only” marijuana users is highest among residents aged 18 to 34 (18%) and those who live in southern B.C. (19%).

But perhaps the biggest surprise, and a source of satisfaction for policy makers, is the way in which cannabis is being sought by users. Just over half of British Columbians who have consumed marijuana since legalization (51%) say that all of their product was acquired at a licensed retailer. In October 2019, only 31% of cannabis consumers in the province were getting all of their product at a licensed retailer.

We still see 16% of British Columbians who say none of their marijuana has been bought at a licensed retailer – a proportion that climbs to 25% among those aged 55 and over. Two-thirds of cannabis consumers aged 35 to 54 (68%) are buying all of their product at a licensed retailer.

Even though the delivery of cannabis products has improved over the past six months, there are significant regional differences that are indubitably related to the presence of stores in specific areas of the province. Cannabis consumers who reside in southern B.C. and Metro Vancouver are the most likely to be getting all of their product from licensed retailers (63% and 62%). The numbers are significantly lower in Vancouver Island (29%), northern B.C. (24%) and the Fraser Valley (19%).

Finally, the issue of “drug testing” remains a priority for British Columbians, with 61% saying that companies in the province should “definitely” or “probably” be able to administer these examinations to any employee now that marijuana is legal.

After a bumpy start that featured slow store openings and hitches with delivery options, there are signs that cannabis legalization is starting to work in a better fashion. More consumers are getting all of their product through licensed retailers, and the number of “new users” has not increased dramatically. Still, the significant regional disparities suggest that more marijuana outlets will need to be authorized in order to effectively eliminate the black market.

The award-winning novelist also pens comics, TV scripts (CBC’s ‘North of 60’), and is an internationally renowned storyteller. Steeped in the oral traditions of his people, the Tlicho (Tłı̨chǫ) of the Dene First Nations, Van Camp’s storyteller’s voice is wonderfully evident in his highly recommended short story collection, Moccasin Square Gardens.

Set primarily in the Northwest Territories, or Denedeh, Moccasin Square Gardens vividly evokes the rhythms and characters of small-town life ""north of 60."" While some tales bring to mind Stephen Leacock or Stuart McLean, those comparisons fail to capture the dazzling range of themes and genres in this collection. Family discord and reconciliation, environmental degradation, sexuality, fantasy, mythology, and even a smattering of horror is all found here. Yet, even the darker stories are permeated with the author's optimism and sense of humour.

article continues below

Moccasin Square Gardens opens with 'Aliens’, a lyrical tale of budding romance and two-spirit identity. In 'Man Babies', a resourceful park ranger confronts the lay-about, videogame-obsessed son of the woman he's considering moving in with. In 'Super Indians', an embezzling band chief is hilariously held to account at a community sports day. In the haunting 'I Am Filled with a Trembling Light', the social ills of addiction and abuse are explored when a dying man tries to reclaim the home his father has lost to gambling debts.

The outliers in the collection are the two 'Wheetago War' stories. Van Camp, a fan of Star Wars who also writes graphic novels, combines Indigenous myth and popular culture in the form of Zombie-like Wheetago monsters, brought back to life by global warming.

It's a cliché, but this clear-eyed, emotion-filled collection will have you laughing and crying, while at the same time contemplating questions of Indigenous and Canadian history and culture.

No example is better than the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks in the United States, which gave us the “Patriot Act” after just 45 days of deliberation to expand government surveillance of Americans to previously unimagined levels.

In mid-April, the actions of Gabriel Wortman led to the deaths of 22 people in Nova Scotia after multiple shootings and fires. Most Canadians, at the time still under lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, were horrified at Wortman’s actions, which included impersonating a police officer.

article continues below

It took the federal government only 13 days after Wortman’s criminal activity was evident for the entire country to announce a nationwide ban on 1,500 types of military-grade “assault-style” weapons in Canada. Any Canadian who possesses these firearms will have two years to get rid of them. The prohibition led to many new discussions about the role that firearms play in Canada’s urban and rural areas.

We know now that the perpetrator of the 22 murders in Nova Scotia had obtained his weapons illegally from Canadian and American sources. This was not a surprise for Canadian authorities, who have consistently reported that more than 70% of the weapons used in gun-related crimes in our country come from the United States.

On the issue of firearms, Canada is decidedly different from the United States. In Canada, it is not legal for a person to own or carry a firearm for the purpose of self defence against human beings. When Research Co. and Glacier Media asked Canadians about this key precept of Canadian law, more than three in four (77%) agreed with it, while 18% disagreed and 5% were undecided.

Atlantic Canada (31%), Saskatchewan and Manitoba (29%) and Alberta (24%) boast the highest number of residents who openly question Canada’s long-standing regulations for firearms. While higher than what is observed in Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia, these are not proportions of voters that would sway an election, certainly not in the way American statewide and congressional races can be tilted if your candidate can adequately hold a shotgun and recite the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution in a manner that panders to the base.

Fewer than one in five Canadians welcome the notion of citizens carrying firearms for something other than hunting or scaring wildlife away. Any survey measuring opinions on banning “assault-style” weapons would be met with near unanimity. The opposition reacted to the announced ban as it always has under its outgoing leader, by claiming the regulations would affect law-abiding Canadians. Lost in this unfortunate combination of inadequate polling and incapable opposition are the solutions that matter to Canadians.

In our survey, more than three in five Canadians (63%) told us that gun violence in Canada is a “very serious” or “moderately serious” problem – a proportion that climbs to 69% among women and 68% among those aged 55 and over.

Sizable majorities of Ontarians and British Columbians, who have experienced gang wars in urban areas, are more likely to look at gun violence as particularly problematic (76% and 67%, respectively). The COVID-19 pandemic did little to curb gun violence in Toronto, where 61 people were shot in the first four months of the year.

We asked Canadians about the effectiveness of four possible measures, and their responses outline a public that is ready for bold action. More than three in five Canadians (62%) think enacting a complete ban on handguns would be “very effective” or “moderately effective” in reducing gun violence in Canada. Most crimes, after all, are not being committed with the military-grade “assault-style” weapons that the federal government was quick to ban.

A higher proportion of Canadians deem two other measures as effective: imposing mandatory jail terms for crimes committed with firearms (74%) and introducing new outreach programs to steer youth away from gangs (also 74%).

Canadians place dealing with firearms smuggled from the United States as the most important issue that needs to be addressed. Many of the country’s residents also want to make sure gangs are not attractive to our country’s youth and believe mandatory minimum jail sentences would act as a deterrent.

Banning military-grade “assault-style” weapons is low-hanging fruit in a challenge that definitely has Canadians preoccupied and wishing for a type of government intervention that goes beyond a photo-op celebrated by poorly executed survey charity work.

True sociologists know that we learn nothing from posing the wrong questions to Canadians, and capable politicians should go beyond voicing displeasure with plans and proposals just because that is what they are expected to do. Meanwhile, Canadians are still worried about gun violence and expecting their elected officials to do better. •

Richmond actors and playwrights Jovanni Sy and Leanna Brodie have joined fellow Canadian artists in two “live” interactive projects called Red Phone and Plays2Perform@Home to keep people connected during COVID-19.

article continues below

Sy, Gateway Theatre’s former artistic director, said that Brodie, who is also his wife, and he were more than happy to join in the two projects when invited by Boca del Lupo’s artistic director, Sherry Yoon and artistic producer, Jay Dodge.

“They came to us and it sounded like a great idea and something that would benefit people in these times,” said Sy.

Since stepping down from overseeing programs and administration work at Gateway, Sy has been spending more time in rehearsal halls and working on projects like Plays2Perform@Home -- which is exactly what he wanted, he told the Richmond News.

“I’ve loved my seven years at Gateway, but I was ready for some new challenges and so far it’s been wonderful” said Sy.

Brodie, an award-winning playwright, said the two projects were created in response to the COVID-19 crisis in their own ways.

“Jay and Sherry had the Red Phone series ready and tailor made for this kind of situation, but they went in the opposite direction of the norm by taking the technology out of the project,” said Brodie, adding that many events have gone virtual since the pandemic hit.

“The projects (turn) the audience into the performers and whatever their social bubble is, where they can have this live unmediated experience with each other and do something completely out of the ordinary and essentially perform for each other.”

The Red Phone project is an audience to audience interaction based on a scripted conversation and will be at Granville Island from July 1 to Aug. 22. Photo submitted

Red Phone is a project where two people engage with each other using a red telephone in a five-minute conversation in two separate phone booths.

The interaction is facilitated by a teleprompter and conversations written by four different Canadian script writers – including Sy and Brodie.

The phone booths are located on Granville Island and are open to anyone from Thursdays to Saturdays.

According to Boca del Lupo Theatre, the act of having a conversation with an unseen partner provides an “anonymity that adds to the intimacy of the performance.”

Meanwhile Plays2Perform@Home is a script “box set” that is ordered and delivered to a home.

The box includes 10 to 20 minute play scripts with three to eight characters that friends and family bring to life with their own performances. Each script is a different genre ranging from a “kitchen sink drama” to a “satirical farce.”

The projects, said Sy and Brodie, are to help keep people and the voices of artists in the community, but at arm’s reach.

“They are right here in Richmond and across the country,” said Brodie.

“I think what these projects have in common is a belief in the power of telling stories, which human beings have been doing for thousands of years. It’s not only how we pass on lessons and pass the time, it’s how we understand the world.”

Riley Scott, who graduated from the Technical Apparel Design program in December 2019, was recognized at the annual Core77 Design Awards 2020, an annual design contest.

article continues below

The awards cover 18 distinct design disciplines and Scott was a student runner-up for the Sports and Recreation Award. His jacket, Stratus Ski Touring Mid-Layer, varies its insulation to the thermal needs of the user.

“The initial inspiration for this jacket came from my own ski touring expeditions and being frustrated with the amount of time and energy that was wasted while altering my layering system,” says Scott.

“I wanted to create an ‘invisible’ layer that could adapt to different temperatures and exertion levels - without removing any garments. To realize this goal, I took inspiration from window blinds as they transition from a 2D object to a 3D object when either side of the baffle is pulled in opposite directions.”

The jacket was Scott’s capstone project in the Technical Apparel Design program. He credited his instructors in helping him achieve success in the project.

For Scott’s instructors, the jacket reflects a commitment to the design process they teach.

“Riley did a fantastic job, not just in what the jacket became as a prototype but in the whole approach to understanding the context of use, defining the problem and technical design requirements, material and construction exploration, and iterative prototyping and testing of possible solutions,” said instructor Dan Robinson.

He says the jacket went beyond finding a solution for taking layers on and off during backcountry ski touring.

“The Stratus jacket is also sensitive to other context-specific requirements for carrying a pack, for providing more traditional vent zips that are usually absent in a mid-layer, for keeping sleeves in place with arm movements, and for packing the jacket when not in use,” Robinson added. “And he did both engineering tests to show changes in insulation and user tests to demonstrate effectiveness in simulated use of the jacket.”

This is the second consecutive year a Technical Apparel Design program graduate has been recognized at the Core77 awards after Philip Siwek’s autonomous vehicle cycling jacket won the Strategy and Research student category in 2019.

Scott, who now works for Mountain Equipment Co-op, is passionate about his future in technical apparel design as he hopes to push the boundaries of what’s possible in developing products.

“I feel so honoured to have been recognized by the designers at Core 77 for a project I put so much time and passion into,” he adds. “It has been incredibly validating to realize that judges from Jacksonville, Luxembourg and Stockholm are all discussing my design as it is something I have thought about every day for months.”

The Technical Apparel Design program has been developed in collaboration with employees from Vancouver-based technical apparel companies such as Arc’teryx, lululemon, Mountain Equipment Co-Op and Mustang Survival, along with top academics and researchers.",[]

In particular, the City advises against tree topping. Tree-topping is the indiscriminate cutting of tree branches to stubs, which leads to a far broader negative impact than just altering the appearance of a tree.

article continues below

When done, tree-topping can increase issues with pests, cause sunburn and shock to the tree, and, in the most dire of situations, lead to the starvation and death of the tree.

It can also negatively affect property value, and, on a larger environmental scale, detract from the urban region’s tree canopy, which supports wildlife, provides much-needed shade from the sun and helps maintain proper drainage during heavy rainfall.

Unfortunately, many believe limiting a tree’s height through tree-topping is the correct way to trim a tree.

But, the survival mechanism of crudely topped trees causes them to produce numerous shoots below each cut. The rapid growth of these shoots means that the tree will return to its previous height quickly and even more densely than before.

Tree-topping also often results in large, open pruning wounds that expose the sapwood and heartwood of the tree to infestation. The stress of losing a large amount of wood and greenery can also inhibit the tree’s ability to close its exposed wounds and guard against insects and disease.

In general, proper pruning practices rarely remove more than one-quarter of the leaf-bearing crown or green portions of a tree, which help protect it like an umbrella from the harsh rays and heat of the sun. Topping often removes about half or more of the crown and can weaken the tree through loss of its food-making leaves.

Tree owner resources

For a guide of the correct way to prune trees on your property, and the environmental regulations protecting them, the City of Richmond has a number of information links homeowners can access.

“There are a lot of things to consider when picking a tutor or learning centre for your child,” says Jade Chan, Centre Director at the Sylvan Learning Centre in Richmond. “Every child has their own specific needs, and you need to find the environment that works best for both the child and the parents.”

article continues below

Jade offers these five great tips for finding the right tutor or learning centre for your child:

1. Length of time in business: Sylvan Learning Centre has been in existence for over 30 years, more than 20 years in Richmond. ""There's a reason we're still here,"" notes Jade. ""We're successful because our tutoring programs and methods work.""

2. Quality of teaching experience: Sylvan hires only tutors who are qualified to teach in B.C. ""That way, you know you're getting experienced teachers who are familiar with the B.C. education curriculum that your child is learning in school,"" says Jade. She suggests you ask any tutor or learning centre your considering about their qualifications.

3. Online research: Type the name of the tutor or learning centre into Google or other search engine with a qualifier like “reviews” or “ratings” and see what kind of ratings pop up. Reading about other clients’ experiences may provide insight into the level of service you can expect.

4. Type of assessments and feedback provided: Ask how a learning centre will assess your child and what kind of feedback they will give. ""At Sylvan Learning Centre, we ask a lot of questions about your child and their relationship with learning. We talk to both the parents and the student to find out where the issues are and how we can support the student.""

Monthly conferences with parents and regular check-ins with students around their progress should be a standard part of any program, says Jade. And ultimately, the tutoring programs should be designed to support what children are learning in school.

5. Payment plans:Be sure to ask tutors and learning centres about rates and payment plans before you commit. “At Sylvan Learning Centre, we design individualized programs for students with varying needs,” says Jade. “We also offer a variety of payment plans to suit each family’s financial situation, because we want to ensure tutoring is available for as many children and young people as possible. From a month-to-month plan to a long-term contract, Sylvan has an option that works for most people.”

COVID-19 data is being released by the BC Centre for Disease Control twice a week. - BCCDC illustration

The BC Centre for Disease Control is releasing COVID-19 data by health service areas, of which Richmond is one, twice a week.

Since the opening of a COVID-19 testing site in mid-June in the parking lot of the Richmond Tennis Club, 1,100 people have been tested for the virus.

While the testing site is referred to a “drive-through” site, there is a dedicated lane for those arriving by foot. It’s open from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Monday to Friday and statutory holidays.

Vancouver Coastal Health reported about 60 people – ranging in age from 12 to 100 - visit the centre every day, either in cars, by bike or by foot with one person arriving in a wheelchair. Only those with symptoms are tested, however.

The testing site opened on June 10 after a previous plan to open a site at Thompson Community Centre was nixed.

According to VCH, 80 per cent of those being tested at the site are Richmond residents, and the most common age groups are those between 20 and 34 and 45 and 64. Twenty per cent are seniors.

There is no need for an appointment to be tested, but there can be a short wait time, according to VCH. The busiest times are at 10 a.m. and 2 p.m.

As of the end of June, 90 people had tested positive for COVID_19 in Richmond.

The testing site will be in place “as long as there is a need for it,” according to a VCH spokesperson.

The COVID-19 testing site is at 6820 Gilbert Rd.",[]

The employee, a member of the mall’s management team which works in Lansdowne’s administrative offices, was exposed to the virus while offsite at a private family event.

Mall management was informed of the exposure July 11, spokesperson Bronwyn Bailey told the Richmond News in an email.

“The team member…has not experienced any symptoms associated with COVID-19 and is currently self-isolating, and will not return to work until they receive proper health clearances,” said Bailey, adding that the administrative offices are separate from the retail shops, and are only accessible to staff.

Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Vancouver Coastal Health said the health authority is not aware of any risk to the public at the mall, and that VCH has not issued any public notifications about the exposure.

A notice circulating on social media claims there has been a potential COVID-19 exposure at Lansdowne Centre. - Submitted photo

On Monday, a notice was issued to Lansdowne tenants advising them of the potential exposure. A photo of that notice was then widely circulated on social media.

The notice said that the centre had been “potentially exposed to the novel coronavirus through an individual, or a group of individuals, either visiting or working in the building.”

And while the notice stated that an unspecified individual had been in contact with someone who has a “confirmed case of the coronavirus,” there are currently no suspected or presumptive positive cases at the mall.

“We are actively working with the tenant, and other involved parties, to confirm all details, and have provided them with the appropriate resources to address the situation. There is currently no confirmed risk to our building’s occupants,” reads the notice.

Dr. Meena Dawar, Richmond’s medical health officer, said all cases of COVID-19 are reported to health authorities, which will alert the public if there is any health risk.

“Please reach out to (public health) first before issuing notices,” Dawar told the Richmond COVID-19 Community Task Force.

She said some retailers might be working with limited information but public health can assess any risks to the public.

Bailey said that, out of an “abundance of caution and as per our established response protocols,” the administrative office space was disinfected, Lansdowne Centre staff were asked to monitor themselves for potential symptoms, and all tenants were informed of the situation.

“There have been no other confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19 reported at our offices or the retail facility, which remains safe and open to guests,” said Bailey.

“Since the start of the pandemic, we have maintained close contact with and followed relevant guidance from the City of Richmond and local health authorities, which have assessed the risk of this current exposure incident to be low,” she added.

However, not all tenants say they have received the letter, dated Monday, July 13. The Richmond News has reached out to Lansdowne Centre for confirmation, but did not receive a response by the time of publication.

The notice, addressed to Lansdowne tenants, says that the centre has been “potentially exposed to the novel coronavirus through an individual, or a group of individuals, either visiting or working in the building.”

While an unspecified individual has been in contact with someone who has a “confirmed case of the coronavirus,” according to the notice, there are currently no suspected or presumptive positive cases at the mall.

“We are actively working with the tenant, and other involved parties, to confirm all details, and have provided them with the appropriate resources to address the situation,” reads the notice.

“There is currently no confirmed risk to our building’s occupants.”

However, the owner a restaurant in the mall, who asked to remain anonymous, told the News that he never received the notice from management, despite being at his restaurant all of Monday.

He said he only became aware of the letter after he returned home and began receiving messages from friends, who sent him the social media photo of the notice and suggested he self-quarantine. He added that he is trying to contact Lansdowne Centre management about the situation.

The owner also told the News he is aware of at least one other restaurant owner who didn’t receive the letter.

The notice states that, in the meantime, any affected premises within the mall will be disinfected as part of the mall’s “precautionary measures,” while an unnamed business has been “professionally disinfected already and will be safe for use soon.”

Management also states in the notice that COVID-19 causes “only mild to moderate symptoms, such as fever or cough,” and that most people recover, however, some people – such as older adults or those with pre-existing health conditions – can develop more severe illness and may require medical attention.

“The health and safety of our occupants is our top priority and our property management team is in continuous contact with our risk management team to provide you with the most up-to-date and accurate information,” the notice reads.

Dr. Meena Dawar, Richmond’s medical health officer, said all cases of COVID-19 are reported to health authorities, which will alert the public if there is any health risk.

“Please reach out to (public health) first before issuing notices,” Dawar told the Richmond COVID-19 Community Task Force.

She said some retailers might be working with limited information but public health can assess any risks to the public.

Vancouver Coastal Health (VCH) is reaching out to Lansdowne to clarify what the situation is.

Meanwile, according to a spokesperson for VCH, there are cases where businesses notify customers as a part of best practices in response to a potential exposure to COVID-19 in their establishment.

However, if the risk is small, the health authority doesn’t need to take any further measures, such as issuing a public notice, said the spokesperson.

The News will update this story as more information becomes available.

According to the fourth-year international student, who is attending Kwantlen Polytechnic University’s Richmond campus, on July 6 around midnight she was parking her car in her apartment’s garage in central Richmond when she was approached by a blue BMW.

As she was getting out of her car, a man got out of the BMW, ran towards her and pepper sprayed her in the face.

Then, a woman emerged from the same BMW, and blocked the victim’s way, asking her if she needed help.

“However, the female didn’t help me. Instead, she dragged me and let the man pepper-spray me for the second time. Then they tried to pull me into their car with my hoodie.

“I got rid of my hoodie and ran desperately towards the elevator door,” said the alleged victim.

In the elevator, she went up to her apartment floor, ran down the hallway and banged on the door to her apartment. Her boyfriend quickly answered and immediately called the police.

The student said her eyes were stinging and watery, and her nose was running from the pepper spray. Her arms and legs are still bruised, she added.

“The whole experience was very traumatic, and I still feel the pain while recalling the memory. But I don’t want to see this horrible thing happen to others.

“Especially for women who live or travel alone, always be careful and take necessary precautions to ensure your safety,” said the woman.

Richmond RCMP confirmed they are investigating the incident.

It is unclear if this in fact was a kidnapping attempt, but in April 2019, Wanzhen Lu, 22, an international student from China was forced into minivan in an underground parking garage in Markham, Ont.

A ransom was demanded and Lu was found three days later on a rural road in Gravenhurst, Ont.

Schools closed early, sports events and clubs were cancelled, and it has been generally harder to maintain the same connections with their peers.

article continues below

However, Richmond’s army cadets - 2947 “39 Service Battalion” Royal Canadian Army Cadet Corps - have been keeping nearly 100 youth continuously engaged and connected since the pandemic restrictions kicked in on March.

The sea, army, and air cadet programs’ in-person activities were proactively cancelled across the country as COVID numbers increased.

However, this hasn’t stopped 2947 from leveraging technology to keep their members active.

Over the past several months, it has hosted virtual fitness nights, webinars, leadership town halls, and teambuilding challenges on a weekly basis.

Recently, the cadets completed a “Helping Hand” challenge, where they submitted photos of themselves helping around the house or supporting their neighbours.

Participation in these activities ranged from a low of 50 to a high of 95 cadets every Thursday since March, using internal communications platforms such as Slack.

“We’ve worked hard to build a culture of digital connectivity, engagement and inclusion over the past several years,” said Capt. Jeff Ng, commanding officer of 2947.

“This has really enabled our youth to not only be comfortable engaging in a virtual space when face-to-face contact is restricted, but also teach them to use tools like Slack in both a personal and professional context. We’re preparing them to use the same platforms they’ll see when they enter the workforce.”

2947 has posted some of the strongest participation results in the province when it comes to online engagement.

Cadets have been able to maintain friendships, share laughs and memes, and participate in thought-provoking and insightful learning activities.

“The best thing I see out of these activities is the outstanding level of care and compassion shown by our senior cadets,” added Ng.

“They meet with their juniors with a genuine interest in creating a comfortable mental and social space for them.

“They are the driving force behind designing activities to help their people destress, stay engaged, and ultimately maintain valuable social connections.”

2947 RCACC was named the Best Army Cadet Corps in BC in 2016, 2018, and 2019.

It has also produced the Top Army Cadet in BC in 2018, 2019, and 2020. Cadets ages 12-18 meet and train on Thursdays during the regular school year and there are zero costs to the program. More information can be found at www.2947armycadets.ca.",[]

The Kory Nagata Memorial Fund was established last week to honour the 24-year-old Richmondite, who recently lost his life on the Fraser River after trying to retrieve a football that had fallen into the water near the Pacific Gateway Hotel.

According to the Vancouver Foundation, which set up the fund, Nagata’s family “hopes to carry on his legacy and his selfless, generous spirit which never failed to draw others to him and help lift them up.

“He was an extraordinary young man with an incredibly promising future, beloved and respected by his teammates, coaches, and friends. He made his family immeasurably proud.”

Nagata recently graduated with a 3.7 GPA from the University of British Columbia’s Sauder School of Business, where he was a Thunderbirds running back.

He was recognized in 2019 for academic and athletic excellence by the Governor General’s U Sports Academic All-Canadian Commendation, given to exceptional student-athletes.

Nagata had spent some time in Virginia as a young boy and was raised in Richmond, where he began his football career as a running back for Richmond’s Hugh Boyd Trojans in high school.

He went on to help the Okanagan Sun reach the Canadian Junior Football League championship final.

On July 4, more than 30 writers joined the group’s poetry salon via Zoom to share work they had created during the pandemic.

“We can’t imagine how the world will look after COVID-19. However, we can still find a moment of peace despite global uncertainty,” said William Chan, current chair of the Chinese Canadian Writers’ Association (CCWA) and event organizer.

According to Chan, the online meeting went far better than expected, and whatever was lost by not having the poets meet in person was offset by the fact artists from across the country could join in.

“We had some poets from the East Coast,” Chan added.

While the work shared was created during the pandemic, not all of it was about the pandemic.

“Some wrote about the arrival of spring and the past Canada Day.

“As writers, we need to keep reading more, thinking more and writing more during this crisis. We need to use our work to connect with the rest of the world,” said Chan.

During the Zoom meeting, Richmond writer Dong Dong shared his latest work called The Cry of the Cherry Blossom, which is about cherry trees blooming in April but with so few people out to admire them due to COVID-19.

“The sakura blossoms alone on the trees, not knowing when people will lay their eyes on their beauty...Planting hope for the next spring; together we will see the whole city covered in pink blankets next year,” Dong wrote (translated from Chinese), noting he created the poem after taking a walk along Richmond’s West Dyke Trail.

“Many people were stuck at home back in April, leaving the trail so empty. In past years, the path would have been packed with people busy taking photos of the blossoming cherry trees. There was a sense of loneliness hovering over me and the emptiness was slowly swallowing me.

“However, I believe this storm will pass and, together, humankind will overcome this,” said Dong. He is already looking forward to enjoying the beauty of the cherry trees with other Richmondites next year.

Chan said his organization plans to host another online poetry event in September and hopes writers from different cultural backgrounds will join them.

“Poems and prose bring out the beauty of the world and our faith in humanity; we can all be connected through words,” said Chan.",[]

“Customers will be provided with buckets from us, so they don’t need to bring their own. We will sanitize each bucket before handing it out to them.

“At the entrance, staff will direct pickers to specific areas and inform them of the guidelines,” said Nijjer, adding that the big farmland makes it easy for people to maintain social-distancing.

Meanwhile, pickers are encouraged to wear face coverings in the fields; they are also required to phone ahead to make an appointment before coming out.

Nijjer said he expects to see fewer kids come out this year because parents want to keep their children safe. However, he thinks berry picking is still a great activity to keep children busy and entertained.

“Many people told me they are happy to be able to get out and enjoy the sunshine while picking up some fresh fruit,” said Nijjer, adding that visiting a local farm has become a family tradition for many people.

“It also strengthens family bonds as it plays an integral role in many people’s families.”

However, that’s the reality every single day for Richmondite Tommy Leung, who’s completely blind.

article continues below

Leung, for all intents and purposes, has been housebound during the pandemic and is completely reliant on his wife, Becky Lei.

In fact, his independence has been stripped to such an extent that garbage day is the highlight of his week, when he accompanies Lei downstairs from their condo near Cambie and Garden City roads.

The simple fact is Leung uses touch and feel to navigate his way around the world – which is not surprisingly off the table with a potentially deadly virus sweeping the globe.

“I used to have a guide dog. I would have went out with him a lot but he passed away prior to the pandemic,” said Leung, 40, who has been blind for 20 years due to glaucoma.

“I’m waiting for guide dog training, but that’s not possible due to the pandemic. All the classes have been cancelled.

“But I do have my wife to help me. That way, I don’t have to feel my way around. I don’t want to be using the elevator or even the brail panels.

“I didn’t even know there were hand-sanitizing stations around in stores and buildings, until someone told me. There’s no way for me to know where they are. And I wouldn’t know where to start to look for them.

“I’m told there are social distancing signs on the ground. I can’t see them, obviously, and I can’t feel them with my cane. So I’ve no way to keep a social distance from people at stores.”

Leung said he can’t even use public washrooms because of the need for him to feel around, even with the use of his cane.

“I’ve not been out at all since the pandemic, to be honest,” he added.

“Apart from garbage day. My wife and I go downstairs in our condo building and I get some air and exercise while she puts the garbage away.”

The one silver-lining during the pandemic is Leung being able to work from home for his job in Vancouver, as a peer support and advocacy coordinator for the Canadian National Institute for the Blind (CNIB).

“One of the big concerns was accessing public transit to my office in Vancouver,” said Leung.

“If I had to take transit, I couldn’t see what I was touching. And if the buses are full to capacity, due to the reduced schedule, they could just shoot past me and there’s no way for me to know that.”

Another person with new challenges in life beyond what many of us are experiencing during the pandemic is Min Yuan, who has been deaf for 38 of her 40 years, due to an accident as a small child.

Yuan, who works closely with the Richmond Centre for Disability, mainly communicated, when face-to-face with people, via lip-reading, something that’s become nigh impossible when the wearing of face masks became prevalent.

“Sometimes I don’t understand them (even without a mask),” said Yuan to the Richmond News, via email, while acknowledging that it has now become almost impossible to know what someone is saying.

“Even if they speak English, (I could usually) understand what they say, because the eyes are my ears, and my eyes are clear. It will speak and tell me what the other party said.”

Yuan said, however, she is a “very optimistic and positive person” and “can face the difficulties and face the reality…I am willing to challenge the difficulties.”",[]

Now, the city says that weekend filming will be taking place in Gastown around Cambie Street and Cordova. It notes that it, “involves highly visible graphic content including mock dead bodies, a mock dead police horse, trash & debris.”

The CBS show, currently called Radio Nowhere, is created by Salvation Productions, and a notification letter sent to residents in the area states that filming will take place at 1086 Bute St. on Sunday, Nov. 3. It adds that scenes will include, “the brandishing of a weapon, coarse language, and special effects rain.”

Another notice states that Cordova Street from Homer Street to Abbott Street, as well as Cambie Street from Water Street to Hastings Street, will be temporarily closed. Cordova Street from Water Street to Hastings Street, as well as Abbott Street from Water Street to Hastings, will be closed, too.

Bus and traffic will be diverted as a result of the shoot.

According to StephenKing.com, The Stand is about a deadly flu that wipes out most of the world’s population. The survivors must choose between following two people and, “The two factions prepare for a confrontation between the forces of good and evil.”

IMDb states that the 10-episode series is set to air in 2020 and stars Whoopi Goldberg, James Marsden, Jovan Adepo, and Amber Heard.

100,richmond-news,https://www.richmond-news.com/living/from-fashion-to-face-masks-1.24130295,From fashion to face masks,[],,"Amid the mounting coronavirus pandemic, clothing designer Jennifer Graham knew she had to do something - she just wasn’t sure what.

“Our online sales were brisk and then COVID-19 outbreak happened,” says the owner of Salts & West, a B.C.-based natural and organic clothing wear company. “I began to reach out to people on Facebook to see if anyone needed anything.”

Instantly, doctors in Eastern Canada were messaging Graham about their pending shortage of protective face masks. To increase the supply of reusable masks, Graham reallocated her resources to cloth mask production. Thus, began a busy shift in manufacturing.

Salts & West is known for creating fashionable, natural fiber women’s apparel, like bamboo leggings, dresses and T-shirts. To go from that to creating cloth face masks was a challenge, but one Graham and her staff embraced.

Originally, the company was donating masks to doctors and clinics, but they soon realized the need was much greater, as the public was also asking about the face masks. Online demand for its personal face and Kn95 masks began to climb as medical professionals were encouraging people to add face masks as another layer of protection, in addition to washing hands and self distancing.

“It feels so good to be able to do something to help others during this crisis,” says Graham, who opened Salts & West 15 years ago. “At the beginning, we were donating many masks, but we soon realized we needed to charge for them to continue production.”

Salts & West was the first small independent company in B.C. to start creating these urgently needed masks. Graham and 10 seamstresses, who all work from home, manufacture 2,000 to 3,000 masks per week.

“All of the fabric comes from Canadian suppliers, including a Vancouver provider,” says Graham, adding they will continue to fabricate masks for as long as there is a need for them. “We are working around the clock to make sure we can keep up with the demand.”

To ensure the safety of the seamstresses, each week Graham gathers the supply of fabric and cuts 3,000 masks at a time. She then bundles a sterilized package for each seamstress for pick up at her front door. To date, thousands of masks have gotten in the hands of first responders, the public and others across Canada and the United States.

“We have heard several stories from vulnerable people with compromised auto immune systems and older people, across the country, telling us how anxious they are about COVID-19,” says Graham. “It’s humbling to know we can help people by offering a little more peace of mind.”

Not only has Graham been providing assistance to first responders, the public and essential businesses, she discovered a way to keep her staff members employed.

“We didn’t have to shut down a factory to do this …. I started with my team of four seamstresses, but as demand grew, I enlisted another six, some of whom are volunteering their salaries to the Food Bank on their own accord,” says Graham, whose company is also donating a portion of mask sales to the Food Bank. “This has been so humbling and gratifying for me and my dedicated staff.”

Seeing the facial marks caused by the long-term wear of masks, the company has released more comfortable bamboo masks, for those who have to wear them for extended periods of time, such as grocery clerks, bakers and other essential workers.",[]

It’s all about the relationships she’s formed with her childhood teachers, the girls she danced alongside as a teen, and the people she teaches at The Next Evolution Dance Company, which she founded five years ago.

Until now, the company has been based out of other dance studios but Bloy is about to take things to the next level with the opening of her own location, a freshly renovated 1,500 sq ft space in Richmond, where she and her team will teach ballet, jazz, tap, lyrical, contemporary and hip-hop. “I’ve been really fortunate throughout my training to have had strong relationships, but that’s not always the case in dance, so when I founded my company, I wanted to do something different – to nurture dancers in a dynamic atmosphere,” says Bloy. “We all know each other – the families, siblings, even the dads who sometimes can be excluded from dance. We keep things close knit, supportive and fun. It’s all about camaraderie – let’s help your friend next to you! If someone falls in class, all the other students clap because they want to congratulate their classmate for trying their hardest.”

article continues below

This positive and supportive atmosphere produces happy students and results – kids participate in exams, competitions and shows and many have gone on to professional careers. But it’s also about steering students through life. “Dance is a really excellent way to learn discipline, time management, and that you get results if you work hard. Also, students are spending their time on something that’s good for their bodies and creativity, not just hanging out,” Bloy says.

When the doors open on September 10, Bloy will be welcoming students of all ages, from pre-schoolers to adults, of every level and experience. “Everyone can get something from dance, whether it’s a career, or just a social experience away from your kids,” she says. Will you learn how to do the splits? Maybe not, but there’ll be a whole community of people cheering you on!

The Next Evolution Dance Company’s new studio is at #7-11220 Voyageur Way, Richmond. Registration is open now. To find out more, call 604-447-0116, email thenextevolutiondance@gmail.com, or follow @tnedance on Instagram and Twitter.",[]

The academy, originally opened for juniors, is expanding its roster of players. In the short time since they opened in January 2018, the club’s popularity has grown immensely and by demand, now offers its world class facilities to adults as well.

“The biggest thing for adults when they come here is they’re always looking for tournaments, socials, leagues, and adult lessons,” said Todd Quesnel, the General Manager at VITA. “So we have the ability to create those programs.”

Because the academy is still in its infancy, Quesnel said, it is a real opportunity for its members to shape what they want it to look like. The tennis academy prides itself on letting its players, whether it be junior or adult players, create their own tennis. For the adult players, that could mean creating the social atmosphere where players can voice their opinions and desires. “That could be a men’s double nights, women’s doubles, mixed doubles, those are all things that we’re hoping to create as well as to add to that club atmosphere,” Quesnel added.

In addition to the tennis courts, VITA’s newly renovated gym, which is open seven days a week with extended hours, is another enticement for many adults. A yoga and dance studio is open for bookings and classes. More than that, the swimming pool and squash courts also provide VITA members with a large selection of exercise options. Squash memberships are available along with access to leagues, ladders, socials, tournaments, adult and junior private lessons. “We wanted to create a facility where adults could come in here and book courts, get a variety of different fitness options, and join a program that makes them feel like it’s a second home,” Quesnel said.

That’s because the Richmond-based, fruit winery he started two years ago, Fraser Sun Winery, has nowhere to go but upwards.

The first batch of blueberries, grown on a 10-acre patch of farmland right behind his winery in east Richmond, plus another 10 acres belonging to a neighbour, has been bottled and the majority of the 30,000-litre production is on the way to a buyer in China.

Next year, the blueberry crop currently growing in the fields is expected to yield about 100,000 litres of wine. And that also has a buyer already lined up to take nearly all of it.

So, what’s projected for the year after that?

“If I can get enough land to grow the berries, it’s probably going to be much more,” says Shang, adding he has already ordered more fermentation tanks that will boost production significantly after they arrive this fall.

What’s driving the sales?

“It’s good quality wine, and since I control the manufacturing costs really well, we can produce it at a cost that is very competitive,” Shang says, adding the underlying health benefits of the antioxidant-rich blueberries also makes it a prized product in the Chinese marketplace.

Another plus has been the stellar reputation wine produced from Richmond-grown blueberries already has in China, as other local blueberry winemakers have, for many years, been exporting the product.

“It’s really well known in China that blueberries from here are good quality. Richmond has been growing blueberries for many generations, and the land is perfect that we don’t have to use any sprays,” says Shang, who taps into his knowledge as a landscaping operator, his other business, to guide his crop towards fully organic status.

“So, another blueberry wine product grown in Richmond is very popular,” Shang says. “And we are the newest, Richmond winery and that makes us special.”

Apart from pricing, what also sets Fraser Sun Winery apart from the competition is the blending of blueberry types - bluecrop and duke.

“That makes us unique, and people enjoy the taste very much,” Shang says.

Just look at recycling for example.

The average BC resident generates around five empty beverage containers a week. Now that might not sound like a lot, but when you start to multiply it by the more than 200,000 people who live in Richmond, then you start to see the impact that choosing to recycle your empty beverage containers at a Return-It depot can have.

Whether it’s aluminum cans, glass bottles, or cardboard cartons, recycling drinks containers uses a fraction of the energy that it takes to create new ones. It also helps to divert thousands of tonnes of material from landfill each year.

But making the choice to recycle isn't just good for the environment, it’s good for you too.

Conveniently located at the heart of Richmond, the Return-It Depot in the Blundell Centre offers would-be recyclers seven cents for every bottle or can they return. Like the impact that your recycling can have on the environment that small change can add up over time, helping to put a few extra dollars back in your pocket that you can spend on anything you want to.

Open from 9 am to 6 pm from Monday to Saturday and 10 am to 5 pm on Sundays and Holidays, the Return-It depot fits around most peoples’ schedules, so there really is no excuse for you not to do your bit.

Whether you want to save the planet or just a few bucks, make sure you check out the Return-It depot at the Blundell Centre, Richmond’s convenient one-stop destination for friendly service from local business owners.",[]

Real Estate Wire (REW), one of Canada’s leading digital real estate platforms, is expanding their well-established listings portal to include rentals. The website, which has been trusted by real estate buyers and sellers for the better part of a decade, will offer a number of tools and resources to help renters find their next home.

“Renting is an important part of the real estate market for many families, especially in cities like Vancouver and Toronto, where affordability is a major issue,” said Simon Bray, REW President. “Over the years, we have seen an increasing need for a rental platform that is safe, secure, and provides renters with the same great service as buyers. That’s why we’ve expanded our real estate marketplace to include rentals.”

The Lower Mainland is one of the world’s most expensive real estate markets for buyers, driving many families to look for affordable rentals as an alternative. The COVID-19 pandemic has further impacted the buying power of many families.

A recent REW survey found that 45% of respondents had either lost their job or some income due to the pandemic. About 38% of survey respondents said that COVID-19 had negatively affected their financial ability to buy a home.

“The shift to include rental properties on our platform has been in the works for some time, but the pandemic has really accelerated the demand for this service,” added Bray.

“Our goal is to help Canadians find their next home. Whether it’s buying a new development, browsing a listing down the street, or finding a great rental apartment, REW delivers a comprehensive real estate experience for everyone.”

In addition to listings, renters will have access to videos, virtual tours, market insights, and detailed descriptions of the rental properties, including their location, nearby schools, and amenities.

With the uncertainty surrounding the future of COVID-19 and its impact on the real estate market, these resources will become increasingly important to families that want to shop for a home online. About 80% of survey respondents believe websites like REW are now a critical resource, with 90% reporting having used a website like rew.ca in the last 30 days.

REW is working exclusively with property management companies to ensure rental properties are vetted and meet REW’s quality management standards.

“Our position in the real estate market has enabled us to establish strong relationships with the top property management companies in Canada. When using our platform, renters can rest assured they are receiving quality listings that have been reviewed by industry professionals.”

There are currently over 10,000 rental listings available on REW in British Columbia, Alberta, and Ontario. Expansion plans to bring rental listings across Canada are in the works.

With a history dating back more than a thousand years, the modern pizza was invented in Naples where the focus has always been on using quality fresh ingredients.

But as more and more people have started to enjoy the humble doughy disc on this side of the Atlantic, the product that most of us enjoy has got further and further away from the dish’s roots. Instead, in a bid to cut corners many stores now use frozen dough and often skimp on the quality and quantity of ingredients in a bid to cut costs.

It’s a far cry from the fan favourite we all know and love.

But thankfully one Richmond restaurant is still offering up authentic dishes, serving up a slice that they claim is “The Last Honest Pizza” in the Lower Mainland.

Sylvan Learning Centre's Jade Chan says that students need to learn about life too.

""At Sylvan, students earn tokens throughout their academic programs,"" Chan explains, ""and they can spend these at our store. We teach them how to save tokens for something they really want. It’s important that they begin to grasp concepts such as budgeting at an early age.”

Sylvan also offers help with basic study skills and includes a component on current affairs. ""We want kids to be aware of their surroundings,” says Chan, “We make sure they’re aware of what's happening in the world and take a look at how it’s affecting them and what they can do about it.""

Recognizing that kids tend to be more focused on checking out social media or texting their friends, Sylvan offers classes designed to stimulate their interest in technology. Robotic classes and camps, for example, teach children to build and program a variety of robots using LEGO®bricks and high-tech software.

Similarly, Coding for Kids encourages students to develop their own video games and animations. It's a cool, 21st century introduction to programming, problem solving, and logic. At the end of the Coding for Kids camp, children design a video game that they can play with friends.

It's not only younger children that can benefit from an academic tutoring program of this nature. Sylvan helps with college preparation by offering sessions on SAT and ACT tests. Providing small group instruction with experienced tutors, Sylvan's SAT preparation sessions include personalized homework and flexible hours to fit a teen's busy schedule.

Signing up for the in-centre prep system means students also get access to Sylvan Prep Online, a personalized, online learning environment. Here, a potential college student has access to thousands of videos on how to approach SAT test problems, as well as subject-specific video lessons and full-length, timed practice tests.

Jade laughs when asked how Sylvan Learning Centre keeps the attention of students in the age of cell phones and mobile devices.

""We have a 'no cell phone use in the learning area' policy,"" she says, ""but it's enforced with friendly reminders, not punishment. It's hard for teenagers when there's a flash on the screen. We understand that. At the same time, we know that it’s hard to be productive when you’re constantly being interrupted.”

Each January, people make the steadfast commitment that this year they will improve their fitness and start eating healthier. Though, as many of us have experienced, it can be a difficult task to do on your own.

At Pharmasave Richlea Square, the pharmacists and medical professionals want to help you achieve these health goals. With a medically supervised weight loss program called Ideal Protein, they have already helped numerous community members lose extra weight and taught them about the changes needed to maintain their weight loss and a healthy lifestyle.

article continues below

Through monthly seminars, the Richmond-based Pharmasave educates people about how and why the Ideal Protein weight loss program works. “It’s a low carb, low fat, protein-based program that you supplement with Ideal Protein foods,” said Lina Ooi, the founder and co-owner of the pharmacy. With this ketogenic diet, Ooi said, “you get the protein you need to maintain muscle mass while keeping the calories low.”

Ooi, who is also an Ideal Protein coach, explained by cutting out carbohydrates, your body enters a phase called ketosis, during which it burns optimal fat. For every gram of fat you lose, you burn 9 calories. Ooi said, “this is double the energy that your body gets from burning carbohydrates.” Furthermore, she added, “when people are in ketosis and burn fat, they tend to feel great and have a lot more energy.” She estimates past dieters have lost between two and five pounds per week.

With over 80 different food options and products, ranging from soup to chips and smoothies – some of which can be sampled at the monthly seminars – this weight loss program is both protein focused and protein driven. Those who sign up for Ideal Protein also get the full support of the coaches and pharmacists who work alongside doctors to ensure a healthy, safe, and successful weight loss journey.

“It works really well with our pharmacy concept in terms of health and wellness,” Ooi said. In fact, obesity is one of the leading causes of several medical conditions. For those dieters with pre-existing medical conditions, such as diabetes or joint pain, Ooi said that a lot of those issues are mitigated once they lose the weight. In addition, Pharmasave Richlea Square is also involved with a UBC Study for Type-2 Diabetics that utilizes Ideal Protein as a diet intervention to improve blood-glucose control. For anyone who is a Type-2 Diabetic and interested in this Study, please contact Pharmasave Richlea Square to see if you qualify!

The next monthly seminar for the Ideal Protein weight loss program is on January 25, 2018 at 6PM. To learn more about Pharmasave Richlea Square and Ideal Protein, visit www.pharmasaverichleasquare.com or call 604-241-2898.",[]

And any history that contributes to the creation and characteristics of a place and its people deserves to be celebrated.



Since 1945, the people of Steveston Village in Richmond have celebrated the heritage of their unique seaside community with a festival reflective of our resource-rich background: The Steveston Salmon Festival.



The festival remains a welcoming beacon to British Columbians and Canadians alike to embrace our nation as one steeped in the bountiful, beautiful landscape that defines who we are as a people. The Salmon Festival rejoices in the traditions of our country, as well as spreads awareness of how our country was built, and why the environment and the preservation of the ecosystem is important.



“Our founders viewed this community as ‘let’s grow something great for our families and our future generations’ and so, we feel it’s just as important to continue with that goal and with that vision,” said Janice Froese, Administrative Coordinator at the Richmond Agricultural and Industrial Society. “Steveston is still effectively like a small town within a big city and for us it’s the spirit of Steveston and carrying on that legacy that was started by our founding fathers.”



The Richmond Agricultural and Industrial Society has been at the helm of the festival for many years, and the celebration has grown from a fundraiser to build a playground in Steveston Park in 1944, to a full-fledged commemoration of the Canadian biography that attracts nearly 80,000 each year.



Froese believes the festival is particularly important because it signifies Steveston’s huge impact in the origination of the Metro Vancouver area.



“Steveston is one of the first communities that was ever founded in B.C., its history dates back nearly 140 years. [Steveston] is older than the city of Vancouver itself,” said Janice Froese, Coordinator at Steveston Community Society.



Remembering and celebrating our history is an important part of preserving culture and cultivating identity. The Richmond Agriculture and Industrial Society are passionate about continuing to remind Canadian citizens of their past and remain vigilant on the future and celebrations like the Steveston Salmon Festival are paramount to the continuation of that practice.



Come out and celebrate what it means to be Canadian at the Steveston Salmon Festival. For more information on the festival, visit the website or call 604-238-8080.

Once they step through the doors of the freshly renovated hotel on the corner of Westminster Highway and Minoru Boulevard, they will be greeted by decor and ambience inspired by the natural surroundings and character of the city perched on the mouth of the Fraser River.

All of the updated 236 rooms, and common areas, lobby and adjacent bar display a colour palette borrowed from the nearby great outdoors.

“Everything in here is brand new,” said Yannick Simović, the hotel’s general manager, adding the design theme is called West Coast Haze.

“When renovating a hotel today it is very much about telling a story,” Simović explained. “And what better story is there than where we are.”

That’s why some of the wallpaper in the halls evoke images of raindrops, and the carpets resemble a sandy beach.

“There’s also a lot of wood used, so that’s very much west coast,” he said. “Everything was designed with that in mind - something unique and representative of where we are.”

The changes started about 10 months ago, and each room now has an updated look that is more akin to residential apartment/condo living than a standard, hotel template, with contemporary bookshelves/entertainment units, cozy furniture and large shower stalls in the more spacious bathrooms that are now more like ensuites.

The hotel’s technology has been vastly upgraded, too, with increased Wi-Fi speeds, abundant data and power connections in the rooms and sitting areas, and even a mobile app that will allow guests to bypass the lobby desk by selecting a room, checking-in and even opening their room door using their smartphone.

To also keep in step with contemporary lifestyles, one of the larger suites in the hotel made way for an expanded fitness centre that has allowed more area for guests to do yoga and stretch, as well as use the weight machines and treadmills.

And while the look and feel of the hotel may have changed, the vast majority of the staff remain - many of whom were present when the hotel first opened 20 years ago - giving repeat and new visitors a familiar and experienced level of care.

They’re also a great way to reconnect with nature and the community you live in.

Next time you’re heading for the middle aisles in the grocery store, consider the following four things that every farmers market offers and your grocery store doesn’t:

article continues below

The shortest path to you: The vendors at your Farmers Market pick, wash, and choose the produce themselves. Grown and inspected locally, you can rest assured that you have the best produce you can buy. And because it’s grown close by, the produce spends less time in refrigerated transport and passes through fewer hands.

A sense of community: Steveston Farmers & Artisans Market’s location at the Steveston Community Centre is a great example of how farmers markets are deeply integrated into the communities they serve. Whether you’re dropping the children off at the martial arts centre or meeting your mother for a stroll through the nearby garden, the market is the perfect backdrop for everyday life and great way to connect with the community you live in.

Self-sustaining economy: money spent at the Steveston Farmers & Artisans Market directly supports the community, and the people who grow and make the products you buy.

“Steveston Farmers & Artisans Market vendors are closely juried,” says Market Committee Chair, Johanna Stewart. “Not only is there variety for the consumer, but there is also a selection of businesses from Steveston Village who represent the thriving local business community.”

Health and well-being: A fresh breeze from the Salish Sea on a sunny day will do a lot more for your general well-being than the manufactured scents in a big box store. Natural light versus halogen-lit aisles, local vendors versus national advertisements, and the general relaxed ambience of an outdoor public market are not matched by a programmed chain store.

Steveston Farmers & Artisans Market (SFAM) operates select Sundays from May to October, from 10:00am to 3:00pm rain or shine, at the Steveston Community Centre parking lot on Moncton Street.

""I love Steveston,"" he explains, ""and this was a perfect opportunity to work in the community where I live.""

Graduating from the Pacific Institute of Culinary Arts and working in private clubs and large chain hotels, Kyle brought his expertise to the kitchen of the seniors' independent living complex in Steveston.

Designing inviting menus for up to 160 residents has its challenges. ""Lots of variety is the key,"" he says, ""We work on a 28-day cycle for menus and we change things up every season. This is home for the seniors, so it's important that they're happy with the meals.""

Seniors often lack vital vitamins and minerals in their diets. Kyle recommends making sure the following are included in any senior diet:

· Calcium: eating milk and plain yoghurt is key to getting enough calcium as we age. ""Commercial fruit flavoured yoghurt has a lot of sugar and even salt,"" says Kyle, ""so we provide plain yoghurt and sweeten it with fresh fruit, a little honey, or even a homemade berry sauce.""

· Vitamin B12: as we age, our bodies absorb less of this important vitamin. Kyle recommends that seniors eat plenty of green veg, fish, and some animal protein to make sure they get enough B12.

· Fibre: ""At The Maple Residences we serve bran muffins every day and make sure seniors have access to fresh fruit at just about every meal.""

· Omega 3: fresh fish is an excellent source of this fatty acid. ""A lot of our residents at The Maples grew up in Steveston,"" notes Kyle, ""Fish has always been a big part of their diet and we make sure it's represented on our menus.""

Many foods today are loaded with sodium. ""Seniors should keep an eye on sodium levels,"" advises Kyle. ""Eating unprocessed foods is important; avoid or limit your intake of pre-made soups or packaged entrees. One processed meal can easily contain almost double the recommended daily intake of sodium.""

Nari Thiara is responding to this change by providing her clients with the opportunity to save thousands on the sale of their home.

The Richmond area real estate agent works with One Percent Realty to offer homeowners an alternative way to sell their homes — one that doesn’t include high commissions going directly to their agents.

“We’re what Netflix was to Blockbuster,” says Nari, who has been in the industry for 12 years. “It’s a game-changing approach to selling homes. 10 years from now, everyone’s going to be doing what we’re doing.”

With the advent of the Internet and public access to the MLS®database, the role of the real estate agent has evolved, says Nari. Rather than have agents provide them with information on listings, the public can find out about listings on their own.

As One Percent Realty sees it, the real estate agent’s primary role now amounts to showing listings to potential buyers and negotiating on the buyer or seller’s behalf.

When it comes to commission on selling homes, the general rule of thumb is for the agent to charge 7% on the first $100,000 and 2.5% on the balance.

A decade ago, One Percent Realty researched the market and found that the public recognized the need to pay for a real estate agent. However, home sellers resented paying high commissions. The company quickly identified an opportunity in the market to offer services at a reduced cost.

“We’re providing exactly the same services as a traditional real estate agent at a fraction of the cost,” says Nari, who primarily serves Richmond neighbourhoods, but also works in the surrounding area. “It’s the way of the future.”

The fully operational club, located on Horseshoe Way in Richmond, believes in a more well-rounded approach when it comes to its junior players.

“Something that is very unique, that’s different from other facilities where you just take a tennis lesson, walk off the court, and go home, is that at VITA we really focus on the basic fundamentals of doing the on court and off court training,” said Todd Quesnel, the General Manager at the academy. “And that’s where our full size gym comes in, which gives us the space and ability to provide that to the student,” he added.

This on court/off court training technique has seen much success with the tennis juniors at the academy. With the time broken into two parts, one with a tennis pro and the other with a personal trainer, Quesnel said “it gives the students the skills they need to take their game to the next level.” Under new management, VITA opened in January 2018 and is one of the few clubs that offers training beyond the court sidelines.

The learning garden began in the spring of 2013 run by volunteers with the support of the Steveston Community Society. Located on the lawn “east of the martial arts centre and beside the parking lot”, the garden is connected directly to the Steveston Farmers & Artisans Market.

“The garden was designed for accessibility,” says Johanna, noting that the firm paths in the garden are wheelchair accessible. “Older adults have a bed where they grow lettuce and other kinds of produce. Every month they get together and make a big salad or a bunch of sandwiches using the lettuce they grew.”

The garden begins with a border of ornamental cherry trees on the north side and a spiral perennial garden just beyond them. South of the perennial garden sits the amphitheatre, tent and benches, and past the tent are raised garden plots where you can find produce like kale, shallots, radishes, squash and pumpkin.

The children’s garden, beside the raised garden plots, is especially enticing as the ingredients for pizza—sans meats, of course—are grown in a pizza-shaped plot!

“Local youths are involved with Stir It Up, which is a year-round initiative,” says Johanna. “The participants make healthy meals once a week from local and sustainable food sources. They then enjoy a sit down meal and get to take any leftovers home!”

If a dish requires some colouring, then we make that in the kitchen from natural ingredients. If we can't make a suitable fresh food dye, then we don't serve the dish.""

This passion for only quality ingredients extends to not serving pre-made frozen food.

""We don't have a freezer in the kitchen,"" Bob says. ""Everything on the menu is made fresh. Indian food is much more flavourful when it is made from fresh ingredients and cooked without freezing.""

Whenever he can, Bob sources his ingredients from the local markets and suppliers.

""Another thing we do at Ginger Indian Cuisine,"" Bob explains, ""is we hand cut all our vegetables and meat. Often restaurants will use a machine to cut the meat, but the benefit of hand cutting is that the flavour of the meat comes through much nicer. For example, people often tell me that our lamb is the best that they have tasted. It's because we have cut the joints by hand and only include the best parts of the meat. Lamb has become known as our specialty.""

When asked why some Indian food can be really spicy, sometimes too spicy, Bob quickly responds:

""It is because the food has been prepared beforehand and frozen. When the dish has been prepared, it's difficult to alter the spice level, plus the spices grow stronger with time. At Ginger Indian Cuisine, we prepare the food when you order. So, if you want spicy, we can give you spicy. But, if you're sensitive to spices, we can alter the amount and give you a taste you will enjoy.""

There's even a spice level called ""kid spice.""

""It's no spice at all,"" laughs Bob, ""so it's suitable for children of any age and adults who prefer very little or no spice in their dishes.""

Canada is welcoming people who are willing to invest a variety of their talents and skills here. The country has set a target of 350,000 new arrivals per year by 2021.

“We are 40 million people and yet we don’t have enough people living here to fulfill all the opportunities for growth,” says Rachel Gary, COO of Canada Direct. “The Canadian government is giving people the chance to have a good life here but there is the expectation that you contribute to the economy as well.”

The Canadian immigration system is based on a points system, in which points are given for education, work experience, and English and French language proficiency. Many points can be earned in Canada, while others can be gained in the country of your origin.

When you contact Canada Direct to help you with the immigration application, a team member will take you through a set of questions that have been specifically designed to outline an applicant’s qualifications. Then, Canada Direct will send an assessment report to one of their regulated Canadian immigration consultants.

Education is one of the most crucial eligibility factors. While most bachelor’s and master’s degrees from other countries can meet Canadian standards, complications can arise if the applicant only has a post-secondary level of education from a technical school.

Gary says that cases such as when a person has a management experience without a university degree can be an issue. It’s not, however, that they are not educated, but rather that a particular level of education is not required to get the job in their country, unlike in Canada.

If they still want to continue working in their industry, the best-case scenario for them is to come to Canada on a student visa and get their degree or a college diploma. Plus, Canada Direct can help them get a work visa, which will allow them to earn income and get extra points for Canadian work experience at the same time.

If you are older than 35 and only have a high school diploma, it can be more challenging to immigrate to Canada, but, as Gary says, not impossible. Manitoba is the most lenient province when it comes to eligibility criteria, as it does not require applicants to pass an English language test. Another way is to apply for a student visa and study for the qualifications that are required for employment.

Having them when you need them can improve how you feel and act everyday.

Alternatively, Sonia Raeisi at Richmond Denture Clinic warns that not having dentures or having dentures that do not fit properly can result in harmful, and sometimes irreparable consequences that can effect your day-to-day activities. People can get headaches, experience ringing in the ears, bone loss and even digestive problems,” she said.

Raeisi has been a denturist since 2007, after graduating top of her class and receiving several awards and scholarships at Vancouver Community College. In addition to running a full service clinic, she provides denture services at Semiahmoo Dental Centre and Tsawwassen Family Dental. Raeisi also aids dental surgeons in the Lower Mainland and is an active member in the denturist community, formerly teaching future denturists at CDI College and serving on the Denturist Association of B.C.

Furthermore, she adds, “ill-fitting dentures can cause irritation and sores on the gums and hyperplasia.” According to National Cancer Institute’s (NCI) website, hyperplasia is an increase in the amount of cells in an organ or tissue. In this case, it is a product of the constant trauma on the mouth tissues caused by ill-fitting dentures. The new cells, according to NCI, are not cancer, though they can become cancerous.

Failing to get dentures at the right time can also impact your overall health. On top of bone loss, the lower jaw can become misaligned and move out of its proper position. In severe cases, Raeisi said, “denturists may not be able to put the lower jaw back into its proper position and the patient will have a harder time adjusting to new dentures because of the drastic jaw relationship.

On a final note, Raeisi spoke to the importance of seeing a denturist. Raeisi said that “denturists are specialized in the area,” meaning the procedures, treatments and aesthetics of the prosthesis are better off in the hands of a specialist.

For the 2020-21 season, the cap was estimated to be $84 million to $88.2 million, depending on a few factors.

That has changed.

article continues below

The suspension caused by COVID-19 and the uncertain future of the 2019-20 season leaves next season’s salary cap in serious jeopardy.

That’s because the cap is tied to league revenues. There’s meant to be a 50/50 split in revenues between the owners and the players. If there’s a drop in revenue for the owners — from a loss of gate revenue for unplayed or unattended games, unplayed playoff games, or a crashing Canadian dollar — then the NHL’s Collective Bargaining Agreement leads to less money for the players the following season in the form of a reduced salary cap.

A significant increase in the salary cap would have been a major relief for a team close to the cap like the Vancouver Canucks. The Canucks were set to have a tough time navigating the cap next season, thanks to the combination of a few highly-paid veterans, performance bonuses for young stars rolling over from this current season, Roberto Luongo’s cap recapture penalty, and several restricted and unrestricted free agents they need to re-sign.

If the salary cap went up, it’s possible the Canucks wouldn’t have to choose between UFAs Jacob Markstrom, Tyler Toffoli and Chris Tanev, but could re-sign all three. A flat cap — one that stayed at $81.5 million — would force the Canucks to choose two and possibly lose another player like Troy Stecher or Josh Leivo.

If the cap goes down? Then the Canucks are in some serious trouble, with difficult decisions to make that will undoubtedly make the team worse for next season. And they’re not the only ones: plenty of other teams would feel the cap crunch from this unprecedented situation.

Potential solutions could include an artificially inflated cap, but one option that has come up in NHL circles is compliance buyouts, with Brian Burke discussing it recently on Oilers Now, a radio program with Global News.

“I’ve heard discussion of compliance buyouts to help teams get to this new cap, to solve some of their problems,” said Burke. “In the last CBA, each team got two cap-compliance buyouts which were exempt from the cap.”

A compliance buyout would differ from a regular buyout in that it wouldn’t cost money against the salary cap. For instance, the Canucks will still have a little over $1 million against next season’s cap from buying out Ryan Spooner, but the Canucks bought out Keith Ballard and David Booth in 2013 and 2014 at no cost to their cap as compliance buyouts after the 2012-13 lockout.

If teams do get a compliance buyout, it seems obvious who the Canucks would use it on. Loui Eriksson has a $6 million cap hit for two more seasons following this one and has found himself in an increasingly-diminished role, playing primarily as a shutdown, defensive forward, with little-to-no contributions offensively.

The Canucks do have other options, however. Brandon Sutter has lost several steps and has a $4.375 million cap hit next season. They could be proactive and buy out Tyler Myers’ $6 million contract for the next four seasons before his play starts to decline. Cutting their losses on Micheal Ferland’s $3.5 million cap hit for the next three seasons might be smart. They might even be tempted to buy out Sben Baertschi’s $3.37 million contract with him buried in the AHL.

Do any of those supersede Eriksson? Probably not. Where it gets interesting is if teams get two buyouts, as they did in 2013 and 2014. Buying out Eriksson would be a given, then, but who would be the second buyout? Sutter has just one year left on his contract, Ferland’s cap hit isn’t overly onerous, and Tyler Myers is still a good, useful player.

One compliance buyout would make it far easier for the Canucks to re-sign Markstrom and Tanev. Two might mean re-signing Toffoli as well.

Stick-taps and Glove-drops

A tap of the stick to Eddie Lackas he announced his retirement from professional hockey on Monday. The former Canuck said the “best time in my career” was in Vancouver and thanked the fans sincerely.

A big stick-tap to Bauer. The hockey equipment manufacturer has modified its production line to produce protective visors for healthcare workers, with Quebec already ordering 300,000 visors for their doctors, nurses, and first responders.

Big Numbers

89 In four seasons with the Canucks, Loui Eriksson has a total of 38 goals and 89 points. He had 30 goals and 63 points in just one season with the Boston Bruins prior to signing with the Canucks.

4 So far, four NHL players have tested positive for COVID-19: two from the Ottawa Senators and two from the Colorado Avalanche. The Senators’ radio colour commentator, Gord Wilson, has also tested positive, as has St. Louis Blues’ play-by-play announcer John Kelly.

The goaltenders capped off their historic season at the tier one level by helping the Richmond Bantam A1 Jets capture the Pacific Coast Amateur Hockey Association President’s Series title.

The Jets claimed the four-team playoff with an unbeaten 2-0-1 record.

Lim-Metz made 32 saves in a 6-2 win over Coquitlam then turned aside 26 more shots in a 2-2 draw with Cloverdale. Mackay had a 24 save performance in a 5-3 victory against the Vancouver Thunderbirds.

In total, the girls combined for six shutouts, a pair of tournament MVP awards, a gold medal at the Richmond International and a silver at another tourney.

The pair made history last fall by beating out seven other netminders for the two spots on Richmond’s top Bantam team.

They both stepped into the crease for the first time when they were six with the Richmond Ravens Female program and along the way have become best friends. Both are Grade 9 honour roll students at Hugh Boyd Secondary School.

MacKay was the first to move over to boys hockey when she made Richmond Minor’s Atom A1 team. Lim-Metz re-united with her when they both made the Blues’ Pee Wee A1 squad for the 2017-18 campaign. Last season they played for the Jets’ Bantam A3 and A2 teams respectively — paving the way for their A1 spots this year.

They have been fixtures in the Richmond-based Elite Goalies Canada program for years — working mostly with Pasco Valana who also happens to be goalie coach for the national women’s team, along with former pros Mike Valley and Alex Auld.

Now Lim-Metz and MacKay are likely headed over to female hockey at the Midget age level next season.

Lim-Metz has already been training with the Fraser Valley Rush on a regular basis and was to join the BC Midget AAA squad for the playoffs until they were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Mackay was supposed to be playing this spring for the Prospects Female U16 Team that was slated to enter tournaments in Toronto and Boston.

Both girls were also going to attend Team BC U16 and U18 camps that also have been postponed indefinitely.",[]

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought all community sports to a complete halt. Some like hockey and soccer were in the stretch runs of their campaigns, while others like baseball and field hockey had yet to launch.

For competitive figure skaters, there really isn’t a season but rather months of work that goes into peaking at regional, provincial and national competitions before almost immediately beginning the cycle again, typically to prepare for a higher level. It means being on the ice as often as five days a week, creating a family-like environment, between the skaters, coaches and parents.

Connaught’s competitive group had just gone into a rare week-long break when several COVID-19 safety measures were announced including the closure of all city-run recreational facilities for the foreseeable future.

For club’s director of programs, the immediate concern was the impact on kids that were used to so much structure in their lives.

“My first thought was this might not hit them for a week or so when they are supposed to be back in the classroom and back on the ice,” said Keegan Murphy.

To help their skaters progress at home, and, more importantly stay in regular communication with their mentors and teammates, the club has turned to the Zoom video conferencing platform to run its usual dryland sessions and more.

Thanks to the program and the technical expertise of coach Leah Warwick, about a dozen 45-minute classes are being conducted a week. They are being led by 10 different coaches and the skaters are able to see each other training.

Components of the sessions include jumping, yoga, palettes, flexibility and ballet. The coaches are providing instruction and feedback with accolades for different challenges to enhance progress.

“It’s important for us to be giving praise so they know they are getting better,” continued Murphy. “I’m super proud of our coaching staff and so proud of our kids. This is something we never thought we would have to do.”

Connaught’s spring component looks to be in jeopardy. It included a trip to Vancouver Island early next month for a competition and during the Victoria Day Weekend as well. The hope is everyone will be back on the ice for the summer day camp sessions.

The online training is also helping the coaches during what is a difficult time for everyone.

“It doesn’t matter what sport you are talking about, you are bringing structure and positivity into daily lives of the kids and you have a passion for it,” added Murphy. “It can be a struggle when it is suddenly taken away from you like this.”",[]

With the season suspended because of the COVID-19 pandemic and a lot of fans confined to their homes for much of the day for the same reason, they’re jonesing for a little Canucks action to help get them through.

Because of that, fans were eager to watch a couple classic Canucks games on Saturday, with Sportsnet Pacific airing two games in lieu of Hockey Night in Canada. At 4pm, they showed 2004’s Game 7 between the Canucks and Calgary Flames, and at 7pm, it was 2011’s Game 7 between the Canucks and Chicago Blackhawks.

article continues below

The 2004 game, despite the way it ended for Canucks fans, was a treat. It was great to see the likes of Markus Naslund, Mattias Ohlund, and Sami Salo back in action. Seeing the Sedins on a line with Trevor Linden was a treat, though it was a little bizarre to see them on the ice at times with a number 14 that wasn’t Alex Burrows. Instead, it was Geoff Sanderson, who wore 14 after coming to the Canucks at the trade deadline for the second time in his career.

On the other hand, the 2011 game, despite being objectively one of the greatest moments in Canucks history, was strangely disappointing.

Both games include one of the greatest play-by-play calls in Canucks history. The game against the Flames featured Chris Cuthbert’s play-by-play masterclass on Matt Cooke’s game-tying goal in the dying seconds of regulation that had Ed Jovanovski jumping up and down like a madman in the penalty box.

Meanwhile, the game against the Blackhawks featured not one, but two classic calls of Alex Burrows’ overtime game-winner. One was from John Shorthouse’s play-by-play for radio, the well-known “They’ve slayed the dragon!” call, but the television call is just as great. Jim Hughson unexpectedly paraphrased a line from The Exorcist, declaring, “It’s a wonderful day for an exorcism!”

Canucks fans got neither call.

Instead of the Canadian feed from the CBC broadcast, Sportsnet used the American feed from Versus, now known as the NBC Sports Network.

Instead of Hughson, fans got the play-by-play of John Forslund, with Daryl Reaugh and Brian Engblom providing commentary. There was nothing particularly wrong with their commentary — well, apart from Forslund botching the call of Alex Burrows’ opening goal, saying it was scored by Mason Raymond — but it’s hard to compare with that of Hughson, particularly since his call is the one that Canucks fans remember.

Forslund also called Burrows’ goal an exorcism, but it didn’t quite have the impact, perhaps because he didn’t let the moment breathe. He rolled right through from the goal call to saying, “They exorcise their demons and eliminate the Stanley Cup Champions.”

To be fair, Forslund is a fine play-by-play commentator, legitimately one of the best in the business. It’s just exceedingly odd that Sportsnet Pacific, which is aimed primarily at Canucks fans, would use the American feed. The replay of the 2004 game used the CBC feed, so it isn’t a rights issue.

According to Andrew Garas, the Director of Communications at Sportsnet, the reason for the US feed was because of the complexities of the archiving systems from which they’re trying to find games.

“We're working to get a wide range of games from our various archiving systems,” said Garas. “At the time we were going to air this particular game, only the US feed was available, with some parts condensed.”

Evidently, no one anticipated needing to fill weeks of airtime with full replays of old games.

“You would think that they would all be labeled, you can just go in and say, I want this game from this year at this time,” said Garas, “but I don't think anyone's ever been in a situation like this where you're going back so far and getting games from years past. They're all somewhere in some capacity. It's just a matter of...being able to extract them from the archiving systems.”

Beyond the source of the broadcast, the replay of the 2011 game was plagued by problems. The first five minutes or so were nearly unwatchable due to a jittery frame rate that had the players looking like bad stop-motion animation. This was, again, an issue with the Versus feed that Sportsnet was able to extract from their archives.

Eventually, the broadcast smoothed out, but then Canucks fans just had a clearer view of the baffling editing decisions made to fit the game’s broadcast into a tighter timeframe. Garas was unable to specify whether these cuts were part of the Versus feed in the archive or if they were choices made by Sportsnet. Whoever made the edit removed two key moments from the game.

One was Alex Burrows’ penalty shot near the beginning of the third period. Burrows had a monumental performance in Game 7. He opened the scoring in the game off a great feed by Ryan Kesler, then had multiple chances to pad the team’s lead, finishing the game with seven shots on goal.

None of his chances were better than his penalty shot just seconds into the third. Burrows had been money on the breakaway and in the shootout all season, with his patented backhand deke that he once claimed was unstoppable if he did it correctly.

Asked Burrows if he thought goalies were wise to that shootout move 2 wks ago. He told me, ""If I do it right, it doesn't matter."" #Canucks — Daniel Wagner (@passittobulis) February 8, 2012

So, when Burrows was taken down from behind by Duncan Keith on the breakaway, it seemed certain that he would go to his, well, go-to move.

Instead, perhaps concerned that Corey Crawford would see it coming, Burrows stayed on the forehand and tried to go past Crawford’s blocker. He was shut down.

“It was probably the worst attempt of my career on a penalty shot,” said Burrows to The Athletic a few months ago. “I know where to shoot, but it was a total fail shot. It was an easy save for Crawford.”

That failed penalty shot is a key part of the narrative of that game and the role Burrows played. Removing it from the replay of the game just doesn’t make any sense.

Saturday’s broadcast also cut out another major moment from the game. Early in overtime, Burrows took a holding penalty, leaving him sitting in the box at a crucial time. In many ways, you could compare it to the 2004 Game 7 against the Flames, with another heart-and-soul player sitting in the box early in overtime, Jovanovski.

In many ways, that entire game was about Burrows. He scored both Canucks goals, had a game-high seven shots, got stopped on a penalty shot, and took a potentially-devastating penalty in overtime. The narrative of that game rises and falls with Burrows.

While killing Burrows’ penalty, Roberto Luongo made a fantastic save on Patrick Sharp on a backdoor play. Hearts stopped across BC in that moment, as Sharp looked to have the game on his stick, but Luongo made the stop.

“From the box, I was just so relieved that Lu made that push and got his blocker on it,” said Burrows to The Athletic.

“I saved his ass,” said Luongo.

That was one of the biggest moments of the game. Sportsnet cut it all out of the replay.

Fans didn’t get to see Burrows take the penalty. They didn’t see the Canucks’ penalty killers go to work to keep the Blackhawks from scoring the game-winning and series-ending goal. They didn’t get to see one of the most important saves of Luongo’s career.

Instead, the broadcast jumped ahead in overtime, skipping over the Blackhawks power play entirely.

In a way, the editing of the latter parts of the game echoed the jittery frame rate of the opening minutes: it was herky-jerky and hard to watch, leaving the feeling that fans were missing something.

Fortunately, Garas indicated that Sportsnet has big plans for the coming weeks that should erase the sour taste that Saturday's broadcast left in the mouths of Canucks fans.

“Right now what we're trying to do is we're trying to get the entirety of the 2011 series versus Chicago, to be able to air that in its entirety,” he said.

Hopefully Sportsnet will be able to grab the CBC broadcasts from the archives when they air the series in the near future.

For now, fans have other Canucks games from the past to look forward to. Sportsnet shared the Canucks game that are on their upcoming schedule:

In terms of overall global impact, however, the best comparison may be the 1918 influenza pandemic, which was inaccurately named “Spanish Flu.”

The NHL’s response to COVID-19 has likewise been compared to the 1918 pandemic for obvious reasons: the only year the Stanley Cup was not awarded was 1919, because of a flu outbreak that ravaged the roster of the Montreal Canadiens during the playoff series. The timeline for the pandemic and the hockey season deserves some closer scrutiny, however, as it provides an important warning.

article continues below

Just like now, the 1918 pandemic threw the world of sports into chaos. College football games were cancelled or postponed, though some ignored bans and played games in front of large crowds anyway. Bowling alleys were closed, to great protest, and the public was urged to stop gathering together for games of rugby and baseball.

Professional sports, however, continued unabated. The Major League Baseball season continued even as the flu spread across the United States. When the league ended the regular season early in September, it was because of World War I shutting down non-essential industries, not the flu, and the league still played the World Series later that month.

Perhaps it was for the best: the second wave of the flu struck in October and November, the deadliest wave of the pandemic. The early end to the MLB season might have saved lives.

The NHL, meanwhile, chose to begin their season as planned in December, despite the danger. To be fair, the league wasn’t playing to thousands of fans in large arenas at the time. The Montreal Canadiens played in Jubilee Arena, with a seating capacity of 3,000.

It was also a much, much smaller league. Just three teams played during the 1918-19 season: the Canadiens, Toronto Arenas, and Ottawa Senators. It was just the second season for the fledgling NHL and what threatened the league’s operations wasn’t influenza, but legal actions and competing leagues. This was despite one player, Hamby Shore of the Senators, already having died from the pandemic in October.

Only 18 games of the planned 20-game season were played, but again, it wasn’t because of concerns due to the flu. The Arenas, who were the defending Stanley Cup champions, were a mess behind the scenes — their players didn’t have contracts and were being paid under the table and attendance for the struggling Arenas was abysmal — and officially withdrew from the league in February.

The Canadiens defeated the Senators for the NHL championship and travelled to Seattle to play the Pacific Coast Hockey Association champion Seattle Metropolitans. Worry over the flu pandemic had subsided to a certain extent. After all, it had been a full year since the first outbreak in the US.

In Seattle, the schools had reopened in January. By March, no influenza deaths were reported in the city. It seemed like the danger had largely passed, so why not play for the Stanley Cup?

Then, in Game 5, veteran defenceman Joe Hall collapsed on the ice. He was hospitalized with a temperature of 104 F. Players on both teams reported symptoms of the flu and, eventually, all but three of the Canadiens players were diagnosed.

The Canadiens tried to forfeit the Cup to Seattle, but the Metropolitans refused to win the Cup that way and the series was cancelled. Hall contracted pneumonia and passed away a few days after the final game was to be played.

What can the NHL learn from this experience? One important aspect is that they can’t let their guard down. It seemed like the worst had passed when the Canadiens travelled to Seattle, but that clearly wasn’t the case. That strain of the flu even came back for another wave in 1920.

The other aspect is how quickly the flu was able to spread through the entire Canadiens roster. The NHL can’t get back to playing before there are clear protocols for identifying who is carrying the COVID-19 virus and quarantining those affected. That can’t happen until tests are widespread and readily available to the general population.

Most importantly, the NHL needs to understand that this could take a long time. While medical science has taken leaps and bounds in the last century, there’s no guarantee that the COVID-19 pandemic will be dealt with any faster than that of the 1918 flu pandemic. Fortunately, the league appears to be taking this pandemic far more seriously than a century ago.

Big Numbers

7 Under the more progressive PCHA rules, which allowed forward passing in all zones of the ice, the Metropolitans dominated the Canadiens in 1919, scoring 7 goals in Games 1 and 3. The Canadiens won two games played under NHL rules, while Game 4 ended in a tie.

Stick-taps and Glove-drops

A tap of the stick to all the healthcare workers in Vancouver, British Columbia, and around the world that are on the frontlines of this pandemic. In a just world, you’d all be paid like professional hockey players.

A stick-tap to Vancouver residents who have taken to cheering for said health care workers every evening at 7 p.m. Without being able to cheer for the Canucks, you’ve chosen the right people to cheer on.

The 25-year-old Richmond native was part of a group that won 28 games and was ranked No. 12 in the nation.

“Our mentality has been that we can always be better and improve, we never reflected on our success as a team until the end of the season,” says Okino, as the COVID-19 pandemic forced the cancellation of the national playoffs.

Okino and the North Dakota school, in a one-game elimination tournament, would’ve had to win four games in five days.

“With 14 seniors and everything to lose, it would’ve been an exciting tournament,” he says.

Okino says as the playoffs got closer, the intensity heightened in the Division 1 action. Players put in extra to win the puck battle, or get the shot on net, and the physicality increases.

“Playoff hockey can bring out the best and worst of players, it’s a special moment to be in,” he says.

The six-foot-one, 200 pound defenceman closed out his collegiate career with a respectable season. He nearly reached 100 career points. He went into the campaign with personal goals to achieve, which included improving his defensive game. That goal resulted in the best plus/minus in his career at plus-seven. Okino improved all-round as a player.

“My shot is a bit harder and more accurate, hockey-sense has evolved,” he says. “I believe any of that comes with practice, and four years of that will help. As a person I’ve matured, gained experiences, made mistakes and tried to learn from them. Also, living in -40 winters will add a few layers of character.”

Four years of college hockey was great for Okino. It allowed him to keep playing hockey and earn a degree in information technology. Once he obtains his degree, he will move back home after seven years. His plan is to seek employment in IT, but also had interest in an officiating career. He also developed life-long friendships and reflects knowing how lucky he was every day to be there.

One of his memorable experiences with the Jimmies was playing in two outdoor games in 2019 and 2020. The most recent was against their rivals Minot State.

“There was a ton of snow which made it difficult to play, but added to the experience,” he says. “The event, Hockey Day in North Dakota, has been hosted by our campus. Both years we got to play outdoors right at school, in front of fellow students and family.”

Okino went to Jamestown, following three seasons (2013-16) with the Chase Heat of the Kootenay International Junior Hockey League. It was the first time being away from home. Okino says the KIJHL helped prepare him for living on his own.

“I think this was the best preparation, because nothing prepares you for it,” he says. “On the hockey spectrum, the number of games we played and how much we practiced (five times a week) definitely prepared me for the college level.”",[]

Last fall there was plenty of uncertainty if there was enough players to ice a team. Richmond Ringette reached out to Delta and between the two associations they had 11 skaters and a goalie.

The small roster was depleted even further at provincials with one player being ineligible to play and another being sidelined in game two with a concussion. Still, Richmond more than held its own — going 2-2 in round-robin play that included wins over Port Coquitlam (6-3) and Prince George (3-2).

A hard-fought 4-2 semi-final loss to eventual champion Kelowna set the stage for the bronze medal game where Richmond defeated Vernon 5-2.

“I know if we had all our players participating in this provincial championship we would’ve had a good chance to win. At the end we ran out of gas,” said proud head coach George Heinrich.

The team included: Alex Bauer, Elise Piovesan, Ellie Ehling, Jade Campbell, Keanna Boyle, Megan Heinrich (captain), Melissa Stevens, Nicole Sparrow (captain), Regan Burrows, Samy Friesen (captain), Sophie Sihoe and Jordan Williams (goalie).

It was back on March 16 Volleyball BC suspended all sanctioned programs and activities.

Three days later the organization cancelled the provincial championships that included the U18 and U17 age groups taking place April 17-19 at the Richmond Olympic Oval and Richmond Christian School.

""As the pandemic evolved it became clear that measures such as bans on large gatherings, social distancing and travel restrictions would continue through May and potentially beyond,"" said Mark Eckert, president and CEO of Volleyball Canada. ""This was a joint decision with our partner Edmonton Events, and although we are disappointed to have to cancel this year’s events, the welfare of participants and fans is our greatest concern at all times.”

The game was fast paced with the teams evenly matched. Richmond got a break midway through the second period to score the game’s only goal

The Ravens finished second in regular season play with a 10-6-1 record then went 5-2-1 in the round-robin playoff format to earn the opportunity to host the banner game at Minoru Arenas. The behind-the-bench duties this season were shared by Rob Jokai and Joel Marcoe after a mid-January coaching change.

The Ravens impressive run came without having a registered goaltender for the entire campaign. Backstopping was at times done by players putting on the goalie gear for regular season play, and for the playoffs, call-ups from Midget C2 and Bantam C1.

“We were very fortunate to be able to call-up goalies. For the playoffs, we had three, and they all played great. One of our goalies was Bantam rostered and Pee Wee aged Kimberly Ho. She played incredible, earning two shutouts during the playoffs,” Jokai stated.

Jaena McGarrigle stepped into the crease for one playoff game and for the final, Bantam aged ringette goalie Tayler Cohen was outstanding in earning the shutout.

The team was led up front by forwards Megan Jokai, Emma Dubnov, Kaylen Mullin, Sienna Scott, Ainsley Moniz, Ashley Schmidt, Claire Marcoe, Chloe Maher, Lauren Bradshaw and affiliate player Tamara Dee. On the blue line were Asha Virdee, Claire Kerr, Megan Heinrich and captain Paige Pfortmueller. Sidelined due to injuries were Ria Gill and Sophia Uppal.

“In the meantime, we encourage all children to find ways to keep working on your sport skills and physical fitness at home so that you are ready to hit the playing field when sport returns.”

The organization held its seventh annual Creating Community Champions benefit last month at the Hilton Vancouver Airport Hotel, raising $75,000 to help make sports more affordable for children.

The notion of establishing a framework to commercialize cannabis began as a promise by the Liberal Party in the 2015 federal election campaign that led to Justin Trudeau becoming prime minister. The implementation of the policy was not as smooth as first envisioned, and the provincial governments were put in charge of setting guidelines for the sale and consumption of marijuana.

article continues below

Research Co. and Glacier Media have been tracking perceptions about legalization every six months in British Columbia. Our latest survey shows that agreement with the new rules remains high across the entire province, that some residents are starting to ponder a future when other drugs could be treated in the same fashion as cannabis, and that – in stark contrast with what we found last year – marijuana users in British Columbia are starting to acquire all of their product through licensed retailers.

As more time passes, British Columbians appear happier with the decision to end prohibition. Seven in 10 of the province’s residents (70%) agree with marijuana being legal in Canada, while 26% disagree and 3% are undecided.

These findings represent a seven-point increase since a similar survey conducted in October 2019, as legal cannabis approached its first anniversary. The groups that are more likely to voice satisfaction with the new status quo are men (75%), British Columbians aged 35 to 54 (76%) and residents of northern B.C. (80%).

In recent weeks, we have seen more talk about creating a safe supply for drugs that are currently available only through illegal means. The impact of these discussions has led to a shift in the views of British Columbians about legalizing all drugs. It must be completely acknowledged that sizable majorities of the province’s residents continue to oppose a move to place any controlled substance inside a store, but the proponents of this option have grown since late last year.

At least two-thirds of British Columbians are opposed to legalizing ecstasy (66%), powder cocaine (70%), heroin (72%), crack cocaine (73%), methamphetamine or “crystal meth” (74%) and fentanyl (75%).

Support for making some of these drugs available in a fashion that would conceivably meet the same guidelines that govern cannabis has risen over the past six months, to 25% for cocaine (up from 18%) and to 24% for heroin (up from 19%). While these are still low proportions, the fluctuation could signal the start of a trend.

Just 10% of British Columbians say they only consumed marijuana after it became legal. Identical proportions of residents tried it before October 2018 (45%) or have never consumed it in Canada (also 45%). The incidence of “legal-only” marijuana users is highest among residents aged 18 to 34 (18%) and those who live in southern B.C. (19%).

But perhaps the biggest surprise, and a source of satisfaction for policy makers, is the way in which cannabis is being sought by users. Just over half of British Columbians who have consumed marijuana since legalization (51%) say that all of their product was acquired at a licensed retailer. In October 2019, only 31% of cannabis consumers in the province were getting all of their product at a licensed retailer.

We still see 16% of British Columbians who say none of their marijuana has been bought at a licensed retailer – a proportion that climbs to 25% among those aged 55 and over. Two-thirds of cannabis consumers aged 35 to 54 (68%) are buying all of their product at a licensed retailer.

Even though the delivery of cannabis products has improved over the past six months, there are significant regional differences that are indubitably related to the presence of stores in specific areas of the province. Cannabis consumers who reside in southern B.C. and Metro Vancouver are the most likely to be getting all of their product from licensed retailers (63% and 62%). The numbers are significantly lower in Vancouver Island (29%), northern B.C. (24%) and the Fraser Valley (19%).

Finally, the issue of “drug testing” remains a priority for British Columbians, with 61% saying that companies in the province should “definitely” or “probably” be able to administer these examinations to any employee now that marijuana is legal.

After a bumpy start that featured slow store openings and hitches with delivery options, there are signs that cannabis legalization is starting to work in a better fashion. More consumers are getting all of their product through licensed retailers, and the number of “new users” has not increased dramatically. Still, the significant regional disparities suggest that more marijuana outlets will need to be authorized in order to effectively eliminate the black market.

No example is better than the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks in the United States, which gave us the “Patriot Act” after just 45 days of deliberation to expand government surveillance of Americans to previously unimagined levels.

In mid-April, the actions of Gabriel Wortman led to the deaths of 22 people in Nova Scotia after multiple shootings and fires. Most Canadians, at the time still under lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, were horrified at Wortman’s actions, which included impersonating a police officer.

article continues below

It took the federal government only 13 days after Wortman’s criminal activity was evident for the entire country to announce a nationwide ban on 1,500 types of military-grade “assault-style” weapons in Canada. Any Canadian who possesses these firearms will have two years to get rid of them. The prohibition led to many new discussions about the role that firearms play in Canada’s urban and rural areas.

We know now that the perpetrator of the 22 murders in Nova Scotia had obtained his weapons illegally from Canadian and American sources. This was not a surprise for Canadian authorities, who have consistently reported that more than 70% of the weapons used in gun-related crimes in our country come from the United States.

On the issue of firearms, Canada is decidedly different from the United States. In Canada, it is not legal for a person to own or carry a firearm for the purpose of self defence against human beings. When Research Co. and Glacier Media asked Canadians about this key precept of Canadian law, more than three in four (77%) agreed with it, while 18% disagreed and 5% were undecided.

Atlantic Canada (31%), Saskatchewan and Manitoba (29%) and Alberta (24%) boast the highest number of residents who openly question Canada’s long-standing regulations for firearms. While higher than what is observed in Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia, these are not proportions of voters that would sway an election, certainly not in the way American statewide and congressional races can be tilted if your candidate can adequately hold a shotgun and recite the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution in a manner that panders to the base.

Fewer than one in five Canadians welcome the notion of citizens carrying firearms for something other than hunting or scaring wildlife away. Any survey measuring opinions on banning “assault-style” weapons would be met with near unanimity. The opposition reacted to the announced ban as it always has under its outgoing leader, by claiming the regulations would affect law-abiding Canadians. Lost in this unfortunate combination of inadequate polling and incapable opposition are the solutions that matter to Canadians.

In our survey, more than three in five Canadians (63%) told us that gun violence in Canada is a “very serious” or “moderately serious” problem – a proportion that climbs to 69% among women and 68% among those aged 55 and over.

Sizable majorities of Ontarians and British Columbians, who have experienced gang wars in urban areas, are more likely to look at gun violence as particularly problematic (76% and 67%, respectively). The COVID-19 pandemic did little to curb gun violence in Toronto, where 61 people were shot in the first four months of the year.

We asked Canadians about the effectiveness of four possible measures, and their responses outline a public that is ready for bold action. More than three in five Canadians (62%) think enacting a complete ban on handguns would be “very effective” or “moderately effective” in reducing gun violence in Canada. Most crimes, after all, are not being committed with the military-grade “assault-style” weapons that the federal government was quick to ban.

A higher proportion of Canadians deem two other measures as effective: imposing mandatory jail terms for crimes committed with firearms (74%) and introducing new outreach programs to steer youth away from gangs (also 74%).

Canadians place dealing with firearms smuggled from the United States as the most important issue that needs to be addressed. Many of the country’s residents also want to make sure gangs are not attractive to our country’s youth and believe mandatory minimum jail sentences would act as a deterrent.

Banning military-grade “assault-style” weapons is low-hanging fruit in a challenge that definitely has Canadians preoccupied and wishing for a type of government intervention that goes beyond a photo-op celebrated by poorly executed survey charity work.

True sociologists know that we learn nothing from posing the wrong questions to Canadians, and capable politicians should go beyond voicing displeasure with plans and proposals just because that is what they are expected to do. Meanwhile, Canadians are still worried about gun violence and expecting their elected officials to do better. •

But few end up partnering with the entrepreneurs and opening branches of their businesses with them.

That’s exactly what happened for Andrew Caras and his fiancé Ronalee Dumond, who were so blown away by the idea for a portable walk-in freezer cooler presented by two firefighters on the show, that they ended up reaching out to the entrepreneurs and launching a branch of their business.

Caras and Dumond are now the proud owners of Capital Cooler Rentals’ third location in Richmond (the other two are in Regina and Ottawa, with others pending). Servicing the Lower Mainland, their fleet of walk-in freezer coolers are available for hire to provide food and beverage storage for private and public outdoor events including music festivals, weddings, sports tournaments, and more. Capital Cooler Rentals also supports restaurants, hotels and cafes when the establishment’s own equipment breaks down or when they undergo renovations. Coolers are available for rent in daily, three-day, weekly, or monthly increments. They deliver an empty unit to a site, pickup after the event is done, then thoroughly clean them for the next client. The units are very quiet as they are completely electrical, using a standard 110-volt receptacle.

In this new venture with his partner, they are looking forward to providing their clients with the top-notch customer service. “(While working for any employer) I always provided the highest level of customer service which my customers always recognized, but few times by management,” he explains, “and now, this high-level of service will be recognized by all our clients, in a business WE own!”

Caras and Dumond are also excited about offering a unique product to their clients: Capital Coolers’ portable coolers are unlike any others available in Vancouver, bringing temperatures down to -12 degrees. “These are true restaurant grade, used in the food industry,” Caras explains. The coolers are especially helpful if a restaurant or hotel needs to preserve food when their systems break down during a renovation or even in the case of a natural disaster.

With the company’s support at the Vaisakhi Festival, booking at Steveston’s Salmon Day Festival and a lineup of tentative bookings supporting some of Vancouver’s most high-profile events, it’s safe to say Capital Coolers can expect their first summer in business to be a sizzling hot one, or in this case, pretty “COOL”.

Gingeri was opened in 2004. The restaurant’s name was inspired by a decorative accessory in ancient China called a “Jin Ru Yi” which was worn over the wrist by wealthy people to indicate status and wealth. The word means good fortune and the fulfillment of wishes.

Whether you come in for a mid-shopping-spree lunch or for a celebratory dinner, Gingeri Restaurant has dishes to suit every craving and occasion. It is best-known for its variety of choices of Dim Sum, including traditional style Har Gow, Shao Mai, spring rolls, steamed BBQ Pork Buns, as well as signature creative Dim Sum items such as shrimp salad tarts with gold flakes.

The pièce de resistance are the restaurant’s three signature dishes: Sautéed Crab, eggplants and minced pork with spicy sauce, and Braised Whole Duck stuffed with Glutinous Rice.

All of these delicacies, and more, can be enjoyed in one of Gingeri’s main dining room and two private dining rooms, which cater up to 250 guests. 16-foot ceilings add to the cozy and upscale vibe of the restaurant, which also includes a karaoke system.

Today, the cannery is a historical site, no longer a thriving business, but local food production is still an important part of the Steveston community.

“Steveston Farmers & Artisans Market is operated by the Richmond Agricultural & Industrial Society,” says Executive Director, Janice Froese. “The RAIS also puts on the Steveston Salmon Festival. Both events pay homage to our local heritage of living off the land instead of grocery stores.”

The Salmon Festival and the Farmers & Artisans Market are both non-profit organizations, so any profit is donated back to the Steveston Community Society. The SCS, in partnership with The City of Richmond, uses those funds to create community initiatives like the Educational Garden and to build community projects like the water park.

Future projects include renovating the playground.

“Last year, I was watering the educational garden and I looked up to see a woman sitting on a bench in the middle of the garden, reading a book,” says Janice. “Then a family pulled into the parking lot, brought out a blanket and a pizza, and had a picnic on the lawn. That’s what initiatives like the garden are all about: community gathering places that bring us together.”

The Steveston Martial Arts Centre is a world-renowned Kendo dojo, located beside the outdoor pool. Classes are held both within the dojo and at the community centre. With the parking lot hosting the Steveston Farmers & Artisans Market two Sundays a month between May and October, the area is bustling.

“Healthy communities foster a healthier lifestyle,” says Steveston Farmers & Artisans Market Committee Chair, Johanna Stewart. “The new location of the market is perfect because both the vendors and the community centre, with the outdoor pool and the dojo, all promote healthy living. Of course, none of it would be possible without The City of Richmond and the RAIS.”

With produce, meats, cheeses, delicious baked goods, adult beverages, and a variety of household wares made by local farmers and craftsmen, the Steveston Farmers & Artisans Market brings Richmond and surrounding communities back to the simplicity of community togetherness. And that’s the best kind of local heritage there is.

The Steveston Farmers & Artisans Market is located in the parking lot of the Steveston Community Centre biweekly between the months of May and October, from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. You can also connect with the market through Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr, or Pinterest.

Yes, figuring out figures is important. But possessing the confidence to reach out and learn is also an important factor.

That’s the approach Mathnasium, billed as the world’s premier after-school mathematics program, strives to accomplish.

“If there are gaps in a student’s fundamental knowledge, we can fill them in so they can challenge the next topics ahead,” explains Tony Colabella who owns and runs the Richmond location of Mathnasium. “Plus, we’re not just a tutor. We help students understand, not just memorize things.”

A major aspect of that is establishing clear and easy to follow lines of communication between teacher and student.

“I don’t care if my teachers have a 4.0 as a math major. If they can’t communicate with these kids in a few different ways, they will stare back at them in the same way they do with their school teachers,” he says. “Our teachers have to find alternate ways to explain concepts that make sense to the students. And we can show them in different methods, whether it’s visual or tactile, so they can bring it all together.”

The one-on-one attention at Mathnasium also allows students to feel comfortable asking questions.

“And the nice thing about math is that once you do figure a problem out one way, the other ways also start making sense,” Colabella says. “We see that often when the kids say, ‘Oh, why didn’t my teacher just say that? This is easy.’”

That “lightbulb” moment is key and also helps the student develop confidence to tackle other, tougher challenges, not just in math.

“Often, we hear from parents that their child’s grades have not only gone up in math, but their other subjects, too, because they are confident and willing to try new and learn new concepts,” he says.

And that’s a satisfying moment for everyone at Mathnasium.

“It’s rewarding when you see a kid, who believed they were not good in math, come in and tell us they got an A in their last math quiz and want to try and solve more math problems with us,” he says. “That’s when I go home and say it was a good day, we got through to them.”

Customers can try the unique birthday cakes from the Boss Bakery at Blundell Centre. The key is the special dough, said Richie Lai, who helps runs the family-owned bakery.

“The cake, it’s very light, not heavy at all,” Richie said, “It’s soft and not too sweet, either.”

The style is typical of a traditional Asian bakery, which goes back to the Boss Bakery’s roots in Hong Kong. That’s where Richie’s brother, Jason, learned the trade and then brought his expertise to Canada when the family moved here in 1977.

“Jason, he’s the hands-on guy,” Richie said, adding that complementing the not-too-sweet cake is the variety of tasty layers customers can choose.

“Some people like to have fruit cocktail sandwiched in between. You can also have mango, which is really delicious,” Richie said. “And there’s always chocolate or coffee, instead.”

A sure sign the cakes are a hit is the amount of repeat business the bakery gets.

“Customers come in, order one for the first time and they keep coming back, ordering for another special occasion.”

“It’s really catching on,” Richie said.

While the birthday sponge cake is not overly sweet, the opposite goes for the sweet buns at the Boss Bakery, where one of the favourites comes filled with coconut.

But for those craving something a little more savoury, the bakery also has traditional style, barbecue pork and curried beef buns.

All in all, the choices at the Boss Bakery can please just about any taste.

“We enjoy providing a good variety to our customers,” Richie said, adding the bakery’s reputation has grown over the years, something that’s in keeping with the name of the business.

But if you were wondering if it had something to do with a celebrity TV baker, think again. “It was Jason’s idea. It’s more the translation of a Chinese name, not a TV show,” Richie laughed, adding the name is derived from Tai Pan.

“In Hong Kong, there are a lot of businesses that use Tai Pan, which means you are the boss, a recognized person in the community. “And when we please a customer, we like to think we’ve accomplished that standing,” Richie said.

The annual Steveston Salmon Festival has been a staple of the Steveston village in Richmond since 1945. The village of Steveston predates even the city of Vancouver, and has a heritage rich in the bountiful resources of Canada and the unique beauty of our land.



Every year, the Steveston Salmon Festival brings residents and visitors alike to embrace our unique culture and rejoice in what it means to be Canadian.



This year, like every year, the festival will take place on Canada Day and will begin at 6:30 am with a pancake breakfast. Followed by breakfast, the kids bike parade starts at 9:30 am and then the massive Canada Day parade at 10:00 am.



The parade will wind itself through the historic village of Steveston and will include floats, bands, celebrities, politicians, community groups, vintage vehicles and more. The festival officially kicks off at the opening ceremonies on the main stage at noon with dignitaries, speeches and the singing of “O Canada.”



After the opening, the day fills with entertainment all afternoon on two stages. Attractions include the Japanese cultural show, trade show, horticultural show, artisan gallery, car show, food festival, and children’s festival. Finally, a local favourite pie and ice cream parlour for refreshments.



In 2017, the festival added a popular food truck element that brings together many unique flavours of B.C. in a fun and bustling environment.



But, the main attraction, as always, is the famous salmon barbeque where over 1200 pounds of wild salmon filets are grilled over open fire pits. The popular treat sells out every year and goes for $16 per plate.



No matter who you are or where you come from, the salmon festival holds a special message for all and that is a boisterous pride in history, environment, and culture. If you are new, returning, or just want to get a taste of what Steveston has to offer, come get outside and celebrate this year’s Steveston Salmon Festival!

Pavel Lalev, who is the company’s Administrative and Development Manager, says that most people don't realize the impact that their shopping habits have on the planet, and for that reason, he is proud of the work his company does. ""I think it's a big social benefit, to have companies like ours. Otherwise, clothing recycling is not a current priority to governments. It's up to the private sector to pick up this slack.""

Lalev adds that in a given year, up to six percent of household waste is textiles – cheaply made clothing purchased from retailers who are making it out of cotton and plastic blends. ""Imagine what that adds to a landfill,"" he says. ""Our work is diverting textile waste from landfills.""

Lalev says that while clothing collection fluctuates, one thing their business can always count on is seasonal clean ups.

""Spring cleaning is huge for us,"" he notes. ""But in a given year, we still collect about 1200 tonnes of textiles, with 200 bins all over the Lower Mainland and greater Victoria area."" He adds that 90 percent of what people deem no longer suitable for their closets is resellable. About 15-20% of items in better condition are sold in North America. Otherwise, the items are shipped to Africa, Asia or South America to countries with vast populations of less fortunate individuals, where they are sold for highly affordable rates.

""The rest goes to rags, and for purposes such as stuffing for car seat insulation."" Lalev also adds that many of the collected clothes have a lot of plastic in them, and are hard to upcycle or recycle. He says that he is proud of the work his company does, not only because items are being diverted from landfills, but because ""less affluent people can't afford new clothes, and this helps them out."" He adds that regardless if the company makes a profit in a given month it still donates a flat amount to their local charity partners, the Boys & Girls Club of South Coast BC and the BC Yukon Branch of the Royal Canadian Legion.

""It's nice,"" Lalev says, ""to do work that helps people.""

Sometimes, they can be, but the benefits of the bank vs. mortgage brokers is often misunderstood.

article continues below

A mortgage broker, like Jeff Evans with Canada Innovative Financial Mortgage Architects, can provide a wider array of lending options for a better financial fit.

“A lot of times people are drawn by the brand name and recognition of the big banks, the ease of walking through their front door and talking to someone about their mortgage products,” Evans says. “It’s a standard thing. People seem to think of the banks first, rather than a mortgage broker.”

But when clients realize what mortgage brokers can offer they are surprised.

“I often have the ability to make things happen that their bank is unable or unwilling to do,” Evans says.

Part of that comes from a broker’s ability to tap into a wide variety of lenders, which also includes some banks.

“We have prime lenders, non-prime lenders, private lenders, all of whom can work well for the client’s individual circumstances,” he says. “I try to provide my service as a value add. I’m not just a rate supermarket that clients come to and ask, ‘What’s your best rate?’”

Brokers like Evans work with the client to ensure they have terms that best match their situation, such as a fair mortgage payout penalty.

“Most of my lenders have a way of calculating a penalty on a fixed rate mortgage that is fair and reasonable,” Evans says. “Basically, all the chartered banks and some credit unions calculate what’s called an interest rate differential penalty in such a way the client gets gouged quite badly if they pay out their mortgage before the maturity date.”

Brokers also work hard to assess their client’s personal financial picture when sourcing mortgage options.

“I look at their financial circumstances in great detail to try and structure things that give them options. Most often, a bank agent won’t dig any deeper than what they have to do to get an approval,” Evans says, adding he can take into account a variety of scenarios, including the potential extra revenue stream of a secondary suite on a property to help increase the loan amount.

Child tax benefits are another possible factor.

“Many of my lenders support it, because that can potentially add several thousands of dollars to someone’s income, which could mean the difference between getting financing for the new home or not,” Evans says. “I don’t know if they even ask that question at the banks. ”

Evans stresses he uses all the tools at his disposal as a mortgage broker to create a solution traditional financial institutions sometimes can’t.

Kids enrolled in a CSF school spend their days learning and living in French. But what happens when they come home?

Speaking a minority language in a community where everyone else speaks English is not easy.

article continues below

""We encourage all our students and their parents to speak French as often as possible,"" says Réjean Gosselin, Principal of l'école des Naviagateurs, a CSF elementary school in Richmond. ""But you can't force it. It's best to make it fun and use encouragement and rewards. Don't make them feel that it's bad to speak English. Teach them to enjoy and celebrate both languages.”

“Being bilingual is a gift that will help them in the future.""

Here are a few tips from CSF to support your child learning French while navigating life in a predominately English-speaking community:

· Make French a priority: If you're a francophone yourself, make speaking French at home part of your daily life – not a chore to be associated only with homework. For French immersion parents, consider learning French along with your child. You can even practice together.

· Play in French: Kids of all ages love to play games. Consider playing board or computer games, such as Scrabble, in French. Check with the school or local library for a French version of popular games such as Monopoly. Online games can be played with people from all over the world; encourage your teenager to play with French-speaking participants.

· Watch & Listen in French: Tune the television into a French channel; pick a French film; listen to the news on Radio-Canada together. Or watch out for a CSF school play production in your community!

· Enroll in French clubs: Check with your CSF school or local library for French-speaking clubs or activities, such as sports or hobbies, in your community. If you don't find one, consider starting a group and encouraging your child's French-speaking or French-learning friends to join.

· Travel in French: Book your next holiday in a French-speaking destination. There are 40 countries in the world where French is an official language. Want to stay in Canada? Take a trip to Québec or New Brunswick.

· Don't forget the grandparents: If your child has French-speaking grandparents, make sure they're involved. Even if they live far away, they can Skype or Facetime with their grandchild. Grandparents have interesting stories to tell and are usually eager to share their lives and heritage.

Make sure French is part of your child's out-of-school activities and you will be supporting them to be fully bilingual for the rest of their life.

Often, clients are so distracted while talking to him that they don’t even notice how much exercise they’re doing, he says.

Listening to clients and creating a strong bond with them is a big part of what makes him such a successful trainer. In fact, Dhillon has been voted Richmond’s Best Personal Trainer by readers of the Richmond News for six years.

“I think it gives me credibility,” he says, adding his success is due to positive word-of-mouth and awards he’s won. “All of that is based on the credibility I got in my own community of Richmond.”

Dhillon, who is certified by the National Strength and Conditioning Association, became a personal trainer after being a private investigator for 10 years. He had also been bodybuilding for about a decade.

“Once I decided to leave the private investigator field, it was a natural transition to go into training, because people were always asking me for help and advice all the time anyway,” he says. “So what I did was, before I made the transition, I let a bunch of people in the Richmond area know that I was going to take on clients.”

He started out working in another gym but within a year, it was sold, he says, and he had to open his own studio much earlier than he planned.

Now, he’s one of the busiest personal trainers in the city.

“Looking back now, it was a huge blessing,” Dhillon says. “Just like anyone else I started with one client, and now six years into it I have my own studio and five employees, and here we are.”

""I explain to them that due to everything being freshly made, I can't store ingredients indefinitely in the fridge, so we make the most popular dishes. Also, if a dish requires some sort of colouring and we can't make the colouring from natural sources, we don't put the dish on the menu.""

Bob will be releasing details about Ginger Indian Cuisine’s four-year celebration closer to the time, but customers – both new and old – can be sure the food will be worth the wait.

And what if you’re a start-up looking for space that allows you to put your financial focus on developing new ideas instead of costly rents?

HyCity Hub in Richmond has opened a shared workspace that is ideal for companies that require office space for three to five people, as well as meeting and event facilities. The spaces can be rented by the day or leased by the month.

The company’s long-established roots in Hong Kong and Shenzhen also make it uniquely positioned to be a conductor between both sides of the Pacific Ocean.

“We provide entrepreneurs with the necessary resources to better understand the Chinese market and what it takes to do well,” says owner Victoir Wu. “Because of our strong, existing connection in Asia, we’ve already worked with municipalities and have connections with local governments and industries.”

Wu launched HyCity Hub in September 2019 and has already hosted a highly successful one-week China Innovation and Investment Tour that coincided with the China High-Tech Fair in Shenzhen. The tour gave innovative Canadian companies the opportunity to experience the Chinese market and meet with government officials. It also provided them with booth space at the tech fair to showcase their products.

HyCity Hub offers ongoing consulting services that include business registration and legal advice, market analysis and strategy development, access to financing and funding, project management and public relations.

On January 16, the City of Richmond Economic Development will be hosting one of its Entrepreneur’s Toolkit seminars at HyCity Hub. Industry experts will discuss commercialization, go-to-market strategy, IP protection, and other topics to help businesses prepare for funding and growth. Details and registration can be found here.

When it comes to its shared workspace rentals, the facilities are conveniently located at HyCity Hub’s headquarters at 13986 Cambie Road near No. 6 Road. By locating outside of Vancouver’s expensive downtown district, in a building the family owns, HyCity Hub can offer lower rental rates.

“Richmond has been an industrial and agricultural centre for decades,” Wu says. “We’re creating a start-up ecosystem to attract younger demographics to the city.”

Alongside the fun, the friends and the newfound skills - there are also a whole host of developmental benefits your child can enjoy by signing up for a program of classes.

To find out more, we asked Lisa Oppenheim from Lights Up Musical Theatre to give us the lowdown on five of the most common benefits children in the Lower Mainland can enjoy by enrolling in arts education classes.

article continues below

1 - Creative thinking

Arts education classes like those offered by Lights Up Musical Theatre teach children how to adapt to new situations and think outside the box. Drama, for example, is great for unleashing kids’ imagination, encouraging them to think on their feet and develop the cognitive skills that will help them in later life.

2 - Academic performance

There has been plenty of research that’s proven that children who are actively involved in the arts enjoy an improved academic performance. Arts education in fields such as music and drama give children a new outlet to exercise their brains in a fun, fulfilling environment.

3 - Focus

Whether a child is memorizing lines for a play, the words for a song or the choreography of a dance routine - they are engaging their brains and developing the kind of focus that they will need to succeed in both education and employment later in life.

4 - Grit

In rehearsing for a performance, students are required to work towards a goal over an extended period of time, and meet challenges along the way. This is the element that will allow students to transform their innate talents into meaningful achievement throughout their lives.

5 - Social skills

Creating any kind of performance is a group effort. Students must learn to collaborate with their ensemble members and share the spotlight with their cast-mates. This not only helps develop teamwork skills but also social confidence.

With enthusiastic expert instructors and locations across the Lower Mainland, including right here in Richmond, Lights Up runs a range of weekly classes for children and teens aged between three and 18 years old.

The 15-year-old sharpshooter was in the line-up in a 4-3 overtime win over Prince George at Prospera Place. It was one of five games he was eligible to play in as an underage player after being the Rockets’ first round pick — 18th overall — in last May’s WHL Bantam Draft.

Wong has opted to go the major junior route after initially making a verbal agreement to play at the NCAA Division One level at the University of Denver. That would have meant a stint in the B.C. Junior Hockey League before heading south.

“We are thrilled that Trevor and his family have decided to commit to the Kelowna Rockets and the Western Hockey League,” said Rockets general manager Bruce Hamilton. “I congratulate our scouts, for selecting Trevor in last year’s Bantam Draft. He is truly a special player and even better young man, we look forward to watching his career unfold. ”

The 5-foot-8 135-pound speedster has 11 points, including four goals, with the Canadians so far in 10 regular season games.

Last season he recorded 64 goals and 77 assists for 141 points in just 30 games with St. George’s School Bantam Varsity academy team. He also added five goals and 18 assists in five post-season games.

“It’s an exciting moment for me. I’ve thought about this decision really hard, and I’m happy to be a Rocket,” said Wong. “When I came to training camp in the summer, I was here for about a week and loved everything about Kelowna.

The team was finalized following a four-day camp at UBC earlier month, culminating an extensive tryout process that began with regional camps in the spring.

Chan has made Team B.C. for the third consecutive year. The Grade 11 student at the Delta Hockey Academy helped B.C. win bronze at the 2017 nationals, as well as the Canada Winter Games last March in Red Deer. The high-scoring forward is in her second season with the DHA Girls Prep team.

Wong helped the Richmond Ravens capture the Midget “A” provincial championship last spring and is the lone player on the Team B.C. roster that plays for a minor hockey association. The Grade 11 student at Steveston-London Secondary made the team as forward despite spending almost her entire career on the blueline.

She has also made the transition up front as a key returning member of the Ravens, under coach AJ Sander.

“We look forward to continuing the recent success of Team BC with this group of talented players,” commented BC Hockey Chief Executive Officer, Barry Petrachenko. “The preparations by this group of athletes, coaches and team staff have been outstanding and we are excited to have them represent BC at the National Women's U18 Hockey Championship.”

The amateur soccer club held a virtual EGM Monday evening to herald a new dawn which will see the organization open its doors beyond its previously female-only membership.

article continues below

Although it’s not official, the Richmond News understands the club’s new name will be “Richmond United,” with the legalities still to be finalized.

The club’s acting president, Marty Mueller, told the News that this was a “pretty exciting time” for the organization and “an exciting time for soccer in Richmond.”

Asked about the club opening its doors to male players and teams, as well as female, Mueller said the “purpose was a little bit deeper than that.”

“It was to provide an environment committed to inclusiveness really. One that welcomes all players of abilities and identities.

“When you’re called Richmond Girls, that’s pretty gender specific. (The inclusiveness) was the main motivation behind the change.”

Mueller said the now former RSGA board had been talking about the change for more than a year.

“I’m very proud of the board of directors, as we’ve worked very hard on this,” said Mueller, adding that the official release of the new name and constitution should come out “any day.”

The sea change in focus would now appear to put the club in direct competition with Richmond FC, a previously boys-only environment which started offering girls programs earlier this year.

However, Mueller said that is not the focus of his organization, saying only that the aforementioned “inclusivity” was top of their agenda.

“We’ve been fielding questions from parents that their kids don’t fit into pigeon hole genders and they’re asking, ‘what do you have for my child?’ explained Mueller.

“So that’s what we’re addressing and that’s what we’re about. We’re not interested in competing with anyone.”

The News understands there had been talks recently between the two organizations about a possible merger, without anything coming to fruition.

“There’s been talk for a long time and we’re open to continue to talk,” said Muller, when asked about previous merger conversations. “It’s always an open door.”

Suggestions of competing clubs and mergers aside, Mueller said the new club is eager to bring in “all kids, all cultures and all identities to play soccer.

“I think we’re on the cutting edge of that right now in Richmond and I’m really proud of that.”

The News reported in February how Richmond FC was launching its girls’ soccer program this year with former Team Canada coach Even Pellerud in a leadership position.

Pellerud is one of the biggest names in the world of women’s soccer with Richmond FC calling him ""women's soccer royalty.""

He is serving as new head of coaching and education where he’s mentoring club coaching staff and helping to design the women’s program.

For decades, the world of minor hockey in Richmond had two competing organizations – Richmond Minor and Seafair – until they finally merged in 2018 to form Richmond Jets.",[]

So it’s just as well Richmond’s Zach Besler – a player/coach at UBC’s junior varsity baseball team who’s just about to graduate in kinesiology – is one extremely motivated individual, who thrives on setting short- and long-term goals.

article continues below

But if you think for a second the McRoberts secondary alumnus has had an easy passage through life, you’d be wrong.

In 2015, in his final high school year, Besler looked well on his way to achieving his bucket list of being a kinesiologist and playing baseball at UBC – dreams first penned on a poster in Grade 7.

However, his hip suddenly gave out while sprinting to first base when playing for Richmond City Chuckers. He had torn his gluteus medius and couldn't walk for a few days.

But he wrapped it up in a tensor bandage and tried to play out the remaining five weeks of the season, ultimately causing more damage to the surrounding muscles. That was it for baseball.

Besler did get into kinesiology at UBC, but underwent two and a half years of physical rehab and setbacks and, instead, channeled his energy into volunteer leadership activities at the school, while learning about injury prevention.

Zach Besler taps into his life experiences to help athletes in his role as a strength and conditioning at UBC. Photo submitted

He then became a strength and conditioning coach with the junior varsity baseball program and, by late 2017, his body was working again.

Besler, though, was driving himself so hard with school and volunteering that he got super sick (mono, tonsillitis, sinus infection) and was out for another six weeks.

Undeterred, when he was healthy again, he kept pushing himself to the limit through 2018 but ended up in hospital after an anxiety attack.

However, last spring, while training a group of elite Grade 11 and 12 players out at UBC, his batting practice caught the eye of people from UBC’s junior varsity (JV) program.

Only then, as a player/coach for the JV team last fall and in his senior year, had Besler finally checked the second box on his bucket list.

“It was tough. But for me, having not played for the first few years (at UBC) and then getting to play at all was a great experience,” Besler told the Richmond News.

“I took it as being one of my childhood dreams being accomplished. I was able to pitch, I was able to start a game. I even played some outfield and coached.”

Besler puts a lot of his determination down to his parents, who’ve instilled a work ethic in him that he sometimes takes to the limit and beyond.

“I’ve had health issues with over-working. Mom always says I have to take care of myself,” said Besler.

“But I try to life my life through the golden rule of treating others the way you wish to be treated. I think everyone needs to be treated really, really well. If I have skills to help achieve that, then that’s good.”

And when asked if he had any advice for younger athletes and students facing obstacles when trying to achieve goals, Besler steered them to the “David Goggins approach,” referring to a navy seal-turned ultra-athlete.

“There are different ways to look at obstacles. You can look at it as something you have to overcome or as an opportunity for success,” he said.

“Sometimes you have challenges and those can be opportunities to showcase your skills. Health challenges are obviously different. So it can be about finding the energy to get over it because of how challenging it is.

“You take all the potential negative energy and flip it around and fire it up into positive energy.”

Ironically, the pandemic cut short Besler’s twilight university baseball career but, true to form, he’s got no less than four strength and/or conditioning coaching roles lined up for the fall at UBC as he gets set to study for his masters.

“This is a very natural next step (coaching),” said Besler, who will be researching visual anticipation in his masters, trying to help athletes’ readiness skills, based on what their opponents do.

“The (visual anticipation) is an important skill to develop, especially now when we don’t have access to game competition. Getting the reads on the play, for example.

“There is a little bit of research on this for court sports, such as volleyball and tennis. Baseball has some apps, but they haven’t been validated.”",[]

Financial Services Authority (BCFSA) said June 16.

“The current state of the strata insurance market is unhealthy,” said authority vice-president and deputy superintendent for regulation Frank Chong.

Minister of Finance Carole James said rising condo and apartment building costs are serious issues for thousands of British Columbians.

“This is especially true with many people facing additional financial pressure related to the COVID-19 pandemic,” she said. “We knew this was a complex issue, and now we have a clearer picture of the different local, national and global factors affecting cost and availability within the insurance market.”

Among key report findings, based on a survey of 6,000 strata and townhouse properties, are:

• an average increase of 40% year-over-year to strata insurance premiums province-wide;

• a 50% increase in Metro Vancouver;

• 54% of strata properties experienced a premium increase of less than 30% compared to premiums the previous year;

• 31% of strata properties saw increases in the 30-50 % range;

• 9% faced year-over-year increases of 50 -100%; and

• 6% saw increases in excess of 100% compared to the previous year.

“Price pressures will continue,” the authority said in the report to James. “Buildings considered to be higher risk are expected to face the most significant increases as well as the possibility of not being able to obtain full, or in rare cases any, insurance coverage.""

The data is in an interim report done at the direction of the provincial government. Further findings will be released in the fall after continued stakeholder consultations, Chong said.

The authority regulates the province’s insurance industry, among other things.

CEO Blair Morrison said the market is failing to meet goals of sustainability, affordability and availability.

“Despite large increases already being felt, the situation has not yet stabilized, meaning many stratas, particularly those in buildings considered to be higher risk by insurers, can expect to face further pricing pressures as well as the risk of not being able to obtain full strata property insurance coverage,” Morrison said.

The industry generates about $300 million in premiums, covering more than $100 billion of insured property value. Coverage is mandatory under B.C.’s Strata Property Act, the authority told James.

Insurance under the act, which must provide full replacement value of the common strata property and assets, does not cover individual unit insurance, which owners need to ensure under individual policies.

The authority said earthquake coverage is not required under the act, but it is often included in strata property coverage.

“Strata corporations that choose not to purchase earthquake coverage are still covered for fire damage following an earthquake,” the authority told James. “An estimated 1.5 million residents live in strata properties in BC and properties can range from under $1 million to over $200 million in insured value.”

The investigation found evidence showing the industry has been incurring losses over the past three years from mostly minor claims, particularly from water damage, due to poor building maintenance.

“The data suggests that strata insurance has also been used to fill in the gaps left by other forms of protection such as home warranties for new buildings and maintenance programs for older buildings,” the authority said.

Further complicating things is the exposure to risk insurers have to earthquake damages in B.C. which has prompted many to reduce the amount of insurance they offer, the study found.

“With this reduction in capacity comes upward price pressures,” the authority said.

“It’s clear there is no quick fix for this problem,” James said. “It’s important to recognize that the dynamics driving these increases are playing out in the private insurance industry – government does not set insurance rates or regulate pricing.”

She said the government is reviewing the report and will be bringing in legislation this summer as a first step to help tackle this problem, while the authority continues its engagement with the sector.

While legislation details won’t be released before being introduced in the Legislature, Liberal Party Opposition Leader Andrew Wilkinson has called on James to take action.

“Skyrocketing strata insurance costs represent one more unexpected hit to the wallets of British Columbians, with a growing number truly at risk of losing their homes. Action by your government is needed now,” Wilkinson said in a June 16 letter to James.

Wilkinson suggested the following actions be taken:

• implementation of a temporary tax holiday on the 4.4% Insurance Premium Tax applicable on strata property to leave money in the pockets of strata owners;

• Extension on a temporary basis the Property Tax Deferment Program to enable strata owners facing extraordinary additional expenses to defer a portion of their property taxes;

• changes to Strata Property Act and regulations that ensure annual contributions are made to a strata corporation’s consolidated revenue fund at levels acceptable considering a building’s age, claims history and other unique circumstances;

• require strata corporations to have a depreciation report detailing necessary maintenance every year;

• require a strata corporation to inform owners and tenants of any material change in insurance coverage, including an increase in any deductible, as soon as feasible;

• develop a mandatory education and training program for strata council members, with particular emphasis on risk mitigation;

• review the B.C. Building Code and implement new requirements focused on the prevention and severity of water damage events, and;

• require the B.C. Financial Services Authority to make public the data and information it is gathering from insurance companies to better understand the current climate of rapidly rising strata insurance.

Condominium Home Owners' Association of B.C. CEO Tony Gioventu in March warned that uninsured condo owners could find themselves bankrupt and homeless if they didn’t maintain suites and personal insurance as strata insurance costs skyrocket.

Birds Nest Properties handles condo and townhouse rentals in Vancouver, Burnaby and Richmond. Director Alvin Cheung said the situation is putting pressures on both strata corporations and individual owners.

Cheung said some buildings have seen deductibles rise from $250,000 to $750,000, situations that have led to special levies for unit owners.

“What if all the owners can’t pay the special levy? What happens then?” he asked.

That could lead to cases of buildings not triggering their insurance leaving owners to pay for repairs or upkeep just not being done.

“It would be a neglected building,” he said.

And that could cause future insurance coverage problems, he agreed.

As well, Cheung said, landlords have seen their landlord insurance premiums leap, in some cases from $500 to $4,000 a year.

But we also need to be safe, especially seniors.

How can we be safe, but not lonely and isolated?

British Columbia has been touted as a model of how to limit the spread of the novel coronavirus. In Metro Vancouver, the city of Richmond had the lowest number of Covid-19 cases. And, throughout the entire province, none of the deaths from the virus were in independent senior living communities.

“Seniors, our pioneers, did the groundwork for what we enjoy today. We want to keep everyone active and healthy,” says Rob Howard, the president of New Coast Lifestyles.

New Coast Lifestyles is in the final stages of opening Hamilton High Street, a resort-inspired development for seniors in one of Richmond’s up-and-coming neighbourhoods.

The development’s 30 condos sold out in just 11 days. There is still availability for some of the 100 rental units which combine independent living with full access to amenities such as a restaurant and bistro, fireplace lounge, pool, spa, barber shop and creative arts centre. Depending on your suite, you can cook in your apartment, make a reservation any time you want in the restaurant or have food delivered to your door. It’s all about having choices.

Round-the-clock personal care services are also available.

“You can move in when you’re totally independent but as you age and your needs change, we will be there to provide services,” Howard says.

“Seniors won’t feel isolated,” he adds. “Our central location lets seniors continue to feel part of the community and also allows us to bring the community into the building.”

Starting in early summer 2020, people can schedule a tour. All staff have been trained in health and safety procedures and every effort is being taken to keep people safe during all stages of the transition.",[]

A new development is an opportunity for more than just getting into the real estate game. Often, new apartment and townhouse complexes are being built with more than housing in mind – in many cases there’s also a community focus. In addition, on many occasions new owners have the opportunity to add bespoke touches. Some developers offer different floorplans or let you choose unique finishes.

Although there’s much to be said about buying a new development as an investment – the real investment is in your future. A home where you can create new memories, a place you can fill with friends and family, and feel a sense of comfort every time you walk in the door.

But it seems like every other block has a new apartment or townhouse complex being built. How can you find one that combines quality and integrity with the lifestyle and community you’re looking for?

They were also 63% lower than the 10-year sales average for the month - a direct result, said the board, of social distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

“Predictably, the number of home sales and listings declined in April given the physical distancing measures in place,” Colette Gerber, REBGV’s president-elect said. “People are, however, adapting.”

According to Gerber, this adaptation is coming in the form of “using different technology to showcase homes virtually, assess neighbourhood amenities with their clients and handle paperwork electronically.”

Across the region, 1,109 homes changed hands last month. This is a 39.4% drop year-over-year and a 56.1% decline compared with March 2020.

The number of new listings for all residential property types was 2,313 in April, which is a 59.7% drop compared with April 2019 and a 47.9% decline compared with March 2020, when 4.436 homes were listed.

The benchmark price for all homes across the region is $1,036,000, which is 2.5% higher than it was one year prior.

“Home prices have held relatively steady in our region since the COVID-19 situation worsened in March,” Gerber said.

A total of 388 detached homes sold in April, which is 33.8% lower than the 586 homes of this type sold in April 2019. The benchmark price for detached homes is $1,462,100 - up 2.3% year-over-year.

In April 2020, 503 apartments were sold, which is 43.2% lower than the 885 homes sold in the same month last year. The benchmark price for apartments is $685,500, up 2.7% from April 2019.

For attached homes, sales reached 218 - a 39.1% decline year-over-year. The benchmark price was $796,800 - up 2.8% compared with the same month last year.

REBGV data includes sales and prices for Vancouver, West Vancouver, North Vancouver, Burnaby, New Westminster, Coquitlam, Port Coquitlam, Richmond, Port Moody, the Sunshine Coast, Whistler, Squamish, Pitt Meadows, Maple Ridge and South Delta. It does not include Langley or Surrey.

However, the vast majority of those transactions were in the first half of the month, and many of those deals reflect pre-pandemic buying activity, due to the reporting lag.

“The first two weeks of the month were the busiest days of the year for our region, with heightened demand and multiple offers becoming more common,” said Ashley Smith, REBGV president. “Like other aspects of our lives, this changed as concerns over the COVID-19 situation in our province grew.”

REBGV said April 2 that residential sales on the region’s MLS averaged 138 per day during the first ten business days of March, and 93 during the final ten business days of the month.

“Many of the sales recorded in March were in process before the provincial government declared a state of emergency. We’ll need more time to pass to fully understand the impact that the pandemic is having on the housing market,” Smith added.

Story continues below

Kevin Skipworth, a realtor with Dexter Realty, said, “This month’s numbers for Greater Vancouver are a tale of what could have been, not so much what will be… There is a time lag between when the contract is written and when it is reported. A degree of [March’s] activity came from transactions that were initiated prior to the increased attention to COVID-19.”

Cameron McNeill, partner and executive director at real estate marketing firm MLA, predicted that the market would see a hiatus until the pandemic is over, but then would rebound later. “While it is too soon to determine the real effects COVID-19 will have on the Greater Vancouver real estate market, we certainly expect significantly slower sales volumes in historically active spring months ahead. The speed and timing of recovery is uncertain, but long-term housing demand for the region will likely be heightened by Canada’s COVID-19 response, and supply constraints.”

Sellers still listing

Despite the pandemic, sellers continued to list their homes in March. There were 4,436 homes listed for sale in Metro Vancouver in March, which is 10.4 per cent lower than March 2019 but a 10.8 per cent increase compared with February 2020 this year, reported the board.

“I was surprised at the number of new listings,” said Skipworth. “It dropped off in the last week of the month but people are still coming to market. Perhaps some people who had been planning on selling decided to do so before the situation gets any worse. We’re also seeing some listing cancellations and re-lists of those properties, so that accounts for some of the new listings.”

With overall sales increasing more than new listings, the sales-to-active listings ratio for March 2020 increased to 26.3 per cent. By property type, the ratio is 21.1 per cent for detached homes, 33 per cent for townhomes, and 28.9 per cent for apartments. These figures indicate a seller’s market, which is defined as more than 20 per cent for a sustained period.

Prices and property types

Home prices in the region also increased again last month. The composite benchmark price for all property types combined in Metro Vancouver is currently $1,033,700. This is a 2.1 per cent increase over March 2019, and a 1.3 per cent rise over February 2020.

Sales of detached homes in March 2020 reached 852, a leap of 61.1 per cent over the 529 detached sales recorded in March 2019. The benchmark price for single-family properties is $1,450,700, which is 0.7 per cent higher than March 2019, and a 1.2 per cent increase compared with February 2020.

March saw 493 attached homes trade hands, which is a 51.7 per cent jump compared with the 325 sales in March 2019. The attached-home benchmark price is now pegged at $791,800, a 2.5 per cent rise from March 2019, and a 0.9 per cent uptick compared with February.

Condo transactions hit 1,179 in March 2020, a 35.1 per cent increase over the 873 sales in March 2019. The benchmark price of an apartment property now stands at $687,000, which is 2.9 per cent higher than in March 2019, and a 1.4 per cent month-over-month rise.

One question mark is whether the no-eviction rule applies retroactively to tenants in recently purchased homes, where the new owner intends to occupy the property, or whether existing eviction notices served before the announcement have been grandfathered in.

article continues below

Now, a leading real estate lawyer in Vancouver has offered clarification on this issue, following advice he received directly from the B.C. government.

Richard Bell of Bell Alliance told Glacier Media Real Estate on Monday, “Up until today [March 30], if an eviction notice has already been given to the tenants to vacate because the buyers are to take possession, that eviction still stands. However, any new home purchase contract, from today onwards, you will not be able to evict the tenant, under any section of the legislation.”

He added, “That was a big concern for us, as we [at Bell Alliance] are working on lots of purchase contracts where the notice of eviction for tenants had already been given. Those purchases can now go ahead.”

However, the eviction ban may significantly affect sales of currently tenanted homes, now that any new buyers wouldn’t be permitted to evict sitting tenants from March 30 onwards, until the ban is lifted.",[]
202,richmond-news,https://www.richmond-news.com/real-estate/buyers-can-t-get-out-of-home-purchase-contracts-because-of-covid-19-1.24109720,Buyers can’t get out of home purchase contracts because of COVID-19,['Joannah Connolly'],,"If you’re in the process of buying a home but have lost income due to COVID-19, don’t assume that you’ll be able to get out of your signed purchase contract, a leading real estate lawyer has warned.

Home buyers who have paid their deposit and signed a purchase contract, who may now want to get out of the purchase since the pandemic hit, do not have a standard “Force majeure” or “Act of God” clause that will let them walk away, said Richard Bell of Bell Alliance in Vancouver. Such a clause would need to have been specifically written into the purchase contract to be applicable, which is unlikely, he said.

article continues below

What’s more, if the buyer walks away from a purchase contract, even if they have lost their job and can no longer afford the home, they could be liable for much more than simply losing their deposit.

“If a buyer loses their job – well, that could happen any time,” Bell told Glacier Media Real Estate March 30. “If they can’t complete the deal, they become liable for at least the deposit. But there could be a further, knock-on liability, if the seller then resells for less than the original amount. The buyer who caused the original deal to collapse could also be liable for the difference.”

Bell added, “Then the question becomes, if the collapse of the original deal causes a series of deals in a chain to collapse, how remote is the original buyer’s liability? How many links in that chain is the buyer liable for? That’s when you get into a legal battle.”

A purchase contract can, however, be rendered void under the doctrine of “frustration” whereby the deal can’t go ahead and collapses under extraordinary circumstances, through no fault of either party. However, this requires the explicit agreement of both parties to the contract, explained Bell.

For example, a buyer may not want to go ahead with a home purchase due to lost income, and the vendor may equally not want to sell anymore because they can no longer afford to upsize, also due to lost income. Under such circumstances, the buyer and seller can come to an agreement whereby the contract is cancelled and the buyer’s deposit returned.

Cold feet a symptom of COVID-19

Vancouver realtor Kevin Skipworth of Dexter Realty is seeing a lot of nervousness among buyers who have signed purchase contracts. He told Glacier Media Real Estate March 31 that he had one buyer with cold feet because of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated concerns about the economy, but after discussion with their conveyancing lawyers, the deal finally went ahead.

“There’s really nothing in the contract that allows for a buyer to walk away from a transaction because of the virus pandemic, but that doesn’t stop anybody from trying. For us as realtors, it’s not our place to try to negotiate out of a contract, that’s where legal advice is the first place to go.

He agrees with Bell that there can be much pricier ramifications than merely a lost deposit. “Everybody seems to think you can walk away and just lose your deposit and that will be fine, but that’s not the case. Sellers can go after you for damages, and more.”

Bell said he is seeing some collapsed home purchases at his law firm, but this is not currently his key concern in terms of real estate conveyancing. He pointed to rules of social distancing and quarantining making it virtually impossible to comply with legal requirements that home buyers and mortgage consumers be present in person to sign contracts, along with their government ID.

“It’s a major roadblock to closing home purchases right now,” said Bell. “Different lenders require different things. But some are literally requiring that we go round to quarantined clients’ homes and have them show their ID to us through the window. It’s ridiculous. Hopefully it will change before long, so we can do it by video. We’re trying to get this up the chain of command.”

‘Force majeure’ in construction

One sector that may have some luck in claiming “force majeure” when failing to complete a contract due to COVID-19 is the construction industry, where sites have had to close due to the outbreak – depending on such a clause being in the contract.

Whether or not a judge under Canadian common law would grant “force majeure” varies greatly from case to case, said Sahil Shoor, a Waterloo, Ontario-based civil litigator for Gowling WLG, in a legal bulletin to the construction sector on March 20.

That is because while some contracts include “force majeure” clauses that clearly states diseases, plagues, epidemics or quarantine restrictions as applicable conditions (beyond the typical “acts of God” events such as natural disasters, fires, floods and wars), other make no such distinctions. Some other contracts yet, Shoor said, may not have a “force majeure” clause at all, further complicating the issue in court.

“In order to successfully rely on a force majeure clause, the relying party [contractor] has the burden of establishing Force Majeure Event and proving that the Force Majeure Event has effectively prevented the party from fulfilling its obligations under the construction contract,” Shoor said in the bulletin, adding the court will assess the merits of the case based on whether the COVIC-19 outbreak qualifies as a force majeure, whether the risk of not being able to complete the contract was “foreseeable and able to be mitigated,” as well was whether it was really impossible to complete the contract.

In cases where there is no clear description of an epidemic or disease as force majeure, a judge will often hinge decisions on the availability of an “alternative method of performance” – even if the alternative is significantly more expensive for the contractor applying for relief.

“As an example, are the party’s employees ill due to the virus and unable to work, or simply afraid to work and choosing not to attend?” Shoor said, adding that cases without a force majeure clause will follow similar lines of legal logic under the doctrine of frustration.

This is the third 50-basis-point cut this month as the bank does what it can to ease the cost of borrowing during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

The unscheduled rate decision brings the bank’s policy interest rate down to 0.25 per cent. At 0.75 per cent, it was the highest such rate among the central banks of G7 countries.

On Friday, Canada’s central bank also announced two new programs to bring greater liquidity to Canadian markets: the Commercial Paper Purchase Program (CPPP), and a quantitative easing program.

Under the latter, the bank will purchase a minimum of $5 billion in Government of Canada securities per week, starting April 1. The program will continue until Canada’s economic recovery is “well underway.”

Over the next 12 months, the CPPP will see the bank undertake primary and secondary market purchases of commercial paper issued by Canadian firms, municipalities and provincial agencies that have an outstanding commercial paper program. Poloz said the program will “help to restore a key source of short-term funding for businesses.”

Bank of Canada rate decisions over the last five quarters | Bank of Canada website

“The intent of our decision today is two-fold: to immediately support the financial system so it keeps on providing credit, and, over the longer term, to lay the foundation for the economy’s return to normalcy,” Bank of Canada governor Stephen Poloz said in an opening statement to media.

Although existing variable-rate mortgage holders will enjoy additional discounts from the BoC's new rate, whether or not the cuts will be passed on to new mortgage consumers remains to be seen. Thus far, despite two previous recent rate reductions of 50 basis points each, mortgage rates for new customers have been rising, not falling.

“This is a very uncertain time for banks and lenders, just as it is for consumers,” said Alex Conconi, CEO of Lendesk. “While the normal consequence of a Bank of Canada prime rate cut is to pass that on to borrowers, at the end of the day, banks control their own prime rate and it cannot be taken for granted amid COVID-19. Moreover, until recently, it wasn’t unusual to see variable rates that were prime minus something: now that has all but evaporated, and we’re seeing prime plus a spread. The consequence is that the banks are able to shore up some margin, which may be necessary if they are to take losses in other parts of their business. Meanwhile, consumers aren’t necessarily paying any less than they would have been paying a few months ago.”

Tenant advocates are openly wondering if it even makes sense to pay rent.

article continues below

In a response to the COVID-19 crisis, the March 25 announcement by the provincial government will end virtually all rental evictions – including those currently in process – freeze rental increases, and pay $500 direct to landlords to help tenants battling job and income losses over the next three months.

""This is not the time to seek rent increases and there is just zero per cent chance of that happening,"" said Premier John Horgan. “Landlords will be prevented from legally raising rents starting April 1. Increases slated to take effect on April 1 will no longer be applied.”

Despite the good intentions, many say the unprecedented program is wide open to abuse. This is apparently recognized by the provincial government whose models concede that 100 per cent of B.C.’s 500,000 renters could theoretically qualify for assistance.

The new rental supplement is in addition to federal and provincial programs announced to offer financial aid to those who lose income due to the health crisis.

Mark Goodman, a multi-family real estate specialist with Goodman Commercial Inc. Vancouver, estimates B.C.'s rental aid package could add up to more than $1 billion over the next three months, but argued it is landlords who could end up paying the most. The $500 paid directly to the landlord will not compensate for losses from the rental increase freeze, Goodman said.

This is particularly evident in Metro Vancouver, he said, where the average rent is now $2,351, according to Rentals.ca.

While the $500 payment direct to landlords is welcome, David Hutniak, CEO of LandlordBC, said that, with no potential for evictions, landlords have little protection if a tenant refuses to pay the balance owing.

“This is wide open to potential abuse,” Hutniak said. He added he hoped common decency would keep abuses in check.

“Two-thirds of landlords in Metro Vancouver are mom-and-pop situations,” Hutniak said, which includes people renting out a basement suite or a condominium to help cover the highest mortgages cost in the country. These owners are also struggling during the current crisis, Hutniak said.

According to a December 2019 survey by Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp., there are 67,000 rental condos in Metro Vancouver.

Hutniak also noted a naivety in the potential of landlords qualifying for a mortgage payment deferral. Premier Horgan encouraged banks to provide this, but Hutniak doubts most landlords would qualify or could afford such a deferral.“We have heard advocates speak about landlords getting mortgage deferrals so they can 'pass those savings onto renters.' But a mortgage deferral by a bank does not constitute any savings to the landlord. It has to be paid back with compound interest on the deferred amount. In other words, interest upon interest,""Hutniak explained. Any deferred amount is added to the mortgage principal, whereas a landlord doesn’t have any security for deferred rent from a tenant, he noted, or from the loss of legal rent increases.

Angela Calla, mortgage broker with Dominion Lending Centres, said landlords are unlikely to get approved for a deferral from some mortgage lenders, even if their tenants can’t pay rent due to lost income. “Deferrals are not being approved on rentals at this time,” she said on March 25. “If/when they are, it will come with additional costs for the landlord, once determined.” However, she updated this information March 26 with the news that Scotiabank is now allowing deferrals regardless of occupancy, and other banks may follow suit.

""It is the government’s expectation that all renters, including those renters impacted by the COVID-19 crisis, who have the capacity to pay rent do the responsible thing and pay their rent,” Hutniak added.

But the Vancouver Tenants Union noted that Premier Horgan conceded he could not guarantee that any rental aid will actually be paid by April 1, when the next rent is due.

“Every person should think towards the future, see where they are going to be in a few months and decide if it makes sense to pay rent,” said Mazdak Gharibnavaz, a steering committee member of the Vancouver Tenants Union, in a March 25 interview on CiTR 101.9 FM’s station at the University of British Columbia.",[]

But with phone lines jammed, and websites unable to process applications that are assessed on a case-by-case basis, many homeowners looking for a deferral or seeking answers have had little success.

article continues below

Confusion reigns over what makes a homeowner eligible for an emergency deferral, how the program works, whether interest is payable and whether deferring payments will affect credit scores. Unfortunately, with the situation changing on a daily basis, and lenders forced to make up rules as they go, it has been impossible for most people to get any information.

To clear up some of these issues, Glacier Media Real Estate spoke with five mortgage experts who offered their insights and advice on some frequently asked questions.

Would deferring my mortgage payments damage my credit score?

As long as the proper arrangements are made in advance, your credit score should not be affected. Atrina Kouroshnia, mortgage broker with Dominion Lending Centres, says, “I don't think deferring payments will have the same impact as [it did] before, as it's a global [pandemic] and, especially if your job is affected, you are making a proactive choice.”

Peter Kinch, best-selling author and award-winning mortgage broker, agrees, “I do not see a situation wherein this will have any impact on your credit score.”

The number-one most important thing? Never assume that you’ll be able to get the deferral and simply not pay your mortgage when it’s due, as this will damage your credit score. “The worst thing would be to just skip your payments,” warns Kouroshnia.

Angela Calla, also with Dominion Lending Centres, cautions, “If you miss the payment without an agreement or your lender does not approve you, it can impact your credit score and could significantly increase your cost of borrowing at renewal. Each borrower should confirm with the lender before they agree to the deferral.”

How can I get through to my lender?

For those trying to make such arrangements but having trouble getting through, Calla says it’s important to give the banks time. “Unless you have a payment due in the next five days [that you can’t pay], they ask that you delay calling at this time [due to overwhelming call volumes]. Email is preferred, or some lenders have portals they have created to assist with this. Look at your lender’s website for updates.”

Alisa Aragon, also with Dominion Lending Centres, recommends speaking first to your mortgage broker, if you have one. “Lenders are experiencing an overwhelming amount of calls and it is very hard to get through. If people have questions, it is best that they talk to their mortgage expert, as we are getting information from most lenders and we might be able to answer their questions faster.”

Should I apply, and would I be approved, for a deferral?

Once you’ve managed to get through to your lender, you’ll likely only be approved for a payment deferral if you’ve lost income due to the COVID-19 pandemic, say the brokers.

If you’re still working and can afford your mortgage, don’t attempt to get a deferral. Not only will you likely be wasting your time and that of the overstretched lenders, the program should only be used as an emergency last resort. That’s because deferring payments will cost you more money in the long term (see “How would a mortgage payment deferral work?” below).

Only those truly unable to pay their mortgage right now, due to lost income from the pandemic, should apply. “The deferral program is really for homeowners that are experiencing financial hardship due to the COVID-19 virus,” says Aragon. “If you are still employed and earning an income, then lenders will not be assisting those borrowers at this time. This program is for people that really need it.”

For those who feel they meet the requirements, it’s worth applying, and each application will be assessed on a case-by-case basis. “It also depends on the lender,” adds Aragon. “Each lender has its own requirements on what has to be provided.”

Landlords may not get approved for a deferral with some banks, even if their tenants can’t pay rent due to lost income, according to Calla. “Deferrals are not being approved on rentals at this time [March 25],” she says. “If/when they are, it will come with additional costs for the landlord, once determined.” However, Calla has an update of this information as of March 26, with the news that Scotiabank is now allowing deferrals regardless of occupancy, and other banks may follow suit.

One relief for landlords is that tenants unable to pay rent due to lost income can now apply for the new $500-a-month rent supplement, to be paid directly to their landlord via BC Housing, which was announced March 25. However, the accompanying temporary ban on evictions may mean leave landlords without options if tenants don't pay their rent at all.

If I were approved, how would a mortgage payment deferral work?

Make no mistake, a mortgage payment deferral is an emergency, temporary measure that will cost you more in the long term, caution the brokers. What’s more, the longer you defer payments, the more it will cost you, as interest will be payable at your contract rate during the deferral period, and will add up.

Kinch explains, “Your principal and interest payments do not have to be made for a period of [up to] six months. However, the banks will accrue your monthly interest payments and add that amount onto your current mortgage balance. As such, after the six-month deferral period, you will have a larger mortgage balance and your monthly payment will be adjusted accordingly to compensate. So you end up with a cash-flow break today, but you’ll have to make up for it in six months. To be clear – this is a ‘deferral’ not a ‘loan holiday’.”

Kinch’s colleague Jonathan Barlow adds, “Every lender will be different in how they manage it. Ones with deep pockets may allow for the deferral to continue until renewal, when they simply renew with the higher balance. Others may structure a repayment plan. Again, this is untrodden ground for the lenders, so they will all approach it differently.”

Calla says, “You are responsible to pay the deferral [interest] taken on the remaining payments on the term with most lenders. This is why it’s approved only for those who can’t make a payment due to not having the financial means. Everyone’s amounts per month and total interest cost will be different based on mortgage amount, rate and term remaining.”

What if my mortgage is with a monoline lender?

The Big Six Canadian banks, plus some credit unions such as Vancity, have been vocal about offering their mortgage payment deferral programs to those in need. But many Canadian homeowners have their mortgages with alternative specialist mortgage lenders, also known as monoline lenders. So are they offering the same payment deferral program?

Barlow says, “Monolines are supporting the deferral program as well, but because they are single service providers (mortgages only), their monetary base is much smaller. So they will be much more strategic about who they offer it to. They’ll certainly ask more questions, but you’ll likely get a much better plan and collaboration from them.”

As with all mortgage types, for more information about deferring payments, go to your lender’s website and talk to your mortgage broker before braving the long hold times on the customer service lines.",[]

Premier John Horgan announced Wednesday that B.C. will also freeze rent increases and evictions until the current crisis has passed, with some exceptions to the latter.

“This is not the time to seek rent increases and there is just zero per cent of that happening,” he said. Landlords will be prevented from legally raising rents starting April 1. Increases slated to take effect on April 1 will no longer be applied.

Horgan said the province is assuming its rental supplement will see 100 per cent pick-up, and that the province is then “working back from there” on the understanding that not everyone will need it. He added that there are around 500,000 tenant households in the province.

“[Uptake] will depend on the depth of the pandemic and the time it will take us to recover,” Horgan said.

The additional rental assistance program will be delivered through BC Housing. Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing Selina Robinson confirmed that the funds are intended to help pay the rent of low- and middle-income renters who have seen a “significant reduction” in income directly related to the spread of COVID-19, such as reduced hours or layoffs.

The supplement will be paid directly to landlords.

Robinson added that the province is granting landlords the power to regulate the use of multi-purpose and amenity spaces to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Existing eviction orders with B.C.’s Residential Tenancy Branch have been halted.

With few exceptions, landlords will also be prevented from entering tenants’ homes without tenants’ consent.

Vancouver-West End MLA Spencer Chandra Herbert, former chair of B.C.’s Rental Housing Task Force, confirmed that the Residential Tenancy Branch will continue to operate to address questions and concerns.

“The stress is off the charts right now. We need to give people security and safety in their rental housing,” he said.

The announcement comes a week before April 1 rental payments are due.

The measures are part of the province’s $5 billion COVID-19 response plan – which was announced on Monday – and follow tax and payment deferral options from governments, Crown corporations and banks intended to ease the financial burdens Canadians’ may be facing.

Earlier today, the federal government announced a new $2,000 monthly benefit for Canadians, which replaces and expands two previously announced emergency benefits.

“It is the inevitable next step,” said Jon Stovell, president and CEO of Reliance Properties and past chair of the Urban Development Institute.

article continues below

Quebec announced the extended shutdown of the majority of construction sites as it ramped up efforts to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus. Quebec's construction unions had called for a work stoppage, saying many sites lack proper hygiene control and require working close to others.

B.C. is second only to Quebec in the number of residents infected by COVID-19.

On March 22, six days after B.C. banned large gatherings, its COVID-19 Joint Information Centre released guidelines that allow for construction to continue, provided no more than 50 workers are working in any one space at a time.

Dr. Bonnie Henry, provincial health officer, has issued a set of guidelines regarding hygiene on construction sites.

Stovell’s company has two big building projects underway, an office tower and a condominium project, and he said his contractors are “going beyond” the provincial measures to assure worker and public safety.

But he believes that all B.C. construction work, aside from infrastructure projects deemed essential, will soon be ordered to close.

A request for comment from the provincial health officer was not received by the Western Investor deadline.

Ron Rapp, CEO of the Homebuilders Association of Vancouver, sent a memo to members this week.

“I told them we have the privilege to continue to work and to make darn sure they all meet the criteria of the provincial health guidelines,” he said.

But Rapp warned that much of the private sector construction in Metro Vancouver – estimated to be worth $10 billion to the B.C. economy and employing up to 130,000 people – could be forced to close regardless of legislation.

A lack of key building supplies due to a broken trade chain, especially from Asia, and the number of people who can’t or won’t report to work is among the problems, he said. He noted that one local supplier, a fabricator, had 25 per cent of its staff test positive for COVID-19.",[]

Reports include inadequate access to washroom facilities, a disregard for social-distancing and workers showing up to job sites sick. On more than one site, workers have no access to hand sanitizer or hand-washing facilities. Multiple workers shared that they risk losing their jobs if they leave, even though colleagues are showing up to work with flu-like symptoms.

Last week, the BC Building Trades Council asked construction workers to report working conditions on job sites during the COVID-19 outbreak. BC Building Trades (BCBT) is now urging WorkSafeBC to enforce mandatory and provincially recommended health and safety practices after reports of unsafe and unsanitary worker conditions.

“Workers are pleading for help – this is urgent,” said BCBT executive director Andrew Mercier in a news release.

“I have been in direct contact with the top brass at WorkSafeBC about this. We need more hand-washing stations. We need better social distancing. Regulations on paper mean nothing if they are not being enforced on the ground.”

One worker who emailed BIV said there are at least 50 people using four washrooms on his Port Moody job site every day, and he has yet to see them cleaned on a daily basis.

Another individual told BIV that a Vancouver site superintendent told workers that he doesn’t care about social distancing: “Either to go to work, or go home.“

A number of the workers who reached out to BCBT – and whose responses have been anonymized – expressed concerns about both continuing to work and about losing their jobs if they chose to stay home or self-isolate. Some have called for non-essential work sites to be shut down.

“The fact no one is shutting these sites down right now is unreal... Well over 200 people sharing this one water hose... No hot water. No hand sanitizer, and five to six bathrooms for the whole site,” wrote one respondent.

Last week, the Urban Development Institute (UDI) said government confirmed that B.C.’s limit on gatherings of more than 50 people does not apply to construction sites. Sites must still follow WorkSafeBC standards and COVID-19 prevention protocols. The latter include additional hand-washing stations and social distancing of one to two metres between workers.

Not so, according to mortgage experts. In fact, advertised interest rates for new mortgage applications have been climbing significantly over the past few days.

article continues below

In its March 19 update, mortgage comparison website RateSpy.com wrote as an example that TD Bank had just increased its advertised rates:

• three-year fixed: from 2.69 per cent to 2.89 per cent

• five-year fixed (high ratio): from 2.69 per cent to 2.79 per cent

• five-year variable: from 2.85 per cent to 2.95 per cent (no discount on the bank’s prime lending rate)

Alisa Aragon, mortgage broker with Dominion Lending Centres Mountain View, told Glacier Media in an interview March 20, “Lenders started increasing rates last Friday [March 13, the same day that the Bank of Canada made its emergency cut to the overnight interest rate]. That includes major lenders such as Scotiabank, TD, RBC. They’ve also been reducing variable-rate mortgage discounts on the prime rate, which is currently 2.95 per cent, so the discount on most variable rates is barely anything. In the future, we could see no discounts at all.”

She added, “The fixed rates are usually connected to the bond market, but because banks need liquidity right now, they’re increasing the rates.” The bond market had previously dropped in line with the central bank’s interest rate, but has also rebounded over the past couple of days.

Liquidity for the banks is a key issue for the federal government right now, which announced March 20 that it is introducing “changes will help provide stable funding and liquidity to financial institutions and mortgage lenders and support continued lending to Canadian businesses and consumers.”

This follows an announcement by the Ministry of Finance that it is launching “a $50 billion Insured Mortgage Purchase Program (IMPP)... The amendments allow mortgage lenders to pool previously uninsured mortgages into National Housing Act Mortgage-Backed Securities for CMHC to purchase these securities through the IMPP. The impact of this measure will provide financial institutions with more liquidity. This, in turn, will allow financial institutions to continue lending to businesses as well as individuals, while assisting customers who face hardship and need flexibility, on a case by case basis.”

By insuring previously uninsured mortgages, the government is essentially taking on the risk associated with those loans, freeing up banks’ balance sheets to provide more liquidity. The moves are intended to support banks while they offer such programs as six-month deferrals of mortgage payments to customers facing financial hardship due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, Aragon said that the program would not necessarily prevent banks from raising mortgage interest rates. “It depends on the bank’s balance sheets, every bank is different,” she said. “These are unprecedented times.”

Even though rates for new mortgages are currently rising, applicants are rushing to get a mortgage on the back of news that the Bank of Canada has slashed its overnight rate.

RateSpy’s March 20 update added, “Nearly every long-time mortgage broker we’ve talked to is swamped, with some saying they’re having their highest application volume ever for a March.”

Aragon is one such busy mortgage professional. She told Glacier Media she is also fielding countless calls from people who are asking about possible mortgage deferrals, even when they haven’t lost their jobs. She added that some are hoping to stop paying their mortgages so they can use the money to invest in the stock market while it is depressed. “That’s not how you do it,” she added. “These deferral programs are really for people who are struggling financially due to the pandemic, and those customers will be required to provide proof of hardship.”

RateSpy’s March 20 update confirmed this trend, saying, “We’re hearing of cases where people are using HELOCs [home equity line of credit] to buy stocks. These are presumably (hopefully) well-qualified, risk-tolerant clients with financial safety nets. It’s definitely not a strategy for the overwhelming majority.”",[]

The board said that it was making “this explicit recommendation today with the support of real estate brokerages, and after an assessment of the latest information and commentary from public health and other government authorities.”

REBGV said that, earlier in the week, it had also “removed the rule requiring that properties listed on MLS be made available for showings.”

Ashley Smith, REBGV president said, “Realtors want to do their part to help prevent the spread of illness in our communities and to meet the housing needs of residents in a responsible way. We’ve heard from some in the community who are unhappy that their Realtors are not holding Open Houses. To those people, we ask for your understanding given the public health crisis we all face today.”

The board said that “anyone looking to buy or sell a home in today’s environment is encouraged to discuss COVID-19 preparedness with their Realtor” and offered some key tips for buyers and sellers. These include:

• If you recently travelled abroad and/or are unwell, do not view a property, and stay home.

• If you’re a seller, talk with your Realtor about alternative approaches to open houses, such as virtual showings and other technology-based solutions.

• If you’re a buyer, only visit a property when others are not present, sanitize your hands before and after a showing, and avoid touching doorknobs and other surfaces in the property.

The REBGV is also offering other tips for buyer and sellers at www.rebgv.org.

Construction must go on

Announced the same day was approval to B.C. construction companies to continue site operations, as the ban on gatherings of more than 50 people does not apply to construction sites, according to the Urban Development Institute.

The UDI said in a March 19 statement that “a senior provincial government official has contacted UDI president and CEO Anne McMullin to assure our industry and membership the 50-person limit does NOT apply to construction sites. The provincial government official confirmed that all sites can and should remain operating… Sites must continue to conform to Worksafe BC practices and current COVID-19 prevention protocols. That means additional handwashing stations should be made available, that workers should maintain their social distance of 1-2 metres from one another and during any on-site meetings.”

The UDI statement added, “In addition, the Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said during the March 17 news conference… that ‘Construction work outside is not as much of a risk that we are concerned about... but anyone who’s sick should not be going to work.’”

The Homebuilders Association of Vancouver (HAVAN) also sent out a statement March 19 offering advice to construction employers on site safety during the pandemic.

In a combined press release, all six big banks said they were also working with commercial customers to provide “flexible solutions” for Canadian businesses struggling because of the virus outbreak.

On the same day, credit union Vancity announced that it was also implementing mortgage payment deferrals of up to six months for struggling homeowners.

It wrote in a statement: “Vancity initially responded by introducing a three-month loan deferral program for our members. It is clear the effects of the pandemic will last longer, so today we are announcing an extension of that deferral program for a term of up to six months. This includes mortgages and other loans and will support members facing financial uncertainty and vulnerability from the fallout of coronavirus.”

Vancity said that personal banking and business customers should contact their customer service line to find out how the credit union can help.

It wrote: “Each case will be assessed individually to help people through these difficult times… Other support for Vancity members facing financial difficulties owing to the virus include providing emergency working capital [and] buying back foreign currency at the rate it was sold, for customers impacted by travel disruption, to ensure they do not suffer financial loss.”

During a press conference, Premier Horgan said these are among the many issues the province has on its plate, and government is looking at next steps, using a cross-governmental approach.

article continues below

""It's not just individual renters that are concerned. Businesses who have rents to pay and no customers coming in the door are equally concerned. So we have a whole range of issues that are piling up and we're looking at what mechanisms we have to assist these individuals,"" he said at the press conference March 17.

""But I want to stress, as I did on Friday, the objective of our government is to provide services for people. That's why we're here. We do not want to come up short. I've made that clear to deputy prime minister Chrystia Freeland in our daily discussions — that we all need to work on this together.""

Chandra Herbert, meanwhile, headed up the three-person rental housing task forced that criss-crossed the province in 2018 to come up with recommendations to modernize the Rental Tenancy Act.

Chandra Herbert is now reaching out to many of the same people and groups he dealt with on that file to make short-term and long-term recommendations with respect to the impact coronavirus will have on renters and rental housing.

“It's quick work in terms of short-term [recommendations] given rents come due at the end of the month. We'll have to be looking at that as an issue. We're looking at how to support renters, but also landlords — there's a number of smaller landlords [for whom] the rent cheque is often also the mortgage cheque,” he told the Courier March 17.

“Tomorrow, I understand, the federal government will be making major announcements around rents, in part. We don’t have an early preview of that, but it will inform the work.”

Chandra Herbert has already put out calls to organizations such as the B.C. Non-Profit Housing Association, the Tenant Resource and Advisory Centre and LandlordBC. Within government, he’ll be checking in with B.C. Housing, as well as Vancouver and Victoria’s rental advisory committees.

“It’s not everybody under the sun — we have to work faster than that — but I'm doing my best to get out to as many folks that have key experience in this work,” he said. “I’ve set my own deadline — as soon as possible. The sooner we can get action, the sooner people have some peace of mind, which is in short supply right now.”

Challenges are numerous as April 1 approaches and rent becomes due. Some workers have already lost jobs while others are at risk of losing them. Some residents are in quarantine or self-isolation. Landlords of smaller and larger buildings, meanwhile, as well as those who rent suites in their homes, face mortgage payments.

“[Some renters] may not be able to get rent money because they're not working or they may have been laid off — if you're a casino worker or somebody in the entertainment industry, for example — the film business,” Chandra Herbert said. “In many cases, people are one paycheque away from not being able to afford rent.”

But, he added, some relief sooner than later, depending what the federal government announces Wednesday.

“CMHC on the federal level has said they're looking at mortgage deferrals and questions like that. But really, [after] we hear what the federal cabinet is announcing tomorrow, we'll see what we, as a province, needs to do,” he added.

“They have a considerable fiscal firepower at their disposal. We'll watch them and then see what more we can do. Certainly, we've been encouraging the federal government to look at the challenge of renters, of course, the challenge with mortgage holders, people in the gig economy who might not qualify for EI, and that kind of thing.”

Under the province’s current Residential Tenancy Act, meanwhile, evictions are still possible — an issue renters’ advocates want addressed. Changes could come.

“Most folks aren't paying rent until the end of this month, so it's all on the table,” Chandra Herbert said.

Real Estate Association predicted March 17.

The tentative forecast by the BCREA admitted that “nobody knows” what will happen, but it ran a series of economic models under four scenarios.

article continues below

All four scenarios predicted home sales in the province would drop in the spring and early summer. The market would then likely rebound in the second half of the year “contingent on the outbreak resolving.” However, only one of the scenarios found that home sales in the province would recover to a point of activity higher than if there had been no pandemic, with the other three forecasting a more muted recovery (see graph above).

Although some industry pundits have suggested that the dramatic interest rate cuts in response to the crisis would fuel housing sales, the BCREA said that the suspension of the planned relaxations of the mortgage stress test would “mute the impact of falling interest rates for the BC housing market.”

The BCREA went further by saying that a national recession was possible due to the pandemic-related uncertainty, and in particular its impact on oil prices.

The authors wrote, “The additional shock to the Canadian economy due to a collapse in oil prices – itself the by-product of a price war between the world’s largest oil producers due to COVID-19 – makes the probability of a recession in Canada that much higher.”

Financial aid needed

BCREA also applauded the CMHC’s move to work with mortgage lenders to help homeowners defer payments, but said it was not enough, and that financial aid packages would be needed for households, especially renters.

The report said, “An unfortunate but unavoidable product of recessions is losses in employment and incomes, which may put some financially vulnerable families in an even more precarious position. The CMHC announced that it would be working with lenders to defer mortgage payments by up to six months if needed, which should stem potential mortgage defaults and foreclosures. However, there is still a need to address lost income for those who cannot afford to practice social distancing by staying home from work, and for those who have to make monthly rent payments and can’t take advantage of payment deferrals. For those individuals and families, cash is king. That means these households will need government cash transfers to meet their financial priorities during this time, and we hope this will be part of the yet-to-be-announced stimulus package from the Canadian government.”

James Laird, co-founder of Ratehub.ca and president of CanWise Financial mortgage brokerage, said of the CMHC’s mortgage deferment program, “Any Canadian who will be unable to make an upcoming mortgage payment should reach out to their lender before they miss the payment to discuss options and come up with a plan that works for their financial situation. The goal of lenders and CMHC is that no one will default on their mortgage as a result of COVID-19.""",[]

The federal financial regulator had previously announced that the stress test would be relaxed for insured-mortgage applicants. The new qualifying rate for insured mortgages (those with less than 20 per cent down payment) would have calculated at the weekly median five-year fixed rate from mortgage insurance applications, plus two per cent. This was intended to replace the current calculation, which is the Bank of Canada’s average posted interest rate, or the mortgage applicant’s contracted rate plus two per cent, whichever is the higher.

article continues below

However, following the Bank of Canada’s emergency interest-rate cut on March 13 of 50 basis points, the second such cut in nine days in response to COVID-19, OSFI has suspended the change indefinitely.

The new lower interest rates may have a similar effect as the planned stress test relaxation, and OSFI may be attempting not to compound the effect.

However, many mortgage lenders have not yet passed on the first of the two BoC rate cuts to their customers, and some have even increased fixed mortgage rates.

Jeremy Rudin, the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, said in a statement, “OSFI is focusing its efforts on issues in the environment that require continued vigilance. OSFI is committed to being a risk-based and agile regulator that calibrates responses that are fit for purpose.”

OSFI is also lowering the Domestic Stability Buffer requirement for domestic systemically important banks by 1.25 per cent of risk weighted assets, effective immediately, according to the Department of Finance. Such banks were supposed to see their buffer increased to 2.25 per cent, but this increase is now cancelled.

The department said is a statement, “This action will increase the lending capacity of Canada’s large banks and support the supply of credit to the economy during the period of disruption related to COVID-19. The release of the buffer will support in excess of $300 billion of additional lending capacity.”

Finance minister Bill Morneau stated, “The government is preparing a significant stimulus program, to stabilize our economy, support businesses and protect Canadians… To all Canadians, our government wants you to know that we have your back. We will take every necessary step to give you confidence.”",[]

""This unscheduled rate decision is a proactive measure taken in light of the negative shocks to Canada’s economy arising from the COVID-19 pandemic and the recent sharp drop in oil prices,"" the central bank stated. The statement added the bank’s governing council is ready to further lower rates if that is necessary ""support economic growth and keep inflation on target.”

When questioned, Bank of Canada Stephen Poloz said even a negative interest rate is on the table but told reporters it would likely not be needed “because of our financial firepower.”

The leading rate reductions are part of a $10 billion stimulus package announced March 13 by the federal government.

The rate cut immediately reduced the BoC lending rate to 0.75 per cent, the lowest since the global financial crisis more than a decade ago.

“Those borrowers who have stuck with variable rate mortgages now look like geniuses,” said Vancouver mortgage broker Peter Kinch, “Someone who has a variable rate mortgage at minus 1 per cent would be paying a 1.95 per cent rate for a mortgage today” he said.

The rate cut will also affect the mortgage stress test, which was scheduled to be modified on April 6 to make it reactive to the average contract rate for five-year mortgage loans at big banks. The stress test had required a borrower to qualify at the posted five-year mortgage rate, plus 2 per cent, or at the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. rate of 5.19 per cent, whichever was higher.

Now, the mortgage stress test will be linked only to the current average contract rate available at federally regulated banks.

A BIV survey March 13 showed this five-year rate is in an average of 2.42 per cent, which means a homebuyer would need to qualify at 4.42 per cent, the lowest level since the mortgage stress was expanded in January 2018 to include all home buyers.

“The housing market in Vancouver is already heating up and these rate cuts will add fuel to the fire,” said Kinch, head of the Peter Kinch Mortgage Team with Diversifi Alternative Investments Ltd.

Housing sales in Metro Vancouver soared 44.9 per cent in February compared to the same month a year earlier and were up 36.9 per cent from January, according to the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver, The composite benchmark price for a home is now $1.02 million, up 2.7 per cent from six months ago.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau, appearing on live national TV March 13 with Poloz and Canada’s banking regulator Jeremy Rubin, said he would deliver a fiscal stimulus package next week that will include an additional $10 billion in new funding to the country’s two business financing agencies — the Business Development Bank of Canada and Export Development Canada. The financial aid could be expanded: Morneau said the government would “do whatever it takes.”

Kinch said rumours are rife in the mortgage and banking sectors that one measure being considered is an 18-month suspension of the mortgage stress test.",[]

There were 5,741 residential unit sales were recorded by B.C.’s MLS last month, which is an increase of 26.3 per cent from February 2019

article continues below

Added to that, the average MLS sale price in B.C. last month was $758,863, a 12 per cent increase from one year previously.

However, all that improvement is in comparison to the weak activity seen in early 2019, and merely brings the provincial real estate market back to normal levels.

“Housing markets in BC continued to trend near long-term average levels in February,” said Brendon Ogmundson, BCREA’s chief economist. “Recent declines in mortgage rates and favourable changes to mortgage qualifying rules may provide a boost to home sales heading into the spring, although there is significant economic uncertainty lingering over the outlook.”

With total B.C. MLS home listings down 8.3 per cent year over year, and sales increasing, the ratio of sales-to-active residential listings across B.C. rose to 20.3 per cent. It is considered a seller’s market only when the ratio is above 20 per cent for several months, so the market is still considered balanced at this point.

As ever, the picture changes dramatically when looking at individual real estate markets, with some recovering more than others, and some struggling.

Greater Vancouver saw the biggest sales increase (but not the biggest price rises), while the small markets of Northern Lights and Powell River both saw fewer sales than in February last year. Of the larger markets, only B.C. Northern reported a decline in transactions compared with its active market of one year ago.

Average sale prices rose on an annual basis in every B.C. market except Powell River, which is small enough to see wild percentage changes in sales and prices, and therefore does not indicate a trend. Of the larger markets, the highest average annual price rise was in the Fraser Valley, up 9.4 per cent, followed by Okanagan Mainline and Vancouver Island.

There were 2,150 transactions on the residential resale market in February 2020, a 44.9 per cent rise over February 2019, and 36.9 per cent higher than the 1,571 homes sold in January 2020.

Even though February’s total sales was 15.9 per cent below the 10-year average for the month, the supply of available homes for sale was unable to meet demand.

“Home buyer demand again saw strong year-over-year increases in February while the total inventory of homes for sale struggled to keep pace,” said Ashley Smith, REBGV president. “This was most pronounced in the condominium market.”

This lack of competition increased the pressure on home prices, with the benchmark composite price of a Metro Vancouver home rising slightly again last month. The benchmark price for all residential properties combined, across the region, now stands at $1,020,600, which is a 0.3 per cent increase over February 2019 and a 2.7 per cent increase over the past six months.

(Story continues below)

Although new listings in February were 3.4 per cent higher than in January, the total number of homes for sale as of the end of February was 20.7 per cent lower than the same month last year, at 9,195 units.

The sales-to-active listings ratio in February 2020 was 23.4 per cent. It is deemed to be a seller’s market if the measure is more than 20 per cent for several consecutive months. By property type, the ratio is 17.3 per cent for detached homes (a balanced market), 26.9 per cent for townhomes, and 28.4 per cent for apartments (both now seller’s markets).

Smith added, “Our Realtors are reporting increased traffic at open houses and multiple offer scenarios in certain pockets of the market. If you’re considering listing your home for sale, now is a good time to act with increased demand, reduced competition from other sellers, and some upward pressure on prices.”

Sales and prices by property type and area

Although detached homes in Metro Vancouver saw the lowest sales-to-listings ratio, it was the submarket to see the most rapid sales growth in February. There were 685 single-family home sales across the region last month, which is a jump of 52.9 per cent year over year.

The benchmark price for a detached Metro Vancouver house has not recovered its recent losses yet, but it is recovering. The benchmark price for a detached home in the region is now $1,433,900. This is 0.7 per cent lower than in February 2019 but a 1.9 per cent increase compared with the low point seen around six months ago.

Whistler and Squamish were again the markets to see the biggest annual jump in typical detached home values, up 15.7 per cent and 10.1 per cent respectively. The steepest price loss in the REBGV’s jurisdiction was seen in Bowen Island, where typical detached prices are down 8.4 per cent year over year, followed by the Sunshine Coast, down 7.8 per cent.

Sales of attached Metro Vancouver homes such as townhouses and duplexes totalled 404 in February, a 45.8 per cent increase compared with the 277 sales in February 2019.

A typical attached home in the region now sells for $785,000, according to the board. This is 0.6 per cent higher than in February 2019 and a 1.7 per cent increase over the past six months.

As with detached homes, Whistler and Squamish townhome prices have seen the biggest increases in the region, up 7.5 and 7.2 per cent respectively. Once again, resale townhome prices in Ladner (down 5.0 per cent) and Tsawwassen (down 4.5 per cent) dropped the most year over year, although those declines are not as steep as they have been recently.

Some 1,061 Metro Vancouver condos traded on the MLS last month, which is a 39.8 per cent increase over the 759 sales in February 2019.

With the demand for condos highest of all the property types, and supply not keeping up, the price of a typical Metro Vancouver condo has recovered the most so far. The benchmark price of an apartment property now stands at $677,200, which is 0.9 per cent higher than in February 2019 and a 3.6 per cent increase over the past six months.

Surprisingly, given the rise in detached and townhome prices in the area, Squamish condos saw the region’s biggest annual condo price drops, down 6.8 per cent. Port Moody and Coquitlam were the areas with the biggest benchmark condo price rises, up four and three per cent year over year respectively.

As demolition began, community residents took to social media to express their memories of a bowling alley which was seen being razed late January.

A resident posted “Say good bye to Cosmic bowling” with a photo which received comments of sadness on its closing, while others shared their birthday memories of the place.

The buildings on Gilley Road with a total of 225 residential units and 2,415 square feet of retail space on the ground floor just requires final approval from city council.

Oris Developments applied to the city to rezone the Bridgeview Shopping Centre at 23200 Gilley Rd. at the southeast corner of Westminster Highway and Gilley Road.

Of the 225 residential units, five per cent – 15 units – will be allocated to affordable housing units under the city’s former Affordable Housing Strategy – new developments have a 10-per-cent affordable housing requirement.

According to the project proposal, there will be an outdoor market square between the two proposed buildings which will include an outdoor seating area and space for public art.

Residents can also expect upgrades such as on-street bike lanes and an enhanced pedestrian crossing at an existing crosswalk around the block.

Clay Adams, spokesperson for the City of Richmond, said the rezoning for the development was granted a third reading and the Development Permit (DP) was reviewed and endorsed by the Development Permit Panel last May.

“We understand the applicant to be actively addressing (rezoning and DP considerations), so while we expect the project to continue forward, the timing is primarily in the applicant’s court,” said Adams.

Headwater Living has applied to rezone the property to high-density in order to build about 149 market-rental units with commercial space at ground level.

Rents are proposed at between $1,350 and $1,600 for studio apartments, $1,600 and $1,900 for one-bedroom apartments and $2,200 to $2,400 for two-bedroom apartments. There could also possibly be maximum household incomes for the property at 5500 No. 3 Rd.

John Roston, who has been pushing for large amounts of rental in the Lansdowne area, calls this a “model” to be applied to as many city centre properties as possible.

In an open letter to the planning committee, which will look at the application on Tuesday, he appeals to councillors to push for aggressive rental in city centre projects.

“We need 100% rental if we are to have any hope of solving the ongoing housing crisis and reducing rents to a level that young people brought up in Richmond and those working in Richmond can afford,” his letter states.

Currently, city centre housing developments are required to have 10 per cent rental, but Roston said this is just creating “small pockets” of rental scattered around the city. He suggests the city buy development lots, rezone them for 100-per-cent rental that can then be sold or leased to a rental property manager or pension fund.

“Such a proactive initiative by council would prove to citizens that council is determined to do everything possible to solve the housing crisis and not simply responding to whatever proposals developers choose to put forward,” Roston continues in his letter.",[]

The cost of strata’s building insurance is passed to homeowners in their maintenance fees and, if the unit is rented, it is likely to be passed on again to tenants.

What’s more, insurers are being so picky about their risk exposure that some poorly maintained or older strata face losing their insurance coverage entirely. This would mean that not only would owners lose everything in a major event such as a fire, flood or earthquake, but also they would not be able to sell or remortgage their homes, even if there was no such catastrophe.

article continues below

A lack of competition in the insurance market across North America, combined with massive payouts that insurance firms have had to shell out due to increasing severe-weather events damaging buildings, have led to the premium increases.

Insurance brokerage Hub International said in a recent note, “Strata and condo corporations should budget for a minimum 35 per cent increase even on properties with no history of losses and full updates (roof, plumbing, heating, and electrical). Stratas with losses or those that have not undergone updates should expect greater increases. The cost of reconstruction appraisals also continues to rise, equating to as much as 5-10 per cent of the building value. These two factors combined will continue to drive premiums up through 2020.”

Insurance firms finding it hard to make ends meet have resulted in a reduction in the current number of insurers operating in the market, which has two effects on premiums. The first is a simple lack of competition allowing insurers to offer less competitive prices. The second, more serious, issue is that many of these fewer insurance firms are now at capacity, and can pick and choose which buildings they insure, while those they turn down are left out in the cold.

Tony Gioventu, executive director of the Condominium Home Owners’ Association of B.C. (CHOA), told Glacier Media, “There is less competition and much higher demand on the insurance. The risks are being very closely monitored. Because there are fewer insurers taking on a greater load of the risk, they’re being very picky about who they’re insuring, and at what value. Compound all that together, and you can hear the cash registers ringing in the background.”

Increasing construction costs, especially in expensive cities like Toronto and Vancouver, are also adding into these premium hikes and refusal to insure, as the financial risk is greater for the insurance companies. Gioventu added, “Another problem is that the value of reconstruction of buildings in high-density markets, where construction costs are high and values are high, the price of construction of these properties is at an all-time high.”

He said the issue is most acute for buildings that have a history of insurance claims. ""What about those buildings that are not getting their insurance renewed. If they have a history of claims or are not keeping their building maintained or repaired, the insurance company just isn't willing to take on the risk, regardless of what you're willing to pay. So now, all of a sudden, no sales, no mortgages, and if there's a loss in the building, everyone loses everything. It's a terrifying thought.""

CHOA has been receiving increasing numbers of calls for help from member strata corporations, said Gioventu, and he predicts this is only going to get worse throughout the year. He also said that he is in discussions with the B.C. government about the problem, but is not optimistic they can help. “Short of creating a provincial insurance program for strata buildings, which represents trillions of dollars of risk and they would never take on, there’s not much the province can do,” he said.

Gioventu said that strata corporations can mitigate the risk of losing their insurance, and reduce their premium hikes, by making sure the building is well cared-for. ""Strata corporations seriously need to make sure that they have depreciation report, and are engaging in it, that they are maintaining their properties and not seeing special resolutions for repairs defeated in their meetings. Look at your building systems. If your plumbing hasn't been replaced and it's 35 to 40 years old, I'd be moving pretty quick. They also need to be looking at bylaws that could make a difference in terms of the risk to the property.""

However, Gioventu did have some optimism for the future. “We’ve got fewer players [in the insurance sector] right now, but industries go in cycles.”

In an interview with Glacier Media, Sam Hanson, president of development company South Street, agreed. South Street is developing a one-million-square-foot residential and commercial community with three levels of underground parking in the downtown core of sea-level Richmond. When asked if he was concerned about building insurance, Hanson said, “We’ve had a meeting with our insurers to discuss this, and we are looking at higher premiums than anticipated. But they explained that the marketplace for insurance is like any other market. It goes up and it goes down. As the cost of insurance goes up, more players start to enter the marketplace, and they start to compete with each other, and prices will come down.”

He added, “Right now there have been all kinds of natural and manmade disasters that have caused insurers to pay out lots of money, and they raise their prices to cover what they have to pay out. It’s just the normal course of business. So yes, right now there is a tremendous issue, but how long it will last, I don’t know. According to our insurers, it is cyclical and it will eventually go the other way.”",[]

And developer Onni has told the Richmond News about some of the new businesses that will soon open their doors at the site, which has been the centre of a rezoning controversy over the last decade.

According to Onni, it has signed lease agreements with the likes of Goodlife Fitness, one of Canada’s largest fitness club chains.

A Thai restaurant called “Bann Lao” will also occupy one of the units, while the Colony Restaurant Group – which operates three large bar/restaurants in Kitsilano, Mount Pleasant and North Vancouver – will also be opening a location.

A spokesperson for Onni also confirmed that the developer has started work on its waterfront hotel, which they hope to open in late spring or early summer 2020.

The News has reached out to Onni for more details on its hotel and will update this story as soon as possible.

The company said it still has some space available for lease and is open to offers from prospective clients.

After more than 10 years of battling with the City of Richmond and Steveston residents, Onni agreed to a deal with the city in June of this year.

Onni agreed to pay $5.5 million to the city in exchange for rezoning six commercial buildings on the waterfront, which were originally supposed to be for marine mixed use. The money was earmarked for Steveston Community Centre.

Not everyone on city council was happy with the rezoning in the summer, including Coun. Kelly Greene, who called the move a “travesty.”

She pointed out that the mixed maritime use was supposed to be the city’s compensation for the development, which is on the old BC Packers site.

The zoning amendments added several types of use to the six Imperial Landing buildings - health service, hotel, recreation, restaurant, retail and financial service - and removed boarding and lodging, community care facility and home business.

Since 1998, the city had contemplated its vision for the waterfront site of BC Packers.

About half the site, to the east, became condos and a waterfront park, while the other half sat empty until 2012 when Onni built six buildings under maritime-industrial zoning, which was intended for servicing the Village’s marine industry. However, the buildings were built to also accommodate commercial uses.

Since 2013, the developer had failed to lease the space for maritime use and hence the buildings sat empty.",[]

The number of new home builds in Richmond markedly increased toward the end of 2017, and has stayed high.

“We’ve seen a very steady high rate of development for last number of years,” Ted Townsend, director of communications with the City of Richmond, told the Richmond News.

He said the numbers don’t surprise him, since Richmond’s official community plans take into account high projected growth and allow for high density development.

“The uptick has been a little quicker than we maybe would have anticipated,” he said. “But it is certainly within what is projected for City Centre.”

Richmond had the biggest growth in new home builds in the region. Other Lower Mainland a slowdown in the number of new homes starting construction.

All of that building translates into a massive construction industry in the city. Business in Richmond pegged the construction activity’s value at $485 million in the first half of 2018. If things continue like this for the rest of the year, the value of construction activity could smash records set in 2016.

Townsend said the neighbourhoods seeing the most new development are Capstan, City Centre and the area near the Richmond Oval.

“One million new people are expected to arrive in Metro Vancouver in the next 20 or 30 years,” he said. “Richmond got out ahead, particularly with the arrival of the Canada Line.”

At the same time as this development boom, fewer existing homes are being put on the market. Only 1,810 homes were sold in Richmond from January to July 2018. That’s 27 per cent less compared to the previous year.

Business in Richmond mentioned measures like the foreign buyer tax and tightened mortgage rules as factors contributing slowdown.

Although the number of homes sold has decreased, prices they sold for have not. The average price of a detached home in Richmond sits at $1.98 million, and the average selling price for a condo is $576,000.

The report went as far as to say that the market for detached houses in Richmond has turned into a buyer’s market. Competition to buy a condo or a townhouse, however, remains stiff.

“I hope people can empathize with (the character) in the story as well as those in the community as well.”

Danielle Graham has published a number of youth novels online, but All We Left Behind was the Steveston author’s first historical novel published by the renowned publishing house HarperCollins.

As part of the launch, in-person book signings, school visits and library readings were lined up to take place around the Lower Mainland and on the Island to coincide with Tuesday’s release.

And then came COVID-19.

“The timing of the release landing during a pandemic is both unfortunate and serendipitous at the same time,” said Graham, whose day job is that of a family therapist.

The book will still go on sale as scheduled and she’s happy to know it will still be sold at Costco for the months of May and June, but all the promotional gigs, which account for a large part of an author’s income, have been axed.

But artists are nothing if not creative and Aldcorn has been inspired by the ways in which artists and authors are finding ways to share their content through live streams, one-person concerts from their homes, drive-by window-art galleries or online story times.

For her part, Graham is hoping readers will think about contributing their own book reviews on book retailer sites, and she’s looking for opportunities to visit a virtual classroom. Meanwhile, Graham found it “fascinating” to draw the link between the pandemic, and some of the emotions people are going through, and what earlier generations would have gone through during times of war.

All We Left Behind came from two personal inspirations. One was of her grandfather, William Aldcorn, who was a Canadian spitfire pilot who was shot down during the Second World War.

The other was her nephews’ 98-year-old great-grandfather, Ted Tadayuki Kadohama, who was interned during the same war.

“Maybe another war like WWII would never happen again, but tragedies that strike and impact the entire world can and do happen – we are living through an example of that right now with the pandemic,” said Graham.

“Maybe the experience of self-isolating is a reminder to return to a greater appreciation of what is truly important, to reconnect with our compassion, to re-harmonize through the rhythm of quiet creativity, to heal ourselves and the planet, and to ultimately make the world a better place.”",[]

A huge area of the park was fenced off for a new Netflix series titled Midnight Mass, which was expected to start shooting on March 16, according to a Twitter post by Kenny Sue.

However, the area has since turned into a ghost town with “beach cottages and fake power lines” and devoid of staff, minus the security in the area.

From the creators of The Haunting of Hill House, this horror-based series is about an isolated island community that experiences unbelievable yet frightening omens after a mysterious priest arrives, according to Netflix.

A sign, posted by the City of Richmond, also mentioned that the “revenue from (the) production will go towards improvements and programming within Richmond’s park system.”

For now, community members can visit and take pictures of the set.

Lou Sheppard, a Canadian artist, was named as Branscombe House’s artist-in-residence for 2020 earlier this year. They work in interdisciplinary audio, performance and installation-based practise.

This year, due to COVID-19, the Sobey Art Foundation and National Gallery of Canada chose to distribute $625,000 – which would have covered the award program, artist residencies, exhibition costs and annual gala ceremonies – equally among the 2020 longlisted artists rather than awarding a short list or single winner the usual $100,000 prize.

Sheppard has also been adapting their community engaged programming in response to COVID-19, although there are still opportunities for community participation.

Sheppard publishes a weekly art prompt on their blog, and is working on a project – titled What We Can’t Say in English – centred on words in other languages that have no equivalent in English.

If Richmond residents speak a language other than English and have any words they don’t have a satisfying English translation for, Sheppard would like to connect with them. After gathering these words and their attempted translations with the help of the community, Sheppard will create a series of podcasts and posters.

So, Adam Zimmerman, a Richmond resident and independent filmmaker, along with his family of four, was surprised when they received an honourable mention at the Quarantine International Film Festival (QIFF) – started by Canadian producers and actors Spencer Streichert and Siobhan Cooney – during the Top 40 award nominees announcement earlier this month.

“It was exciting when we found out; my two sons were happy to see their hard work had paid off and couldn’t wait to send it to their teachers,” said Zimmerman, adding that over 600 films were submitted worldwide.

“Personally, I’ve made films for festivals and this is the first one to be accepted and that was exciting.”

When a close friend first suggested he submit something to QIFF for fun during the spring break, Zimmerman wasn’t particularly keen on the idea.

“At first I wasn’t quite sure I wanted to do it, but I thought about giving the kids something to do, so I asked them if they wanted me to write something up,” said Zimmerman. Although, he didn’t have much confidence he would even be able to think of something that would fit the organizers’ theme, which was “Bear/Bare.”

Along with his wife, Trayce Zimmerman, who produced the film, Adam got to work filming his older son Dallas, 11, giving his younger brother Jackson, eight, a grammar lesson on homonyms.

The film starts off with Jackson dreading his vocabulary test and Dallas trying to explain what a homonym is, and goes on to show the two brothers playing video games while listing examples of words that sound the same but have different meanings. The younger brother ends up losing the video game as he’s so focused on the homonym conversation.

Adam told the Richmond News that he decided on a silent film because he didn’t have proper sound equipment to record on set and wanted to make a film that was the “easiest and most effective” with homophones as the content.

“I get mixed up myself with homophones and having subtitles in the silent film helped decreased the confusion for everyone,” he added.

The organizers of QIFF were expecting only about 20 of their friends to submit a film, said Adams, but the festival somehow “blew up” into a world-wide event and is now on its second edition of submissions.

“(The film) was mostly a fun and very smooth experience, which is rare on any film sets, and I think because we shot it very quickly … it’s what kept it fun for the kids.”",[]

Born Dec. 12, 1952 in Cincinnati, Ohio, Thrasher, who passed away last Thursday, April 9, began performing professionally at the tender age of six, before making her name in the world of jazz and R&B.

article continues below

She recorded in New York with legendary artist Roy Ayers, and in Canada with the late Long John Baldry and Linton Garner.

Along with performing with the Platters (a vocal doo wop group from Los Angeles) in the U.S.A., Japan and the Philippines, Thrasher travelled as a jazz and R&B singer in the cruise ship industry.

She originally came to B.C. to appear alongside The Platters in 1981 and never left.

“I just fell in love with B.C.,"" Thrasher told the Richmond News back in 2011.

She also traveled to New York to record with a group called RAMP. The band toured Washington and performed in New York City's Central Park and in London, England in November 2007.

Along with her stage and musical achievements, Thrasher starred in movie, television and commercial productions.

In 2005, she performed in Fierce People, starring Donald Sutherland and Diane Lane, an experience she said was ""a career highlight.""

Thrasher also found time to volunteer at a number of fundraising events in Richmond and across the Lower Mainland.

Indeed, it was her willingness to help that forged a friendship with Richmondite and community advocate De Whalen in about 2011, who was then the president of the Richmond Women’s Resource Centre.

“I gave her a call to see if she could help us out,” recalled Whalen, referring to the centre’s upcoming 35th anniversary fundraiser, which had a Great Gatsby, Roarin’ Twenties theme.

“She was only too glad to help and she continued to support the centre for many years to come. She was a lovely, lovely woman with such a big heart.”

Whalen said they quickly became friends, adding that you “knew you could always depend on her.”

Case in point for Whalen was one Sunday afternoon in Garden City Park, when an eagle-eyed Mountie noticed in the parking lot that the licence plate on Whalen’s car had long expired.

“I was horrified and said I’d get it sorted straight away,” explained Whalen.

“He said I wasn’t driving anywhere and pointed out I had three hours before I’d get a ticket. It could have been an Easter Sunday, I’m not sure, but there were not many options. I was stuck.

“Then, out of the blue, Sibel called. I told her my predicament and she said she’d be right there as she lived close by.

“It was a Sunday afternoon, but she was all dressed up in her velour suit, her nails done, her extensions in. She took me to the mall and waited until I’d got my licence renewed.

“That day just about summed her up. I’ve called her my guardian angel ever since.

Whalen said she had seen her around town off and on over the years and remembered how she needed help to get on stage about two years ago.

“She said she was having trouble with her lungs…she was quite frail.”

In August 2004, Thrasher was inducted into the B.C. Entertainment Hall of Fame.",[]

Jill Raymond – who writes, teaches and rehearses out of her purpose-built apartment/studio in Capstan – recently kicked off “The Isolation Sessions” to help feed her artistic soul during the pandemic and perhaps bring a little sunshine into people’s lives.

article continues below

Essentially, Raymond has collaborated with fellow musicians/singers in duets/trios to record videos from isolation and then edit them together like a live recording.

Together, they’ve already produced several delightful videos, which are available for free on social media, including a rendition of Sammy Davis Jr’s Candyman with Joseph Spitale.

“I was feeling a little helpless in the current situation; so much creativity and performance preparation has just been completely frozen in this moment for so many people,” said Raymond, who sings in some of the videos and plays the ukulele in another.

“My classes are cancelled (and) my two shows that are slated for later this year still hang in the balance.

“I don't know when I'll next be able to be in the same room with many of my artistic friends and colleagues.

“(So), I thought 'what can I actually do (in) this situation to create something good?’ It seemed a natural choice to figure out a way to make music and performances together but, actually, separately.”

Raymond explained how she uses editing software to pair the videos, with whoever is playing the main instrument recording themselves first, before the other listens to that recording through headphones while recording their own video.

“Then they send that to me and I edit them together. It's pretty fun as a lot of the videos have some kind of interaction which gives it a 'live' feeling, even though it is all done separately and at different times.”

Raymond added that, as well as cheering up a few people at home, who’re likely stuck in the same situation, The Isolation Sessions might give local and international artists the chance to collaborate and give her a worthwhile project to “pour some joy into during this difficult time.”

“I wanted to do something creative that day (March 23) to fill the void that the (Gateway) show would have. So, I decided to do it to honour the fact that I was supposed to start rehearsal that day,” explained Jason Sakaki, a Steveston resident and McMath secondary grad.

article continues below

Gateway Theatre’s production, From Alaska, was cancelled earlier this month due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Sakaki added, “(I didn’t) think it would pick up so much traction with many people being super invested in the show,” which was staged in every room in his house to give the impression of set changes.

Jason Sakaki took to Instagram for a one-man live stream of Les Miserables. Photo: Video screenshot

Sakaki’s choice of Les Miserables was no coincidence.

Les Miserables is a story about people going through a difficult time, similar to what Richmond and the world is going through today, he explained.

“We’re in this time of ‘what’s happening next’ and no one really knows. Even though the musical takes place in the 1800s, it’s completely relevant to what we’re experiencing right now,” Sakaki added.

Like many residents, the pandemic is affecting Sakaki as a performing artist financially, but the fear of the community turning away from theatre frightens him even more.

“It’s a little bit unsettling for actors because we don’t know when it’s going to end. Since we will not be able to get back to work until it’s fully over. That’s the scary thing right now I think,” said Sakaki.

“What we’re a little scared about is when we come back, are people going to come back to theatres and so … we want to keep them interested in what we’re doing.”

Sakaki will be hosting another one-man production of Beauty and the Beast on April 3 at 7 p.m. on Instagram @jasonsakaki.

Gateway Theatre recently announced that Barbara Tomasic, who is the interim producer for the theatre, will be stepping up as Gateway’s new director of artistic programs.

article continues below

Tomasic, who has been working with the theatre since 2004, said that it felt “wonderful to step into a position of leadership at an organization” that will help her develop as an artist and a leader.

She hopes to include more interactive events and different programs to better connect with the community’s younger generation.

“Because our population is aging, we are finding that everybody, especially younger people, aren’t going to theatre as much,” said Tomasic.

She added that family events, like Gateway’s Spooktacular, is a “gateway” to a more diverse audience including young families.

“Gateway Theatre is an exciting place right now, experimenting with innovative ways of working with artist and the community.”

Tomasic will officially start as the artistic director of programs at the theatre on June 1.

Her first goal, said Tomasic, is for the theatre to work on re-connecting with the community.

“People are looking for different kinds of experiences and I’m excited to reach out beyond the walls of the theatre and get more involved in the community, to know what the community is doing and what they need and what they want to see,” she said.

“The idea of embracing the community, which is also an action of reaching out and welcoming people in, is what I hope the theatre can do through events.”

While many applications from across North America were received, Tomasic’s joint application with Jasmine Chen, an artist and actress, stood out the most.

Their application resulted in Gateway’s new artistic and community producer position for Chen, which allows the pair to work together in a job-share environment.

“We prepared a presentation together … and we found out we have a great chemistry working together and a similar value system, even though we came from different backgrounds,” said Tomasic, adding that both wanted to pursue their respective avenues of work, as a theatre director and actress, while taking on their roles.

“I’m excited to be in a permanent position … and be working alongside with Jasmine at Gateway.”",[]

The restaurant prides itself on its consistency. Because chef and owner Raj Kumar trains all of his chefs to follow his tried-and-true recipes, customers at every location enjoy the same Tandoori Kona taste experience.

This consistency has helped create a loyal following for the restaurant, which Chef Raj has owned since 2002. Patrons know that if they love a dish this week, they’ll enjoy exactly the same flavours when they return, whether it’s the next day or five years from now.

In fact, Chef Raj loves to tell the story of one of his customers who dropped by the Cambie Road location on the way to the airport. When the customer was on the plane and opened his take-out lunch, the man next to him said, “That smells like Tandoori Kona food.”

“It’s the flavour,” Chef Raj says. “Our cooking is based on onion, ginger and garlic. They bring out the flavour of the food itself.”

It’s important to Chef Raj that his food is both delicious, without using a lot of spices, and healthy. He minimizes the amount of oil and fats his chefs use in the recipes. His

Basmati rice is especially high in quality. “If customers are healthy then we are healthy,” he says.

Along with a menu of traditional favourites, Tandoori Kona — Kona means “corner” in Hindi — also offers daily specials. That means there’s no use of leftovers the next day — everything is fresh and prepared that day.

The prices are very reasonable, which makes Tandoori Kona the go-to place for many people who live and work in the area.

Building on the success of his Richmond location, Chef Raj has opened two more Tandoori Kona locations, in Manitoba and Saskatchewan, along with the soon-to-open brand new location in Hinton.

New manager, drinks expert Adam Lennon, gives his top picks.

1. The crisp, refreshing beer: Fuggles & Warlock The Last Strawberry

article continues below

“This Richmond brewery tends to do quirky, weird things and they use good ingredients, with no artificial flavours, ” says Adam. “This is a hazy straw yellow Belgian wit with just a little bit of a white head. It’s got a strawberry and yoghurt taste with a little bit of vanilla and is tart, crisp and refreshing – great for summer.”

2. The affordable, light red: Cave Saint Desirat Syrah

“This is the best French red I’ve had at this price point ($13.70),” says Adam. He likes its medium-bodied, fruit forward taste and the low tannin that makes it not too acidic. “It’s an approachable all-rounder – smooth, easy and perfect with barbecue food,” he says.

3. The perfect pairing with seafood: Country Vines Winery Yee Haw Pinot Gris

You know this is a special wine at one look. “It has some contact with the skin before pressing, which gives it a light peach/pink colour,” explains Adam. “On the nose, there’s spring flowers, honeycomb and citrus. It’s very dry with notes of pear, lemon and apricot, then a long, creamy finish.”

4. The quirky spirit: Lucid Spirits Apple Whiskey

Kingswood Liquor Store was the first of just three stores to stock this, which is handmade in Delta. “It’s smooth, well balanced with a nice bit of natural sugar,” says Adam. “You get a really fresh, juicy apple flavour all the way through, and a gradual heat.”

5. The once-in-a-lifetime Bordeaux: Le Pin Pomerol 2001

The methods vary and are sometimes so extreme they often hack inside Internet-connected camera devices in our homes and monitor us via video.

In other cases, they track our browsing data, communications, and access files stored in our homes.

There have been cases when this data was used for blackmail.

Considering how dangerous a lack of online privacy is, follow these tips to ensure online privacy.

1. Keep Your Apps Updated

It’s important you keep your apps updated. Turn on your auto-update option, if available. If not, consider it your duty to keep an eye on any pending updates and install them immediately.

Any app you use may have vulnerabilities or loopholes hidden inside them. Software developers are always on the lookout and patch them as soon as they find them. These patches are released in the form of software updates. Hence, it is important to install them to keep your system secure.

2. Configure the Privacy Settings of your Browser

Configuring the security and privacy settings of your device is important to stop your browser from leaking private information online.

To review your browser privacy, access the “settings” on your respective browser and move to the security and privacy tab.

Unmark anything you think can be harmful for your privacy and security. Most importantly, block third-party cookies so they don’t monitor your online activities.

3. Install a VPN

If you want complete online anonymity, install a VPN. VPNs safeguard your security and privacy using online encryption to ensure even the most powerful surveillance agency or the most dangerous hacker can’t access or monitor your online communications.

PureVPN is recommended. Their service offers the most powerful encryption to keep you secure and anonymous. It also offers other features, such as an Internet Kill Switch and Wi-Fi protection to keep you secure at all times.

PureVPN delivers the best features and functionalities, and is acknowledged by top publications such as CNET. TrustPilot also gives the service the highest rating in the industry.

4. Be Cautious when Installing Plug-Ins

Plug-ins installed from unreliable sources can be dangerous for any user. There are thousands of plug-ins and extensions available on the web funded by notorious sources.

They often come freeMost hack inside your private data and send it over to their owner company. This data is compiled and used without your permission, often sold to data bases, or in worst cases, used for blackmail.

Therefore, only install plug-ins from reliable sources.

That’s because you can’t confidently bite down on some of the things you previously enjoyed.

You feel left out, unfulfilled, even inadequate.

That’s no way to live life.

But a leading Richmond denturist, Alex Hupka of Esthetics Denture Studio, has a solution - dental implants.

While you may have heard increasingly more about them, as they become a mainstream treatment for those who need to replace several teeth, implants for those with full dentures can also provide a remarkable outcome.

“A lot of patients say it’s like getting their teeth back,” says Hupka, who provides what is called precision implant dentures.

Here’s how it works:

Denture-wearing patients seeking a permanent solution receive a referral to a dental surgeon who performs the actual implant process - usually four in the upper portion of the mouth and two on the lower.

Working closely with the surgeon, Hupka then produces a set of dentures that can clip onto the implants to provide an extremely secure attachment.

“When done correctly the denture will stay down, and food won’t find its way underneath,” Hupka says. “With regular dentures, you can flick your tongue and flip your dentures out.

“Once you have implants, it’s challenging to do that.”

Standard dentures have to rely on a good fit and suction - mostly for the upper set - to remain in place.

But as a person ages, the shape of their gums changes, impairing the original fit and ultimately that requires alterations.

Precision dentures fitted to implants significantly decrease that probability. And you have the confidence to tackle more hearty foods.

“With dentures, you can apply about 75 pounds of pressure when you bite down,” Hupka says. “With implants and precision dentures, that jumps to about double.

“But the biggest change comes with stability, which improves 100 percent,” Hupka adds.

It takes roughly five months for lower implants with dentures to be completed, while the process for the upper set takes about six to eight months.

“That’s mostly due to the body’s healing mechanisms,” Hupka explains, “because the upper bone in your mouth is like balsa wood and the bottom is like oak. Complete healing takes one year, which is how long the bone needs to completely mature.”

But once done, feel free to order whatever is on the menu.

“I have never heard a patient say they regret getting implants,” Hupka says. “Once they have implants, it’s a wide-open world for them in terms of what they can eat and enjoy.”

Hailing from northern Iran, Tila Akhavan and her brother David said that the dishes on their menu reflect their home country’s natural ingredients. Having only opened AnAr earlier this year, the restaurant is already bustling with customers. “People were hungry to see this kind of food on the market,” Tila said.

AnAr Restaurant brings recipes and dishes that one might find nestled away in the winding labyrinths of a bazaar or in a humble food stall serving up the tastiest kebabs on the street. Using natural spices like turmeric and saffron in cooking, with aromatics including lemon and lime, the restaurant serves up some seriously creative dishes most Vancouverites will have never tasted before. Looking back to her own heritage, Tila follows her heart, not a recipe. Free of steadfast rules, like meticulous measuring and quantities, AnAr’s kitchen is a place for taste and creativity.

AnAr’s mission, in addition to bringing restaurant variety to Richmond, is also to serve up extraordinarily scrumptious food while still maintaining its natural and nutritional values. AnAr strives to revert back to traditional Iranian cooking methods like steaming and barbequing lots of organic vegetables and Halal meats. Tila and her team share the same value of “cooking in the most nutritious ways”.

With reasonable prices, natural ingredients and generous portions, AnAr is based on being a family-oriented restaurant and designed for working class people. Being an inexplicably hard worker herself, Tila is making it more convenient for people to get a nutritious, tasty, and even exotic meal. “We try to do everything ourselves to make sure we know exactly what goes into our food,” she said.

""As an international bank, we bring a different perspective,"" he explains. ""Vancouver is the Pacific Gateway to Asia and we have many customers who need to transfer money to or from Asian countries. With our international presence and multi-lingual staff, we're able to help. KEB Hana Bank Canada is well-positioned to offer advice and provide services to our customers with international ties.""

In addition to its full range of domestic banking products, KEB Hana Bank Canada is also able to offer trade services and letters of credit.

""Another advantage we have at KEB Hana Bank Canada,"" Michael says, ""is our traditional approach to relationship banking. When other banks look at a business from a lending perspective, they have a checklist—and if you don't meet the matrix criteria, they can't help you. When a local bank gets too big, they focus on the mass market.""

KEB Hana Bank Canada, on the other hand, prefers to focus on the business and its principles.

""At KEB Hana Bank Canada, when we look at a loan application, we look at it deeply and from the perspective that we want to make it work,” Michael says. “We try to understand the customer's need—whether it’s related to a personal or commercial loan—and help the customer meet that need in the best way possible.""

That principle of focusing on the customer's needs is core to the work Michael and his team do at the bank.

That’s a philosophy that is shared by Richmond’s Dear Animal Centre. And as its name suggests, Dear Animal Centre is dedicated to caring for your pets as if they were part of the family.

“Our goal is to treat our clients as we would our own families, and to treat our clients’ pets as though they were our own,” says Dr. Varinder Dabri, owner of The Dear Animal Hospital. “Being of service to our patients is the mission of our practice.”

Centrally located in a brand new facility in Richmond’s Blundell Centre, Dear Animal Centre has been caring for people’s pets since 1975. From their clean and comfortable surroundings, the practice offers a variety of services from emergency care and surgery to microchipping, dental and even grooming. The main focus, however, is always on the animal.

Dr. Dabri’s devotion to helping pets stems from a long-standing respect for animals and a determination to care for those least able to care for themselves.

“My main focus is always on the patient,” says Dr. Dabri. “If a pet is in pain, I won’t send it home without treatment. I try to accommodate everybody, even if they don’t have money on them, if they have an emergency I still treat their pet, no question.”

The sleep specialist would then offer a test that involves spending the night in a hospital sleep lab. Once there, the patient was attached to 15 or more wires and contraptions to monitor sleep, pulse, breathing and the presence of snoring. This was an excellent way to diagnose sleep apnea but often involved significant waiting periods.

Today, sleep clinics such as Coastal Sleep can offer an in-home test without the wait time and with less cumbersome testing devices.

article continues below

""We provide a small monitor that you use at home,"" says Paul Sweeney, President of Coastal Sleep. ""You wear a small nasal device that measures your airflow and a band on your chest to measure the movements. The third device is a pulse oximeter that measures your heart rate and oxygen level. That’s it.""

Should breathing stop during the night, says Paul, the monitor senses that the chest is moving, but there's no airflow in the nose.

""That would indicate an obstruction in the airway,"" he explains. ""The data we get from the monitor tells us how many apnea events are happening per hour. We can then usually determine if there's a mild, moderate, or severe case of sleep apnea at that point.""

The procedure is similar to the hospital sleep test and, while not quite as accurate, provides a very good screening tool.

""If there are other medical issues or if the test results are inconclusive, we'll usually recommend that patients be referred to a sleep specialist for further testing.""

According to Paul, approximately 75 percent of the population suffers from sleep apnea without even being aware.

""It's very prevalent,” he says. “People with diabetes or heart issues have up to a 50 percent chance of suffering from sleep apnea and if you have drug resistant hypertension, there's an 83 percent of having sleep apnea. At Coastal Sleep we also see people with pacemakers, congestive heart failure, and addiction to narcotics. These conditions are a good reason to be tested, at least to rule out the possibility of sleep apnea.""

Another demographic that can suffer from sleep apnea is the menopausal or post-menopausal woman.

""This particular group of women are often undiagnosed,"" says Marielle Dickson, a Registered Respiratory Therapist at Coastal Sleep. ""They often have vague symptoms: they're not heavy snorers, and while they may present with weight gain, they have little to no change in activity levels. They may have mild depression or anxiety and are often feeling tired all the time.""

As a preferred vendor of both the Vancouver Coastal Health Authority and Fraser Valley Health, Coastal Sleep offers diagnostic testing free of charge.

Then after studying The BC Funeral Service Foundation program for Embalmer and Funeral Director, he found his true vocation: working as a funeral director, a profession he joined seven years ago. “I knew I could help vulnerable people by being compassionate, listening well and helping them navigate a new and confusing process,” he explains.

In December 2017, he opened his own funeral home, Can-Trust-Funeral Ltd., to serve the Richmond community that he’s been a part of for the past 25 years. “I know this area and can help its people in a way big companies can’t,” he says. “I’m knowledgeable about what families need, have an extensive network including local suppliers, and can help organize funerals that are personalized, straightforward and affordable.”

Chan says one of his advantages over the big funeral homes is that he can provide all the items a family might need, such as caskets, urns, upright headstones, flat bronze markers and wreaths, at an affordable price, so they don’t need to deal with multiple vendors. He also delivers the personal touch – he meets loved ones at a location they choose, and is available 24/7. “I can speak Cantonese and Mandarin, which is very important in the Richmond community,” he says. “It’s especially an advantage for elderly people who might not speak good English. They need to feel like they are in control of the process of arranging their loved one’s funeral, and doing things through a translator can make that challenging.”

Overall, Chan’s goal is to make this part of your life as straightforward as possible, allowing you to take things at your own pace, making sure you understand what’s happening, and ensuring that you have a service that honours your loved one. “Every funeral service is unique and personalized. You don’t have to follow a pattern. The only thing that matters is what suits you and honours the person who passed,” he says.

Victoria Warfield did just that with her mom and dad.

Impressed by the classical music she listened to on the 78 speed records from jukeboxes her father repaired, the youngster knew exactly where her future lay.

""I had access to all of this wonderful music and I wanted to play it,” says Warfield, president of the Richmond Branch of BC Registered Music Teachers’ Association. “So, I told my parents I wanted a piano.”

The trouble was, her parents fulfilled her request with a toy piano the young Warfield literally reduced to kindling in frustration.

Eventually, it was replaced with a proper one, which was no mean feat as the cost was steep back in the 1950s for a family with five young children.

“Still, they made it happen,” says Warfield who references the story as a means to emphasize the importance music and proper instruction can make in a child’s development.

“It sets you apart, in some ways,” says Warfield, 62, who has been teaching piano for five decades. “For one, it’s demanding of your time and you have to learn time management at an early age.”

And young musicians develop one-on-one relationships with adults - their music teachers - at a much earlier time, making the young student more socially mature at an early age.

“Even today, I see it with the younger kids. They have a very mature ability to have a conversation with an adult, because they are working closely with their music teacher,” Warfield explains. “In most instances, in a school classroom situation youngsters don’t interact with an adult in that way.

“And that gives them a maturity beyond their years socially, which is a really important characteristic that helps carry them forward.”

Music is also a great outlet for developing creativity.

“Once you figure out what you have to do with your chosen instrument to make a sound, then the creativity kicks in,” Warfield says, adding problem-solving and increased motor skills are other benefits a musical education brings.

Seeing young musicians make that journey to acquire those attributes is immensely satisfying, Warfield says.

“It’s a satisfaction knowing they are becoming the person they were meant to be,” she says.

So, how do you decide on the right teacher to guide your budding musician?

Contact the local branch of the BC Registered Music Teachers Association. That way you can be assured of choosing someone who is highly qualified and experienced.

As the Korean company enters the Canadian market with a new store in Richmond, its products are proving increasingly popular with women across the country.

Susan Fong said she received Racinne’s Youth Power Neck Emulsion as a gift. The mother-of-two from Vancouver, who has a full-time job, was tired of researching skin-care products and was happy to try something new. After using the emulsion regularly, she was happy to notice the fine lines on her neck disappearing. She was also pretty stoked that the bottle lasted her two whole months!

In Mississauga, Ont., Debbie Skinner was also getting positive results from her Youth Power Neck Emulsion. In her mid-50s, Debbie had long been hesitant to use neck cream, but was encouraged by the natural ingredients in Racinne’s products and that the fact that they’re cruelty-free.

Meanwhile, Tyatt Leung was feeling like she was aging faster after having her second child. The mom from Richmond Hill, Ont., tried numerous facials, masks and creams on the market but nothing seemed to work for her. Then she discovered Racinne’s Lady S home spa device, which is designed to rejuvenate the skin and soften fine lines. Tyatt was tempted by the affordable price and gave it a try. Within weeks, she said, her complexion had improved. She was so impressed that she bought a Lady S for her mother.

It was truly an authentic and original tea experience. Soon after finishing the last sip, we agreed to call our adventure a T-Go Tea experience.”

In February 2017, Chen and Liu opened the first branch of T-Go Tea, sourcing the leaves from the Taiwanese farms they visited. “The environment there is well-preserved with clean air and water,” says Chen. “We knew that by being particular about the source of our ingredients we could offer customers an elevated experience.”

That’s not the only way T-Go Tea is different. “Most places brew up in advance,” says Chen. “We use a specially modified espresso machine to make tea to order, which delivers a fresher taste. And we’re not just fussy about our leaves. We don’t use artificial powders, syrups or colours – instead it’s whole coffee beans, fresh milk (dairy, almond and other varieties) fruit jam, fruit sugar, sea salt, whipping cream, and fresh fruits and vegetables.

There are many different types of tea to choose from, such as milk, honey fruit, sea salt milk and freshly brewed espresso latte. You can also add grass jelly and egg pudding, both made locally; and coconut jelly and tapioca pearls, from Taiwan. Chen is a big fan of the sea salt cappuccino. “It’s a great way to satisfy a dessert craving without being sugary,” he says.

The menu also has top Taiwanese street desserts and fresh smoothies. “The Egg Bubble Waffle goes well with all our drinks,” says Chen. “It’s crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside. When you buy it with a drink, you get $1 off, so your waffle is just $2.50.” The final piece? Decor. “Conventional bubble tea shops have a plasticky, modern look,” says Chen. “Ours is thoughtfully designed, with art displayed on the wall. It goes with our belief that tea brewing is an art, and needs an environment to honour that.”

T-Go Tea is at 4720 Mcclelland Road #1810 (Central at Garden City Plaza near the new Walmart in Richmond). Enjoy Happy Hour from Monday to Friday, 8pm to 9pm, where you get 50% off six signature drinks. Find out more at Tgotea.com, Facebook and Instagram.",[]
264,richmond-news,https://www.richmond-news.com/standout/language-and-brain-development-bilingualism-is-a-good-thing-1.2372369,Language and brain development: bilingualism is a good thing,[],,"One of the common myths that educators in the Conseil scolaire francophone (Francophone school district 93) hear is that learning two languages at once can hinder a child's development.

This was the thinking back in the 1960s when several flawed studies seemed to indicate that bilingualism could be a handicap to a child. The thought at the time was that learning two languages simultaneously meant that the child was spending too much time and energy distinguishing between them both.

article continues below

The popular logic now is that the effort required to switch between two languages may actually trigger more activity in the part of the brain that is responsible for executive function– specifically problem solving, switching between tasks, and the ability to focus while filtering out irrelevant information.

The use of language requires using both hemispheres of the brain – the left side, which is analytical and logical, and the right side, which is more active in emotional and social responses.

Children learn a second language quicker and easier than adults because the plasticity of their brains lets them use both the left and right hemispheres. In adults, language is lateralized to one hemisphere, usually the left.

In addition, bilingualism expert François Grosjean notes that the myth that the language spoken at home has a negative effect on the language learned at school is also incorrect. In fact, says Grosjean, the home language can be used as a linguistic base for learning aspects of a second language.

In other words, an education in French might actually help your child understand the grammar and structure of the English language better.

""Kids who learn a second language have an advantage over native speakers,"" says Réjean Gosselin, Principal of l'école des Naviagateurs, a CSF elementary school in Richmond. ""They learn the structure and the grammar of a language. They don't guess where the verb or the adjective goes in a sentence. In our native language, sometimes we get lazy. So kids speaking French who learn English don't guess. They have learned the rules and they know how to apply them. It's the same for English kids who learn French.""

The students heralded from UCMAS Richmond a globally recognized and scientifically proven development program based on mental math and abacus for children aged 4-13 years.

Among those who were recognized for their achievements was Lexi Ong, a student at William Bridge Elementary School Richmond, who was crowned the Canadian National Champion in all three categories she participated in – Visual, Listening & Flash.

Five other students from Richmond - Carson Lam, Dywonne Calamiong, Keenan Guevarra, Lorenzo Lachica and Shane Liam So - were also crowned National Champions in the Visual Competition.

In total more than 5700 students from across Canada participated in the annual competition which provides UCMAS students with an opportunity to compete in their respective categories and be recognized for their excellence.

At the competition, which tests speed and accuracy in arithmetic, the students get eight minutes to solve as many as 150-200 math questions. The math questions include numeric calculations of multiple rows and columns that require students to calculate at a rate faster than using a calculator.

It’s a great example of the skills that students can learn at UCMAS (Universal Concept of Mental Arithmetic System), an abacus based system that is proven to help improve cognitive skills such as focus, concentration, memory retention, listening, multitasking as well as confidence.

“We are so proud of all of our students who took part in June’s competition,” says Krishna Kumar, Director of UCMAS Richmond. “Their success is a testament to the hard work and dedication they’ve put into studies that has furnished them with the skills that are crucial to success in all areas of study and in daily life.”

UCMAS is proven to enhance not just the mental math calculating skills of children but also their concentration, focus, memory, retention capacity, listening skills, speed and accuracy. To find out more visit www.ucmas.ca, call 604-248-7575 or email orient@ucmas.ca",[]

Nigel Matthews spent his childhood in car junkyards.

article continues below

""I'd work on scrapped cars,"" Matthews said.

Then, when the longtime Richmond resident was 17, his father bought him a 1970 MG midget.

""I still have it,"" said Matthews. ""Although I took it all apart to restore it. It's in a million pieces today. I'll get to it when I retire.

""I'm having too much fun to retire though.""

Matthews is ""living his dream"" as a judge for the Concours d'Elengance car shows, the most exclusive events of the year for classic car collectors and automobile enthusiasts.

The News reached Matthews in Pebble Beach where he's judging at the most prestigious luxury car competition in the world -- the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance.

However, he'll be judging closer to home in September at Vancouver's Luxury + Supercar Weekend.

By day, the 57-year-old is an executive at Hagerty Insurance, the largest collector-vehicle insurer in the world. Then, a number of times a year he jet sets to some of the most lavish spots in the United States and Europe to hob knob with the rich and famous to judge their opulent cars.

Today, on the luxury car judging stage, he's considered a world authority on Alfa Romeos.

Prior to that, Matthews spent two decades doing restoration and collision work exclusively on luxury cars such as Ferraris, Maseratis, Aston Martins, Bentley's and Rolls Royce -- modern, classics as well as exotic sports cars.

When asked how he snared this coveted position, Matthews said, ""I kind of fell into it. It's who you know and who introduces you to the people in the know.""

""I came down to Pebble Beach one year as someone's guest and met the chief judge,"" he said. ""It so happened that the chief judge is a Formula 1 fanatic and my younger brother was very much involved with the Formula 1 in England... so we had something in common.""

While in Pebble Beach, he said the winners of this coveted car show don't win a cash prize. Rather, what a win from Concours d'Elegance gets you is prestige.

""A Best of Show win can add considerable value to your car, between 30 to 40 per cent,"" he added.

The value of the cars he adjudicates is staggering.

""For example, a 1962 Ferrari 250GTO that I'm judging on Sunday is easily worth $32 million. There are so few around. Those don't normally change hands.""

Matthews says that fashion designer Ralph Lauren owns a late 1930s Bugatti 578SC Atlantic, now on display in a museum in Paris. (Matthews has seen it a number of times.)

""It's probably worth $52 million,"" he added. ""Bugatti only made four of them and one was destroyed in the 30s."" (Jay Leno owns one of them.)

The tales behind these exclusive cars are as interesting as the staggering amount of money collectors pay for them.

Case in point: The tragic story of the third Atlantic. A married Frenchman, Monsieur Chatard, purchased the car for his mistress. Well, it appears the philanderer was teaching another attractive blonde how to drive it when they were both killed in a horrific train crossing accident, which totaled the car. In 1965, its remains were discovered in a French junkyard.

""Many of the original panels and components were salvaged from the wreck and it was rebuilt,"" said Matthews. ""That car wouldn't have as much value as the others, roughly $30 million.""

Matthews hopes to build the Vancouver show into ""something really spectacular.""

""There's a void here in B.C. for this type of event,"" he said, adding that there'll be 100 years of cars on display.

""This event is focused on the 125th anniversary of Mercedes Benz, so there will be many of those, including the gull wing Mercedes and the roadsters which are called 300SLK coupe and roadsters from the mid-50s,"" said Matthews. ""It's also the 50th anniversary of the E-Type Jaguar, so there will be a fabulous display of those, as well as the Rolls Royce's 100th anniversary of the Spirit of Ecstasy, which is the mascot on the front of every Rolls Royce.""

He said the judging will be done a little differently in Vancouver than in Pebble Beach.

""It's more about flowing lines, elegance, beauty, design and the vehicle's place in history rather than all the nuts and bolts,"" he said. ""The deciding factor could be as simple as which one the judge would like to take home.""

During Vancouver's Luxury + Supercar Weekend, there will be 16 local judges -- people in the luxury automotive industry as well as collectors.

""People like me, who are afflicted with the same disease as me,"" he quipped.

""It's incurable, it's as if car nut oil runs through your veins instead of blood.""

Attendees at the Vancouver show will see the fastest car in the world, the Bugatti 2011 Veyron.

""It does 257 miles per hour, has a 1,001 horsepower and sells for $2.2 million before taxes,"" he said. ""I've had the pleasure to drive it twice and it's incredible. I would compare it to the Concord in the aviation world.

""I can't ever imagine any other car manufacturer creating another one like the Veyron. The engineers at Bugatti only built it as an exercise to show the car world that they could do it. They actually lose money on the sale of every one of them.""

There will also be the new MP4-12 Super sports car on display by British automaker, McLaren, which makes Formula 1 racecars.

""This will be the first sighting of this one in Canada,"" said Matthews.

Mercedes will also unveil the SLS-AMG roadster convertible.

""That sells for a cool $150,000 to $200,000,"" said Matthews.

Provincial health officer Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix announced July 15 that there were 21 new cases in the past 24 hours, including two cases that they call ""epi-linked,"" or presumed cases that have not been proven through testing but are being treated as official cases.

The province has now recorded 3,149 cases since the novel coronavirus first appeared in B.C. in late January.

More than 87.4% of those infected, or 2,753 people, have recovered. Of those who haven't, 189 people have died and 207 people are actively fighting the virus. Only 14 people are hospitalized, with five of those in intensive care units. The rest are self-isolating at home. There were no new deaths recorded in the past 24 hours.

Recording at least 20 new COVID-19 cases in a 24-hour period has become common in B.C., and Henry said yesterday that she found that number ""distressing,"" even though, she added, the good news is that the province knows where the clusters of infection are, many of the infections are linked and the number is not really that large given the province's population of more than five million residents.

The numbers in the past week were:

• 20 new cases on July 9;

• 25 new cases on July 10;

• 21 new cases on July 11;

• 20 new cases on July 12;

• 21 new cases on July 13;

• 13 new cases on July 14; and now

• 21 new cases on July 15.

In June, the number of daily new cases many times was in the single digits.

""There is one active community outbreak, in addition to several community exposure events,"" Henry and Dix said. ""There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks.""

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,023 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1,659 in Fraser Health;

• 135 in Island Health;

• 216 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

• 51 people who reside outside Canada.

The Federal Bureau of Prisons is expected to take Sidoo into custody on September 23 and release him from a Pacific Northwest area facility just before Christmas.

article continues below

Sidoo, 61, appeared online via Zoom in front of United States District Judge Nathaniel Gorton of the United States District Court for District of Massachusetts, as well as his lawyers and prosecutors. He wore a plaid suit while sitting in an office space inside his $31.7 million home in Vancouver’s Point Grey neighbourhood.

Sidoo, now a convicted felon, initially pled innocent to fraud and money laundering charges; he teared up before being sentenced and read a prepared statement:

“The last several months have been the hardest in my entire life and today I accept the court’s decision without reservation. No words can express how sorry I am for my decisions and actions that led to this day. I make no excuses, your honour. I broke the law and pled guilty and I now must pay for my actions.

“To my wife and boys, all I ever wanted was your love and respect and to be a good role model. And I know I have made a terrible mistake that has deeply affected our family. To my friends and colleagues and former teammates over the years, I am deeply ashamed today. To the young men and women who looked up to me as a role model, you deserve better. To the court and all of you, I wish to apologize for my actions.

“I will serve my sentence and am committed to returning to the community and doing everything possible to make a positive impact. I hope in time people will not judge me for the worst mistake in my life but for the work in the days, weeks and years ahead in which I am committed to being a better man.”

Gorton told Sidoo he was “impressed” by the businessman’s “obvious remorse.”

But Gorton pointed out two omissions in Sidoo’s statement.

“You expect to put this behind you and go forward and make up for what you called mistakes. I would call it a crime, not a mistake, but nevertheless, it is important that you acknowledge it and realize how many constituencies you have disappointed,” said the judge.

Sidoo also did not explicitly acknowledge that his crimes resulted in two students missing an opportunity to attend the universities his sons, Dylan Sidoo and Jordan Sidoo, were admitted to.

“What you accomplished, along with getting them into college, is to deprive two other deserving students of admittance into those universities — an act that is the very antithesis of one you want to be known for,” said Gorton.

Likewise, United States Attorney Andrew Lelling submitted to Gorton: “Sidoo engaged in serious criminal conduct involving fraud and deception that stretched over multiple years.

“His crimes warrant significant punishment. By engaging in the scheme, with [scheme mastermind Rick Singer] and others, Sidoo was able to steal two college admissions slots for his sons, including one from the University of California at Berkeley, one of the top public universities in the nation.”

Sidoo, said Gorton, “committed a crime that displayed an unbelievable lack of integrity, morality and common sense.

“You have let your selfish desire, your pride and your enormous wealth overcome all of what you apparently want to stand for with your works of charity,” Gorton told Sidoo.

Sidoo’s philanthropy, derived from his earnings in the capital markets, was central to his sentencing defense. According to Sidoo he has donated several million dollars to charitable causes, such as the University of B.C. football program.

In pleading guilty to fraud, Sidoo avoided a maximum prison term of 20 years and prosecutors subsequently agreed to 90 days behind bars, plus a $250,000 fine and one-year of supervised release, which will not be enforced in Canada by the U.S. Probation Department. Prosecutors also agreed to drop the money laundering charge.

The prison Sidoo goes to is expected to have harsher conditions since his options are limited due to his foreign citizenship. His attorney Martin Weinberg said he is expected to spend 14 days in isolation in a “maximum security setting,” due to COVID-19.

Sidoo will get four days credit for time already served. If he serves the full 90 days he will be released December 17 but will have to spend 14 days in isolation at home should B.C. public health rules for international travellers and COVID-19 continue into the fall.

Gorton said Sidoo’s crime would normally warrant more time in jail but there are mitigating circumstances, such as his remorse, lack of criminal record, philanthropy and “collateral consequences,” such as not being able to enter the U.S. as a felon and being stripped last month of his Order of B.C. medal for community service. Sidoo’s attorneys also previously noted he did not directly pay the universities but that his fraud was limited to cheating on the tests.

The former B.C. Lions football player worked as a stock broker in the 1990s and an investment banker between 2000 and 2010. Since 2010 he has made millions of dollars directing a handful of public companies that have failed to generate wealth for retail investors.

Sidoo was arrested March 8, 2019, in San Jose, California, on charges by the U.S. Department of Justice of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering related to the high-profile U.S. college admissions and bribery scandal, brought to light by a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe dubbed Operation Varsity Blues.

One of dozens of parents to be charged, Sidoo initially pled innocent to paying $200,000 total to scheme mastermind William ‘Rick’ Singer, who hired corrupt exam expert Mark Riddell to take Dylan and Jordan’s SAT exams, in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Sidoo also helped falsify one of his son Jordan’s university applications in October 2013 with an essay that originally included a fake claim of Jordan being held up at gunpoint by gangsters, while he was purported to be an intern for an anti-gang organization.

Co-conspirators Singer and Riddell pled guilty last year in exchange for cooperating with the government’s investigation.

The guilty parties in the case, who used Singer’s criminal services, were generally well-off individuals. Celebrities such as actress Lori Loughlin and her clothing designer husband Mossimo Gianulli and actress Felicity Huffman also pled guilty for related crimes and brought much media attention to the investigation.

Sidoo’s sons had no involvement in their father’s crime.

Jordan is now a 2018 history graduate from University of California Berkeley. Dylan graduated in cinematic arts in 2016 from the University of Southern California (USC). The two previously attended Vancouver’s prestigious St. George’s School.

Neither university has announced whether or not their degrees will remain valid. Dylan, according to the sentencing documents, had scored a 1,460/2,400 SAT score until Riddell, using a fake ID in December 2011, bumped up the score to 1,700, which was high enough for Dylan to enter Chapman University (and later transfer to USC). Riddell then scored 2,280/2,400 for Jordan in December 2012, paving the way to Berkley.

Riddell also took a high school test for Dylan. The B.C. Ministry of Education has issued no statement on how its testing process was so vulnerable to fraud.

Both sons have since entered into penny stock promotion with their father.

270,richmond-news,https://www.richmond-news.com/news/huawei-hopeful-it-can-provide-5g-to-canada-despite-trump-five-eyes-pressure-1.24170835,"Huawei hopeful it can provide 5G to Canada despite Trump, Five Eyes pressure",[],,"OTTAWA — Huawei Canada says it is collateral damage in the Trump administration's trade war with China and remains hopeful that it might still be able to sell next-generation internet equipment to Canada.

That characterization comes one day after Britain became the last of Canada's ""Five Eyes"" intelligence-sharing allies to ban the Chinese telecommunications firm from its 5G wireless internet.

article continues below

The next generation of wireless internet technology is to be dramatically faster than the current standard, with more bandwidth and faster response times. It's expected to be crucial to technologies such as autonomous vehicles and remote medicine.

Alykhan Velshi, Huawei Canada's vice president of corporate affairs, says the company hopes the Trudeau government's ongoing 5G review steers clear of political machinations by administration of U.S. President Donald Trump to undermine the company.

""We see ourselves as being caught in the middle of the U.S.-China trade war. Canada is also unfortunately caught in the middle of it,"" Velshi said in an interview on Wednesday.

""That is the context in which a lot of announcements and decisions are made, as the Trump administration is demanding that everyone pick a side whether it is actually in their interest to go all in on one side or that other.""

Britain's decision brought it firmly in line with Trump's campaign to have Huawei banned from allied countries, including Canada.

The United States views Huawei as a security threat and says its equipment and technology would serve as a back door for China's communist leaders and military to spy on other countries as they adopt 5G technology — a charge the company firmly denies.

The Trudeau government has delayed a long-awaited decision on whether to allow Huawei to participate in Canada's new 5G network largely because of China's ongoing imprisonment of two Canadian men, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor.

Kovrig and Spavor were arrested nine days after Canada detained Huawei's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, on an American arrest warrant in December 2018. That move is widely seen as retaliation by China to force Canada to release Meng.

Velshi, a lawyer and former Conservative political staffer, called the case against Meng a ""politically driven"" prosecution by Trump, and pointed to a 2018 musing by the president that she could be used as a bargaining chip in his trade negotiation with China.

He said Meng will be vindicated by the Canadian courts when the extent of Trump's political motivation is properly presented.

(The Green party issued a statement along the same lines Wednesday, saying the United States is abusing its extradition treaty with Canada for political purposes and calling on the Canadian government to demand U.S. charges against Meng be dropped.)

But at the same time, Velshi also expressed sympathy for Kovrig and Spavor and reiterated the view of the Canadian arm of his company that diplomats can somehow win their freedom.

""Like all Canadians we're concerned about their detention, we're concerned about their treatment and we want to see them home as soon as possible.""

The tensions between Beijing and Washington intensified on Wednesday following Tuesday's announcement by Britain that Huawei would be excluded from work on the 5G network because U.S. sanctions made it impossible to ensure the safety of Chinese-supplied equipment.

The Trump administration decided in May to block non-U.S. companies from using American technology to produce processor chips and other components for Huawei without Washington's approval.

On Wednesday, the Chinese government accused Britain of colluding with the U.S. to hurt Huawei. The Trump administration fired back by announcing travel bans on employees of Huawei and other Chinese companies that the U.S. determines are assisting authoritarian governments in violating human rights, including against Uighurs in western China.

Velshi said Huawei has faith in the Canadian government's ongoing 5G review and the company has nothing to say about how long it has taken for a decision to be made.

In the meantime, Velshi said that despite the tensions between Beijing and Ottawa, Huawei's revenues in Canada grew in 2019, as did its workforce, which stands at about 1,200 employees. Velshi said the company has not yet made public its 2019 financials.

""We attribute that growth to the fact that our customers … have largely stood by us and continued to buy our products,"" said Velshi.

David Reed, Britain's deputy high commissioner to Canada, had no comment on what Canada should do next, but noted the two countries enjoy strong co-operation in the Five Eyes, which also includes Australia and New Zealand.

Reed said all countries must focus on allowing more companies to thrive in the 5G market.

""The reason we're in this position is there's a global market failure,"" Reed said in an interview. ""That's the conversation we started, particularly with Five Eyes partners, earlier in the year and we're trying to make progress on that.""

John Power, the spokesman for Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains, gave no indication as to when the government would make its decision on which companies can sell 5G gear in Canada. He reiterated that the government would ""not compromise on matters of national security"" but declined to reference specific companies.

""Our government's review will consider technical and security factors, including advice from our security agencies and consider decisions from our allies and partners,"" he said in a statement, adding that it would take into account ""important domestic and international considerations.""

In one cluster, at least 17 cases have been traced to a group of people who met up in Kelowna, some from the Interior and Alberta, others from the Lower Mainland.

“There are a number of people who have been exposed in those events,” said Henry Tuesday.

More troubling still is the emergence of new cases at the Krazy Cherry Fruit Company in Oliver, where two have been identified among migrant workers. They were among 62 cases identified in B.C. between Friday and Monday.

“Public health teams are monitoring the situation closely and have placed restrictions on those living and working on the farm to limit the potential for further transmission,” said Dr. Henry in a written statement today.

But others have expressed concerns that not enough is being done to prevent outbreaks among vulnerable groups. Where newly arrived immigrants were disproportionately affected at earlier outbreaks at poultry plants in Coquitlam, others say migrant agricultural workers still run higher risks due to inadequate housing.

“As anticipated,” said Byron Cruz of Sanctuary Health, an organization that works to protect migrant workers from predatory practices. “We knew that something was going to happen because the situation for housing in that farm is terrible. They were all crowded.”

‘WAY ABOVE MY COMFORT ZONE’

Yesterday, Dr. Henry warned 25 cases a day was “distressing” and “cautionary to us.” And while not unexpected due to the increased travel and social interaction of phase 3, she said “That’s way above my comfort zone.”

Dr. Henry urged anyone who attended Canada Day parties in the vicinity of the Kelowna cluster to self-monitor for even the mildest of symptoms, noting that anyone can be tested should they feel they’ve been exposed.

Just how quickly a province or state can backslide has been painted in stark relief among our neighbours to the south.

In comments to the press Tuesday, Health Minister Adrian Dix pointed to surges in several U.S. states where record breaking daily caseloads in several states have led jurisdictions like California to re-introduce physical distancing protocols, in what Dix described as “lockdown 2.0.”

“All our neighbouring jurisdictions continue to see an increase, whether it’s our neighbouring province to the east, Alberta, or others, Washington, Oregon and California, in Nevada, Arizona and in other American states — we’ve seen record days of new cases of COVID-19 recently,” said Dix.

Here in B.C., Henry said that on Monday, she checked how weekly caseloads are tracking with the province’s modelling that suggests British Columbians keep their social contacts to 65% of normal.

“We are still skirting that line. The RT, the reproductive number, is hovering around one… which is sort of pushing the limits of where we need to be,” she said.

While health officials work to contain the outbreak in Oliver, it’s unclear how a potential surge in cases will affect that calculation, and Byron Cruz of Sanctuary Health said he expects more cases to crop up in coming days due to their tight living quarters.

What is clear is the more cases are contained to a single cluster, the easier they are to track.

“This is going to be our dance over the next few months, where we do what we can do, we travel, we have those social interactions, but we do it in a thoughtful way so we do it with the people we know we’re with,” said Dr. Henry.",[]

The man and woman, who have asked not to be identified, were taken in by what appeared to be a call from their grandson in dire need of help.

article continues below

“The guy sounded so much like our grandson. If he had said ‘Grandma,’ we’d have known [it wasn’t him] right away, but he said ‘Nan’ and so does my grandson,” said the man.

The imposter grandson, who used their grandson’s name, called on Monday and told them he had been driving a friend’s car and struck a vehicle with Quebec licence plates that had turned sharply in front of him.

The fake grandson went on to say he had been taken to jail, but a judge would free him if he could pay for the damage, estimated to be $5,000. The grandparents were told to send money to the car’s owner in Montreal.

“I wasn’t cluing in at all [that this was a scam], he sounded so much like our grandson,” the man said.

The dutiful grandparents then took cash from their bank and went to the Bank of Montreal and using an account number the scammer had provided via an accomplice posing as a lawyer, they sent money to a BMO branch in downtown Montreal.

“The kid said, ‘Please don’t tell Dad,’ ” the man said. It wasn’t until he later talked to his grandson that it became clear they had been scammed.

The couple has since been in touch with police and the Bank of Montreal, which they say has been very helpful.

“They are doing their best to try and get the money back,” said the man, who thinks the scammers “took a shot in the dark and got lucky.”

But according to the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre, it’s likely the scammers mined information like the grandson’s name from social media to make the pitch more convincing.

The centre calls these types of scams “the emergency scam.” It preys on the fear of a loved one being hurt or in trouble. The scammer claims to be someone you know and says they need money immediately. They tend to use scenarios like needing bail money because they’ve been arrested, or being in a car accident, or having trouble returning from a foreign country.

The targets are often seniors and the scammer pretends to be a grandchild, who begs them not to tell their parents that they’re in trouble, the Anti-Fraud Centre said. As a result, the grandparent doesn’t find out until after they’ve sent the money that their grandchild was not the person who asked for help.

Const. Cam MacIntyre said scammers will go to any lengths to defraud a victim.

“They will pose as a family member, a trusted member of the public, or even the police. We strongly recommend that people never deposit money into accounts of people or entities they do know personally,” he said.

“It’s so important to verify where your money is going. Call a family member, a friend, or the police if you are suspicious.”

The Anti-Fraud Centre says there were 18,803 reports of fraud, and 6,671 victims reporting losses of $22.6 million in Canada in the first four months of this year.

MacIntyre suggests if you are in the process of providing financial information or sending money to potential fraudsters, stop immediately.

“Contact your financial institutions and ensure all payments that you have not authorized are stopped. Inform them of the fraud and change both passwords and access information,” he said.

Suspected frauds can be reported to your local police or the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre at 1-888-495-8501.

Kevin McIntosh, who launched the petition on change.org in late May, sent it to politicians on both sides of the border, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump, on Monday.

article continues below

“I propose that the current list of essential reasons for persons to cross the border between Canada and the U.S. be expanded to include those persons owning personal property outside of their home jurisdiction,” McIntosh told lawmakers.

McIntosh, who is now under 14-day quarantine at home following an odyssey to get his boat out of the Point Roberts Marina, told the Optimist he expects the political powers that be to expand the list of essential reasons to cross the border into the American peninsula, hopefully prior to an expected extension of the border closure next week.

Earlier this month McIntosh flew from YVR to Sea-Tac, drove a rental car to Bellingham and then took a chartered flight to Point Roberts, where he prepped his vessel to sail back to Canada.

He said with his boat now back in Canada, his personal situation has been resolved, but he’d like to see others who signed the petition get access to their boats and cottages.

He’s hopeful politicians will agree to expand the definition of essential travel so Canadians with property in Point Roberts can cross the border, so long as they don’t have any contact with local residents and don’t stay for any length of time.

Many who have signed the petition own cottages and worry that without regular maintenance they will fall into disrepair. They raise concerns over rats and raccoons causing damage to vacant buildings as well as the possibility of leaks and other issues. There are also worries about insurance not being valid if structures are unattended for months on end.

Many suggest that crossing the border to check on property should be deemed essential travel so long as those who cross only go to and from their properties.

Delta MP Carla Qualtrough previously told the Optimist she has “a ton of sympathy” for Canadians who can’t get to their cottages and boats, but isn’t sure when they’ll be able to cross the line again.

Qualtrough said she has been in talks with cabinet colleagues in Ottawa as well as people locally in an effort to find a solution that might suit the geographic anomaly, but has yet to come up with one.

“Unfortunately, I don’t see a world where we don’t treat the whole border the same,” she told the Optimist when asked about the unique circumstances in Point Roberts.

She said the best hope for those with property in Point Roberts might be a gradual reopening of the border by region or by type of visitor that could broaden the definition of essential travel.",[]
275,richmond-news,https://www.richmond-news.com/news/if-the-canucks-get-a-compliance-buyout-is-it-obvious-who-they-should-pick-1.24109926,"If the Canucks get a compliance buyout, is it obvious who they should pick?",['Daniel Wagner'],,"About a month ago, the NHL announced that the salary cap would increase significantly from this season’s $81.5 million USD. For the 2020-21 season, the cap was estimated to be $84 million to $88.2 million, depending on a few factors.

That has changed.

article continues below

The suspension caused by COVID-19 and the uncertain future of the 2019-20 season leaves next season’s salary cap in serious jeopardy.

That’s because the cap is tied to league revenues. There’s meant to be a 50/50 split in revenues between the owners and the players. If there’s a drop in revenue for the owners — from a loss of gate revenue for unplayed or unattended games, unplayed playoff games, or a crashing Canadian dollar — then the NHL’s Collective Bargaining Agreement leads to less money for the players the following season in the form of a reduced salary cap.

A significant increase in the salary cap would have been a major relief for a team close to the cap like the Vancouver Canucks. The Canucks were set to have a tough time navigating the cap next season, thanks to the combination of a few highly-paid veterans, performance bonuses for young stars rolling over from this current season, Roberto Luongo’s cap recapture penalty, and several restricted and unrestricted free agents they need to re-sign.

If the salary cap went up, it’s possible the Canucks wouldn’t have to choose between UFAs Jacob Markstrom, Tyler Toffoli and Chris Tanev, but could re-sign all three. A flat cap — one that stayed at $81.5 million — would force the Canucks to choose two and possibly lose another player like Troy Stecher or Josh Leivo.

If the cap goes down? Then the Canucks are in some serious trouble, with difficult decisions to make that will undoubtedly make the team worse for next season. And they’re not the only ones: plenty of other teams would feel the cap crunch from this unprecedented situation.

Potential solutions could include an artificially inflated cap, but one option that has come up in NHL circles is compliance buyouts, with Brian Burke discussing it recently on Oilers Now, a radio program with Global News.

“I’ve heard discussion of compliance buyouts to help teams get to this new cap, to solve some of their problems,” said Burke. “In the last CBA, each team got two cap-compliance buyouts which were exempt from the cap.”

A compliance buyout would differ from a regular buyout in that it wouldn’t cost money against the salary cap. For instance, the Canucks will still have a little over $1 million against next season’s cap from buying out Ryan Spooner, but the Canucks bought out Keith Ballard and David Booth in 2013 and 2014 at no cost to their cap as compliance buyouts after the 2012-13 lockout.

If teams do get a compliance buyout, it seems obvious who the Canucks would use it on. Loui Eriksson has a $6 million cap hit for two more seasons following this one and has found himself in an increasingly-diminished role, playing primarily as a shutdown, defensive forward, with little-to-no contributions offensively.

The Canucks do have other options, however. Brandon Sutter has lost several steps and has a $4.375 million cap hit next season. They could be proactive and buy out Tyler Myers’ $6 million contract for the next four seasons before his play starts to decline. Cutting their losses on Micheal Ferland’s $3.5 million cap hit for the next three seasons might be smart. They might even be tempted to buy out Sben Baertschi’s $3.37 million contract with him buried in the AHL.

Do any of those supersede Eriksson? Probably not. Where it gets interesting is if teams get two buyouts, as they did in 2013 and 2014. Buying out Eriksson would be a given, then, but who would be the second buyout? Sutter has just one year left on his contract, Ferland’s cap hit isn’t overly onerous, and Tyler Myers is still a good, useful player.

One compliance buyout would make it far easier for the Canucks to re-sign Markstrom and Tanev. Two might mean re-signing Toffoli as well.

Stick-taps and Glove-drops

A tap of the stick to Eddie Lackas he announced his retirement from professional hockey on Monday. The former Canuck said the “best time in my career” was in Vancouver and thanked the fans sincerely.

A big stick-tap to Bauer. The hockey equipment manufacturer has modified its production line to produce protective visors for healthcare workers, with Quebec already ordering 300,000 visors for their doctors, nurses, and first responders.

Big Numbers

89 In four seasons with the Canucks, Loui Eriksson has a total of 38 goals and 89 points. He had 30 goals and 63 points in just one season with the Boston Bruins prior to signing with the Canucks.

4 So far, four NHL players have tested positive for COVID-19: two from the Ottawa Senators and two from the Colorado Avalanche. The Senators’ radio colour commentator, Gord Wilson, has also tested positive, as has St. Louis Blues’ play-by-play announcer John Kelly.

The brand new Sequoia Children’s Learning Community offers two different programs: for children from six months to three years, and for children from ages three to five.

article continues below

With a curriculum inspired by Reggio Emilia and the British Columbia Early Learning Framework, children will be guided in projects and activities that foster teamwork and creativity, pushing them to communicate, collaborate, and problem-solve with one another.

“In order for a child’s brain to be open to learning, a child must first feel emotionally secure and content,” says Victoria Lim, Sequoia Children's Learning Community manager. “If a child is emotionally stressed, their brain becomes preoccupied, which doesn’t allow any space for learning.”

This is where Sequoia’s curriculum draws on nature as a tool to help children relieve stress and calm their senses to increase their capacity for exploration and learning.

“We have a huge outdoor space, which is rare in the city,” Lim says. “Our centre is on a farmland with a beautiful trail beside it. We have a great landscape for our children to explore and learn.”

In addition to helping children handle moments of overstimulation, the outdoor area also provides space for children to move their bodies and develop their senses, in order to encourage physical literacy.

Rather than emphasizing academics, Sequoia’s philosophy focuses on helping children learn how to identify their emotions and develop coping strategies, particularly to prepare them for entry into the school system.

“Through studying the research related to child development, we’ve found that a lot of early years children are actually ready for school in terms of cognitive development. They’re great at retaining information. But there isn’t enough focus on their emotional well-being,” Lim says. “Much of the research shows that children who are socially and emotionally developed tend to grow into adults who attain higher grades, earn higher wages, and feel much happier long-term.”

As an educator, Lim sees success as the ability for children to become whoever they want to be.

“By teaching children early on to be aware of their emotions and how to be in harmony with others, we provide them with strong foundational skills to help them create and experience more happiness and success, not just in a classroom, but in rest of their lives,” Lim says.

Right now, Sequoia has a special fee promotion in place, including a promotion for a free month in the Over 3 program.

That sounds easy, but Lonnie's job actually involves building strong relationships with employers and providing them with a variety of services to help them with their hiring needs. Avia is part of Back in Motion, and works to help job seekers improve their job search skills, and also provides advice on how to access various training subsidies and other services.

Avia Employment Services provides the WorkBC program, the official employment program of BC that helps people find jobs, explore career options and improve their employability skills. Avia helps organize job fairs, information sharing sessions, and promotes skills and job matching.

Part of the mandate of Avia Employment Services is to work with businesses in the Richmond community, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, to help match employers with suitable employees.

""For example,"" Lonnie explains, ""an employer might come to us and say they have a role for someone in their organization with a certain set of skills. We then go to our database and work on a profile match. We find candidates that fit the profile the employer is looking for, and we do some pre-screening to come up with a list of appropriate job candidates. We then continue to act as a liaison between the worker and employer, to ensure a good employment match is made.""

Avia offers recruitment services that are tailored to the specific hiring needs of employers. With a single point of contact, Avia gives employers access to a diverse pool of screened, qualified and job-ready candidates.

""Avia can also help with the negotiation of wage subsidies,"" says Lonnie. ""There's a WorkBC program that offers a training subsidy of up to 50 percent of the usual wage for a period of up to six months. Once approved, we can talk to employers and offer them a suitable candidate with all the skills they are looking for with the added bonus of hiring someone at up to a 50 percent subsidy while they learn the ropes. .""

And what is the cost to the employer for a service that pre-screens candidates and offers a choice of job seekers plus a wage subsidy?

""Nothing,"" Lonnie laughs. ""Avia is a social service and all our services are at no cost to either the employer or the job seeker.""

This year’s Doors Open Richmond takes a virtual approach with #DoorsOpenOnline, offering a peek into Richmond’s vibrant arts, culture and heritage scene from the comfort of home. Over 30 sites will be accessible for discovery on mobile phones, tablets, and desktop computers.

Doors Open Richmond is presented by the Richmond Museum Society in partnership with the City of Richmond.

“Now more than ever, being able to provide a sense of togetherness is really important,” says Educational Programs Coordinator at Richmond Museum Emily Ooi. “Granted we’re used to physically being able to gather in these locations and explore and ask questions. But we think you’ll find this year that you can still explore these sites in a new way.”

Celebrating cultural diversity and civic awareness, new videos and behind the scenes footage will be posted on the Richmond Museum’s online platforms of participating sites, including exclusive content that showcases their operations and employees, as well as interesting attractions, artifacts or products.

In addition, participants can play along with Nature Bingo with Terra Nova Park, learn about special artwork found at Richmond Caring Place or make a Collection Connection with an artefact in the Richmond Museum's extensive collection.

“We hope that people discover a new place in Richmond, or perhaps learn about a place they’ve maybe walked by and wondered about,” Ooi says. “And by following, liking, and sharing online, they’re supporting the larger Richmond community.”

Anyone can participate by following Richmond Museum on Facebook and Instagram at @RichmondMuseum, Twitter at @Richmond_Museum, or by following the hashtag #DoorsOpenOnline.

They believe that each life has a unique story to tell, and it is one that should be told in a tribute that is equally unique. Because traditional funerals may not be for everyone, Richmond offers an alternative.

With Time to Remember, families at Richmond Funeral Home can create personal send-offs to honour their loved one while comforting family and friends in a meaningful way. With these personalized packages, memorials can centre around the elements that commemorate a loved one’s life. After all, hobbies and interests can be symbolic of individuality; the staff at Richmond Funeral Home think it is important to offer a final tribute that celebrates and captures a loved one’s passion.

article continues below

Sandra Melin, the Managing Funeral Director and Embalmer at Richmond Funeral Home, says that Time to Remember is an important option they offer. “I think everyone has a story to tell, they have their own personal history, their own life to be remembered,” she explained. “It is very important that we take that into account with each and every family and that we celebrate their life lived.”

Melin shared a Time to Remember whereby guests were asked to wear their loudest, most colourful Hawaiian shirts. Bright leis were given out to guests upon arrival, as each family member and friend was greeted by sunshine balloons and palm trees in the Reception Centre - with virgin Piña Coladas in hands. The food offered Hawaiian flair and the table centrepieces consisted of round rose bowls carrying a floating Hibiscus gently placed on water. “The families’ loved one had such a fondness of Hawaii and so they wanted to give her a Hawaiian sendoff,” Melin recounted, “it was truly a Time to Remember for family and friends.”

Melin said families love and appreciate the Time to Remember option, offered by Richmond Funeral Home. For a funeral home that caters to all faiths and cultures, it is imperative to offer Time to Remember in addition to the established traditions and customs.

Do more than honour the individual – celebrate their individuality.

Does your partner complain about your loud and prolonged snoring? A common cause at the root of many sleep-related disorders is sleep apnea.

Coastal Sleep operates sleep apnea diagnostic and treatment clinics in six convenient locations throughout the Lower Mainland.

""Our respiratory therapists and nurses specialize in the treatment of sleep apnea,"" says Paul Sweeney, a Registered Respiratory Therapist (RRT) and President of Coastal Sleep.

Coastal Sleep has been helping people understand sleep apnea, its causes and symptoms for almost 15 years. Providing services and explaining treatment options in English, French, Punjabi, Mandarin and Cantonese, Coastal Sleep is able to offer diagnostic testing in the comfort of a patient's own home.

""In the past, patients had to be referred by their family doctor to a sleep therapist at a hospital,"" Paul explains. ""And they needed to spend the night at the hospital in order to be tested. However the lengthy wait times often delayed diagnosis and treatment.

“At Coastal Sleep, we can expedite the process of diagnosis and we make testing much more accessible.”

Patients are often referred to Coastal Sleep by their family doctor or specialist, says Paul, but they can also call the clinic directly.

""After testing, we like to work with the family physician or specialist to help the patient understand the results,” Paul explains. “Typically, the patient is referred back to us for treatment.""

First line treatment for sleep apnea involves the use of a CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure) machine and mask that's worn every night.

""The modern masks are more comfortable than in the past,"" Paul says, ""Patients find it quickly becomes a game-changer. They sleep better and they have more energy.""

For more information about sleep apnea diagnosis in the Richmond area call Coastal Sleep at 1.877.241.9066, visit their website at http://www.coastalsleep.ca or send an email to info@coastalsleep.ca.

“It’s like walking into one big, wonderfully happy family,” said Jaimee Manlutec, who runs the front desk at the salon. “Everyone who comes in is made to feel special and really gets to know the stylist who is working on their hair.”

“Even the new clients feel comfortable right away because everyone here is so friendly,” she added. “You are made to feel right at home.”

That commitment to focusing on the client comes right from the top at the salon. Owner Shatha Dawood, who took over the business last October, holds family close to her heart and extends that feeling to all who pass through her door.

“She’s all about family and making people feel good,” Manlutec said.

Part of that commitment is expressed in the unique service Mon Amie provides for its Muslim customers who wear the traditional hijab. “Those clients prefer not to be seen in public without wearing it,” Manlutec said. “We cater to that need by providing a private space where we lower a privacy screen so they can come in and have their hair taken care of without any worries.

“And they really like that idea. They feel safer.”

Another unique service the salon provides is eyelash lifting. The process enhances eyelashes by increasing their volume without using artificial extensions. “I don’t know of any other salons offering that,” Manlutec said.

Inside the salon is room for more than 14 chairs, which means there’s usually plenty going on. “Everyone is bustling,” Manlutecsaid, adding the experienced stylists are able to efficiently coordinate clients to meet their needs.

“The majority of our stylists have been here many years, which is great for our customers because they can come in here and feel confident they’ll be treated just the way they want.

“And the result is you leave with a great feeling that makes you want to come back.”

""We call it the Grill Chill,"" Bob explains, ""and it's a room that is separate from the rest of the restaurant for a little privacy. Families book it for birthdays, anniversaries, or just a group

get-together, and companies use it for meetings. There's a wide-screen television that can be booked for presentations and, of course, there's delicious Indian food.""

That delicious Indian food is made fresh and to-order daily.

""There are no additives, no artificial food colourings, and nothing is frozen,"" Bob says. ""At Ginger Indian Cuisine , we don't even have a freezer in the kitchen.""

For corporate catering, whether in the Grill Chill room or at your office, contact Bob, tell him what you need and he'll prepare a competitive price.

""The restaurant is also a convenient place for people to host events that they would prefer not to host at home, for whatever reason,"" says Bob. ""Some of our customers book the Grill Chill room and invite their guests. They can eat, drink, and visit with each other while we do the work. At the end, the host can pay and the guests go home.

Whether it is going to a grocery store, starting their own business, or working as an artist or athlete – we are all, in the same way, connected to it. However, it is figuring out how to best prepare your kids, and give them the advantage, that will make the difference.

Tressa Wood is the CEO and founder of Young Entrepreneur Learning Labs, the after school enrichment program that encourages kids to think entrepreneurially. She has dedicated her career to building and growing businesses and turning local start-ups into household names. It was the thought of her daughters, 7 and 9, that inspired Wood to design a program where all kids could start on an entrepreneurial path from a young age, enabling them to follow their passions and enjoy the freedoms it provides.

article continues below

From gaining a valuable skillset to discovering your passion and finding your confidence, here are six ways that your kids can benefit by learning entrepreneurship at Young Entrepreneur Learning Labs.

1. It helps kids find their passion: When you give your child the chance to pursue any invention or business idea, it may show them what truly excites them.

2. It teaches kids to create their own opportunities: Give your child the advantage by teaching them what it means to be the one to solve the problem, not just address it.

3. It means making mistakes is actually a good thing: Learning from your mistakes is one of the best ways to get better, Wood said.

4. It instills a sense of perseverance: Like when your kid’s first prototype doesn’t work and they go back to the drawing board to solve the problem - over and over again until they get it right.

5. It builds up confidence: When your child plans, creates, fixes, and presents their own business on Market Days, they are not only building a business, but they are building confidence.

6. It is fun! This is some of the best parts of the kids’ days, Wood said. Seeing a project through from start to finish instill a sense of accomplishment, but most importantly the learning should be fun.

With programs for kids between seven and fifteen, there is something for every kid at Young Entrepreneur Learning Labs. Programs are now being offered in Richmond throughout September.

“The attraction I had for getting into this business is making people more beautiful, happy, feeling good, and that makes me happy,” she says. “And since the effects are immediate, I can see what we’ve done has been an improvement for a client. And that is very satisfying because I am a people person.”

Persona Laser & Skin Care Centre has been serving clients from the same location since 1987. For the past 12 years, Shaghaghi has been running it and enjoying the opportunity to meet so many people who have come in for treatments that range from laser therapy for hair reduction and vein therapy, to electrolysis and spa services.

“When I see regular clients, it’s the continuation of a relationship with someone I can help make feel better about themselves,” says Shaghaghi, who is trained as a medical aesthetician who specializes in laser treatments.

The most popular service she provides using the high-tech device is hair removal.

And it’s not just for women.

“A lot of guys come in and get their backs, shoulders, neck lines, and even their cheeks treated,” Shaghaghi says. “So, it’s pretty popular.”

The laser is also used on sun-damaged skin, correcting pigmentation, and treats fine lines and wrinkles by increasing the collagen.

“It’s a very effective tool that requires a skilled and qualified technician.”

Other services at Persona Laser & Skin Care Centre include microblading and permanent makeup application.

“For those clients who feel they don’t have the right shape for their eyebrows, microblading is an option,” Shaghaghi says. “We can create them which better suits their face.

“We also have something that is pretty advanced and that’s for cellulite reduction,” Shaghaghi adds.

Called lipomassage, it was developed in France and uses rollers and suction to massage and break up fat cells to smooth the skin.

“It treats areas that are hard to reduce with normal exercise and dieting,” Shaghaghi says. “And it’s not painful. That’s the great thing about it.”

On the spa side, the salon pampers clients with nail care, facials, waxing, and eyebrow tinting.

Started in 1956 by a group of people in a church hall, the Memorial Society of B.C. now has in excess of 242,000 members around the province, making it the largest memorial society in North America.

""Because we have so many members,"" Nicole explains, ""I am able to negotiate lower costs with funeral service providers for our members. We only work with established funeral homes with a good reputation. Currently, we work with almost 30 funeral homes around B.C.""

The Memorial Society is a non-profit organization registered under the Societies Act of B.C. and is the only member-based, volunteer-driven memorial society in B.C.

""Everybody should be a member of the Society,"" Nicole says. ""Everybody alive will pass away at some point and for a $40 one-time membership fee, we can take the burden off your loved ones by referring them to a designated funeral service provider for the disposition of your remains and related issues.""

Upon joining the Society, members are asked to complete an arrangement form stating their wishes for their remains and detailing any pre-paid arrangements they may have.

""People need to have this conversation with their children,"" Nicole says, ""It's not a pleasant topic for most people and you don't need to dwell on it, but it's a conversation that must be had.""

What they may not know, however, is that there are tons of opportunities available in other cities or provinces across Canada, where immigration and job-hunting will be quicker and easier.

article continues below

If applicants are young professionals with a bachelor’s or master’s degree, they have a better chance of immediately immigrating to one of the bigger cities. If they don’t, Canada is opening its doors to people who are willing to consider other provinces as well.

For those who have only a high school diploma, the best path to citizenship is by going to where the jobs are, says Rachel Gary, COO of Canada Direct. “Be flexible about where you’re willing to move to,” she says.

Prairie provinces may be seen as too cold or rural, but there are many benefits to moving to places like Manitoba and Saskatchewan.

Manitoba has the most lenient eligibility requirements because it needs people the most, Gary says. It’s also the only province that does not require applicants to pass an English language test. Saskatchewan is also making it easier for people to immigrate there.

Gary suggests that applicants start in Manitoba or Saskatchewan, then once they have earn enough points to get resident status, they can apply for jobs in other provinces.

“We can submit their application to move to Vancouver right from the start but I can almost guarantee they won’t be in the pool,” she says. “We always tell them the truth because immigrating to Canada is not a cheap process. We don’t want to submit people’s applications and not get them here. If they only have a high school diploma and want this opportunity to come to Canada, they have to go to Manitoba.”

It also depends on the type of work people are willing to do. If they agree to work in the fields with the most demand, they can get their start in Canada and earn the points that lead to residency.

1. Take your time

article continues below

“I always suggest not to meet with families right after a loved one has passed,” says Chan. “They are vulnerable and might miss information or be confused. Except for certain religious beliefs, we have to wait for 48 hours for the physician to provide the necessary documents in order to register the death. By law cremation cannot take place within 48 hours, so use this time to rest.”

2. Don’t feel obliged

It’s ok to meet a few different funeral homes before you select. “Phone first, ask for a price list and gauge how the employee makes you feel,” says Chan. “When you visit, take notes – I’ll provide you with a notepad so you can remember things.” If your loved one has a prearranged funeral plan it can generally be used at or transferred to any funeral home.

3. Know about the law

Before you make arrangements, be sure you have the legal right to do so – the executor is responsible for funeral arrangements and payment. You can buy a casket and any funeral goods or floral arrangements from any supplier, and it is not legal for suppliers to charge extra for this. If this happens, report providers to Consumer Protection BC.

4. Gather what you need

Chan will provide a list of things you need for a meeting with a funeral home. It includes government ID of the person who has passed, information for the obituary and clothing.

5. Don’t come alone

The initial meeting can be confusing. It’s good to have someone there to support you, ensure you’re clear about the information you’re giving and receiving, and prevent miscommunication.

6. Do things your way

There’s no ‘right’ thing to do. “You don’t need to have a sit-down event, you don’t need to have a eulogy. Sometimes these things are too overwhelming or they don’t reflect the wishes of the person who has passed,” says Chan. “Every funeral service is unique and personalized. You don’t have an obligation to meet guests’ expectations or do things the traditional way.”

But the biggest challenge is finding the support to stay healthy – that’s where U Rise Personal Training comes in.

Listening to women who are pregnant and accommodating their needs, is the most important part of helping them start or maintain a healthy lifestyle, according to U Rise owner Gary Dhillon.

article continues below

“You have to build a really strong relationship with your clients,” he says, adding that a woman may see her hairstylist every month or so, but she may see her trainer three times a week. So the connection is even stronger.

A big part of supporting pregnant clients is keeping in mind they may be emotional, Dhillon says, and if they are having an emotional day, they’ll need stronger support.

Many of Dhillon’s clients were working with him before they became pregnant, and he recommends starting a healthy lifestyle before getting pregnant, as it won’t get any easier from that point on.

“Before you even think about getting pregnant, start doing something healthy, even if it's just walking,” he says. “Just get a routine.

“If they haven't been part of a fitness program or had a regimen before the baby, it can be really hard now for them to get into something,” he adds.

If a mother-to-be can create a healthy lifestyle for herself and maintain it through the pregnancy, it will be easier for her to transition to feeling healthier and stronger after the birth, he says.

“The women who come here who keep a healthy weight, they're able to feel like themselves again after,” he says.

And while it is important to eat enough to grow a healthy baby, most women overestimate how much they should eat, he adds.

“This whole eating for two thing is not true,” Dhillon says.

Once they’ve had the baby, new mothers should get active again, once it’s safe for them to do so, he adds.

“It's really important for their sanity to start to move and get some of that weight off,” Dhillon says, “because once that baby starts to get a little older, and the mom is meeting other moms, it can be discouraging for them to see some of those moms looking healthier than them.”

It can also be important for new mothers to get time for themselves, he adds.

“One thing I've learned, sometimes it's really important for these women to get away from their babies for an hour,” Dhillon says.

That closure, recently extended to July 21, is a shared agreement by Canada and the U.S. and restricts non-essential traffic, meaning only people making essential trips can cross the border, for example, for work or transporting goods.

article continues below

However, the closure only applies to the land border, and Canadians wishing to travel to the U.S. can still enter the country via air.

While Canada currently restricts all foreigners from entering the country for non-essential reasons – with the exception of immediate family members – the U.S. only prohibits visitors from certain countries, and that list doesn’t include Canada.

Also, while anyone entering Canada needs to self-isolate for 14 days under the Quarantine Act, that may not be the case in the U.S, depending on which state people are travelling to.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends international travellers arriving in the U.S. self-isolate, but that measure appears to only be a requirement if mandated by a state or local government.

For example, there are no enforced travel restrictions in Oregon, and the state’s borders and airports are open, according to the Travel Oregon website, which also notes that there are no mandatory quarantine periods in place for visitors.

While Canada has issued a global travel advisory, warning against all non-essential travel outside of the country and to avoid all cruise ship travel, Global Affairs says the decision to travel “is the sole responsibility of the individual.”

Some Americans can travel to Canada

Ottawa slightly eased Canada’s border restrictions June 9. Under the new rules, foreigners who are an immediate family member of a Canadian citizen or permanent resident are allowed to enter Canada.

Those new rules also apply to the Canada-U.S. land border.

Concern about ‘Alaska loophole’

Americans are also allowed across the land boarder if they can prove they are just passing through Canada to travel home to Alaska. However, this has become known as the so-called “Alaska loophole,” where U.S. travellers use that pretext for travelling within Canada.

“We’re concerned about this phenomenon and we’re hearing about it in communities across the province,” said B.C. Premier John Horgan during a press conference Thursday (July 2).

For example, Horgan said he’s heard of Texas and California license plates being spotted at a general store in Port Renfrew.

“If you’re heading to Alaska, you don’t go through Port Renfrew.”

Horgan said he has raised the issue with Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland and confirmed he would like to see the border remain closed for the time being.

“For 15 weeks I have maintained, and others have supported me across the country, that our border needs to remain closed until the United States demonstrates that they have a handle on this pandemic,” he said.

“And we’re going to be very clear on that right up to the next (border agreement) deadline…I can’t see our position changing based on the evidence south of us at this point in time.”

US COVID cases rise

The U.S. has seen a spike in COVID-19 cases in recent days.

New cases reported July 1 and July 2 both number over 50,000, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. Previous days saw cases numbering around 40,000.

That spike has caused at least 19 states to pause or roll back their plans to reopen. For example, California has closed all indoor establishments for at least three weeks, while New York City will not allow indoor dining to resume, as originally planned, next week.

As of 2 p.m. Friday (July 3), the U.S. has over 2.8 million cases of COVID-19, and 131,997 people have died from the virus.",[]

The notion of establishing a framework to commercialize cannabis began as a promise by the Liberal Party in the 2015 federal election campaign that led to Justin Trudeau becoming prime minister. The implementation of the policy was not as smooth as first envisioned, and the provincial governments were put in charge of setting guidelines for the sale and consumption of marijuana.

article continues below

Research Co. and Glacier Media have been tracking perceptions about legalization every six months in British Columbia. Our latest survey shows that agreement with the new rules remains high across the entire province, that some residents are starting to ponder a future when other drugs could be treated in the same fashion as cannabis, and that – in stark contrast with what we found last year – marijuana users in British Columbia are starting to acquire all of their product through licensed retailers.

As more time passes, British Columbians appear happier with the decision to end prohibition. Seven in 10 of the province’s residents (70%) agree with marijuana being legal in Canada, while 26% disagree and 3% are undecided.

These findings represent a seven-point increase since a similar survey conducted in October 2019, as legal cannabis approached its first anniversary. The groups that are more likely to voice satisfaction with the new status quo are men (75%), British Columbians aged 35 to 54 (76%) and residents of northern B.C. (80%).

In recent weeks, we have seen more talk about creating a safe supply for drugs that are currently available only through illegal means. The impact of these discussions has led to a shift in the views of British Columbians about legalizing all drugs. It must be completely acknowledged that sizable majorities of the province’s residents continue to oppose a move to place any controlled substance inside a store, but the proponents of this option have grown since late last year.

At least two-thirds of British Columbians are opposed to legalizing ecstasy (66%), powder cocaine (70%), heroin (72%), crack cocaine (73%), methamphetamine or “crystal meth” (74%) and fentanyl (75%).

Support for making some of these drugs available in a fashion that would conceivably meet the same guidelines that govern cannabis has risen over the past six months, to 25% for cocaine (up from 18%) and to 24% for heroin (up from 19%). While these are still low proportions, the fluctuation could signal the start of a trend.

Just 10% of British Columbians say they only consumed marijuana after it became legal. Identical proportions of residents tried it before October 2018 (45%) or have never consumed it in Canada (also 45%). The incidence of “legal-only” marijuana users is highest among residents aged 18 to 34 (18%) and those who live in southern B.C. (19%).

But perhaps the biggest surprise, and a source of satisfaction for policy makers, is the way in which cannabis is being sought by users. Just over half of British Columbians who have consumed marijuana since legalization (51%) say that all of their product was acquired at a licensed retailer. In October 2019, only 31% of cannabis consumers in the province were getting all of their product at a licensed retailer.

We still see 16% of British Columbians who say none of their marijuana has been bought at a licensed retailer – a proportion that climbs to 25% among those aged 55 and over. Two-thirds of cannabis consumers aged 35 to 54 (68%) are buying all of their product at a licensed retailer.

Even though the delivery of cannabis products has improved over the past six months, there are significant regional differences that are indubitably related to the presence of stores in specific areas of the province. Cannabis consumers who reside in southern B.C. and Metro Vancouver are the most likely to be getting all of their product from licensed retailers (63% and 62%). The numbers are significantly lower in Vancouver Island (29%), northern B.C. (24%) and the Fraser Valley (19%).

Finally, the issue of “drug testing” remains a priority for British Columbians, with 61% saying that companies in the province should “definitely” or “probably” be able to administer these examinations to any employee now that marijuana is legal.

After a bumpy start that featured slow store openings and hitches with delivery options, there are signs that cannabis legalization is starting to work in a better fashion. More consumers are getting all of their product through licensed retailers, and the number of “new users” has not increased dramatically. Still, the significant regional disparities suggest that more marijuana outlets will need to be authorized in order to effectively eliminate the black market.

No example is better than the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks in the United States, which gave us the “Patriot Act” after just 45 days of deliberation to expand government surveillance of Americans to previously unimagined levels.

In mid-April, the actions of Gabriel Wortman led to the deaths of 22 people in Nova Scotia after multiple shootings and fires. Most Canadians, at the time still under lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, were horrified at Wortman’s actions, which included impersonating a police officer.

article continues below

It took the federal government only 13 days after Wortman’s criminal activity was evident for the entire country to announce a nationwide ban on 1,500 types of military-grade “assault-style” weapons in Canada. Any Canadian who possesses these firearms will have two years to get rid of them. The prohibition led to many new discussions about the role that firearms play in Canada’s urban and rural areas.

We know now that the perpetrator of the 22 murders in Nova Scotia had obtained his weapons illegally from Canadian and American sources. This was not a surprise for Canadian authorities, who have consistently reported that more than 70% of the weapons used in gun-related crimes in our country come from the United States.

On the issue of firearms, Canada is decidedly different from the United States. In Canada, it is not legal for a person to own or carry a firearm for the purpose of self defence against human beings. When Research Co. and Glacier Media asked Canadians about this key precept of Canadian law, more than three in four (77%) agreed with it, while 18% disagreed and 5% were undecided.

Atlantic Canada (31%), Saskatchewan and Manitoba (29%) and Alberta (24%) boast the highest number of residents who openly question Canada’s long-standing regulations for firearms. While higher than what is observed in Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia, these are not proportions of voters that would sway an election, certainly not in the way American statewide and congressional races can be tilted if your candidate can adequately hold a shotgun and recite the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution in a manner that panders to the base.

Fewer than one in five Canadians welcome the notion of citizens carrying firearms for something other than hunting or scaring wildlife away. Any survey measuring opinions on banning “assault-style” weapons would be met with near unanimity. The opposition reacted to the announced ban as it always has under its outgoing leader, by claiming the regulations would affect law-abiding Canadians. Lost in this unfortunate combination of inadequate polling and incapable opposition are the solutions that matter to Canadians.

In our survey, more than three in five Canadians (63%) told us that gun violence in Canada is a “very serious” or “moderately serious” problem – a proportion that climbs to 69% among women and 68% among those aged 55 and over.

Sizable majorities of Ontarians and British Columbians, who have experienced gang wars in urban areas, are more likely to look at gun violence as particularly problematic (76% and 67%, respectively). The COVID-19 pandemic did little to curb gun violence in Toronto, where 61 people were shot in the first four months of the year.

We asked Canadians about the effectiveness of four possible measures, and their responses outline a public that is ready for bold action. More than three in five Canadians (62%) think enacting a complete ban on handguns would be “very effective” or “moderately effective” in reducing gun violence in Canada. Most crimes, after all, are not being committed with the military-grade “assault-style” weapons that the federal government was quick to ban.

A higher proportion of Canadians deem two other measures as effective: imposing mandatory jail terms for crimes committed with firearms (74%) and introducing new outreach programs to steer youth away from gangs (also 74%).

Canadians place dealing with firearms smuggled from the United States as the most important issue that needs to be addressed. Many of the country’s residents also want to make sure gangs are not attractive to our country’s youth and believe mandatory minimum jail sentences would act as a deterrent.

Banning military-grade “assault-style” weapons is low-hanging fruit in a challenge that definitely has Canadians preoccupied and wishing for a type of government intervention that goes beyond a photo-op celebrated by poorly executed survey charity work.

True sociologists know that we learn nothing from posing the wrong questions to Canadians, and capable politicians should go beyond voicing displeasure with plans and proposals just because that is what they are expected to do. Meanwhile, Canadians are still worried about gun violence and expecting their elected officials to do better. •

Re: “LNG expansion defended,” Letters, July 2.

article continues below

I must commend the FortisBC staff person who wrote to defend an expansion of the Tilbury LNG plant. His defence highlights the supposed “green”-ness of liquefied natural gas (LNG) while ignoring how LNG is actually procured through fracking.

Fracking is the “process of injecting water at high pressure into subterranean rocks, boreholes, etc. so as to force open existing fissures and extract gas.”

Using tons and tons of clean water to bring gas to market? How is this green?

The Tilbury expansion project is unsafe and unhealthy for the people living nearby as well as the salmon and other living things in the Fraser River. There is enough traffic on the Fraser without adding huge LNG tankers that would have to turn around in a congested space. And it would be right across the river from the jet fuel storage facility. The potential for a devastating fireball explosion in the river and kilometres beyond (Silvercity and where I live in the ALR) is too horrible to contemplate.

If that is not enough, there is actually no good economic case for LNG. There is a glut on the worldwide market and it costs more to produce it than it can be sold for. And the Tilbury expansion would produce more pollution than B.C. could mitigate in order to reach its climate change targets. This is the worst fossil fuel project ever. It does not succeed on safety, health, economic and environmental fronts. Tilbury and B.C. should be gearing down from fossil fuel, not increasing its use.

Another week went by, still nothing and I called them again and this time was told that I should’ve heard back from them long ago and it’s strange that I didn’t. The agent then said she sent an email through to get them to call me “later today.”

When days went by and no phone call was received, I once again called them on June 30, and this time the agent told me they’re working on calls from the week of June 8 and the previous agent was in error, I was told again to expect a call back that day.

I called them again today, July 2, and now I’m being told that they have no clue as to when I’ll get a call back.

Being a disabled person and with the current fear and social distancing, I can’t just walk into the food bank or soup kitchen like anyone else if food runs out — and it is getting a bit close for comfort.

I am writing about the public consultation around the Tilbury Phase 2 LNG Expansion project on the Fraser River that few people know about.

I live on an island (Lulu Island) surrounded by the Fraser River, downstream from the proposed Tilbury Expansion project and stand to lose everything in the case of a disaster. There are no guarantees that one won’t happen as we live in a high-risk area to earthquakes, tsunamis, liquefaction and flooding and going forward with this project is nothing short of irresponsible and downright dangerous.

Expanding an LNG plant where there is already significant marine traffic, fragile marine species and located very near the third busiest international airport in Canada and a densely populated community is extremely risky.

There are Indigenous people that have depended on the salmon runs for thousands of years and local fishing communities that are at risk.

The whole process from extraction, transporting, processing, shipping and ultimately using this greenhouse gas has no climate benefits and ultimately lines the pockets of only a few, leaving the rest of us to deal with the costs as taxpayers for building infrastructure, of environmental devastation and, in the end, for the cleanup of an industry that should be replaced by clean energy projects like wind and solar power.

The risks of this project far outweigh any potential benefits. Under no circumstance should this project be able to pass an environmental assessment.

The old adage “damned if you do, damned if you don’t” comes to mind when discussing the current ‘hostage’ situation involving China’s Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou and Canada’s Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor.

article continues below

Kovrig and Spavor have been detained in China since 2018, and their release is increasingly improbable given Beijing’s ruling to indict them on the alleged crime of espionage, with little evidence to suggest that they are, indeed, culpable. The more likely evidence-based explanation for their detainment is that Beijing is playing politics and engaging in hostage negotiations to get Wanzhou back.

On the one side of the debate, we have 19 prominent Canadians, including former parliamentarians and senior diplomats, calling on the Canadian Minister of Justice to end the extradition proceeding against Wanzhou to secure the release of the two Michaels. On the other hand, we have 30 Canadian defence and national security experts signed an open letter urging the Prime Minister to stand firm and not to engage in hostage diplomacy. It is truly a modern-day case of Homeric proportions, with the Canadian government being caught between Scylla and Charybdis.

Many Canadians concur with the Prime Minister that it would be disastrous to engage in hostage diplomacy with China, arguing that the best response is to levy sanctions against the Chinese Communist Party officials using the Sergei Magnitsky Law. Undoubtedly, it is an arduous decision with both sides expressing valid points and, ultimately, everyone empathizes with the two Michaels and their families.

It appears that Canada is experiencing a moral crisis of what to do, and a simple solution does not seem likely. What is required to fix this issue is a hard and earnest look at Canada’s relationship with China. Increasing globalization and trade relationships with China have not brought forth the democratic reforms our politicians and business leaders had hoped. It is exceedingly unlikely that China will miraculously abide by international law concerning human rights while under an autocratic, totalitarian regime.

One thing seems abundantly clear – many Canadian politicians have been reticent to criticize China. The pursuit of trade agreements and corporate profits supersede truth, justice, and human rights. And now, it has come back to bite us squarely in the backside. Perhaps it is time for the Canadian government to admit that reforms are not happening in China despite the signing of a free trade agreement and to look for trade partners elsewhere. The opportunities for new trade partners are limitless; we just have to be willing to admit that China is not going to change and work through some growing pains for a better, safer, and more just future.

It gets untangled easily and is unpredictable. But wines from Haywire are just the opposite. They are full of personality and consistently reflect the unique Okanagan terroir where they originate.

Haywire, one of several brands made at the Okanagan Crush Pad, actually refers to owners Christine Coletta and Steve Lornie’s impromptu decision to forgo retirement and journey into wine making.

If you’re looking for an enchanting white, the 2018 Haywire Secrest Vineyard Chardonnay ($26.90) fits the bill. The grapes are from their 38-acre vineyard in Oliver. It’s a high altitude cool growing site with layers of limestone, an important ingredient in producing premium chardonnays. The site was converted from conventional farming in 2014 and received Organic Certification in 2019.

The grapes were whole bunch pressed into two egg-shaped concrete tanks for a long, slow native ferment followed by malolactic fermentation. It was left on the lees to build texture and richness for ten months before bottling unfiltered.

This Chardonnay reveals a peach bouquet together with lemon and vanilla. I enjoyed the balanced nature of fresh fruit with the refreshing acidity that comes from cool climate sites along with the extra richness from the lees and the lack of filtering. The Haywire Chardonnay would be ideal with sautéed BC spot prawns available now at the Steveston Landing.

Another distinctive Haywire wine is the 2018 Haywire Pinot Noir ($26.90). Grapes from their Summerland and Oliver vineyards were fermented with native yeasts in large concrete wine tanks. Each lot was aged separately and bottled unfiltered to showcase the wine’s natural flavours

The result: there’s lots of bright cranberry and cherry fruit with hints of cola, earthy beets and smoke. Well balanced with fresh acidity, moderate tannins and 12.5% alcohol levels. It’s more of a food wine than a sipper and I would recommend barbecued ribs as a perfect partner. Another choice for summer is barbecued salmon over coals with alder smoke.

To learn more about Haywire wines you can visit the Okanagan Crush Pad in Summerland from 11am to 5pm daily. You’ll discover an exciting new format: one that provides space, comfort, and safety.

The online booking system at on their website guarantees a private table to enjoy one of four tasting flights, offerings in a peaceful, unrushed vineyard setting. Each flight features six wines: Raised in Concrete ($25), Organic Flights of Fancy ($35), Top Flight Reds ($35), and Weekend Bubbles ($40 per person on the weekends only). Throughout July, there’s a special promotional fee of $20 per person for any of their flights.

If travelling to the Okanagan Crush Pad is not in your immediate plans, you can order a dozen or more Haywire wines on line and receive $20 off shipping. What a Haywire idea!

I support the Government of Canada’s actions taken on July 3, 2020 in response to the People’s Republic of China's imposition of The Law of the People’s Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, referred to as the National Security Law.

article continues below

The measures taken by the Government of Canada are in line with Canada’s values and the expectations of Canadians.

Canada is a country that advocates democracy, freedom, human rights, and the rule of law. It has the moral obligation to support Hong Kong people, and especially Canadians in Hong Kong, when the National Security Law threatens their freedom and human rights.

The government of the People’s Republic of China has unilaterally imposed the National Security Law, despite strong opposition from the international community. Indeed, the Hong Kong people were excluded from the process of making the National Security Law, and the definition of the crimes contained within (Chapter III) is ambiguous.

The National Security Law has also weakened the judiciary by giving too much power to The Office for Safeguarding National Security of the Central People’s Government (Articles 52 to 57) and ultimately hurting the ""One Country, Two Systems"" principle agreed to in the Sino-British Joint Declaration.

This year’s presidential campaign in the United States will be very different from the ones of elections past, with the COVID-19 pandemic affecting public gatherings, events and conventions.

article continues below

Research Co. has been tracking this democratic process, and some themes are starting to emerge. The last presidential contest that saw an incumbent seek a new term took place in 2012, when Democrat Barack Obama ultimately defeated Republican Mitt Romney. I had the privilege of following that election from start to finish, and there are many differences between what we saw eight years ago and the mood of Americans in 2020.

In July 2012, there was no clear frontrunner in the race for the White House. Obama and Romney were supported by 47% of decided voters across the United States, with Independents barely breaking in favour of the incumbent president. Obama could count on the votes of most women and young voters, while Romney connected well with men and older voters.

This year, the situation is dissimilar. Trump, the Republican incumbent, sits 10 points behind prospective Democratic Party nominee Joe Biden at the national level. Across the country, in a survey that was completed before the Independence Day celebrations, 53% of decided voters said they would cast a ballot for Biden, while 43% would support Trump.

Independents, who backed Trump over Hillary Clinton in 2016, are no longer happy with the president. In this crucial group, Biden is ahead of Trump by 15 points (54% to 39%). Unless the numbers tighten among American voters who do not align themselves with the Democrats or the Republicans, Trump’s chances will fade.

In our tracking, Trump’s approval rating dropped to 40% this month, down six points since we checked in early June, well into the COVID-19 pandemic but before the protests about racial equality dominated media coverage. An approval rating hovering around 50% is usually an indicator of a lost election for an incumbent president. Trump is significantly below this threshold right now.

Trump’s approval rating is particularly bad with African Americans (21%) and Latino and Hispanic Americans (32%). These two groups are usually supportive of Democrats, so the results are not earth-shattering. Still, his numbers also fell to 46% among White Americans.

When we asked Americans to select six words out of a list of 18 to describe Trump, almost three in five selected “arrogant” (57%). Of the six words chosen, the only one that is remotely positive is “strong” (36%). More than a third of Americans perceive their current head of state as “dishonest” (40%), “uncaring” (39%), “foolish” (also 39%) and “out of touch” (34%).

This does not mean that Americans are enthralled by Biden. When we pose the same question about the prospective Democratic Party nominee, about three in 10 Americans describe him as “intelligent” (32%), “compassionate” (also 32%), “down to earth” (30%), “honest” (28%), “weak” (28%) and “out of touch” (28%).

We could look at Biden’s results as superior to Trump’s, since only one of the six words is overly negative (“weak.”) These numbers are very different from what Barack Obama and Mitt Romney posted in July 2012.

At that time, 50% of Americans regarded Obama as “intelligent” and 46% felt the same way about Romney. In an exceedingly polarized nation, the numbers on this indicator are significantly lower for both Biden (32%) and Trump (31%).

Right now, Biden is clearly favoured at the national level, but we still need to look into the way specific American states will behave. The Democrats hope to win the three jurisdictions that took Trump to the White House (Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin) and perhaps make inroads in Florida and Ohio.

No election is decided four months in advance. In any case, three indicators point to Biden enjoying unique advantages in 2020: Trump’s weak approval rating, reminiscent of what Jimmy Carter and George H. W. Bush posted in 1976 and 1992, his difficulties in reconnecting with Independents, and a lower proportion of voters willing to cast a ballot for a third-party candidate.

In 2016, almost 6% of all cast ballots in the American presidential election went to third-party candidates, most notably Gary Johnson of the Libertarian Party and Jill Stein of the Green Party. This year, Americans are not looking at third parties as much as they were four years ago, with only 3% selecting Libertarian Jo Jorgensen or “some other candidate.” However, we collected our data before a man called Kanye Omari West flirted with becoming the Ross Perot of the 21st Century.

Given that B.C. has an estimated population of about 5,190,000 people, that translates into one case for every 1,735 residents, or 0.579 people per 1,000 residents. That compares with Washington State's estimated population of 7,615,000 people and 37,491 cases, for about one case of COVID-19 for every 203 people, or 4.92 people per 1,000 residents.

Three people in B.C. have died in the past day from the virus that spawned a global pandemic, making the death toll in the province now 186. Of the 162 people actively fighting off the disease, 17 are in hospital, with three of those in intensive care. The rest are self-isolating at home.

More than 88% of those infected in the province, or 2,660, have recovered.

""While there are no active community outbreaks in B.C., new cases and community exposure events continue to occur in the community,"" Health Minister Adrian Dix and provincial health officer Bonnie Henry said in a joint statement.

The two acknowledged that there has been a second case of exposure to the virus in a strip club – at the No. 5 Orange bar on Main Street. That is the second instance of exposure at a strip club, following one at Brandi's Exotic Show Lounge on Hornby Street in late June.

Public health teams have issued an alert for anyone who may have been at the No. 5 Orange on July 1.

""If you have been at a location with a community exposure event, monitor yourself for symptoms, limit your contact with others and contact 811 to arrange for testing if any symptoms develop,"" Dix and Henry said. ""Contact tracing to contain the spread of COVID-19 requires all of our involvement to be successful.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,018 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1,589 in Fraser Health;

• 133 in Island Health;

• 203 in Interior Health; and

• 65 in Northern Health.

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreaks at Tabor and at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred to those homes from the hospital. The outbreak at the Tabor long-term care home was declared over on July 7.

""Fewer faces, bigger spaces is the safest approach, because we know crowded, closed spaces where people may be in close contact with each other are higher-risk environments for all of us and need to be avoided at this time,"" said Henry and Dix.

Enza’s family lives modestly in the Italian Alps, the family’s meagre income supplemented by Enza’s talented stitchery. Ciro lives with his brother Eduardo in the local convent, having been left there by their mother as young boys. Although they live in neighbouring villages, Enza and Ciro only meet as teenagers. They begin to develop a friendship just as Ciro is forced to leave his mountain home after catching the local priest in a scandal. Ciro is sent to America and begins an apprenticeship as a shoemaker. Shortly afterwards, Enza and her father also travel to America to earn money to build a house for their family.

While Ciro and Enza both begin to make their way in America, they do not meet up again until a chance encounter just as Ciro is about to leave to fight in World War I. While Ciro is away in the War, Enza’s sewing talents lead her and dear friend Laura, into a glamorous life in the Metropolitan Opera House, sewing for the great Enrico Caruso. Laura and Enza are living a beautiful life and Enza is set to marry when Ciro returns from the War to take up his shoemaking career. Such is the love story of Enza and Ciro, their paths cross and part until finally the title of the book is fulfilled and they leave the bright lights of New York and begin their life together in Minnesota.

It’s like setting a destination on your GPS without knowing where you are starting from. You’ll just end up going in circles!

If the ""new normal"" ends up being a compromise on the ""old normal,"" I am not signing up for the program. The worst mindset is to assume that what we had before was better than what we’re striving for.

article continues below

Our current situation allows us to take stock and make decisions about which parts of ""old normal"" are worth keeping and which parts to let go. We are then in a great position to create a future so much better than what we experienced up until March of this year. I would go a step further to define the obstacles that have been holding us back and transform them into the opportunities that excite us.

As a financial advisor, here are the top things that excite me right now:

By taking the past few months to catch our breath from the unsustainable pace of old normal, we have been able to focus on the relationships and values that we treasure. We can now abandon the shallow goals that popular culture tells us we should have and finally create an inspiring future moving toward the goals that really matter to us.

For the 66 per cent of Canadians who do not have a written financial plan yet, now is the ideal time to create an understandable and achievable financial plan focused on helping you move forward, step by step. Financial planning is not expensive, difficult nor too late to start. Now is the time!

COVID-19 has taught us very quickly the wisdom of Mike Tyson: “Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face!” An old-school 50-page financial plan is irrelevant practically the day after it is printed. We have quickly learned that an agile financial planning approach is necessary when responding to life’s unexpected events. For a financial plan to work tomorrow, it must embrace flexibility.

Solid evidence-based approaches to investing have evolved exponentially. We no longer need to settle for ""old normal"" approaches and habits that have tended to erode wealth, rather than build it. Investors can now embrace science, rather than former ways based on speculation and illusion.

As we get more and more comfortable with meeting online, the professionals we deal with now have more capacity to help people. You can take care of the things you know you need to do like your financial plan, wills and powers of attorney, tax advice, etc. with greater clarity and interaction, all without travel time, parking fee and without leaving the comfort of your home!

I do not intend to trivialize the global tragedy that COVID-19 represents. However, it would be an even greater tragedy if we ignored the lessons we are learning and the opportunities that are being uncovered.

We have seen countless televised messages from elected politicians, as well as heated discussions about the proper use of masks. As we enter a very different summer, Research Co. and Glacier Media tracked the views of Canadians on political and behavioural matters.

The one consistent finding throughout the pandemic has been the high level of satisfaction that Canadians express toward the federal government. In our latest survey, 70% of Canadians are happy with how Ottawa has dealt with the COVID-19 outbreak, practically unchanged since we last asked in May (69%).

article continues below

The rating for provincial governments and municipal governments improved as more Canadians were able to leave the isolation pod. Three in four Canadians (75%, up 11 points since May) are satisfied with their provincial administration, and seven in 10 (70%) feel the same way about their local government.

The big jump for provincial governments was not uniform across the country. In Atlantic Canada and British Columbia, satisfaction reaches 86% and 83%, with positive perceptions increasing by 19 points and 14 points, respectively.

Two other areas experienced double digit rises in satisfaction: Saskatchewan and Manitoba (78%, up 19 points) and Ontario (76%, up 23 points). The lowest ratings are observed in Quebec (69%, up three points) and Alberta (62%, up six points). Quebec had the highest level of satisfaction when we started asking this question in March; Alberta has consistently been at the bottom.

On the behavioural side of things, there are some remarkable changes in the way Canadians are approaching the pandemic. Time and reassurance have made many residents feel safer about take-out and delivery. In April, 40% of Canadians said they were not ordering food because they feared infection. The proportion has dropped to 23%, in what will surely be welcome news to an industry that has been greatly affected by the pandemic.

Three in 10 Canadians admit to overeating, unchanged since April. There is an increase in consumption of alcohol at home (18%, up five points) and a steadier curve on losing our tempers more often (16%, down two points).

Throughout the pandemic, the gender gap on some questions related to safe practices has been staggering. This time, it is evident on two questions. Fewer Canadians (40%, down seven points) are cleaning the groceries they buy to prevent infection. While only 36% of men are sanitizing the provisions they buy, the proportion jumps to 44% among women.

Still, the biggest behavioural change is on our faces. Back in April, only 14% of Canadians said they wore a protective mask every time they went out. This time, practically half of Canadians (48%) are not leaving home without them. Regionally, Ontarians are leading the way in wearing masks (63%), followed by Albertans at 51%. The proportion is slightly lower in Quebec and British Columbia (each at 48%).

Again, women are being more meticulous. Most female respondents (57%) say they are wearing masks outside, while only 39% of male respondents report the same behaviour. There is also a generational gap, with more than half of Canadians aged 18 to 34 (55%) always bringing their masks, compared with 46% for those aged 35 to 54 and 44% among those aged 55 and over.

Mask or no mask, Canadians appear resigned to staying close to home and avoiding big crowds. Only 11% of Canadians expect to be able to travel abroad before the end of September, while a similar proportion (12%) believe they will be able to go to a live sporting event. There is slightly more hope about attending or hosting a large social gathering at some point before Labour Day (21%).

More than a third of Canadians think the calendar will hit December before they take a trip abroad (39%), witness a live sporting event (35%) or go to a large party (also 35%). In a sign of the difficulty of issuing any kind of forecast during the pandemic, the proportion of undecided respondents is high on all three options.

Even the seemingly simple task of shaking the hand of a person who is not at our home appears distant, with 20% of Canadians expecting to do this before September, and 29% foreseeing it perhaps as a Christmas miracle. In addition, three in four Canadians (75%) say they will “definitely” or “probably” take a vaccine against COVID-19 is one ultimately becomes available, up two points since April.

Even if the future seems bleak, Canadians are more optimistic now. In March, only 22% were willing to say that the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic was “behind us.” The proportion barely moved to 24% in May, but reached 49% at the end of June. Oddly enough, Quebecers (57%) and Ontarians (49%) are more enthusiastic about the corner being turned than those in two large provinces that have fewer COVID-19 cases: Alberta (44%) and British Columbia (39%). •

The City of Richmond has fallen out of step with real needs, and real costs, and reality itself when it comes to the Coronavirus.

On one walk yesterday, easily a dozen homes abandoned, left to being overran by vegetation and vermin infestation, abandoned vehicles next door to a school, again rat infestation. A home under construction for almost a year now, with zero cleanup being done, it is fenced but not locked so has become a dumping ground.

While going past it the fellas doing the drywall decided it was a good place to clean up, so pieces of drywall, even the chips and dust were swept out of their van and trailer and thrown on the ground. These are described as restricted dangerous materials that can NOT be dumped, but must be contained and enclosed to be dropped off at the proper facility. Grass at these different abandoned sites growth to 3 feet and over.

South Arm has opened its outdoor activity areas, but there is no distancing. I am glad to see people being active, but shoulder-to-shoulder contact of dozens of kids playing basketball, means everyone brought whatever they have been in contact with to send home with everyone else there. That alone would mean a couple of hundred people. The internet is not turned on at South Arm, but every outdoor light is, 24/7, even the field lights.

I am sure this is happening at all community centres, the schools are also just leaving their lights on outside all day. The grass cutting at the schools seems more regular but less caring. Grass is on the sidewalks, hills and around trees and goal posts it is not cut at all. Their equipment has hit and knocked down fences, weeks ago, not repaired. Not surprisingly, ad the last time it took two years to come out replace a broken piece. Why, in today's world are we using real wood for this type of fencing? Fencing made from recycled plastics is maintenance free, is not going to rot, as is the story with wood being buried in ground as wet as ours.

The City has hundreds of people waiting to get to work, they should be doing city wide inspections, to keep our city clean, they can help to make sure some kind of distancing is taken place and enforced or shut down for that day. This is not private businesses that are in a for profit situation, but our own city that instituted the rules that they are the absolute worst at following. So let's put some people to work and make it as safe as we can.

One more important item is the outrageous speeds cars are hitting, and a complete lack of enforcement from the RCMP.

Re: “More cons than pros for proposed LNG expansion near Richmond, says action group,” online, June 20

article continues below

A recent article in the Richmond News presented a one-sided picture of FortisBC’s Tilbury Phase 2 LNG Expansion project. I’d like to provide Richmond readers with some missing details about the project and correct misleading information in the article.

For nearly 50 years, our Tilbury facility has been producing Liquefied natural gas (LNG) to help ensure British Columbians have the energy they need on the coldest days of the year. LNG is natural gas that has been chilled into a liquid form. It’s made from the same natural gas we use in our homes and businesses every day and is already moved by truck and ship around our region safely.

As B.C. shifts toward a lower-carbon future, LNG will continue to play an important role. LNG’s emissions are lower than conventional fuels used in heavy-duty trucks and ships. As a result, we see LNG as an important part of our efforts to reach our 30BY30 target of reducing customers’ greenhouse gas emissions 30 per cent by 2030.

There are two main drivers behind this project the article missed. The first is that the new storage tank would serve B.C. customers in the event of a natural gas supply disruption, like the one that disrupted gas supply to the Lower Mainland in 2018.

The second is to produce more LNG as a fuel for ships and potentially to serve overseas export markets. Since our LNG is created with renewable hydroelectricity, it is some of the cleanest in the world. We’ve been fuelling BC Ferries with LNG since 2017.

Our proposed expansion would serve the growing demand for LNG as a fuel for ocean-going ships and could provide the cleanest LNG to overseas markets, creating new jobs and economic opportunities.

In addition, there are a number of other points in the article to clarify. Our LNG facilities are safe. They are built to Canada’s high safety standards. If new standards are introduced, our facilities are upgraded to meet them.

The new expansion will be no exception. It would feature a fully contained double-walled storage tank and advanced safety features. Our employees are experienced leaders in their fields and will follow stringent safety procedures to ensure the public and our workers are kept safe.

It’s worth emphasizing that Tilbury is a good location for a small-scale LNG facility. Our site is located in an industrial area and we can expand within our existing footprint.

Although the project considers new production of up to 3.5 million tonnes per year, this is the maximum potential of the site. The final size will depend on market demand from marine customers, and potentially overseas customers.

Finally, it’s important to clarify that our utility customers will not pay for the new LNG production needed to serve overseas markets served by this expansion. Costs for the storage tank, which would strengthen service to B.C. homes and businesses, would be passed on to utility customers. Before this can occur, we will need to file an application to our regulator, the BC Utilities Commission later this year.

Our project is at an early stage of planning and design. It’s important to get the full picture of the project by visiting TalkingEnergy.ca and becoming involved in the environmental assessment process, which will include more opportunities for public input in the future.

For the 2020-21 season, the cap was estimated to be $84 million to $88.2 million, depending on a few factors.

That has changed.

article continues below

The suspension caused by COVID-19 and the uncertain future of the 2019-20 season leaves next season’s salary cap in serious jeopardy.

That’s because the cap is tied to league revenues. There’s meant to be a 50/50 split in revenues between the owners and the players. If there’s a drop in revenue for the owners — from a loss of gate revenue for unplayed or unattended games, unplayed playoff games, or a crashing Canadian dollar — then the NHL’s Collective Bargaining Agreement leads to less money for the players the following season in the form of a reduced salary cap.

A significant increase in the salary cap would have been a major relief for a team close to the cap like the Vancouver Canucks. The Canucks were set to have a tough time navigating the cap next season, thanks to the combination of a few highly-paid veterans, performance bonuses for young stars rolling over from this current season, Roberto Luongo’s cap recapture penalty, and several restricted and unrestricted free agents they need to re-sign.

If the salary cap went up, it’s possible the Canucks wouldn’t have to choose between UFAs Jacob Markstrom, Tyler Toffoli and Chris Tanev, but could re-sign all three. A flat cap — one that stayed at $81.5 million — would force the Canucks to choose two and possibly lose another player like Troy Stecher or Josh Leivo.

If the cap goes down? Then the Canucks are in some serious trouble, with difficult decisions to make that will undoubtedly make the team worse for next season. And they’re not the only ones: plenty of other teams would feel the cap crunch from this unprecedented situation.

Potential solutions could include an artificially inflated cap, but one option that has come up in NHL circles is compliance buyouts, with Brian Burke discussing it recently on Oilers Now, a radio program with Global News.

“I’ve heard discussion of compliance buyouts to help teams get to this new cap, to solve some of their problems,” said Burke. “In the last CBA, each team got two cap-compliance buyouts which were exempt from the cap.”

A compliance buyout would differ from a regular buyout in that it wouldn’t cost money against the salary cap. For instance, the Canucks will still have a little over $1 million against next season’s cap from buying out Ryan Spooner, but the Canucks bought out Keith Ballard and David Booth in 2013 and 2014 at no cost to their cap as compliance buyouts after the 2012-13 lockout.

If teams do get a compliance buyout, it seems obvious who the Canucks would use it on. Loui Eriksson has a $6 million cap hit for two more seasons following this one and has found himself in an increasingly-diminished role, playing primarily as a shutdown, defensive forward, with little-to-no contributions offensively.

The Canucks do have other options, however. Brandon Sutter has lost several steps and has a $4.375 million cap hit next season. They could be proactive and buy out Tyler Myers’ $6 million contract for the next four seasons before his play starts to decline. Cutting their losses on Micheal Ferland’s $3.5 million cap hit for the next three seasons might be smart. They might even be tempted to buy out Sben Baertschi’s $3.37 million contract with him buried in the AHL.

Do any of those supersede Eriksson? Probably not. Where it gets interesting is if teams get two buyouts, as they did in 2013 and 2014. Buying out Eriksson would be a given, then, but who would be the second buyout? Sutter has just one year left on his contract, Ferland’s cap hit isn’t overly onerous, and Tyler Myers is still a good, useful player.

One compliance buyout would make it far easier for the Canucks to re-sign Markstrom and Tanev. Two might mean re-signing Toffoli as well.

Stick-taps and Glove-drops

A tap of the stick to Eddie Lackas he announced his retirement from professional hockey on Monday. The former Canuck said the “best time in my career” was in Vancouver and thanked the fans sincerely.

A big stick-tap to Bauer. The hockey equipment manufacturer has modified its production line to produce protective visors for healthcare workers, with Quebec already ordering 300,000 visors for their doctors, nurses, and first responders.

Big Numbers

89 In four seasons with the Canucks, Loui Eriksson has a total of 38 goals and 89 points. He had 30 goals and 63 points in just one season with the Boston Bruins prior to signing with the Canucks.

4 So far, four NHL players have tested positive for COVID-19: two from the Ottawa Senators and two from the Colorado Avalanche. The Senators’ radio colour commentator, Gord Wilson, has also tested positive, as has St. Louis Blues’ play-by-play announcer John Kelly.

The market, which runs two Sundays each month through to the end of September, is back for its 11th season with 50 - 70 vendors providing a unique, local opportunity to buy produce and other goods the old fashioned way.

“In our farmers’ market all the vendors either grow, bake, make or catch what they are selling,” said Alan Sakai, the market’s committee chairperson who also oversees the event’s operations.

“For example, all of the farm produce sold at the market has to be grown locally here in Richmond, or come from no further than the Okanagan Valley. Essentially, what we are trying to do is promote the pioneer spirit,” he explained.

Some of the Richmond-grown produce includes seasonal items such as strawberries, blueberries, corn, plus other fruits and vegetables raised in local hothouses that are available throughout the market season.

“Our vendors are special. They simply love what they are doing,” Sakai said. “These folks are out there to share their skills and products.”

Sponsored by the Richmond Industrial and Agricultural Society, the market is run by a small army of volunteers. All profits raised by the market support activities and projects of the Steveston Community Centre.

Held in the Easthope parking lot across from the Steveston Community Centre, the market opens, rain or shine, at 10:30 a.m. and closes at 3:30 p.m. And when the sun comes out, there can be as many as 3,000 people visiting the site where they are entertained by live music and a children’s area with plenty of activities. But there is so much more to do during a trip to the market.

“We want people to plan and come visit Steveston,” Sakai said. “The market is just one of the wonderful things people can do when they come down here. Aside from the market, they can visit other stores and restaurants in the village and enjoy everything the destination of Steveston has to offer.”

Parking during market days is available in the Steveston Community Centre lot, as well as other sites in the adjacent Steveston village area.

Lack of English can be a major barrier. That’s why Avia Employment Services is now offering Arabic services in Richmond.

During 2016, Coquitlam and Surrey’s branches of Avia developed an Arabic program in order to support Syrian refugees. “We didn’t feel as much impact from the refugee crisis, possibly because of the cost of living in Richmond, but over the past couple of years we’ve begun to research who’s here that could be accessing Avia’s services,” says Lonnie Belfer, Industry & Community Relationship Liaison for Employment Services. “We discovered that there’s a large number of Arabic speakers who are struggling because of low levels of English, so we developed a program specifically for them.”

The first step was to hire an Arabic-speaking Job Developer who can help people write their resumés, assist with the job search, and even support with understanding cultural difference, both one on one and in workshops. She can also help clients access English classes, both free and paid for. “It’s packaging what we do for everyone in the community, but framing it around the needs of someone with a low level of English and perhaps no support network here,” explains Belfer.

The Arabic Program launched in January 2018 and there were 25 existing clients of Avia who could immediately use the service. The agency is now connecting with groups who work with the Arabic-speaking population to help advertise the service to the wider community. “We have a lot of people here who want to work and feel like they can’t because of language or cultural barriers,” says Belfer. “This program is very exciting because it provides opportunities for them to break down those barriers and get employment.”

Belfer says that jobseeking in Richmond can be intimidating to newcomers because there are predominating cultures that are non-English, so plans are in the works to roll out this program in other languages, and also to adapt Avia’s services for other groups such as young people. “Ultimately, we want to find the best way of engaging with all populations,” he says.

That’s one of the key concepts behind Independent Living, which is just one of the many housing options that are available to seniors.

article continues below

“Independent Living communities are designed to take the hassle out of everyday life,” says Eileen Campbell from Steveston’s The Maple Residences. “Instead they offer seniors the opportunity to enjoy an active social lifestyle from their own private suites in a community of likeminded residents.”

It’s an increasingly popular choice for seniors who are looking for a change and a new lifestyle. How can you tell if Independent Living is right for you? We asked Eileen to give us her expert input.

Are you an independent senior?

The key to this kind of living is to enable seniors to continue to enjoy their independence. That means that you’re free to live the life that you’ve carved out for yourself, the only difference is that you don’t have to do it on your own. Instead, you have access to 24-hour support that is there for you as and when you need it.

Do you intend to stay social?

An active mind is key to enjoying older age, and one of the main benefits of Independent Living is that it offers a ready-made community of like-minded people.

Do you want an active lifestyle?

Whether you’re interested in live entertainment & social activities, destination bus trips, arts, crafts & exercise or simply socializing with peers, the best Independent Living communities boast a range of amazing amenities that suit residents’ lifestyles.

Would you prefer not to worry about home maintenance?

Maintaining a home can be a full-time job. One of the joys of Independent Living is that you hand over that responsibility to someone else. So instead of worrying about household maintenance or repairs, you can simply get on with enjoying your life.

“We offer programs that do not have the typical academic focus, such as math, reading or science,” says Kristine Lim, Summit Learning’s program director. “We wanted to provide more wholistic programming.”

article continues below

The goal is to get students, aged seven to 15, to use their knowledge in a real world setting to create their very own business.

“Not all kids grow up knowing what it’s like out there in terms of practical experience,” Lim says. “For example, they may be really good at math but don’t have the opportunities to properly apply it.

“They may have all the multiplication tables figured out, but once they are at the grocery store they may not be able to use that knowledge to figure out the best deal on a product.”

Summit Learning also provides an opportunity for students to discover what their passions are and how that could be transformed into a business.

“Some kids maybe go to cooking school or art classes and never translate what they are capable of producing as something they could possibly sell through a business that they develop and run themselves,” Lim explains.

Once the students choose what their business will create, they produce a brand name, logo and go about marketing their ideas and products.

“They also come up with their own product prototypes,” Lim says, adding some of the items from past young entrepreneurs have included baked goods, slime for playtime fun and even wind chimes made from recycled materials.

All through the process they receive feedback from fellow students and instructors - who come from a variety of teaching backgrounds.

“We not only teach students about business, but to communicate with other people by way of customer service and learning how to accept constructive criticism,” Lim says.

The program culminates with a special market day when the goods produced by the various businesses go on sale to the public.

“Overall, we want to teach youngsters important life skills they can apply to any career choice, in any economic environment,” Lim says.

Relaxing on a table, soft hands gently massaging the skin, the smell of oils, and that stress-free feeling at the end. Sense Massage clinic in Richmond offers all those sensations, but with a therapeutic focus. Edward Chang is a Registered Massage Therapist (RMT) for Sense Massage.

""The big difference is that an RMT is regulated,"" Edward explains. ""And we're trained to identify your injury and to treat it accordingly. We will also educate you on how to take care of your body after the treatments by giving you some home exercises and advice on when to use ice and when to use heat.""

article continues below

Wrapping ice on a sprained ankle is something most people would probably do, but Edward explains why that's important as opposed to using a heat pad.

""When the muscle is first injured,"" he says, ""there will be microscopic tears in the blood vessels, which means there will be a lot of inflammation. There will be poor circulation due to damage on the blood vessels, thus swelling occurs. If you use heat, it will exacerbate the problem because it will open up the capillaries to allow further blood flow to the injured muscle. Ice will close down the blood vessels, thereby decreasing the volume of blood at the site and decreasing the pain.""

Edward recommends ice for the first 24 – 72 hours after a sprain or muscle injury.

""Of course, everyone is different,"" he says. ""At Sense Massage, we decide on a case by case basis. For example, a young person will recover quicker than an older person. So, we may want to use heat treatments earlier for young people and delay heat for seniors.""

Registered massage therapists are also trained to work with and educate their patients.

""Massage therapy is not as simple as taking medicine,"" Edward explains. ""At Sense Massage, we offer a consultation where we ask a lot of questions to determine the problem and devise a plan to help the patient. At the same time, we will teach you about your body and educate you on how to take care of your body and keep it healthy.""

Applying the right pressure is also important, Edward says.

""Some spa massages work on the basis of no pain, no gain. But research has found that assumption to be false. For muscles to relax, you need the right pressure at the right point. A Registered Massage Therapist is trained in the correct technique.""

The shortest path to you:The vendors at your local Vancouver farmers market pick, wash, and choose the produce themselves. Grown and inspected locally, you can rest assured that you have the best produce you can buy. And because it’s grown locally, the produce spends less time in refrigerated transport and passes through fewer hands.

A sense of community: Steveston Farmers & Artisans Market’s new location at the Steveston Community Centre is a great example of how farmers markets are deeply integrated into the communities they serve. Whether you’re dropping the children off at the local martial arts centre or meeting your mother for a stroll through the nearby garden, the market is the perfect backdrop for everyday life and great way to reconnect with the community you live in.

Self-sustaining economy: money spent in a non-profit market such as Steveston Farmers & Artisans Market directly supports the local people who grow and make the products you buy.

“Steveston Farmers & Artisans Market vendors are closely juried,” says Market Committee Chair, Johanna Stewart. “Not only is there variety for the consumer, but there is also a selection of local business from Steveston Village who represent the thriving local business community.”

Health and wellbeing:A fresh breeze from the Salish Sea on a sunny day will do a lot more for your general wellbeing than the manufactured scents in your local box store. Natural light vs. halogen-lit aisles, local stores vs. national advertisements… are there buskers, bands or even the occasional DJ inside your local grocery store?

Leaving for work in the morning and coming back after a full workday means, that unless you have taught your pet to use the toilet, you are going to need some extra help.

As a dog lover who grew up with pets all his life, James Heunefeld was familiar with the sinking feeling and guilt that comes with making your pet sit at home all day. That is why he started Tails Up Dog Walking, a professional dog walking, training, and sitting service based in Steveston. By combining his love for dogs and his affinity for premier customer service, James created what is now one of Richmond’s most sought-after dog walking services.

“No day is the same,” James said, “we take our canine friends to a variety of off-leash and dog-friendly areas around the city that stimulate their senses and allow them to explore.”

Having recently expanded his business to serve all of Richmond, James said he was excited to show his new clients the benefits of having a well-trained and well-exercised dog. Because James manages his business from an entrepreneurial standpoint, Tails Up is an all-encompassing dog service. He offers group dog walks twice a day with pick up and drop off services, dog training and sitting. His wide range of services will soon be augmented with an easy-to-use, automated scheduling app.

Safety is the number one priority at Tails Up Dog Walking and meet and greets with new clients are always free. At that time, James decides whether the dog is well suited for pack walks, or if it needs one-on-one training prior to group walks. “Socialization in a safe environment is one of the biggest assets walkers can offer pet owners,” James said, adding that group learning is one of the most effective ways dogs pick up good behaviour.

“Growing up we had a very dominant, stubborn dog who was difficult to train,” James explained, “so believe me when I say I’ve pretty much seen it all.” Over the years, James studied training techniques and methods, which he uses on his walks. It is not uncommon to spot James on a walk, dressed in his blue Tails Up uniform and surrounded by dogs who, of course, have wagging tails and are grinning from ear to ear.

The school was established 31 years ago by Artistic Directors Heather Joosten-Fair and Annette Jakubowski, and offers recreational and professional lessons in classical ballet, jazz, lyrical, contemporary, modern, tap, musical theatre, Pilates, hip-hop, experimental anatomy, acting and voice. There are also ballet and tap classes for adult beginners. What sets it apart? “It’s the calibre, background and experience of the faculty members,” say Joosten-Fair and Jakubowski. “Coupled with the personal care we put into each student’s program, the Academy’s quality and results are unmatched in the city.”

Award-winning choreographer Joosten-Fair specializes in tap, lyrical and jazz and has trained with some of the most famous names in dance. Jakubowski danced professionally with the Stuttgart Ballet, which took her all over the world before she became a registered teacher. Both Artistic Directors give their personal attention to every student. “We guide their goals and aspirations and design individual programs that best suit their needs,” they say. “Whether they are dancing in the recreational or professional program, each of our 500-plus students is an important and integral part of the Academy.”

Some schools produce great ballet dancers, and some are great for singing, but students at Richmond Academy of Dance excel in all disciplines. It’s the only dance school in the Lower Mainland to have had provincial representatives to the BC Festival of Performing Arts in all dance and vocal categories: Classical Ballet, Modern, Stage, Musical Theatre Voice and Classical Voice.

2. The faculty is the best in the business

Annette Jakubowski and Heather Joosten-Fair founded the school 31 years ago after dancing and teaching all over the world. The entire faculty has similarly illustrious careers, as do the many visiting teachers and choreographers. This keeps the school at the leading edge of new disciplines and techniques. “Richmond Academy has played a huge role in my development as an artist, a dancer, an individual and a performer,” says Pamela Schneider, an Academy graduate who’s now with Cirque du Soleil. “My work ethic has stemmed from having trained with a dance company that believes in staying current and keeping high standards.”

The Academy has many grateful graduates who’ve become arts professionals. “Thank you, Richmond Academy of Dance, for helping me achieve my dreams,” says Heather Ogden, Principal Dancer with the National Ballet of Canada. Other alumni include Gregory Pember, a Toronto-based dancer and actor, and Julliard graduate Stephanie Amurao.

4. Every student is viewed as an individual

The Artistic Directors give their personal attention to each student, designing individualized programs to meet their needs and achieve their goals, whether they’re planning a career in the arts, or are taking dance classes for fun, exercise or to meet people in the community.

If your high-school student has a beautiful voice, she can head to the July Summer Vocal Camp for a week of private coaching and group classes. July also sees a week-long boot camp for students aged 12+ with strong tap experience, while in August the school is running intensive courses for pre-professional ballet/contemporary dancers and musical theatre students.

""Often, when that conversation doesn't happen, children are unclear as to their parent's wishes,"" Nicole explains. ""I've seen cases where one child has said that their parent wanted to buried and another felt that cremation was wanted. It leads to family arguments and the possibility that your wishes may not be carried out.""

The Memorial Society of B.C. has been encouraging members and their families to have an end of life planning conversation for more than 60 years. With in excess of 242,000 members around the province, the Society is the largest memorial society in North America.

""Your survivors can benefit from our help when the time comes,"" says Nicole. ""Their first phone call should be to the Society. We can have your wishes for the disposition of your remains on file. We can then refer them to a registered funeral service provider that can offer them our member discount rate.""

That one phone call can relieve your loved ones from the anxiety and discomfort related to shopping around for the best funeral services rate at a time of emotional stress.

""Unfortunately, we live in denial,"" says Nicole. ""At the Society, we try to reach out to the children, who are usually in their forties and fifties, and encourage them to have the conversation with their parents. I've been at information sessions where a parent has shared that they have a pre-paid plot for their remains, but their child sitting next to them was totally unaware. They can't carry out your wishes if they don't know what they are.""

It seems natural that we all plan for our vacations and retirement, but we don't want to plan for the end of life. This is a mistake, says Nicole.

But Trinity Western University (TWU) has the next best thing thanks to its Adult Degree Completion Program, which is offered at the Richmond campus.

“The issue is a lot of adults have busy lives, with full-time work and family commitments,” said Mark Halvorson, Associate Dean of the Bachelor of Arts in Leadership program at TWU. “While they may have had some post-secondary education over time, which helped them get started in their careers, they can feel stuck if they didn’t finish their degrees. And they can’t simply hit pause in their lives or go back to full-time university studies.”

That can leave you feeling frustrated because you are competent and have developed a level of success in your field. “But at the same time, they see their peers advancing around them,” Halvorson added. “So, what we did was create a format for finishing a degree that allows adults to finish their coursework one night a week in a six-weeks accelerated format. In as little as 18 months, depending on their incoming transfer credits, a student can finish his/her degree.” All the while that allows the student ample time to keep up with his/her other commitments.

As for who is enrolling, it covers a large demographic.

“Our students are culturally diverse and span all levels of work experience from younger working adults to adults with long work histories,” Halvorson said. “They may have collected a certificate here, or a few courses there, but they fall short of a full degree.”

“From what they have, we create a customized learning plan that links the programs and schools they’ve attended and the coursework we offer for them to earn a degree.”

To gain access to the program, students must be 23 or older with two to three years of workplace experience. The degree they work towards is a Bachelor of Arts in Leadership, a discipline which is geared towards succeeding in the workplace.

“With a focus on the workplace, it will give them skills they can use in everyday situations to maximize their contributions,” Halvorson said.

That’s because the program at UCMAS (Universal Concept Mental Arithmetic System) in Richmond seeks to develop a child’s learning ability in a holistic fashion, using visualization methods that begin by using an abacus to solve math problems.

article continues below

It’s an approach that attracted the interest of Krishna Kumar, director of UCMAS in Richmond, six years ago.

“I’d always been passionate about education and wanted to do something in the community,” he says. “And when I found UCMAS I realized this was a program that was not just teaching for a grade.”

“This program focuses on developing a child’s visualization capabilities that are controlled by the creative side of our brains.”

The use of an abacus triggers that visual form of learning and makes it a powerful tool.

“A child will ultimately be able to visualize numbers to do the math, meaning they can do complex math mentally without the need of the calculator,” Kumar says.

With that ability they can go much further than crunching numbers and apply the visualization technique to other areas of study.

“The goal of the abacus is not just to improve math skills but goes way beyond that,” Kumar says.

For example, if a youngster wants to study medicine and is learning about human anatomy, images of body structures can become almost photographic in their memory.

“Because they have learned visualization in this program, they will be able to grasp the essence just by looking at an image,” he says.

The skill can also be used in sports.

“They are able to see the big picture much more clearly, too,” Kumar says. “Therefore, their reflexes become much better.”

The ideal age range for students at UCMAS is 6 to 13 years old.

“That’s when a child’s brain is optimally growing,” he says, adding a student can graduate from the program in about four years of classes, once a week for two hours.

“And what they achieve is having a life-long skill they will use in everything they do.”

In today’s world, which is getting increasingly focused on technology, the ability to visualize things well is an extremely important skill.

Students who have completed the program at UCMAS Richmond have achieved Baccalaureate levels.

“That means every child who has graduated from our program so far has been able to do mental math at the highest level of proficiency,” Kumar says. “Plus, three of them graduated with distinction and are the only ones in North America to have done so.”

Brynelle Tesalona from Richmond was crowned the 2019 Canadian National Champion and will represent Canada at the International Competition in Cambodia on Dec 7-9, 2019.

With a population of just over five million, Finland is estimated to be home to over 2 million saunas.

Sauna King Systems Inc. has been manufacturing and supplying sauna heaters and custom built saunas for more than 40 years. Through their experience of listening to North American consumers concerned about the incorrect building of home saunas, the company developed the Steamcube, a standalone, functional yet portable sauna that anybody can assemble. The Steamcube is suitable to be placed either inside or outside the home or cabin.

article continues below

Let's look at a few of the numerous benefits that regular sauna use can provide:

1. Stress relief

Saunas have long been looked on as a quiet, contemplative place. The warm, inviting environment of a sauna offers a sense of peace and harmony. It's a place to escape the hustle and bustle of the world and relax.

2. Muscle relaxation

The hot steam of a Sauna King Systems sauna heater is a benefit to anyone suffering aches and pains that can be helped by heat or steam therapy.

3. Cardiovascular health

In recent study from the University of Eastern Finland, researchers followed more than 2,300 men aged between 42 and 60 years old for over two decades and found that those who used saunas frequently had a 63 percent decrease in deaths due to heart attacks and strokes.

4. Risk reduction for dementia and Alzheimer's Disease

The Finnish study also found that those subjects whose sauna use averaged 4 – 7 times per week were 66% less likely to develop dementia at the 20-year follow up mark than the men who only used the sauna once a week. In addition, the subjects had a 65% risk reduction for Alzheimer's Disease.

5. Improved blood pressure

Improvements in blood pressure, blood flow, and heart function have been seen with as little as four sauna sessions a week. Scientist refer to sauna bathing as ""passive heat therapy"" and speculate that the health benefits are due to the sauna raising the body's core temperature, which in turn promotes better blood flow.

The mother of a former Glen Eden student speaks on the transformative effect of the program:

“Right from the beginning, school was tough for our son. Although a very bright kid, he was not able to work to his full ability because of an overwhelming sense of anxiety all day long. He had difficulty attending a full day of school without a blowup or two.

article continues below

“Our son went to a total of 4 different schools in the district — some of which were better than others - as well as homeschooling. One school in particular was very good and our son was thriving. Unfortunately, he was transferred to another classroom where the new teacher didn’t use any of the recommendations from the previous school. That teacher had a rigid system that each student had to follow. Unfortunately, it put too much pressure on our son and he was told that another school would be more appropriate.

“We visited Glen Eden and, although their philosophy takes getting used to because it’s different than any other school, I have to say — It works! Instead of trying to fit our son to their program, they spent a lot of time getting to know our son, noticing when he’s more relaxed and when he’s more agitated. They set him up for success by having him do schoolwork in those scenarios that he’s more relaxed in. They never phoned us to come and pick him up because he wasn’t faring well. He developed many deep relationships with the staff. In his own words:

‘When I first came to Glen Eden, I had no hope. I didn’t think I’d be successful. You gave me hope and now I can see that I can be successful. I couldn’t have done it without you.’

“Admittedly, I was nervous during the first year, wondering if he was doing enough schoolwork. In hindsight, I had no need to be nervous. Over time, as the anxiety lessened, our son’s motivation increased ten-fold. He caught up in his work much faster than I could imagine. He became clear in the goals he was working toward and is very motivated.

“He has now completed his fourth year at Glen Eden. He won’t be returning next year because he will be mainstreamed in our local high school. After so many years of struggle, all three of us are so pleased. My husband and I have no doubt he’ll thrive in his new setting next year.

“Best of all, as his school life improved, so did our home life. No more blowups. My own anxiety over parenting has greatly decreased. We are thoroughly enjoying parenting a teenager who is curious about so many things and following what he’s passionate about. Our family and friends are all amazed by his transformation.”

Ajay Dhingra, president of Goodbowl, said they saw a gap between restaurant suppliers, with an abundance of products, and residents who are trying to get food on their tables, while maintaining physical distancing.

“Many people are scared to go to grocery stores and many of the big companies have a one- to two-week delay for delivery…On the flip side, most of the restaurant suppliers have (a lot) of products that are not being used because most restaurants are closed. So, we asked ourselves how we could help … bridge that gap,” explained Dhingra

Goodbowl’s phone app offers curbside pick-up at their eatery, where a customer’s items can be either placed directly into the trunk of their car, or placed on a table next to a parking space for them to check before leaving.

Eggs, vegetables and poultry are some of the items they offer, with other items such as bread waiting to make it onto the list.

Goodbowl is also offering a pay-it-forward program where customers can pay for a health worker’s meals to be delivered every week.

“Being open, especially as a small business, is kind of a scary thought during COVID-19,” said Dhingra.

Why it matters: The combination of a price war between Saudi Arabia and a major global contraction from the COVID-19 pandemic has reduced oil prices to the point where some Canadian producers are losing money on every barrel of oil they produce.

article continues below

Oil prices bounced modestly Monday in response to the news over the weekend that Saudi Arabia and Russia have agreed to end their oil price war through productions cuts. And for the first time, other G20 nations, including Canada, the U.S. and Brazil, have also agreed to cut their production.

Saudi Arabia and Russia agreed to cut production by nearly 10 million barrels per day for May and June.

Canada, the U.S. and Brazil have agreed to cut an additional 3.7 million barrels per day. It’s not clear yet how much Canada has agreed to, though Dan McTeague, an analyst Canadians for Affordable Energy, said he believes it is 800,000 barrels per day.

Oil prices increased slightly Monday on the news of the agreement, but are still well below what most producers need to continue producing.

The problem is that that there is now a major oversupply because the demand for oil has dropped so significantly in recent weeks, as countries around the world shut down large parts of their economies and societies. Global oil consumption is down 30%.

Globally, 5 million barrels of oil per day is not fetching a price that makes it worth producing, says the International Energy Agency (IEA).

“These operators are now losing money on every barrel they produce,"" the IEA said.

""While it's encouraging that there's an agreement to end the irresponsible global oil price war, much damage has been done,” said Tim McMillan, CEO of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP).

“The damage to the Canadian energy sector will be longer lasting due to the liquidity crisis triggered by these market manipulations. The other reality is there is nothing OPEC can do to stop the COVID-19 pandemic.

“We are still months away from understanding the devastation that is being brought to every corner of Canada's economy. Canada's oil and natural gas industry's focus remains on weathering this crisis and working with governments to put into place support that will save people's jobs in the short term and create the foundation for the economic recovery.""

The Canadian Crude Index rose nearly 16% this morning – rising nearly US$2 per barrel to US$13.21 per barrel, according to oilprice.com.

The impact on gasoline prices in Canada will not be significant, McTeague said. He said gasoline prices may rise “a penny here and penny there, but right now the market’s still in a bit of a funk.”

Canadian oil and gas producers are still waiting for federal aid that has been promised to keep them afloat through the COVID-19 crisis.

“Since we began our discussions with the Government of Canada three weeks ago, we have lost between $6 billion to $8 billion of investment in the Canadian energy sector,” CAPP said in a press release. “This has resulted in job losses across the country and further damage to every sector of our economy.”

Why it matters: Ottawa has been examining ways to boost competition and reduce prices for wireless customers

article continues below

The CEO of Telus says major cuts to jobs, charitable contributions and investments are in store if Ottawa mandates the Vancouver-based telecom giant facilitate mobile virtual network operators (MVNO) on its infrastructure.

Darren Entwistle made the remarks at a Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) hearing Thursday (Feb. 20) in Gatineau, Quebec.

“The reduced employment is in the zip code of 5,000 jobs over the next five years,” he told the panel.

Entlwistle said Telus’ boardroom had signed off on a resolution to cut investment by about $1 billion over five years as well as an unspecified amount of its philanthropic giving.

Telus revealed in March 2019 it had contributed $150 million and one million volunteer hours to charitable organizations over the past year.

“I would ask that as we look holistically, on the eve of 5G, what’s the right thing to do for Canada, that we include quantitatively all of these factors,” the CEO said, adding he believes a facilities-based MVNO to be ""just wrong from theory to practice.""

The federal Competition Bureau recommended in November that the CRTC create a MVNO policy to boost competition and lower prices for wireless services.

Upstart competitors would gain access for five years to infrastructure owned by incumbent providers Telus, Bell Canada and Rogers Communications Inc.

While the smaller competitors could offer plans as MVNOs (companies offering services through infrastructure they don’t own), they would be expected to build out their own infrastructure during those five years.

Efforts to launch MVNOs in Canada have not been met with much success.

One MVNO, Sugar Mobile, had offered wireless services outside Canada’s northern territories through a combination of Wi-Fi and roaming agreements between sister company Ice Wireless and the incumbents.

But in 2016, Sugar drew the ire of Rogers, which accused it of circumventing regulations because most of Sugar’s customers did not live in the northern territories and therefore weren’t considered roaming while using the incumbents’ infrastructure.

Rogers won that battle when the CRTC ruled in its favour in 2017.

The recent Competition Bureau recommendations are essentially the same MVNO model Sugar was using nearly four years ago.

And when businesses turn to outside professionals for help, it’s essential that those advisors also adapt quickly to the new regulations, realities and challenges.

Over the past few years, Manning Elliott Accountants and Business Advisors has undergone a purposeful evolution to become one of the most well-respected and progressive mid-sized firms in the Lower Mainland and Fraser Valley. With 200+ dedicated professionals and staff, the firm has expanded the services it offers and increased its locations to now include offices in Vancouver, Burnaby, Surrey and Abbotsford.

To celebrate and acknowledge this transformation, Manning Elliott is positioning its new brand identity to reflect these changes.

""Business is evolving rapidly, and so is Manning Elliott,"" said managing partner Alden Aumann.

The rebrand showcases ways in which the firm has grown in capacity and capability. “It better represents who we are as a firm and where we are going in the future — a firm that is bold, modern and professional, while building upon its reputation of trust among its longstanding clients,” Aumann says.

By trusting and relying on the expert services that Manning Elliott provides, clients have the resources that enable them to enjoy everything that life in British Columbia has to offer.

Clients have turned to Manning Elliott for accounting, assurance and tax services since 1952. These remain its core strength; however, many businesses don’t have the time or inclination to seek out other service providers to help with specific needs in more complex or challenging areas such as tax and transition planning, regulatory compliance, cross-border tax compliance and planning, international expansion, and internal business re-organization. Manning Elliott has retained some of the best advisors who bring a wealth of knowledge to these aspects of business management.

“We have a full suite of in-house business services that extend from the pre-planning stage to the final exit stage,” Alden says. “Regardless of what stage of the business life cycle a client is in, we have the resources and expertise to provide that client with assistance.”

The completely revamped website and blog, provide timely information for those who want instant insight into some of the more pressing issues facing their business today. Responding to current trends and regulations, and tapping into the expertise and experience of its professional staff, the blog provides a reassuring perspective that is further enhanced by one-to-one advisory assistance.

Areas of industry specialization among the offices include, but are not limited to, agriculture and food services, blockchain and cryptocurrency, cannabis, construction, craft breweries, mining and exploration, oil and gas, real estate, first nations, financial services, as well as technology.

In order to achieve such market dominance, Manning Elliott is continually building on its solid foundation of trusted and experienced CPAs, who take pride in their careers with the firm. It also strives to attract the best and brightest business students by positioning itself as the firm of choice for accounting graduates.

“We hire dozens of students every year and take them through intense internal training as Chartered Professional Accountants,” says Aumann, who has been with the firm for 21 years. “We also offer them a lot of support, especially through our mentoring program. From day one they focus on a career path that enhances their professional goals.”

The 18,000-sq-ft facility houses multiple buildings on a Main Street filled with streetlamps and little pedal cars for kids aged 18 months to 10 years old to “drive” around town.

Kidtropolis offers buildings like a fire hall, a post office, a police station and even a theatre for kids to explore and pretend play, but what makes the space different from other children play areas is their collaboration with business brands in the “city.”

Several businesses such as M&M Food Market, Richmond Animal Protection Society (RAPS), Richmond Honda and Boston Pizza, have their own buildings in the mini city, which exposes children to consumer brands that they may see their parents visit occasionally.

However, Ginny Lam, CEO of Kidtropolis, said Richmond businesses reached out to them when they saw their communit building mission statement aligned with theirs.

“It gives the city more life and meaning through collaborative work with businesses that the kids experience their parents going to.”

Lam opened the miniature, yet big, play area in 2016 with the intention of building a community for members and kids to re-discover creativity, imagination and social interaction in a technology-driven society.

“We wanted the kids to be able to touch and feel, put on costumes and really get into the groove of bringing back that creative and pretend play while socializing with each other,” said Lam, adding that they believe in a learning-based play space.

Axon Driver Solutions, located on the third floor of Aberdeen Centre, is a space for driving enthusiasts to test their skills, as well as an ICBC-approved driving school that integrates classroom hours, simulator time and on-road training.

Dean Chen, director and lead instructor of Axon Driver Solutions, said when the company launched two years ago, it was intended to be a service company that would supply the simulators to driving schools. However, many of those schools were hesitant to use the new technology, so instead of servicing other schools, they opened their own.

The company’s biggest challenge is overcoming the misconception among the public (and perhaps driving schools) that their driving simulator is just another arcade game, he explained.

Not only is that inaccurate, said Chen, professional race car drivers from the Formula 1 teams practice on driving simulators.

That said, Chen doesn’t believe simulators should replace on-road practice; however, the technology can effectively complement on-road practice and can help students develop basic driving skills before getting into a real car.

“A lot of people take the written test (…) but when they jump into the car and need to make quick decisions, they’re not used to it and get nervous. It’s not an easy learning environment,” Chen added.

Lindsay Wilkins, spokesperson for ICBC, said they are “gradually seeing an increase in the use of driving simulators by driver training schools over the years across B.C.,” adding that they “see value in it as an educational tool, and schools have found that simulators can assist with assessing decision-making, teaching hazard perception and can also be effective in teaching steps within maneuvers.

“We’re supportive of using technology such as simulators as part of comprehensive driver training programs, but we believe that nothing can replace actual experience and time spent on the road.”

The simulators use similar D-BOX mechanics and physics that provide an 80 to 90 per cent real-time feedback of being in a real car.

Chen and his staff want to promote the use of the simulators as a way to help students build confidence and provide a safer learning environment.

Axon Driver Solutions remodeled and reconfigured existing simulation software to make driving maps that mimic racetracks and roads like ones in Richmond.

Their hardware and simulator platform are also built by themselves minus some of the controls and parts which are bought in from other companies.

The business is partnered with two local motorsports team in a training program – expected to start next year – where one is a karting team that helps develop young kids to become future motorsports stars and the other a local team that races in Mission.

Drop-in prices for Axon Driver Solutions are $20 for 15 minutes, $36 for 30 mins and $55 for an hour. There is also a punch card option that costs $160 for 10 half-hour sessions; schedule lessons are also available.

The simulator centre is open from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday to Wednesday, and 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Thursday to Sunday.

Asa Hutchinson issued an order Thursday requiring people to wear face masks in public throughout the state, which has had a surge in coronavirus cases over the past several weeks.

The Republican governor had resisted a statewide mask mandate and opposed issuing a stay-at-home order earlier in the pandemic, but he signed the order requiring masks when social distancing isn't possible in the hopes of slowing the disease's rapid spread in the state. The order takes effect Monday.

article continues below

Hutchinson’s decision comes amid growing support for mask requirements from business and health leaders and a day after Bentonville-based Walmart said it would require customers to wear masks in all of its U.S. stores. The state’s largest newspaper, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, also called for a statewide requirement on Thursday.

Hutchinson previously encouraged people to wear masks and allowed cities to pass ordinances requiring their use, but he stopped short of requiring them statewide. He’s the latest Republican governor to relent on the mask issue in the face of a surge in COVID-19 cases. Alabama's governor issued a similar mask mandate on Wednesday.

Arkansas' coronavirus cases have dramatically risen since May, when the state began allowing businesses that had closed because of the pandemic to reopen despite warnings from national health officials about the risks of doing so too soon. Arkansas was one of a handful of states that did not issue a broader stay-at-home order that kept most businesses closed.

Hutchinson previously questioned how a mask mandate could be enforced in a rural state such as Arkansas, but this week he left open the possibility of such a requirement. The chancellor of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences called for a statewide requirement last weekend.

Hutchinson's order was expected to face criticism from some conservatives in the state. Hours before he issued the order, a Republican legislator urged people to call Hutchinson to oppose any mask directive.

A poll by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business suggested tensions are flaring between workers and employers, with around 27 per cent of 3,389 employers polled indicating some of their laid-off staff have refused to return to work.

article continues below

Of the nearly 870 businesses that provided the reasons their employees gave for refusing to return to work, 62 per cent reported workers ""prefer the Canada Emergency Response Benefit."" Employers could choose more than one explanation for why a worker refused to return, and respondents also selected options such as concern for health (47 per cent), childcare obligations (27 per cent) or lack of hours in return offer (16 per cent).

CFIB president Dan Kelly said it's ""clear"" that CERB ""created a disincentive to return to work for some staff, especially in industries like hospitality."" Other sectors where conflicts are arising include child care, dental offices, home health care, amusement parks, gambling and spectator sports, the study suggested.

""CERB was created as emergency support for workers who had lost their job due to the pandemic, not to fund a summer break,"" Kelly said in a statement.

But Ian Robb, Canadian director of the Unite Here union that represents hospitality workers, disagrees. He said workers are impatient to return to work — for what is usually the lucrative summer season — but employers are the ones failing to adopt measures like frequent cleaning and wage subsidies. The union previously estimated that average wages in cities like Toronto are around $20 per hour for hospitality.

""A number of our members in the U.S. have gone to work and contracted (COVID-19),"" Robb said.

""There's just not enough safety in front of service. Nobody wants to stay home and make two grand when they can make double that by working.""

The survey suggested that the hospitality sector had the biggest share of employers, 45 per cent, who had trouble recalling workers. CFIB defines hospitality as including hotels, restaurants and bars.

The CFIB study suggests that in the hospitality sector, 56 per cent of hard-to-fill positions were ""unskilled, entry-level jobs"" that pay ""at or around minimum wage,"" although across sectors, skilled and semi-skilled jobs were harder to fill.

Employment and human rights lawyer Neena Gupta says she has heard of tradespeople unable to perform jobs because workers failed to return.

She said the reason an employee is refusing the work matters. Lack of childcare, like daycare and camps, can be a job-protected reason for staying home, as can disabilities such as being immunocompromised, says Gupta, a partner in Gowling WLG's Waterloo Region and Toronto offices.

The federal government's website states that workers seeking CERB, which offers $500 per week over a limited period, ""should be seeking work opportunities and/or return to work when their employer makes a request for their return, provided they are able and it is reasonable to do so."" The government's COVID-19 guidelines also provide for employees to refuse to do a dangerous job, although the worker must already ""be at work"" to refuse such a task.

However, notes Gupta, general apprehension about the pandemic is likely not enough to merit a job refusal. She said workplaces must comply with health and safety guidelines, and that a ministry inspection must find some sort of violation to justify a job refusal.

Managers should give workers a written ""come back to work"" recall and an indication that it will be treated as job abandonment if the worker doesn't return, says Gupta. After that process is completed, the employer could consider that worker terminated for cause, and hire a replacement.

While reporting misuse of CERB by a former employee might appear to give an employer some moral satisfaction, Gupta says it’s unlikely to help with staffing concerns or worker morale.

""I do ask people to be reasonable. You can’t call someone at noon on a Thursday and expect them in at 7 a.m. on Friday,"" she says.

The agreement will be presented Friday to the Superior Court of Quebec for approval to become the new so-called stalking horse bid for any rival offers that may be presented next month.

A lawyer representing Quebecor suggested last week that the media conglomerate intended to make a bid.

The shareholders — the Texan fund TPG Capital, the Chinese firm Fosun and the Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec — presented a US$420-million bid June 29 when Cirque filed for creditor protection. They were counting on a US$200-million loan from the Quebec government.

The shareholders and Cirque agreed to terminate the agreement, said a Cirque statement Thursday.

""The shareholder's proposed agreement, which had set the bar for other bids, assured a path to survival following the forced closure of all of the shows resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic by providing the company funding, support, and a clear road map to relaunch,"" said the statement.

The lenders, who hold about $1 billion of the Cirque's secured debt, would inject up to $375 million, create a fund to retain employees and pay ex-workers and artisans, and maintain the company's head office in Montreal, according to a source familiar with the matter, but who is not allowed to speak publicly.

""The co-operation of the group of creditors has been extraordinary in order to achieve our objective of recapitalizing the Cirque,"" Gabriel de Alba, the managing director and partner of Catalyst Capital Group, the main creditor, said in a statement.

Deprived of income since mid-March due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Cirque cancelled its 44 shows and cut nearly 3,500 people.

For the 2020-21 season, the cap was estimated to be $84 million to $88.2 million, depending on a few factors.

That has changed.

article continues below

The suspension caused by COVID-19 and the uncertain future of the 2019-20 season leaves next season’s salary cap in serious jeopardy.

That’s because the cap is tied to league revenues. There’s meant to be a 50/50 split in revenues between the owners and the players. If there’s a drop in revenue for the owners — from a loss of gate revenue for unplayed or unattended games, unplayed playoff games, or a crashing Canadian dollar — then the NHL’s Collective Bargaining Agreement leads to less money for the players the following season in the form of a reduced salary cap.

A significant increase in the salary cap would have been a major relief for a team close to the cap like the Vancouver Canucks. The Canucks were set to have a tough time navigating the cap next season, thanks to the combination of a few highly-paid veterans, performance bonuses for young stars rolling over from this current season, Roberto Luongo’s cap recapture penalty, and several restricted and unrestricted free agents they need to re-sign.

If the salary cap went up, it’s possible the Canucks wouldn’t have to choose between UFAs Jacob Markstrom, Tyler Toffoli and Chris Tanev, but could re-sign all three. A flat cap — one that stayed at $81.5 million — would force the Canucks to choose two and possibly lose another player like Troy Stecher or Josh Leivo.

If the cap goes down? Then the Canucks are in some serious trouble, with difficult decisions to make that will undoubtedly make the team worse for next season. And they’re not the only ones: plenty of other teams would feel the cap crunch from this unprecedented situation.

Potential solutions could include an artificially inflated cap, but one option that has come up in NHL circles is compliance buyouts, with Brian Burke discussing it recently on Oilers Now, a radio program with Global News.

“I’ve heard discussion of compliance buyouts to help teams get to this new cap, to solve some of their problems,” said Burke. “In the last CBA, each team got two cap-compliance buyouts which were exempt from the cap.”

A compliance buyout would differ from a regular buyout in that it wouldn’t cost money against the salary cap. For instance, the Canucks will still have a little over $1 million against next season’s cap from buying out Ryan Spooner, but the Canucks bought out Keith Ballard and David Booth in 2013 and 2014 at no cost to their cap as compliance buyouts after the 2012-13 lockout.

If teams do get a compliance buyout, it seems obvious who the Canucks would use it on. Loui Eriksson has a $6 million cap hit for two more seasons following this one and has found himself in an increasingly-diminished role, playing primarily as a shutdown, defensive forward, with little-to-no contributions offensively.

The Canucks do have other options, however. Brandon Sutter has lost several steps and has a $4.375 million cap hit next season. They could be proactive and buy out Tyler Myers’ $6 million contract for the next four seasons before his play starts to decline. Cutting their losses on Micheal Ferland’s $3.5 million cap hit for the next three seasons might be smart. They might even be tempted to buy out Sben Baertschi’s $3.37 million contract with him buried in the AHL.

Do any of those supersede Eriksson? Probably not. Where it gets interesting is if teams get two buyouts, as they did in 2013 and 2014. Buying out Eriksson would be a given, then, but who would be the second buyout? Sutter has just one year left on his contract, Ferland’s cap hit isn’t overly onerous, and Tyler Myers is still a good, useful player.

One compliance buyout would make it far easier for the Canucks to re-sign Markstrom and Tanev. Two might mean re-signing Toffoli as well.

Stick-taps and Glove-drops

A tap of the stick to Eddie Lackas he announced his retirement from professional hockey on Monday. The former Canuck said the “best time in my career” was in Vancouver and thanked the fans sincerely.

A big stick-tap to Bauer. The hockey equipment manufacturer has modified its production line to produce protective visors for healthcare workers, with Quebec already ordering 300,000 visors for their doctors, nurses, and first responders.

Big Numbers

89 In four seasons with the Canucks, Loui Eriksson has a total of 38 goals and 89 points. He had 30 goals and 63 points in just one season with the Boston Bruins prior to signing with the Canucks.

4 So far, four NHL players have tested positive for COVID-19: two from the Ottawa Senators and two from the Colorado Avalanche. The Senators’ radio colour commentator, Gord Wilson, has also tested positive, as has St. Louis Blues’ play-by-play announcer John Kelly.

And it’s all free admission.

“We’ve always billed ourselves as an affordable option to the PNE, with significantly more performers and a chance to have fun at that last, major family event before the kids go back to school,” says Bryan Tasaka, manager of major events with the City of Richmond.

“This is a great opportunity for families to come out and see some amazing live music for free, while enjoying a huge variety of things to do, see and taste from cultures around the world.”

Expectations are that 50,000 to 60,000 people will attend the festival, which runs from 4 p.m.to 10 p.m. on Friday andfrom11 a.m. to 10 p.m. on Saturday.

“This year we’ve added free skating and broom ball in the Antarctic Zone at Minoru Arenas where we’ll turn on the disco lights, put on some fun music and let people cool off,” Tasaka says.

The Richmond World Festival has also partnered with Cinevolution Media Arts which produces Your Kontinent Digital Carnival, an outdoor exhibit that transforms shipping containers into pop-up galleries offering a unique perspective on the complex relationship between art, nature and technology, while contemplating what it means to live in a port city.

“The Digital Carnival willfeature 11 artists who will create installations using projection and soundscapes that this year will follow the theme of fire,” Tasaka says.

Then there’s the How To’s … which demonstrates the skills needed to produce a variety of cultural crafts, such as origami, finger weaving, Japanese book binding, European hand puppets and Ukrainian Pysanky (Easter eggs).

In a multicultural city like Richmond, the event has been a huge success.

“It’s been a great fit,” Tasaka says. “Many great cultures have been represented, whether by an exhibitor’s booth, the food trucks that boast cuisines from all over the world, as well as the Culinary Stage that showcases different types of food.”

The best way to reach the site without a vehicle is either by public transit - SkyTrain’s Canada Line terminates less than 1 km from Minoru Park - or by bicycle. Two bike valet options are located on the festival grounds.

Those travelling by car can park at the Richmond Centre multi-level parkade or Richmond City Hall, both of which are a short walk from the park.

Minoru Park is located at 7191 Granville Avenue in Richmond, between Minoru Boulevard and Gilbert Road.

""Apart from losing sleep,"" Paul says, ""sleep apnea can cause you to stop breathing for a short period, resulting in a drop of oxygen levels in your blood stream. If left untreated, the drop in oxygen levels can lead to cardiovascular issues, hypertension, diabetes, and even stroke.""

article continues below

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) causes a loss of muscle tone in the muscles that keep the airway open, resulting in the tongue and tissue falling back and blocking the airway.

""Patients with OSA are continually woken from deep sleep, so they're tired the next day,"" he explains. ""It's a very prevalent condition; about 75 percent of sufferers don't even realize they have it.""

A common misconception is that sleep apnea is caused by being overweight. While obesity can be one cause of the condition, says Paul, it's not the only one.

""At Coastal Sleep, we treat a lot of slim patients who suffer from sleep apnea because of an anatomical issue with their throat,"" Paul notes. ""Some people have a really short jaw and/or crowded airway. Or they have large tonsils and redundant tissue in the throat.""

Most patients experience the obvious symptom of snoring or their partners notice frequent interruptions in their breathing. Another symptom could be those frequent bathroom visits in the night.

""That's the starting point,"" Paul says. ""Then there are other related issues such as headaches in the morning, or a feeling of heartburn. When we're screening patients we look at the symptoms as just one part of the puzzle. If they have other medical conditions, including high blood pressure, obesity, diabetes, or previous heart failure, they're at a higher risk for sleep apnea.""

“Kids are like sponges when it comes to soaking up adult behaviour,” he explains. “Today, parental involvement has become massive and with that comes a certain amount of conflict. I’ve seen some really good coaches behind the bench who send the right message to kids on how to handle any adversity or conflict. It’s a great skill to pass on to a young person.”

Nigel points out that it’s not just the kids that benefit.

“Richmond has an unusual demographic when it comes to recruiting kids into programs. We tend to lose families who move out of the area for one reason or another, but we also get to welcome new Canadians, some of whom have never picked up a hockey stick before. We find that the parents of these kids benefit from socializing with other parents. It brings down barriers and helps with any language issues.”

Nigel and his coaches are often asked by parents what they can do to make their youngster a better hockey player.

“Please let them play other sports,” he says. “If you want your kid to be a top hockey player, let them go and play soccer or baseball as well. Let them follow their curiosity and see where their abilities are.’

Ongoing layoffs and the shutdown of non-essential services has caused many in Richmond to have reduced incomes or to lose income, with limited change in essential expenses, including servicing debt.

The uncertainty of these circumstances can become dire for many, so it’s no surprise the majority of Canadians are more concerned about their financial health over their physical wellbeing during this pandemic.

Here are five ways Canadians can help manage debt during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Apply for the help you’re eligible for

As the COVID-19 crisis continues to evolve, there are several resources available to eligible Canadians to help relieve some financial burden. Financial assistance can come from traditional Employment Insurance, municipal and provincial rental assistance programs for tenants, the Emergency Care Benefit program, or extended benefits at work, if available.

To know what financial assistance you are eligible for, you will have to do some research first, then submit any applications promptly as processing times may be longer due to application numbers, the possibility of reduced staff and hours of operations.

Look to your bank for assistance

Many of Canada’s major banks have implemented changes to lending rules in response to COVID-19. These changes are designed for people experiencing loss of income and businesses experiencing profit loss.

Mortgage payment deferrals, skipping payments, loan extensions, revised terms or even reduced interest rates are all things your lenders can consider.

If you can, use deferred payments to create or deepen your emergency savings for the future.

Contact your bank or credit union for further information and assistance as they will be your best source of information that will be helpful to your particular financial situation.

Alter your existing budget and create a new emergency budget

While getting financial help through your bank or personal lending company is advised, we also have to do our part during this unprecedented time. This means, cutting down on spending and adhering to a new budget in accordance with your individual circumstances.

While it’s too late to save for this emergency, creating a new budget based on a reduced level of income and any changes in monthly expenses is entirely possible. Include all family members in the discussion about reducing costs and consider cancelling or putting on hold non-essential monthly fees like subscription services - these can add up.

While self-isolating, ask to put other monthly expenses like parking passes and gym memberships on hold so you can allot this money for essential items and expenses.

Consider a personal loan in an emergency

Personal loans don’t require any security and can be used for any purpose, making them an ideal financial resource in the face of an emergency. A personal loan is a flexible form of financing that allows you to access a lump sum with a fixed repayment schedule. This type of loan can be obtained quickly, especially through a licensed online lender.

Seek Advice

Many of us are facing financial uncertainty and there’s no shame in asking for help. If you are experiencing looming debt issues as a result of COVID-19 or other circumstances, consider seeking the advice of a credit counselling service. Credit counsellors can offer tailored advice and if you qualify, enrol you into a Debt Management Program (DMP) to consolidate unsecured debts into one, affordable, monthly payment. Creditors are more likely to accept a DMP in a financial crisis because some payment will be collected.

“Times are really tough right now, and what we are seeing with the COVID-19 pandemic is completely unprecedented”, explains Loans Canada Chief Technology Officer, Cris Ravazzano.

“We are seeing a lot of volatility in the lending space, with some lenders slowing or even temporarily stopping their operations. On the other hand, many lending institutions are designated as essential services and are choosing to keep their doors open. As Canada’s first and largest loan comparison website, our close relationship with these institutions enables us to continue to provide Canadians with the emergency financial solutions they need. We have also made it a priority to maintain up-to-date information on COVID-19’s effect on the credit industry and invite Canadians to visit www.loanscanada.ca for the latest information.”

The impacts of COVID-19 are widespread, affecting all Canadians. If you’re experiencing financial hardship and are coping with debt during these exceptional times, use what tools and forms of relief are available to manage the circumstances. Although you may feel overwhelmed at the prognosis of your financial health and debt repayment, the first step to addressing debt is to come up with a plan.",[]

With long-established roots in Hong Kong and Mainland China, the company offers ongoing consulting services that include business registration and legal advice, market analysis and strategy development for companies that want to expand their reach into Asia.

“Over the past few weeks I have seen a jump in demand for our space not only from freelancers, consultants, and small companies, but also medium and large companies that have what we used to think of as enviable office space downtown,” says HYCITY HUB Executive Director Victoir Wu.

“In a post-COVID-19 world, we believe the coworking demand will probably be led by larger organizations looking to decentralize work forces.”

To ensure a safe and hygienic workplace that will set their members at ease, HYCITY HUB is rolling out new health and safety practices. They will also be providing disposable face masks and hand sanitizer to clients. Their space will operate at limited capacity to ensure social distancing.

“Our members can rest assured that we are complying with governmental regulations and encouraging optimal hygiene standards,” Wu adds.

HYCITY HUB, in collaboration with Meiga Health Group, has also launched an online store to address the shortage of essential medical supplies and products in Canada. HYCTY HUB strives to deliver the highest quality of medical supplies by importing directly from certified factories that offer the highest quality of personal protective equipment at the lowest price.

“It was not an easy process to pick our winners this year,” says Frederick Weil, co-head of Richmond FC’s scholarship committee.

“We had quite a few people who applied and everybody was deserving.”

Consistency, dedication, teamwork, and leadership on and off the field are the main criteria for the award. While skill level is taken into consideration, the scholarships are not automatically given to the best players.

“There is by no means an expectation that the person is a standout player or a star. If you look at the kids chosen to receive the scholarships, they represent different teams and different levels. We look for players that are good people all-around, on and off the field,” Weil says.

Richmond FC’s scholarship program for graduating players was created to provide a way to thank players for their years of involvement with the club, and a way to keep them connected for years to come. It also reflects the soccer club’s commitment to positive involvement in its community, including leading events such as large food drives.

“We want what the kids learn in soccer to carry forward into their lives,” Weil says.

“Its not just about playing games on the field, it’s also about what you learn on and off it as well, and what you take back to the community. Yes, the club is about playing soccer, but it’s also about being involved and connected to your community. The scholarship is a reflection of that.”

RFC is committed in providing an inclusive, encouraging and positive experience to all players in Richmond. And the programming reflects that.

Students typically have at least one parent who speaks French or has a French-language heritage, or a sibling who has been educated in a French school system elsewhere in Canada.

Instilling a sense of cultural and linguistic pride in children of a minority population is not easy, but the schools in the CSF system have shown that it can be done through patience and persistence.

Here are 4 suggestions from Réjean Gosselin, principal of l'école des Naviagateurs in Richmond, about how to share your cultural heritage with your children:

1. Keep the older generation involved

""It's important to keep the grandparents and older relatives involved,"" says M. Gosselin. ""They have stories to tell—and they can keep the culture alive. Also, they most likely want to speak French. So it's a win-win for the child and the grandparent.""

2. Have fun with the language

If children feel forced to speak a language other than English, or feel like it's mandatory, very often they will refuse.

""We try to have children speaking French at school, but we don't force it,"" M. Gosselin says. ""We want them to enjoy the language. We try to make it fun with games and play—we want to celebrate our language and culture.""

3. Share activities in French together

Movies in French can be found on video-on-demand services like Netflix, or your local library might still have the DVD versions. Movies can help us connect to the French language and to the francophone culture.

4. Live your heritage

Probably the most straightforward way to share your heritage with your child is to live it every day. Speak French with your child most, if not all, of the time. Experiment with French recipes at mealtimes. Bring French books home from the library. Boost your collection of French music CDs. For younger children, read them French fairy tales and nursery rhymes.

""At l'école des Naviagateurs, we have French books in our library,"" M. Gosselin says. ""And we encourage parents and children to read them together.""

That is the paramount rule when designing their physics and aesthetics.

This is the explanation denturist Alex Hupka at Esthetics Denture Studio likes to use when outlining how partial dentures are made.

article continues below

“If you have lost one or more natural teeth in your upper or lower jaw, and you don’t want a bridge or an implant because it is cost-prohibitive, then a partial denture can be a viable alternative,” Alex says.

You can have a partial denture fabricated and inserted just about any time after losing teeth. The sooner you replace the missing teeth, the healthier it is for your remaining dentition. “If you don’t have a partial fabricated, the space created between the existing teeth will allow the surrounding ones to drift into that open area. This is called the Domino Effect. Where space is present, the bone deteriorates, and the natural teeth that are left begin to wobble, and develop what we call mobility. If you don’t have a partial, and you bite down using a natural tooth with nothing beside it, the tooth ligament stretches unfavourably, damaging it and making the tooth mobile,” Alex says.

Partial dentures help stabilize the surrounding natural teeth, keeping their ligaments healthy by decreasing the tendency of unnatural, lateral movement.

Partial dentures are made precisely for comfort and fit. “I call it bio-ergonomic design,” Alex says. Making these dentures involves following the tissues and existing wear patterns in the client’s natural teeth to act as a guide on how the partial should fit to provide the most natural bite.

On average, with no other changes to surrounding teeth, they can last for about a decade.

“Partial dentures fabricated from chromium cobalt are made using the same material as artificial hips,” Alex says. “It’s extremely rigid and light.”

For those unfamiliar with the concept, hotpot dining involves ordering a choice of savoury broth and a selection of fresh and usually raw ingredients, which diners cook in the broth, then dip into their choice of sauce. This fun and interactive dining concept has long been popular in Asia and is quickly growing in popularity in the West.

Unlike regular hotpot, where a group shares one or maybe two large pots, Dolar Shop Hot Pot is known for offering individual pots, which ensure all diners eat exactly what they want.

One of the restaurant’s most popular menu items is the Individual Seafood Hotpot. Shrimp Pâté and fresh Wagyu Beef are also a hit, but the most important element in the hotpot experience is the soup base, which is made from scratch using ingredients of the highest quality.

The base is so important, in fact, that hotpot chef Jack Zhao, who has been with Dolar Shop Hot Pot for 10 years, was brought all the way from China to work at the Lansdowne Centre restaurant. He is one of the only people in the world entrusted with the secret recipes for the restaurant’s exclusive sauces and soup bases.

Go easy, sun-worshippers.

That’s the advice from the trained professionals at Body Glo Tan at Blundell Centre.

If you want that gently bronzed appearance, get there safely by slowly building up to the look you desire with a series of tanning bed sessions that will not only give you better results, but will also be easy on your skin.

“You need to tan in moderation,” says Nicole Herbert, manager at Body Glo Tan. “And when you use a tanning bed, it’s important to use an indoor, tanning lotion to protect and hydrate your skin.”

Plus, remember to stay away from using oils or any outdoor tanning products.

“An SPF (Sun Protection Factor) lotion should not be used when you are on an indoor tanning bed unless you are covering up a scar or mole,” Herbert says. “And you must also wear the proper eye protection.”

Moderation is another key factor.

“You don’t want to over expose your skin,” Herbert explains. “Just like tanning outdoors, you don’t want to be there from sun up to sun down.”

Coming in to use one of Body Glo Tan’s sun beds every other day during your measured build-up to a tan allows your skin to rejuvenate and achieve longer-lasting results.

“That base can give you more protection from burning when you go away to a sun destination,” Herbert says.

Your natural skin tone will determine how many tanning bed sessions will be needed - those with fairer complexions will generally require more time. For a more immediate tanned appearance, you can opt for Body Glo Tan’s spray tan.

Keep in mind, that process is purely cosmetic and does not produce a natural tan that can offer protection from the sun.

“You can start with the tanning beds to achieve a natural tan, and then use the spray tan as a finishing product to get that deep, tanned look,” Herbert says.

When looking for a spray tan, Herbert suggests doing some online research to find a salon, which uses organic solutions that also have a purple undertone.

“That purple undertone cuts out the chance someone walks out of the salon with an orange, Oompa Loompa look,” she says.

When done, the spray tan can last from between seven to 10 days.

The results of an X-ray and blood test revealed tell-tale signs of COVID-19. Doctors decided to immediately sedate, intubate, and send Li to Royal Columbian Hospital, one of the province’s primary COVID-19 sites. There, he became the youngest COVID-positive patient to be mechanically ventilated in the hospital’s intensive care unit during the pandemic’s spring peak, according to the RCH foundation.

“I didn’t have a chance to tell anybody,” Li recalls after hearing he would be placed in an induced coma. “My mom was outside at the waiting area in the ER, and social workers called her.”

“His blood levels of oxygen were ridiculously low, so he needed quite a lot of oxygen to support him,” said Dr. Robert Sharpe, a critical care physician at RCH. “His carbon dioxide levels were also quite high. It was quite difficult to blow off CO2 because his lungs were greatly inflamed from the body’s reaction to the virus. He was pretty touch and go early on.”

A personal trainer and competitive mixed-martial artist who controlled his type 2 diabetes through diet and exercise, Li remained hospitalized for a month and remembers nothing about the first three weeks. During that time, ICU teams kept a close watch on his blood gases, made sure his organs were getting enough oxygen, and watched for signs of new infections.

Since there is no specific treatment yet for COVID-19, patients are supported medically in the hopes they can fight off the virus.

“He fooled us a couple of times, where we thought he was ready to come off the ventilator,” said Sharpe. “And then we just needed to give him more time, and he turned around.”

When he regained consciousness, Li was surprised at the amount of weight and muscle he lost. It took him a while to start moving comfortably again.

“In the beginning, it was pretty rough,” he said. “I didn’t realize that being in a bed for a month, I could have so much muscle atrophy.”

While his time at Royal Columbian is hazy, Li says the care – from the doctors to the nurses and physiotherapists – stands out, as does other, simpler milestones.

“My fondest memory was getting the tubes out of my nose and eating actual food for the first time in a month,” Li said. “That felt pretty good.”",[]

Dr. Michael Schwandt, who was one of the first infectious disease specialists from Vancouver Coastal Health to help contain outbreaks at sites like the Lynn Valley Care Centre, made the comments not long after a group of 239 scientists from 32 countries wrote an open letter to the World Health Organization, successfully appealing for the world health body to change its guidance on aerosolized transmission.

“We'll be watching closely the science around airborne transmission. At this time, we don't think it's played a major role in the outbreaks in Vancouver Coastal Health that we've had direct experience with,” said Dr. Schwandt.

The new W.H.O. guidance, which came last Thursday, accepts that the novel coronavirus can spread through aerosolized particles — tiny droplets in the air — in crowded indoor settings for prolonged periods of time.

“There have been reported outbreaks of COVID-19 in some closed settings, such as restaurants, nightclubs, places of worship or places of work where people may be shouting, talking, or singing.

“In these outbreaks, aerosol transmission, particularly in these indoor locations where there are crowded and inadequately ventilated spaces where infected persons spend long periods of time with others, cannot be ruled out,” reads the W.H.O.’s new guidance, which also calls for more research into aerosol transmission. aerosol transmission.

But Dr. Schwandt said his team doesn’t view the airborne versus droplet transmission debate as a binary, and that while the virus can be traced at varying distances at concentrations, most of the cases he’s come across in Vancouver Coastal Health region, home to the first outbreaks in the country, have been from “face-to-face” transmission.

The proof, he said, comes from Vancouver Coastal’s success in tracing contacts based on direct contact, an experience a spokesperson for Fraser Health told the Tri-City News has been echoed in their health authority.

“Without taking airborne transmission into account as a risk factor, we've been able to bring outbreaks under good control, really looking at close physical contact as the main risk factor,” said Dr. Schwandt.

That means, at the moment, current ventilation systems in places like long-term care homes are not considered a risk factor in the spread of the virus.

Airborne or not, sharing air in large, indoor public gatherings raises everyone’s risk of transmitting the virus, as Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry reminded British Columbians in her daily update Tuesday.

“Stay away from closed spaces as much as possible,” she said. “If it’s a house party, you may not know all the people who are there.”

And like the W.H.O., health officials in B.C. said they are keeping an eye on the science.

“If more evidence were to develop around airborne or aerosol transmission, then naturally we'd need to look at preventative measures that include attention to ventilation,” said Dr. Schwandt.",[]

What is COVID-19?

COVID-19 symptoms are similar to other respiratory illnesses, including the flu and common cold. They include cough, sneezing, fever, sore throat and difficulty breathing.

The best way to prevent potential transmission is to wash your hands for at least 20 seconds, avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth, cough or sneeze into a tissue or your sleeve, avoid contact with people who are sick, and stay home if you are sick.

This is a developing story.

In one cluster, at least 17 cases have been traced to a group of people who met up in Kelowna, some from the Interior and Alberta, others from the Lower Mainland.

“There are a number of people who have been exposed in those events,” said Henry Tuesday.

More troubling still is the emergence of new cases at the Krazy Cherry Fruit Company in Oliver, where two have been identified among migrant workers. They were among 62 cases identified in B.C. between Friday and Monday.

“Public health teams are monitoring the situation closely and have placed restrictions on those living and working on the farm to limit the potential for further transmission,” said Dr. Henry in a written statement today.

But others have expressed concerns that not enough is being done to prevent outbreaks among vulnerable groups. Where newly arrived immigrants were disproportionately affected at earlier outbreaks at poultry plants in Coquitlam, others say migrant agricultural workers still run higher risks due to inadequate housing.

“As anticipated,” said Byron Cruz of Sanctuary Health, an organization that works to protect migrant workers from predatory practices. “We knew that something was going to happen because the situation for housing in that farm is terrible. They were all crowded.”

‘WAY ABOVE MY COMFORT ZONE’

Yesterday, Dr. Henry warned 25 cases a day was “distressing” and “cautionary to us.” And while not unexpected due to the increased travel and social interaction of phase 3, she said “That’s way above my comfort zone.”

Dr. Henry urged anyone who attended Canada Day parties in the vicinity of the Kelowna cluster to self-monitor for even the mildest of symptoms, noting that anyone can be tested should they feel they’ve been exposed.

Just how quickly a province or state can backslide has been painted in stark relief among our neighbours to the south.

In comments to the press Tuesday, Health Minister Adrian Dix pointed to surges in several U.S. states where record breaking daily caseloads in several states have led jurisdictions like California to re-introduce physical distancing protocols, in what Dix described as “lockdown 2.0.”

“All our neighbouring jurisdictions continue to see an increase, whether it’s our neighbouring province to the east, Alberta, or others, Washington, Oregon and California, in Nevada, Arizona and in other American states — we’ve seen record days of new cases of COVID-19 recently,” said Dix.

Here in B.C., Henry said that on Monday, she checked how weekly caseloads are tracking with the province’s modelling that suggests British Columbians keep their social contacts to 65% of normal.

“We are still skirting that line. The RT, the reproductive number, is hovering around one… which is sort of pushing the limits of where we need to be,” she said.

While health officials work to contain the outbreak in Oliver, it’s unclear how a potential surge in cases will affect that calculation, and Byron Cruz of Sanctuary Health said he expects more cases to crop up in coming days due to their tight living quarters.

What is clear is the more cases are contained to a single cluster, the easier they are to track.

“This is going to be our dance over the next few months, where we do what we can do, we travel, we have those social interactions, but we do it in a thoughtful way so we do it with the people we know we’re with,” said Dr. Henry.",[]

The question is whether strong summer sales — driven in part by delayed purchasers waiting to buy since spring's lockdown — will carry forward to fall, experts said.

article continues below

The Canadian Real Estate Association on Wednesday reported that June sales were up 63 per cent on a month-over-month basis, and 15.2 per cent higher than the same time last year. Prices also rose from June 2019, up 6.5 per cent to an average $539,000.

""Home sales, prices and starts have effectively regained all the ground lost during the shutdown,"" BMO chief economist Douglas Porter wrote in a note to clients.

""However, fair point that some of this outsized strength is simply pent-up demand for the lost sales from the key spring season.""

The real estate industry came to a near standstill earlier this year as non-essential businesses closed to help slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. CREA said the jump in sales returned them to ""normal levels"" for June, noting they were up 150 per cent from where they were in April.

Porter said the housing market now must keep up its momentum headed into autumn. Though at a glance, the numbers appear to suggest nothing ""amiss in the economy whatsoever,"" the market will have to balance slowing immigration levels, low interest rates and short housing supply, he said in the note. This tension will come with lasting scars, he said.

Also on Wednesday, the Bank of Canada released its quarterly outlook, forecasting an uncertain economic recovery ahead, and suggesting housing activity will slow over the next few years.

Royal LePage CEO Phil Soper said that the ""pent-up demand"" in the market has been boosted by first-time homebuyers looking for bargains during the downturn. That can crunch the number of new listings, since first-time owners don't have a home to sell, he said, noting CREA's data showed housing inventory at a 16-year low. The association said that the number of newly listed properties climbed 49.5 per cent from May to June.

If there are too many home buyers and too few listings available, that can drive up prices, said Soper. Soper predicts that more existing homeowners may list their homes in the fall, which may cause price increases to level off.

""We're seeing upward pressure on prices, and the highest levels of demand in Ontario and Quebec,"" said Soper. ""Things are good in other parts of the country, but they're quite calm, where the number of people looking for homes and the number of homes available for sale are roughly equal.""

Sherry Cooper, chief economist at Dominion Lending Centres, said in a client note that home prices are declining in Calgary, while elsewhere on the prairies, prices are either flat or rising.

Tim Otitoju, a Regina, Sask.-based real estate agent and chairperson of the province's real estate association, said that while the supply of homes for sale is steady and a bit low, sellers are getting more comfortable with the provincial measures to re-open business.

""We saw a surge in demand in June — we are actually attributing that to the buyers that held off during the shutdown,"" said Otitoju. ""It seems that buyers and sellers are showing a lot of confidence in the provincial reopening plan. Sellers are starting to put their houses back on the market.""

Soper said that he was reassured by the recovery in the West, given oil price volatility and regulatory changes in British Columbia. If immigration does slow, said Soper, it may be a few years before the long-term impacts surface, since homeownership for new Canadians spikes between three and seven years after arrival.

While home sales may be hitting ""normal levels,"" the overall housing market is ""obviously not back to normal at this point,"" said Shaun Cathcart, CREA's senior economist.

""The market has recovered much faster than many would have thought, but what happens later this year remains a big question mark,"" said Cathcart in a statement.

""That said, daily tracking suggests that July, at least, will be even stronger.""

The Canadian Federation of Independent Business surveyed more than 4,500 small business owners online from June 26 to July 2 and found that 2,100 respondents took on an average $135,000 in debt ($285.4 million for the responding group as a whole).

article continues below

Laura Jones, the executive vice-president of the organization that represents at least 110,000 small businesses, said debt has ballooned as 58 per cent of small businesses re-opened fully.

About 35 per cent are back to full staffing but only 24 per cent are back to normal revenue, she said.

""I've talked to many businesses that are open again, but are worried about being able to outrun the debt they have accumulated, particularly with sales still down,"" Jones said in a statement.

At the national level, that debt amounts to billions of dollars.

To finance COVID-19 revenue shortfalls and extra costs, the CFIB survey found 37 per cent of businesses are relying on personal savings, 34 per cent on credit cards, 18 per cent on bank loans, 11 per cent on retirement savings and 9 per cent each on mortgages and loans from families and friends.

Josie Rudderham, a co-owner of Cake and Loaf Bakery in Hamilton, Ont., wasn't surprised by the findings because her 12-year-old company was hit hard when COVID-19 began.

Cake and Loaf temporarily closed one location, permanently shut down a second and laid off workers right as the company's busiest season — Easter — hit. It emptied out what treats it had ready for sale and sent them home with employees or over to health care workers and food banks.

""A lot of expenses didn't stop, the overhead really didn't slow down that much, insurance itself is a big chunk of what we pay and that didn't get reduced. In fact, it went up,"" she said.

Rudderham, who has since reopened a location for curbside pickup, had to take out a loan to deal with cash flow issues and said many of her fellow small business owners did the same because they don't have the cash reserves larger companies do.

""I anticipate it will take us more than a decade to pay off some of this debt that we've had to take on because we are never aiming for profit,"" she said. ""We're aiming to break even every year and then every year we also increase wages because living wage gets recalculated every year.""

James McIntosh, the founder of Meaford, Ont.-based Duxbury Cider and chair of the Ontario Craft Cider Association, also stumbled on troubles when bars and restaurants were forced to close in March.

Duxbury's sales dropped 53 per cent, but McIntosh still considered himself fortunate because his family operates the farm and only has a few workers on staff.

He took out a loan and later, when patios reopened saw about a fifth of his licensed business came back.

Others borrowed money and didn't have such luck. They could be trying to cover what they lost for far longer, he said.

""Some of the smaller guys were really hurt because they didn't have an LCBO or grocery store (selling arrangement),"" he said. ""They were basically relying on what business they could drum up locally with bars and restaurants.""

According to the polling industry's generally accepted standards, online surveys cannot be assigned a margin of error because they do not randomly sample the population.

“The decision about criminal jury trials is entirely in the hands of the chief justice of the Supreme Court and the judiciary,” David Eby said. “On our end, the sheriffs and court services branch are working very closely with the judiciary to support the courts in getting jury trials up and running as soon as we can.”

article continues below

The court is expected to make an announcement on criminal jury trials this week.

The pandemic has created a significant backlog in court cases, Eby said. Four thousand cases were adjourned when in-person hearings were restricted in B.C. Supreme Court. The provincial court has adjourned more than 10,000 cases, including traffic tickets, family matters, minor prosecutions and small claims.

To help deal with the backlog, Eby has proposed a one-year restriction on civil jury trials.

But people accused of a criminal offence have a constitutional right to a jury trial. It’s considered the key to a fair and just system. To choose a jury, whether civil or criminal, requires the assembling of a significant number of people, Eby said.

“Potential solutions include larger venues for jury selection and doing tiered selection, where you bring in one group of people, and then another group of people, as opposed to typically bringing in around 200 people and selecting from the pool,” he said.

The order of the provincial health officer limiting all public gatherings to 50 people makes it a challenge, he said.

At the Victoria courthouse, defence lawyers have been setting criminal jury trial dates for the fall, even though they believe it’s unlikely their trials will go ahead.

Criminal defence lawyer Jordan Watt said it’s difficult to conceptualize getting 12 people together, approximately one foot apart from each other, to listen to the evidence throughout a trial which could last one week or up to three or four months.

“Then to get them to deliberate together without there being some type of massive construction to the current courtroom setup that we have right now, it’s just not going to happen,” Watt said.

“Even if you go a step further, I think you’re going to have problems getting people to come to court in order to be selected as jurors.”

All the provinces are struggling with the issue, said Eby, who is part of a national committee co-chaired by Chief Justice Richard Wagner and federal Justice Minister and Attorney General David Lametti.

The committee offers national guidance to chief justices, judges and court administration officials on the gradual resumption of court operations across Canada. The action committee is dealing with the challenges of jury trials and hearings in small court rooms, circuit and remote courts. It has released a document around best practices for jury trials and how to try and conduct jury trials in the COVID-19 era.

Eby has repeatedly asked Lametti to give increased discretion to judges under the Criminal Code around jury trials to address the realities of COVID-19.

“He’s indicated that he’s willing to look at those things, but the earliest they could be in the legislature is in the fall, so we’ve got quite a period of time before that happens,” Eby said.

The provincial attorneys general have also been asking the federal government for guidance on the timelines of the Jordan decision during COVID-19, Eby said.

In July 2016, in R. v. Jordan, the Supreme Court of Canada created new limits of 18 months from the time a charge is laid until the trial is completed in provincial courts and 30 months in superior court. Anything longer violates the accused’s right to be tried within a reasonable time, unless the prosecution can show exceptional circumstances.

“It’s clear that in exceptional circumstances you can go beyond the Jordan timelines,” Eby said. “The question for everybody is how long is the exceptional circumstance in relation to COVID.”

He hopes the federal government can give the provinces a legislated COVID-19 period that is deemed to be an exceptional circumstance “so we don’t end up with different exceptional circumstances across Canada and different standards of access to justice for the accused.”

Eby is calling for mandatory arbitration of ICBC claims to deal with the backlog.

“There were already a significant number of people waiting a long period of time for their trials,” he said. “Now we’re looking at allowing plaintiffs to require ICBC to enter into a binding arbitration process so they can have their matter heard sooner and relieve pressure on the court.”

Another strategy would allow people to appear virtually in both traffic and family matters. This would free the court from restrictions on how many courtrooms and how much spacing is needed, he said.",[]

That’s been the automatic response in most of the world. It’s undeniably effective, and an overwhelmingly popular approach. So Finance Minister Carole James committed Tuesday to carrying on. But her fiscal update vividly illustrated what the government is up against.

article continues below

Her February budget was balanced, with a few hundred million in reserve.

The new estimate is a deficit this year of $12.5 billion, the biggest ever, and one that developed almost instantly.

That’s not a forecast. The situation is so wildly unpredictable they’ve give up doing forecasts. They’re just “scenarios” now. So it could go higher.

As James said: “That's why we've developed a scenario, rather than a typical forecast, because of the unprecedented nature of COVID-19 and the uncertainty regarding the magnitude of the economic decline caused by the pandemic.”

She’s acknowledged there will be deficits for at least the next three years. But it’s more likely to be a decade or more.

(Two years ago officials marked the elimination of just one component of B.C.’s debt, the operating debt stemming mostly from accumulated deficits. It took 40 years to accomplish that.)

The federal government did a similar update last week. Its projected deficit of $34 billion has jumped to $343 billion because of the pandemic.

So the on-going federal-provincial plan to keep helping people is based on borrowing more and more money to pay for it.

Rock-bottom interest rates will ease some concern about the hole they’re digging.

And there are projections that the economic collapse will only last for a year. So an optimistic outlook would be a one-year catastrophe followed by a bounce back in 2021, followed by years of whittling deficits back down to size.

Government finances obviously depend entirely on the private sector economy. James’ briefing included an exhaustive list of crises in different sectors.

Roughly half the new deficit is the new spending to help people cope ($5 billion in direct aid, $1.3 billion in deferred taxes and extensions). The other half arises from a collapse in government revenues.

There is a billion less in personal income tax, another billion less in corporate income tax and $1.3 billion less in sales tax, as examples. That’s all due to retail sales dropping 24 per cent, home sales down 45 per cent, 235,000 fewer jobs, corporate profits down 36 per cent and a seven to eight per cent drop in the provincial GDP, all in the last five months.

“No one has a playbook for dealing with this,” James said. So the plan they’ve fashioned is based on the fervent hope this is a one-year nightmare.

She has plans to announce a “recovery plan framework” in September, which would outline the expectations for how $1.5 billion in stimulus spending might be used.

But all the “scenarios” depend on the COVID-19 daily counts. Any sustained increases or outbreaks could delay recovery plans. That would make economic calamity even grimmer and more protracted than it already is.

Whatever the virus does in the next while, COVID-19 will be around for years as an economic factor.

Just So You Know: James spent 60 minutes detailing the extent of the economic catastrophe. She ran through 24 slides showing devastating impacts on every single aspect of the economy.

But the official news release covering her update was a study in deliriously-upbeat positivity. It was headed: “B.C.’s strong fiscal response, economic foundation support people.”

It rehashed all the previous good news announcements, ignored all the alarms and buried the stunning news there “could be” a $12.5 billion deficit.

It’s probably a firing offence for communications staff to write anything that leaves a negative impression in these sorts of releases.

But in a world where governments are spending more than ever, getting their own news out and covering themselves on all platforms as they see fit, the release is a reminder: It’s good to get an independent view.

Amendments to the Workers Compensation Act would increase the maximum insurable earnings to $100,000 from $87,100.

article continues below

The government says it is aiming for at least 90 per cent of workers to have 100 per cent of their earnings covered if they are can't work because of an injury suffered on the job.

The bill would also allow the safety agency to obtain search and seizure warrants when it investigates workplace safety infractions, if authorized by a court.

As well, it would allow victim impact statements to be heard in court in serious workplace prosecutions.

Labour Minister Harry Bains said the changes will help injured workers and their families, while also giving WorkSafeBC more tools to investigate workplace incidents.

""This bill makes modest but important improvements to several aspects of British Columbia's workers compensation system,"" Bains told the legislature.

The legislation would strengthen the way occupational diseases caused by viral pathogens are handled by fast-tracking the presumption for when a virus was contracted on the job, if established by WorkSafeBC's board of directors.

The government says this would mean people who are at higher risk of contracting COVID-19 at work are able to get benefits more quickly.

It would also expedite health care for a worker before a claim is accepted in cases when treatment would likely prevent a significant deterioration in health.

The government says in a statement that the legislation would allow WorkSafeBC to adjust a one-year time limit on mental health claims because it ""is not realistic for most workers, given the delay or gradual onset of some mental disorders.""

The amendments to the Workers Compensation Act were developed after three expert reviews, which included consultations with employer, labour and Indigenous organizations.

The government says it also considered systems that are in place elsewhere in Canada and took into account the possible effects of the changes on employer premium rates.

More than 100,000 new claims are made in B.C. every year due to workplace injuries or fatalities, the government says.

There were 140 workplace fatalities last year, with 84 of them caused by occupational disease, 40 by traumatic injury and 16 the result of a motor vehicle incident.

The province says WorkSafeBC conducted 141 investigations in 2019.

Exactly one week ago, on July 7, the province recorded 12 new cases. What followed was an uptick in recorded cases:

• 18 new cases on July 8;

• 20 new cases on July 9;

• 25 new cases on July 10;

• 21 new cases on July 11;

• 20 new cases on July 12; and

• 21 new cases on July 13.

""I know it was distressing to me to see 20, especially 25 [new cases] one day,"" Henry said. ""That's way above my comfort zone.""

She added, however, that the slight rise in cases was not unexpected, given that the province has been allowing restaurants and other indoor businesses to reopen.

""We do know where those cases are,"" she said. ""We're testing the people who need to be tested.""

It would be more concerning, she said, if the cases were spread out across the province in an unlinked way. The most recent cluster of cases is linked to the Krazy Cherry Fruit Company in Oliver, she announced yesterday (July 13).

Given B.C.'s population, 20 cases in one day is also better than some other jurisdictions, she said.

The province has identified 3,128 infections since the virus first appeared in the province in late January.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,015 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1649 in Fraser Health;

• 135 in Island Health;

• 212 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

• 52 people who reside outside Canada.

Of the 209 people currently fighting COVID-19 in B.C., 14 people are in hospital with five of those in intensive care units. That leaves 2,730 people who have recovered from the virus.

No new deaths from the virus were identified in the past 24 hours, leaving the death toll at 189 people.

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

So far 399 residents and 252 staff at seniors' care facilities have been infected by COVID-19 in B.C.

Health Minister Adrian Dix said that it is his understanding that the federal government and the U.S. government have agreed to extend the closure of the two countries' border for one additional month, until August 21.

""This is obviously positive and necessary news,"" he said. ""Everybody who lives in B.C. knows how inconvenient and how difficult that is for many businesses and many individuals for a variety of circumstances.""

In a fiscal update Tuesday, B.C. Finance Minister Carole James said the COVID-19 pandemic will result in ""the worst downturn experienced in our province in recent history.""

article continues below

""The projected numbers are staggering, but they're not without hope,"" James said, in summing up B.C.'s fiscal position.

She said B.C. had entered the pandemic perhaps better situated than other provinces, as it had a balanced budget, a triple AAA credit rating and one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country.

B.C. also managed to contain the pandemic and flatten its growth curve better than some other provinces, and it has been able to move earlier on a phased economic restart plan.

""Because of that strength, we were able to take immediate action to help people, to help businesses, to help communities with our $5 billion COVID action plan,"" James said.

She said the province is expecting a loss of $4.2 billion in tax revenue, including $1 billion less in personal income tax revenue, $973 million less in corporate taxes, $1.3 billion in provincial sales tax revenue, $300 million in natural resource revenues and $882 million less in Crown Corporation income.

The province is also spending $5 billion in emergency spending, and has approved $1.3 billion in tax credits and deferrals. In total, the increased spending, lost tax revenue and foregone revenue will bring the deficit to $12.5 billion.

In February, James brought down, but never passed, a balanced budget and modest surplus of $227 million and provincial GDP growth projections of 2% in 2020.

""Mere weeks after the budget 2020 was tabled, our entire world changed,"" James said.

James said the B.C. economy is now expected to contract 6.8% in 2020, according to some forecasters.

Since February, B.C. lost 235,000 jobs, and saw retail sales declined by 23.6% in April compared to February. Overall, home prices dropped 4%.

Home sales declined 45.4% in May, compared to February, and B.C. merchandise exports are down 14.7% year-to-date, compared to January to May 2019.

""While the job losses in March and April were record-breaking, figures for May and June in fact have seen some recovery of the losses that we experienced in the previous two months,"" James said.

Asked if her government planned to resort to spending cuts to address the deficit, James said ""now is not the time to be able to cut back on services and support for people and business in British Columbia.""

As for any long-range plans for dealing with debt and deficits, James said: ""I do not believe that it's going to be a quick fix.""

Asked if the $5 billion that her government has already approved could be added to later this year, James said ""I believe the $5 billion is enough now.""

However, she added no one can predict what might happen should there be a second wave of COVID-19.

As for the $22 billion in capital spending allocated in the 2020 budget over three years for big capital works projects, like new schools, hospitals, bridges and roads, that will continue to be spent.

""This is going to serve us very well because it translates into huge investments,"" James said.

According to the survey released on Tuesday, 19.3 per cent of businesses could operate at their current level of sales and spending for less than six months but would have to take additional action if it lasts for a longer duration. Nearly 35 per cent of hotels and restaurants only have the runway for six more months of lockdown measures, says the survey conducted May 29 to July 3.

The results come as many businesses are looking at government programs or credit to remain afloat.

Almost 64 per cent of survey respondents said they were approved for outside credit or government funding programs such as Canada Emergency Business Account loans or wage subsidies. Less than 24 per cent of businesses said in the survey that their rent or mortgage payments were deferred during the pandemic.

While working from home has increased during the pandemic, only about a quarter of survey respondents indicated they would likely offer teleworking as an option going forward after COVID-19 spread is contained.

The version released on Tuesday was a follow-up to a crowd-sourced questionnaire on the Statistics Canada website, a collaboration launched in April, with the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, that surveyed 12,600 businesses. The sample was not designed to reflect the overall Canadian economy.

The Canada-U.S. border has been closed to ""discretionary"" travel like vacations and shopping trips since the pandemic took hold of the continent in mid-March, a rolling 30-day agreement that's currently set to expire July 21.

article continues below

Officials on both sides of the border who are familiar with the ongoing talks, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss matters not yet public, say another extension until late August is all but inevitable, thanks to a towering wave of new COVID-19 cases that's swamping efforts to restore a modicum of normality in the U.S.

New York Rep. Brian Higgins, one of several members of Congress from northern states keen to see a plan for reopening the border, expressed dismay Tuesday at news he called disappointing but hardly surprising.

""With no leadership from President Trump to address the pandemic, cases in the United States are spiking and as a result U.S. citizens are not welcome in several countries around the globe, including many of our allies,"" Higgins, a Democrat, said in a statement.

Recent calls from Higgins and others for a plan to start easing border restrictions have been greeted with social-media scorn and derision in Canada, where recent polls make clear the idea of allowing entry to Americans any time soon is a non-starter.

The novel coronavirus has been particularly resurgent in southern states like Florida, Texas, Georgia and Louisiana, where businesses tried to reopen early, contrary to the advice of public health officials, and the wearing of face masks became a partisan issue.

""The U.S. and Canada should be developing a plan that lays out what continued, nuanced management of the border during a prolonged pandemic will look like,"" Higgins said.

""But the administration's failure to develop a national plan for widespread testing, (personal protective equipment) distribution and the rejection of social distancing and mask-wearing to slow the spread doesn't inspire confidence that such a plan is in the works.""

Wearing a mask, perhaps the simplest way to reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus, has evolved into one of the most complex and flummoxing points of division in the U.S., thanks in part to conflicting signals early in the crisis about its effectiveness and the obvious reluctance of the commander-in-chief to embrace the idea.

It was only just this past weekend — nearly four months into the crisis — that Trump himself was photographed wearing one in public, during a visit with wounded service members at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.

Dr. Robert Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, urged Americans to mask up Monday, saying facial coverings for everyone in the country would break the pandemic's back in less than two months.

""It's our major defence to prevent ourselves from getting this infection,"" Redfield told a news conference in Charlotte, N.C. ""If all of us would put on a face covering now for the next four weeks, six weeks, I think we could drive this epidemic into the ground.""

Paradoxically, new online polling from Leger and the Association for Canadian Studies suggests the idea of mandatory masking in public is more popular in the U.S. than it is in Canada.

Leger's latest online poll, conducted July 10 to 12, found 72 per cent of 1,001 American respondents supported the idea of mandatory masks indoors, compared with 67 per cent of the survey's 1,523 Canadian participants. Of those surveyed in the U.S., 41 per cent said they would consider it a violation of their personal freedoms, compared with 27 per cent of those in Canada.

""Americans are far more likely to agree that rights are at issue,"" said ACS president Jack Jedwab. ""Yet, despite the fact that Americans strongly agree that the mask requirement is a rights infringement, they nonetheless believe that mask wearing should be mandatory.""

Trump appears to be capitulating on other border issues as well: on Tuesday, facing a lawsuit from Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the administration abandoned a controversial measure that would have forced international students whose courses move entirely online to either transfer schools or leave the country.

That news likely comes as a relief to untold thousands of Canadian students studying south of the border, many of whom have been forced into virtual classrooms with colleges and universities having cancelled in-person classes.

Dr. Howard Njoo, Canada's deputy chief public health officer, was reluctant Tuesday to discuss the worsening COVID-19 situation in the U.S. in any detail.

But he said cross-border travel in a public health emergency is usually a matter of ensuring that both countries have a similar grip on the circumstances, taking into account factors like their respective health-care systems, testing and contact-tracing regimes and strategies for preventing transmission.

Given that a number of U.S. states are experiencing community transmission of COVID-19 and don't have the situation under control, it will likely be weeks or even months before the benefits of additional preventative steps become apparent.

""It will take some time,"" Njoo said. ""If I were to travel anywhere, I would stick to Canada for the time being.""

Bruce Clark, president and CEO of the biopharmaceutical company Medicago, cautions observers against holding unrealistic assumptions that his product — or any of the numerous vaccine hopefuls in development globally — can bring the pandemic to a screeching halt if proven viable.

article continues below

Clark notes more than 120 companies are trying to come up with a COVID-19 vaccine, many of which have never been in the vaccine space before.

He doesn't doubt that ""something's going to come out of this,"" but he questions how effective it may be.

""Whatever vaccine we get in this first round — unless it's a miracle — it's not going to be perfect,"" says Clark, whose company began trials for its proposed vaccine Monday in Quebec City.

""It's going to have to undergo development, it's going to take probably years to come up with an understanding of the right vaccine, the right approach. It's not the panacea.

""To assume that we can have, in 18 months, the solution to a pandemic that comes around once in a generation, is naive.""

Canada's deputy public health officer Dr. Howard Njoo expressed similar cautions Tuesday, while acknowledging the need to develop viable vaccines and therapies.

""Lots of different steps are still ahead of us before we might even anticipate that there might be a safe, effective vaccine that would be available for use in the general population,"" said Njoo.

So much is still unknown about COVID-19, notes Clark, including how it may manifest during the flu season later this year.

He suspects a more likely scenario is that a vaccine will offer only part of the solution, along with new therapeutics and ongoing public health interventions.

Medicago's first phase of clinical trials will test the safety of a plant-based product on 180 healthy men and women, aged 18 to 55.

The randomized, partially blinded study uses technology that does not involve animal products or live viruses like traditional methods.

Clark notes that vaccine developers typically use chicken eggs to propagate a virus, but Medicago uses recombinant technology involving the genetic sequence of a virus, with living plants as the host.

The resulting virus-like particles mimic the shape and dimensions of a virus, which allows the body to recognize them and spark an immune response.

Clark says the plant-based approach is significantly faster and offers more consistent results than egg-based or cell-based methods.

It's the same method Medicago has used for a proposed seasonal flu vaccine that Clark says is currently being reviewed by Health Canada. If approved, Clark says it would be the first plant-based vaccine in the world.

While it takes five to six months to propagate a virus in eggs, the plant-based technique requires just five to six weeks, he says.

""In a pandemic, something like COVID, if you're able to cut that much time off development, you have a substantial impact on public health.""

Meanwhile, Clark says viruses are prone to mutations as they adapt and grow in an egg, which could result in a vaccine that doesn't exactly match the circulating virus. In contrast, ""a plant is a plant,"" and that makes production easily scalable.

""One plant behaves like 100,000 plants,"" he says.

The trial will evaluate three different dosages alone, or with one of two adjuvants provided by GlaxoSmithKline and Dynavax. An adjuvant can boost the effectiveness of a vaccine for a better immunological response, thereby reducing the required dose, Clark adds.

He hopes to know the safety of the product, as well as effectiveness of the adjuvants and dosing by October. Based on that, researchers would kick off a second, more targeted trial phase involving about 1,000 participants.

If that's successful, Clark says a third phase would involve about 15,000 to 20,000 subjects, include older cohorts, and may be a global study, depending on circumstances of the pandemic by then.

If the vaccine proves effective, Clark points to another uncertainty.

Because the company's commercial plant is across the border in Durham, N.C., he says there's no guarantee of a Canadian supply.

""'Guarantee' is a strong word,"" says Clark. ""Strange things happen to borders in the context of a pandemic.""

Such border complications were made clear to Canadians in April when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau complained about problems with incomplete or non-existent deliveries of critical COVID-19 supplies. At the time, U.S. President Donald Trump ordered U.S. producers to prioritize the domestic market.

Clark suggests similar hurdles could impact vaccine distribution, putting immediate pressure on Medicago to complete construction of a large-scale manufacturing facility in its home base of Quebec City.

""Certainly, we need a facility in Canada,"" Clark says.

""There's no guarantee on the easy flow of materials back and forth across the border should we have a successful vaccine. We have to keep the focus on completing the Canadian facility so that we have domestic capacity. I think this is what most countries are concerned about.""

By the end of 2023, the Quebec City plant is expected to be able to produce up to one billion doses of a COVID-19 vaccine annually.

Until then, Medicago says it expects to be able to make approximately 100 million doses by the end of 2021, assuming its trials are successful.

Clark says countries must temper any nationalist agendas that might emerge with a viable vaccine and acknowledge that the fight against COVID-19 is global.

Meeting that demand would require multiple manufacturers, multiple distribution routes, and lots of co-operation, he says, possibly through the World Health Organization.

""There has to be some ability to share those around and distribute, whether that's through an entity like the WHO, or something equivalent.""

The Liberals last week revealed this year's projected deficit sits at $343 billion, driven by an estimated $231.9 billion in COVID-19 spending, so far, and a massive drop in government revenue.

article continues below

With the deficit at levels not seen since the Second World War, Leger and the Association for Canadian Studies asked 1,523 Canadians whether they felt the government ought to immediately and quickly begin to scale back pandemic support programs to Canadians and to business.

Forty-one per cent said yes to that question, 44 per cent said no and 15 per cent said they didn't know or preferred not to answer.

The survey was conducted between July 10 and 12, just after the Liberals released their projections.

It cannot be assigned a margin of error because online polls are not considered truly random.

This week, the Liberal government announced that one of the biggest benefit programs — a federal wage subsidy — will be extended until the end of this year.

It covers 75 per cent of wages, up to a weekly maximum of $847, for eligible companies and non-profits that have lost at least 30 per cent of their revenues.

""Over the last three months you have seen me come out to talk with Canadians about what we're doing to help you and your family, your employer, your local businesses deal with this pandemic,"" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Monday in announcing the extension.

""We're going to continue to do that vital work.""

As of July 6, the wage subsidy had paid out $18.01 billion to 252,370 companies. Last week's fiscal and economic update from the Liberals increased the overall budget to $82.3 billion.

The other marquee support program, the Canadian Emergency Response Benefit, is set to expire in the fall.

The $500-a-week benefit had, as of July 5, paid out almost $54.8 billion to 8.25 million people.

Of those surveyed, 78 per cent said they were worried about the size of the deficit and how it may affect things in Canada in the long term.

In releasing the deficit projections, the Liberals didn't set out a plan for how or when they might get the books back to balance.

The survey asked respondents which of two routes traditionally use to cut deficits they would support.

In the survey, 60 per cent said the government ought to focus on cutting government spending, while 21 per cent said the focus should be on raising taxes.

“We were preparing for economic moderation, we were well-equipped to be able to weather the challenges,” James said at a news conference Tuesday.

“What came next was unprecedented. Mere weeks after Budget 2020 was tabled, our entire world changed.”

The government has provided $6.26 billion in financial aid to businesses and individuals. Among the losses it anticipates this fiscal year because of the pandemic are close to $1 billion in personal income tax, $973 million in corporate income tax and $1.3 billion in provincial sales tax, James said.

The projected GDP decline in 2020 would be the worst on record going back to the 1980s, although it is also projected to increase by 3.1 per cent in 2021.

James said for context, B.C.’s real GDP has only declined twice in the past 40 years, falling by 2.4 per cent in 2009 and 6.4 per cent in 1982.

“As those numbers remind us, this could be the worst downturn experienced in our province recent history,” she said.

B.C.’s restart plan is showing signs of hope for the economy as consumer confidence increases, she said. The unemployment rate is slowly rebounding and fewer wildfires and floods have helped the bottom line.

However, she warned that the province’s financial forecast could change depending on many risk factors, including the possibility of a second wave of infections, the possibility of a vaccine, as well as the success of relief measures and central bank policy.

Regardless of how B.C. copes with the pandemic, James said its economy is also subject to the economic health of other jurisdictions, particularly those that buy from the province.

James said it wouldn’t help the economic recovery to pull back on spending, but the government will review every cent spent as it heads into the next budget year.

The B.C. government has tabled legislation giving itself room for three years of deficits, which James said will be re-examined each year.

James said she believes people care about provincial deficits because they understand it’s taxpayer money, but they also understand the emergency the pandemic created.

She declined to predict how long the recovery would take, given the many moving pieces at play.

“There is no question that COVID-19 has had a profound impact on the economy of British Columbia and that’s not short term,” she said.

The job losses have been widespread but some have been disproportionately affected, depending on a worker’s age, gender or which sector they work in, James said.

Young workers are among the hardest hit, with the unemployment rate rising sharply from 9.1 per cent in February to 29.1 per cent in June for those aged 15 to 24.

Women, who dominate the service industries and many of whom have also left jobs to care for family members, are another group more affected. Their unemployment rate rose from 4.8 per cent in February to 13.4 per cent in June.

The hardest hit industries include wholesale and retail, accommodation and food services, construction, culture and recreation.

The overall unemployment rate of 13 per cent remains at its highest level since 1987. While the job losses in March and April were record breaking, the figures for May and June have seen modest recovery as the economy started to reopen.

“The projected numbers are staggering but they’re not without hope. Things are getting better each and every day when we follow the provincial health officer’s advice,” James said.

The NDP government’s fiscal update was met with calls for an economic recovery plan by its political opponents, with the Opposition B.C. Liberals asking what happens when federal benefits like the Canada Emergency Response Benefit run out.

Liberal Leader Andrew Wilkinson also suggested the government should reconsider its pre-pandemic spending priorities.

“People in every corner of B.C. have had to adjust to a new normal and adapt their household budgets, so why is this government pretending it’s business as usual?” he asked in a statement.

The Green party said the province should transition to a green economy by helping traditional industries become more sustainable, spending on training and building local businesses into the supply chain.

“We can seize the once in a generation opportunity to strategically drive stimulus spending towards a future British Columbians want: an innovative, low-carbon, sustainable, just and inclusive economy for all,” interim leader Adam Olsen said.

The agency previously reported that year-over-year inflation declined by 0.2 per cent in April, then took a further drop of 0.4 per cent in May as lockdowns put a damper on consumer spending.

article continues below

But a look under the headline figures showed consumers were spending more on items that don't weigh as much in the consumer price index, which tracks inflation. And they were spending less on things that weigh more in the calculation.

In a numbers experiment to better reflect pandemic spending, Statistics Canada found the annualized inflation figures for April and May would have been 0.0 and -0.1 per cent.

The research paper made public Monday says a specific consumption pattern, such as that happening during the pandemic, would need ""to be sustained in order to have a subsequent impact"" on year-over-year headline numbers.

The research was aided by data from the Bank of Canada, which targets an annual inflation rate of two per cent as measured by Statistics Canada's consumer price index.

The bank has warned that the economic shock wrought by COVID-19 and structurally low interest rates is having a deep effect on the inflation rate, which is far below the target.

The basket of goods used to form the consumer price index has been shaken by a shift in consumer spending habits during the pandemic.

People are buying less gasoline, which usually receives a heavier weight in calculating inflation, as its price has plunged and the frequency of car travel has dropped. Canadians are travelling much less, while grocery-buying is up.

Statistics Canada is to report June's inflation rate next week.

The Bank of Canada said in April that it expected inflation to be close to zero in the second quarter.

Beyond the end of June, the bank was less clear, citing the high level of uncertainty around the course of the pandemic.

The federal government's economic ""snapshot"" last week pegged inflation at 0.5 per cent for this year, then rising back to two per cent in 2021.

The reading was based on the average of forecasts from 13 private sector economists.

On Wednesday, the central bank will release its updated outlook. Governor Tiff Macklem has described what's coming as a ""central planning scenario"" for the economy and inflation, as well as related risks — such as local, but not national, lockdowns.

Indigenous communities closed during pandemic but at economic cost,['Nick Wells'],,"Indigenous bands along the west coast of British Columbia say their borders will remain closed to tourists and non-residents, despite the economic impact, as they work to raise awareness about the threat COVID-19 poses to their communities.

The Nuu-chah-nulth, the Heiltsuk Nation and the Haida Nation have all closed or restricted access to their territories and reserves.

article continues below

""Of course it's negatively impacting. But our directors have said, our chiefs have said, people before economics,"" said Judith Sayers, the president of the Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council, in an interview. ""I think everyone is slowly realizing the impact economically, but right now we just really feel that we want to protect the members first.""

Members of the Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council, made up of 14 First Nations along the west coast of Vancouver Island, have deployed a variety of tactics to help ensure their borders are kept sealed from non-residents.

Members of the Ahousaht First Nation, who live in the remote area of Flores Island, have deputized citizens to act as peacekeeping officers, Sayers said.

The Ahousaht issued a notice on July 2 that their territory, which covers a large area of land and water north of Tofino, including provincial parks, will remain closed to tourists and non-residents as there ""is still no vaccine, no anti-serum and no cure for COVID-19.""

Others, like the Tla-o-qui-aht in Tofino, had been stopping cars in an effort to convince them to turn around.

While Tofino is now welcoming back visitors, the Tla-o-qui-aht communities of Ty-Histanis, Esowista and Opitsaht remain closed to those who haven't been invited. The closure includes part of Long Beach in Pacific Rim National Park.

The concern, Sayers says, lies in the ability to test and contain any potential COVID-19 outbreak.

""A lot of our communities are remote and testing is not easily available,"" she said. ""If you're in Port Alberni, or Nanaimo, or Victoria, or somewhere (else), you can get testing and get results in 24 hours. It's not the same with our communities.""

The closures have resulted in disputes between Indigenous groups and local businesses.

The Haida Nation in Haida Gwaii have turned away non-residents at the ferry terminal, discouraged leisure travel and called on two local fishing lodges to rethink their reopening plans.

""We're such a close-knit community, I think that once we get a case of COVID, I think that it'll spread like wildfire,"" said Duffy Edgars, the chief councillor of the Old Massett Village council in Haida Gwaii.

Edgars said many local fishing lodges are respecting the Haida Nation's state of emergency, but is frustrated by others who want to open up.

""It's disrespectful,"" he said. ""These bigger (lodges) are coming in and just doing whatever they want.""

The fishing lodges that have opened say visitors and staff will not have contact with the Haida Gwaii communities, and they have emergence evacuation plans in place if a COVID-19 case were to develop.

Leaders and representatives from the Nuu-chah-nulth, Heiltsuk and Haida all say they would like to see more co-operation from the provincial government in working with Indigenous communities.

""It's really frustrating,"" said Marilyn Slett, the chief councillor of the Heiltsuk. ""We have a limited amount of time here, we think, before that anticipated second or third wave so right now is the time for us to be sitting down and having those discussions so going forward we're all working collaboratively together.""

Part of the issue, she says, lies in B.C. politicians encouraging residents to take part in inter-provincial tourism.

""We're seeing a lot more vessel traffic on the coast, we're seeing a lot more recreational boaters, and that's a really high concern for our community,"" said Slett.

The closures — many of which began in March — have been felt at a variety of levels.

The pandemic forced the cancellation of the Heiltsuk's Spawn-on-Kelp fishery this year, an event Slett says employs 700 people and is a hugely important economic driver for the community.

""Certainly our community put forward the health and safety before the economic driver,"" she said. ""So our community has been hit hard.""

Sayers says when the pandemic first broke out and restrictions were placed on communities, First Nations were bringing in food for members so they didn't have to leave their reserves and face possible exposure at grocery stores.

The Heiltsuk, Nuu-chah-Nulth and the Tsilhqot'in issued a statement in late June, criticizing the provincial government's reopening plan and what they saw as a lack of dialogue with First Nations groups.

All three want the province to commit to four conditions, which would allow border restrictions being lifted: COVID-19 information sharing, screening, rapid testing and culturally safe contact tracing teams.

Until those are met, Slett says, she can't see Indigenous communities fully opening their borders.

But the provincial government says it is committed to working with Indigenous communities.

""Many tourist-depending communities are now safely welcoming the gradual return of out-of-town visitors,"" said Sarah Plank, a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation. ""At the same time, we acknowledge some smaller and more remote communities and First Nations continue to be concerned about visitors to their communities.""

The government is also working on scheduling a meeting with the Nuu-chah-nulth, Tsilquot'in, Heiltsuk and Haida Nations and other communities, she added.

Why it matters: The program brings cost relief to businesses hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, and is intended to support employment.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau apologized on Monday for not recusing himself from discussions about the administration of Ottawa's $900 million student volunteer program.

WE Charity was initially selected to deliver the initiative under a nearly $20 million contract. Trudeau said he was aware of his family's ties to the organization, but unaware of the honorariums his mother and brother received for their involvement.

""It is not a surprise to me that they got paid by WE, but I did not know that they got paid by WE,"" Trudeau said.

""In this situation, I should have recused myself,"" he added, acknowledging that his involvement in Ottawa's student volunteer program has created controversy. Members of the Conservative Party of Canada have called on Trudeau to address his involvement before Ottawa's ethics committee.

""I get that. I made a mistake in not recusing myself immediately from the discussion.""

Trudeau said he will evaluate any requests to address the issue before parliament. He also said that, because of his involvement, the rollout of the student volunteer program has been a bit delayed – an outcome he deeply regrets.

In addition to addressing the issue, Trudeau said on Monday that the federal government will extend its wage subsidy program until the end of the year. More information on the extension is expected this week.

The prime minister also said he spoke with U.S. president Donald Trump earlier in the day about the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement – which took effect July 1, – Black Lives Matter, China, the two Canadians who remain detained in China and U.S. aluminum tariffs.

""I highlighted to the president that the pandemic has disrupted usual manufacturing processes and supply chains,"" said Trudeau. ""It would be a shame to see tariffs come in between our two countries at a time when we're celebrating the new NAFTA.""

Trudeau briefly told reporters to expect a joint announcement regarding the closure of the Canada-U.S. border.

Non-essential travel across the border is banned until late July.

But the government is being warned it may have to move the end date into 2021.

article continues below

The program is the heart of the Liberals' promise to help Canadians get back to work, even if has to be at a slower pace, as the pandemic wanes.

Speaking outside his Ottawa residence, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced the extension to give ""greater certainty and support to businesses as we restart the economy.""

Trudeau didn't say how the government will reshape the eligibility rules for the program that critics have said stop some employers from getting aid they need.

He promised more details in the coming days.

While some companies are back open with restrictions easing, other parts of the economy are still reeling from the effects of COVID-19.

Some sectors will only start up in the fall or even the winter and will need help into next year, said Ross Laver, senior vice-president for strategy at the Business Council of Canada. He pointed to airlines as one example where rehiring may be slow.

""I don't think anybody expects that those industries that have been really hard-hit, that everything is going to be fine by Dec. 31,"" he said.

""We need to bear in mind that some of them are going to need help for an extended period of time.""

The wage subsidy previously was to expire the first week of June but the Liberals announced an extension to the end of August in mid-May.

The government has yet to share eligibility requirements for July.

Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said the extension would be welcomed by many small companies that have seen costs return faster than revenues.

He also pressed the need for eligibility rules to understand how to qualify.

""Not a single employer in Canada understands whether they qualify for the July wage subsidy and we're in mid-July. So they need to do an awful lot better,"" Kelly said.

""It sounds great to have an announcement to extend the subsidy, but businesses in order to use it really need to understand whether they would qualify and what the rules of the game are.""

The program covers 75 per cent of wages, up to a weekly maximum of $847, for eligible companies and non-profits. Companies must show a 30-per-cent drop in revenues, a cliff that may discourage companies from growing, lest they find themselves suddenly cut off from federal aid.

""You don't want people to think that you get over the threshold and then automatically lose"" the subsidy, said Hassan Yussuff, president of the Canadian Labour Congress.

Yussuff also said the extension would bring some stability to reopening phases, and likely bolster job gains seen over May and June.

Last week, Finance Minister Bill Morneau hinted at changes to revenue-reduction thresholds when he spoke about reducing ""disincentives to growth"" in the program.

Kelly said the government could consider a graduated approach with smaller subsidies at lower levels of revenue loss, or dropping the requirement altogether, either of which would give employers the confidence to rehire faster, Kelly said.

The Liberals originally saw the wage subsidy as the key tool in helping cushion the economic blow from COVID-19 by helping workers stay tied to their employers so businesses could get back to normal quickly once lockdowns lifted.

The pace of spending on the program has been below expectations, with $18 billion paid to 252,370 companies as of July 6.

Instead, the budget for the program dropped as more workers accessed the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) for people who lost their jobs or nearly all their hours.

The $500-a-week benefit had, as of July 5, paid out almost $54.8 billion to 8.25 million people.

The budget for that program is now at $80 billion, but it's scheduled to end in the fall. Yussuff said the government needs to soon release details on how workers without jobs will transition to the employment insurance system, which was largely supplanted by the CERB.

The government's fiscal and economic ""snapshot"" last week boosted the cost of the wage subsidy program to $82.3 billion from $45 billion, in a sign of impending changes.

Perrin Beatty, president of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, said changes to the wage subsidy ""must encourage Canadians to transition"" off the CERB, and ""create a positive incentive to return to work.""

The July 8 fiscal update noted that small employers make up the largest share of approved wage subsidy applications, with the largest numbers of employees covered in manufacturing, accommodation and food services.

The ""snapshot"" also said men may be ""slightly more likely"" to be covered than women although there aren't firm numbers to rely on.

Adrian Dix said during a news conference Monday that warnings of possible exposures at a restaurant, spin studio, bed and breakfast and resort are believed to stem from ""private parties"" at the hotels.

article continues below

Eight positive tests for the disease are linked to visits to downtown Kelowna and the city's waterfront between June 25 and July 9, said an email from Interior Health, the regional health authority.

""When people come together for private parties — in this case it was primarily people in their 20s and 30s — the risks are considerably higher,"" Dix said.

The exposures follow the move to a new phase of reopening in B.C. that allows for tourism within the province. Although the accommodation industry was not ordered to close during the pandemic, many operators did so voluntarily but began welcoming guests again as part of the new phase.

Infections in B.C. inched up on Monday as health officials announced 62 new cases since Friday.

Two more people also died for a total of 189 deaths in B.C.

The new figures bring the total number of confirmed cases in the province to 3,115, while 2,718 people have fully recovered from COVID-19.

Interior Health also issued an isolation order for Krazy Cherry Fruit Co. in Oliver after two positive tests associated with the farm. Public health officials are monitoring the situation and placed restrictions on those living and working on the farm, the government said in a news release.

The cases linked to Kelowna involved people who live in three regions of the province, including the Interior, Fraser and Vancouver Coastal Health regions, said Dix. He credited contact tracers with making the connections.

He said the tourism industry has done a good job of creating safe environments for guests, but it's also up to guests to ensure they respect physical distancing guidelines and group size limitations.

""Whether it's a trip or a party at home, the same risks and the same rules apply,"" Dix said.

If you're gathering with friends and family, you should consider the increased risk that indoor locations pose and determine how many people can maintain a safe distance accordingly, he said.

""We have got to live with COVID-19 for the next year so that means the responsibility is on all of us to understand the risks and understand our responsibilities to one another.""

Interior Health issued an exposure advisory for the resort and bed and breakfast on Friday and added the restaurant and spin studio in a statement on Sunday.

Visitors to the Boyce Gyro Beach Lodge on July 1 or the Discovery Bay Resort from July 1 to July 5 were advised to self-isolate and monitor themselves closely for symptoms.

The health authority is now urging visitors to Kelowna's Cactus Club restaurant on Water Street between July 3 and July 6, or the Pace Spin Studio on July 2, 4, 5, 7, 8 and 9 to self-monitor and get tested if COVID-19 symptoms appear.

The B.C. Centre for Disease Control also warns that a case or cases were confirmed on an Air Canada flight from Kelowna to Vancouver on July 6, but Dix could not say if that warning was linked.

Public health contact tracing is underway and the health authority said it's reaching out directly to anyone who has been exposed, where possible.

Testing is recommended for anyone with novel coronavirus symptoms, including fever, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, or a loss of taste or smell, said Interior Health.

""Milder symptoms may include runny nose, fatigue, body aches ... diarrhea, headache, sore throat, vomiting and red eyes,"" it said in a statement.

Anyone with even mild symptoms is urged to stay home and avoid travel.

Efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19 include physical distancing, regular hand washing, not touching the face and avoiding gatherings of more than 50 people, the health authority said.

Powell River-Sunshine Coast MLA Nicholas Simons has been adapting to new ways of carrying out democracy, mandated by regulations required to cope with the pandemic.

article continues below

Simons said he is going to be attending the legislature next week for the first time in what is being called a hybrid session. He said this means some people are in Victoria and others are functioning in their communities via videoconferencing.

“It’s very busy and there are a lot of issues that are related directly to the pandemic that I assist with when I can,” said Simons. “There continue to be issues for me relative to other sectors, including, of course, ferries, forestry and other ongoing interests.”

Simons said up until now, every day the legislature sits, he has been going onto Zoom and participating in the debate. He said if he is rostered to be doing his chamber duty in the legislature, such as next week, he simply attends in Victoria, where the number of MLAs has been substantially reduced due to physical distancing and maximum assembly numbers.

He said one significant change in legislative business has been the voting schedule. Rather than votes taking place during the day, they all get lined up and voted on at the end of the day, negating the need for everyone to be at their computer constantly from 10 am to 6:30 pm. The system, for the most part, has been working well, although there is the occasional glitch, said Simons.

There was one situation where the MLA who was voting remotely could not be heard, and so the clerk at the table phoned the member and got confirmation regarding the member’s vote.

Simons said those running and coordinating the hybrid system have done an “amazing job.” There are four screens in the legislative chamber and those in that setting can see members participating from their constituencies.

Simons said this is the first time a hybrid form of parliament has been conducted, so once again, BC is leading the way.

He said Question Period has taken on a new dimension because the chamber is not packed with close-together bodies “stuffed like sardines.” He said the opposition still has the opportunity to ask questions and the government has the chance to explain its actions on issues.

“It’s important for democracy,” said Simons.

When asked if British Columbians were being well served by the new system, Simons said: “I hope so. We’re making every effort to adjust the needs of our communities. There are challenges that everybody is facing.

“What we have to continue to do is figure out how government can best help our communities, our businesses, our industries and get to the challenges that are lying before us.”

Simons said with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the incredible focus by health minister Adrian Dix, and his dedication to the issue, has served the province well. He added that Dr. Bonnie Henry, as provincial health officer, has all of the necessary abilities to give confidence to the public.

“In this kind of situation, when you have dedicated people, incredible changes have been made to our health system,” said Simons. “We were prepared for the worst and we managed to relay good medical advice and the vast majority of people adhered to the recommendations and continue to do so.

“The message is as important today as it has always been. I’m completely confident that our government and our health officer have done their absolute best and the statistics indicate that we have been an outlier in our success.”

The new normal in the legislature has no horizon. Simons said the impact of COVID-19 will be present for a while.

“We are doing what we need to do,” he added, “and everybody recognizes that British Columbia can continue to stay strong.”",[]

The province said in a document released in late April that Stage 3 would include ""opening all workplaces responsibly"" and ""further relaxing the restrictions on public gatherings.""

The document didn't get into specifics, though it did say restrictions would remain on large gatherings such as concerts and sporting events.

Meanwhile, health officials in Quebec, the epicentre of the pandemic in Canada, are concerned about a spike in COVID-19 cases in Montreal linked to the reopening of the city's bars.

Over the weekend Montreal's public health authority urged patrons and employees who have frequented bars since Canada Day to get tested for the coronavirus.

Quebec reported 114 new COVID-19 infections Sunday, boosting its total to 56,521 cases.

The province is to introduce mandatory masks on public transit starting today, with a two-week grace period before users will be denied service as of July 27.

Montreal has also indicated that it intends to bring in mandatory masks for enclosed public spaces as of that date.

On the East Coast, Prince Edward Island is reporting another new case of COVID-19 — a woman in her 80s from Queens County tested positive and is self-isolating at home.

P.E.I. has reported four new cases of the infection since July 4 after being COVID-free during the months of May and June.

Canada's COVID-19 case total currently stands at 107,589, including 8,783 deaths and 71,467 cases considered resolved.

""I can't say no to a good time,"" said Edmonton Oilers fan Jeet Jermana. ""I'd be hard-pressed not to jump into a big party.""

article continues below

On Friday, the NHL board of governors and NHL Players' Association said they had ratified the return-to-play plan, paving the way for the league to resume its pandemic-hit season later this summer.

Toronto and Edmonton were also officially unveiled as hub cities where all games will be played, beginning Aug. 1. Training camps start Monday in the 24 cities with teams still in the running for the Stanley Cup, including six in Canada.

In 2017, when the Oilers nearly advanced to the Western Conference final, Jermana was among the thousands of fans who partied in Ford Hall at Rogers Place arena and in bars along the popular Whyte Avenue district.

But with COVID-19 this year, where teams will play in empty arenas, Jermana said he'll likely watch more games at home, maybe with just a few friends.

That is, he said, until the Oilers advance and he and other fans won't be able to resist going out.

""Once it becomes the 'real playoffs' I think more and more the momentum will grab,"" he said.

Matt Black of Hotel X Toronto, located west of the city centre where multiple media outlets have reported that several teams will be based, said the prospect of any accommodation for celebratory fan gatherings, even outdoors, seems unlikely.

Nevertheless, Black said he expects citywide excitement will be palpable, even with empty arenas.

""You look back to those scenes of Jurassic Park and Maple Leaf Square and all of that ... it would be great for people to be able to get together again but you just need to make sure that you're doing it in a safe manner,"" said Black.

The players themselves aren't to have any contact with the general public.

Dr. Vinita Dubey, Toronto's associate medical health officer, said in an emailed statement that players and staff arriving from abroad will also have to serve a modified 14-day quarantine as well as undergo rigorous screening and daily testing protocols, wear masks in indoor settings, physically distance and wash hands often.

An Edmonton police spokesperson said the service wouldn't be able to comment over the weekend on what sorts of preparations they might make for crowds when the season resumes.

Geoff Grimble with the City of Edmonton said the city's civic events management team would likely discuss the issue during a scheduled meeting on Monday.

""The City of Edmonton's first priority is public safety and we'll continue to follow the advice and requirements of the Chief Medical Officer of Health to ensure fans, players, coaches and staff remain healthy,"" Grimble said.

Oilers fan Brendan McLeod admitted he may be lured to a street celebration when — not if — his team advances, but said he still wants to maintain physical distancing.

""We have to get through this together or else it's not going to change,"" said McLeod.

But Shadi Merhej, who said he enjoys both hockey and the Oilers, noted the sport doesn't have quite as strong attraction for him in the summer.

""It's daylight 'til 11 o'clock. You don't want to spend half your day watching hockey,"" Merhej explained.

""I'd rather go for a bike ride, or rollerblade or golf.""

Shaw told reporters on a Zoom conference call that he was ""a little tone deaf"" with the tweets last Friday that were ""out of frustration"" and that he took responsibility for them and didn't want them to become a distraction.

""I apologize for that, at no point was I saying I was going to break the rules or we're going to break the rules,"" Shaw said. ""We know as a team that's not an option and to get through this season, everybody is going to have to buy in and everybody is going to have to adhere to whatever protocols we're set under.""

He noted if other teams don't follow public-health guidelines, the season may be derailed in any case.

Shaw had raised concerns about the length of time players may need to stay in their current environment. He replied to a tweet from TSN reporter Scott Mitchell, who reported that multiple sources told him players could face a $750,000 fine and potential jail time if seen outside the ballpark — which also are the same maximum punishments in the Quarantine Act.

""We were told two weeks... not all summer... all summer is a bit much,"" Shaw tweeted.

In an email reply, the club said arriving in Toronto, players understood the maximum penalties for leaving the Rogers Centre footprint during camp.

""The rules have kind of changed a little bit from when we first got up here, it was the first I was hearing about that we could be possibly be in here all summer,"" Shaw said, adding he should've chosen his words differently.

He explained he'd rented a place one block from the Rogers Centre and had looked forward to taking walks by the water to get away from the game. Living in a hotel was not an ideal situation, he said.

Shaw said Blue Jays management — president Mark Shapiro and general manager Ross Atkins — spoke to players on Saturday about the situation.

""I was a little bit tone-deaf to the situation, I should have said what I said, should have worded it a little bit differently,"" Shaw said. ""I apologize for that, take full responsibility.""

The Blue Jays are training in Toronto while figuring out where to play this coming season as the shortened 60-game schedule starts in less than two weeks.

Ottawa has given the ball club the green light to hold training camp in Toronto, but hasn't made a call on games. No fans will be in the stands.

The Buffalo News reported over the weekend the club had checked in with that city about playing in that city, usually the home of the their triple-A club. Blue Jays officials have said Dunedin, Fla., the club's spring-training facility, is the most likely venue for home games if the team can't play in Toronto.

For his part, Shaw said he and his teammates are hopeful Toronto is the club's home this season.

He noted that weather and the COVID situation in Florida means that Dunedin would put the Blue Jays at a competitive disadvantage.

The Blue Jays are slated to open the season July 24 at Tampa Bay. The home opener is July 29 against the Washington Nationals.

Shaw said he doesn't foresee opting out of the 2020 season, given he was looking to this year as a bounce-back season on a one-year contract after an admittedly poor 2019.

Meanwhile, Blue Jays manager Charlie Montoyo said right-hander Chase Anderson is day-to-day with an oblique strain.

Anderson was projected to be a member of the Blue Jays' five-man starting rotation.

PETERSBURG, Fla. — Florida shattered the national record Sunday for the largest single-day increase in positive coronavirus cases in any state since the beginning of the pandemic, adding more than 15,000 cases as its daily average death toll continued to also rise.

According to state Department of Health statistics, 15,299 people tested positive, for a total of 269,811 cases, and 45 deaths were recorded.

article continues below

California had the previous record of daily positive cases — 11,694, set on Wednesday. New York had 11,571 on April 15.

The numbers come at the end of a grim, record-breaking week as Florida reported 514 fatalities — an average of 73 per day. Three weeks ago, the state was averaging 30 deaths per day. Since the pandemic began in March, 4,346 people have died in Florida of COVID-19, the state says.

Testing has doubled over the last month, going from about 25,000 tests per day to almost 50,000, but the percentage of people testing positive has risen even more dramatically. A month ago, fewer than 5% of tests came up positive on a daily average. Over the past week, the daily average exceeded 19%.

About 10.7% of Saturday’s 143,000 tests came up positive, with an average age of 38. ""I still think we need to increase our testing a little bit more,"" said University of Florida epidemiologist Dr. Cindy Prins, adding that the state and local health departments should ramp up their contact tracing.

Prins said that she's still concerned about large crowds, gyms and some restaurants as being places of mass transmission. Reports of illegal clubs and raves in South Florida is also a worry, she said.

""I really do think we could control this, and it’s the human element that is so critical. It should be an effort of our country. We should be pulling together when we’re in a crisis, and we’re definitely not doing it,"" she said. ""I know people want to live their lives. There have been a lot of other times, people have made those sacrifices in order to benefit our society. It’s almost like a war effort. That’s what we need right now.""

Terry Shaw, AdventHealth’s president and CEO, said Sunday on CBS’ Face the Nation that the peak of COVID-19 hospitalizations in Florida will be ""sometime in front of us in July.""

While on the program, he said that the health system, which has hospitals in nine states including 30 in Florida, has adequate PPE, a stockpile of ventilators and a clinical team that’s learned how to better treat the disease.

""I give you an example. Our length of stay in our ICU for COVID patients has dropped in half. The number of people coming in to our hospital with COVID that need a ventilator, we’ve also been able to cut that in half. And because of those things, our death rate has also been cut in half"" since the beginning of the pandemic,"" he said

The health system’s ICU capacities in Florida are currently running at about 85% to 90%. He said the system could turn some ""progressive care units"" into ICU units if needed.

Hospitals in several counties have stopped doing elective surgeries. HCA West Florida have ceased inpatient elective procedures at hospitals in Hillsborough, Pinellas and six other nearby counties, said an HCA spokeswoman on Sunday. Florida ceased elective surgeries statewide from March until early May in order to free up beds, and to reserve personal protective equipment for health care workers caring for COVID-19 patients.

Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach are the top three counties for hospitalizations, with 3,232 people hospitalized — 42 per cent of the 7,542 people in hospitals statewide for coronavirus.

Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez told CNN on Sunday that his county's hospitals will soon reach capacity, but he said more beds can be added, including for intensive care.

""We still have capacity, but it does cause me a lot of concern,"" he said.

Throughout May and into June, the state reopened much of its economy with some restrictions — and the number of positive cases began rising, but it wasn't until the last week that the daily death total began rising, too.

Because of the increase in cases and the positivity rate, doctors have predicted a rise in deaths, saying the mortality rate usually increases two to four weeks later as some of those infected get sicker and eventually die. Health experts are concerned that people are gathering in crowds, and have expressed concern that the Republican National Convention's nomination party for President Donald Trump will be held in Jacksonville in August.

On Saturday, the Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom reopened at Walt Disney World in Orlando, concerning health experts who urge people not to gather in groups. Guests at the park said that people were wearing masks and social distancing, and videos showed near-empty parks.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said that even with the rising rates, he still wants the schools to reopen as scheduled next month, saying children have not proven to be vectors for the disease in states and countries where campuses are open. He said while each county will have to come up with procedures, depending on their local infection rate, not opening the schools would exacerbate the achievement gap between high- and low-performing students.

""We know there are huge, huge costs for not providing the availability of in-person schooling,"" he said. ""The risk of corona, fortunately, for students is incredibly low.""

Helen Ferre, a spokeswoman for DeSantis, said Sunday that the state has tested more than 2.4 million people for COVID-19.

Ferre said the important statistic isn’t the raw number of positives, but the percentage — on Sunday, it was just over 11%, about 8 percentage points lower than the weekly average.

""The more people who get tested and are proportionately reporting negative for this virus is meaningful,"" she wrote in an email to The Associated Press.

Meanwhile, a commissioner for a county near Jacksonville is seriously ill with the virus, according to a posting by his daughter on Facebook.

St. Johns County Commissioner Paul Waldron had recently voted against a county ordinance requiring masks, but not because he opposed them. He said he wanted more answers from county administrators about which masks are most effective and whether the county had enough for employees and visitors at government buildings.

So what about 142 days?

""Every game might end 0-0,"" the Calgary Flames general manager quipped.

With summer training camps set to open Monday as the NHL lurches forward in its plan to restart a season stopped in its tracks four months ago by COVID-19, the temptation might be to spring a surprise or two — maybe a new power-play setup or a tweak to the penalty kill — when the games return Aug. 1.

Coaches for the 24 teams set to feature in the league's return have had ample time to plan, brainstorm and re-assess their systems and rosters. The 16 taking part in the best-of-five qualifying round have known for nearly seven weeks which opponent they'd be lining up against if the league got back up and running.

But don't expect to see massive changes — especially early — from the men standing behind the benches in those empty arenas in Toronto and Edmonton once the puck is dropped.

They have enough to worry about when it comes to their own players.

""Every coach is going to look at and break down the opponent and have a game plan to attack,"" continued Treliving, whose club will take on the Winnipeg Jets in the qualifying round. ""But because of the uniqueness of this time, there's more of a focus to get your team ready. I remember last year preparing for the playoffs and we're sitting there going, 'What are we going to do with the four days between our last regular-season game (and the playoffs)?'

""We thought we had two months to prepare last year and we were dealing with four days. You're dealing with four months here. So the focus for the 24 teams is how do we get up to speed? How do we get to our 'A' game when we haven't played for so long?""

Like most teams, Montreal Canadiens head coach Claude Julien and his staff met remotely via video conference on a regular basis after the NHL suspended the schedule because of the pandemic in mid-March.

And after it was announced they'd be facing the Pittsburgh Penguins in the qualifying round, those preparations ramped up significantly.

""I'm a believer that as a coach you can never get too much information — as much as you can get is great,"" Julien said. ""The important part is what you share with your players. That's where you have to be careful.""

Penguins head coach Mike Sullivan said his focus will be shaking off the rust and getting his group prepared for a situation that will see teams go from zero to 100 in short order.

""There are significant challenges from a mindset standpoint and making sure that we get out of the summer hockey mode or the social distancing skates into real competitive hockey,"" he said. ""Because that's what we're going to be faced with in a short period of time.""

But Toronto Maple Leafs winger Zach Hyman, whose club is set to face the Columbus Blue Jackets in the qualifying round for a spot in the usual 16-team playoffs, still believes there could be some subtle changes around the league.

""This is the unknown,"" he said. ""When you go in from the regular season into playoffs, you don't really tweak too much, you just kind of roll into the playoffs, rolling off your momentum from the regular season. This is a completely different beast, where what you watched a couple months ago may not be the team that you're playing against in the summer. It's almost like a brand new year with the same rosters.

""It'll be interesting to see how everything turns out around the league with the long layoff.""

Canucks defenceman Christopher Tanev said he expects Vancouver's coaches to have plenty to share about the Minnesota Wild.

""I'm sure they'll have a lot of information,"" he said with a smile. ""They'll know every little detail about the team and every player.""

The Wild, however, shouldn't expect more than the basics on the other side.

""It's unique that we've known who we're playing here for a while,"" Minnesota interim head coach Dean Evason said. ""The challenge, at least for our group, is we don't want to overload them.""

The Boston Bruins are in a slightly different position as one of the top-4 teams in the Eastern Conference. They'll take part in round-robin games against Washington, Tampa Bay and Philadelphia to determine the No. 1 seed on that side of the playoff bracket, but the Bruins won't know their first-round opponent until after the qualifiers.

""We're not going to introduce a whole lot of new concepts,"" Boston head coach Bruce Cassidy said. ""Even though you've had a lot of time to dream up a lot of different things, I don't know if it's the best time — a short turnaround with a lot of the line — to start messing too much with your game.

""We're going to try to keep it as simple as we can.""

For all the time coaches have had, that might end up being their best play.

Ferries loosens restrictions",['Roxanne Egan-Elliott'],,"B.C. Ferries is loosening some restrictions and increasing capacity as summer travel within the province grows.

Passenger numbers have risen to about 70 per cent of what they were at this time last year, said Tessa Humphries, communications manager for B.C. Ferries. In the early days of the pandemic, they were about 20 per cent of normal.

article continues below

Passenger capacity had been capped at 50 per cent, but that restriction is being phased out to increase service, Humphries said.

That level was set by Transport Canada, which gave operators a choice between limiting capacity and implementing enhanced cleaning and physical- distancing measures.

Humphries said B.C. Ferries implemented both measures at first but has now decided to phase out the capacity limit. B.C. Ferries consulted with Transport Canada on the change, she said.

Enhanced physical-distancing and cleaning protocols, including clear plastic barriers and face- coverings, remain in place. Passengers are asked whether they’re experiencing COVID-19 symptoms prior to travel, and those in vehicles are allowed to remain inside their cars.

More than 300 sailings per month have been added on major routes between the Island and the Lower Mainland since the start of June. The company is aiming to keep capacity about 20 per cent above demand, Humphries said.

“We will have fewer sailings than in summer schedules of the past, but significantly more than what was available as a result of the service cuts in April,” she said.

The company has also added an additional vessel on the route between Departure Bay and Horseshoe Bay on Fridays and Sundays, and a second vessel on the route that services the southern Gulf Islands on Thursdays through Mondays.

“We did also hear from the communities that there was a struggle for capacity there,” Humphries said, adding that it wasn’t uncommon for sailings on Gulf Islands route to be completely booked.

Passengers travelling by car are encouraged to book in advance or choose less busy times to travel.

Humphries said B.C. Ferries expects it will take a couple of years before passenger numbers return to pre-pandemic levels.

Onboard food services have resumed on some minor routes, including between Swartz Bay and the Gulf Islands, and the Passages gift shop reopened Friday on sailings between Swartz Bay and Tsawwassen. Packaged food and limited hot food resumed on three major routes between the Island and the Lower Mainland in June.

The Lands End Café in the Swartz Bay terminal also recently reopened. Markets in the Departure Bay and Tsawwassen terminals reopened in late June.

The drop in ferry traffic has cost B.C. Ferries millions of dollars in lost revenue.

Humphries said the company is evaluating the financial situation daily and reopening onboard amenities will provide another revenue stream.

“But we’re all doing all of that carefully and gradually, as well as safely reintroducing these services,” she said.

But even the best efforts have left doctors stymied about the source of more than one-third of this country's known COVID-19 infections. Not knowing where cases come from makes outbreaks that much harder to stamp out.

article continues below

Now medical researchers and supercomputers are turning genetics labs into virus detective agencies, looking first to find the novel coronavirus itself within blood samples from thousands of infected patients, and then comparing all of those isolated viruses to each other looking for places they differ.

Every close match will draw a line from patient to patient, ultimately painting a picture of how the virus spread.

""This is the big effort over the next four weeks,"" said Andrew McArthur, director of the biomedical discovery and commercialization program at McMaster University.

""What's going to come out of there pretty soon is a glimpse of what just happened, how did it move around the province, how did it move between provinces or how big was Pearson (airport) in the early days of the airport being open.""

Knowing how the virus spread will show where there were weaknesses in public health measures early on, said McArthur. Being able to keep divining genetic codes from samples will mean when there are flare-ups of cases, they can be quickly compared to each other to see if they're all related or are coming from multiple sources.

It means, for example, a long-term care centre should be able to quickly know if its 10 new cases are because one case spread widely or arose from multiple carriers coming into the facility.

""That's a very different infection-control problem,"" said McArthur.

It also means that maybe, just maybe, the second COVID-19 wave most think is coming won't be as bad, or as hard to control, as the first, because the sources can be isolated very quickly.

""A second wave is likely,"" McArthur said. ""But we've never spent this kind of money and effort before, either, so maybe we'll beat it.""

The kinds of genetic technology being used for this project did not exist when SARS hit Canada in 2003.

This genetic mapping is constantly on the look-out for mutations. Thus far, SARS-CoV-2, the official name for the virus that causes COVID-19, has not mutated as quickly as many others do. Influenza, for instance, changes so much over a year the vaccine has to be retooled every summer to keep up.

But there are enough subtle changes still happening among the 28,000 individual markers that make up a genome for SARS-CoV-2 that cases can be traced backward and linked to the ones that came before. McArthur said it takes a lot of data storage, a lot of high-capacity computer analysis, and a lot of money, to run the comparisons among them all.

The federal government put $40 million on the table in April for genetic research on COVID-19. Half is to keep tabs on the virus as it spreads, look for any changes it undergoes, and map its pathway across the country. The other half is to look at the genetic structures of the patients who get infected, trying to answer the puzzling question of why some people die and others have symptoms so mild they never even know they are sick.

Genome Canada is administering the project, with six regional genomics agencies overseeing the work locally and labs like McArthur's doing the testing and analysis. The funding is intended to create genetic maps from 150,000 patients. Canada thus far has had about 108,000 positive cases, and the expectation is that almost every one of them will be gene-mapped.

The results will be loaded into a global site comparing all known infections of COVID-19, but also be analyzed for national and regional reports.

In New York, genetic sequencing was used to figure out that COVID-19 in Manhattan wasn't coming from China and Iran as imagined, but from Europe. In Canada, it is suspected that much of the virus came into this country from travellers returning from the United States in early March. But the work is only now beginning to confirm that belief.

McArthur estimates the first data will be available for Ontario in about four weeks, but warns it will take many more months to complete all of the tests. His lab sequenced 600 samples on Wednesday alone.

Overall, McArthur expects the genetics project to last for two years.

Trump flew by helicopter to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in suburban Washington to meet wounded servicemembers and health care providers caring for COVID-19 patients. As he left the White House, he told reporters: ""When you're in a hospital, especially ... I think it’s a great thing to wear a mask.""

article continues below

Trump was wearing a mask in Walter Reed's hallway as he began his visit. He was not wearing one when he stepped off the helicopter at the facility.

The president was a latecomer to wearing a mask during the pandemic, which has raged across the U.S. since March and infected more than 3.2 million and killed at least 134,000. Most prominent Republicans, including Vice-President Mike Pence, endorsed wearing masks as the coronavirus gained ground this summer. Republican governors have been moving toward requiring or encouraging the use of masks as the pandemic has grown more serious in some states in the South and West.

Trump, however, has declined to wear a mask at news conferences, coronavirus task force updates, rallies and other public events. People close to him have told The Associated Press that the president feared a mask would make him look weak and was concerned that it shifted focus to the public health crisis rather than the economic recovery. They spoke on condition of anonymity to describe private matters.

While not wearing one himself, Trump has sent mixed signals about masks, acknowledging that they would be appropriate if worn in an indoor setting where people were close together. But he has accused reporters of wearing them to be politically correct and has retweeted messages making fun of Democratic rival Joe Biden for wearing a mask and implying that Biden looks weak.

Questions remain whether Trump will wear a mask with any regularity.

The wearing of masks became another political dividing line, with Republicans more resistant to wearing them than Democrats. Few masks were seen at recent Trump campaign events in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Phoenix and South Dakota’s Mount Rushmore.

The only time Trump has been known to wear a mask was during a private part of a tour of a Ford plant in Michigan.

A spokesman for the Biden campaign cast the president's action as too little, too late.

""Donald Trump spent months ignoring the advice of medical experts and politicizing wearing a mask, one of the most important things we can do to prevent the spread of the virus,"" spokesman Andrew Bates said in a statement. ""Rather than taking responsibility and leading, he wasted four months that Americans have been making sacrifices by stoking divisions and actively discouraging people from taking a very basic step to protect each other.""

While hundreds of people could be employed in positions relating to the games and hubs — such as security jobs, rink staff, food services and hotel housekeeping — the financial benefit of two bubble communities under tight seal would be ""modest"" at best, suggested Bank of Montreal chief economist Douglas Porter.

""When you think of how many tourists would normally be in Toronto during peak tourist season, I'm quite sure this is less than one per cent,"" he said.

""The reality is, it's not going to move the needle.""

But Porter, a lifelong hockey fan, said he anticipates a ""reasonably meaningful positive"" morale boost to Canadian sports fans who've been eagerly anticipating players returning to the ice in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The games are slated to start Aug. 1 with six Canadian teams qualifying for the 24-team resumption of play. No fans will be in the seats.

Edmonton and Toronto were confirmed as the NHL's hub cities on Friday night.

""The fact that part of our world is getting back to some kind of normal will help reinforce the sense that things, generally, are moving in that direction and could help support the recovery,"" Porter said.

The gradual comeback of major sporting events has drawn plenty of interest in recent weeks, with debates raging over the risks of putting players back into the games, even if spectators aren't allowed in the facilities.

Further questions have been raised over whether rigorous testing is enough to prevent outbreaks within the isolated community, which could potentially throw the whole plan into a costly disarray.

Many of these factors make placing a value on hockey's return especially difficult.

Michael Naraine, a professor at Brock University in St. Catharines, Ont., said the largest amount of money is on the line at large corporations, which he said is driving the return of major sporting events.

""The primary revenue driver for sports is broadcasting,"" said the assistant professor of digital sport management and marketing.

""They need television advertisers come back. The league itself needs to gain its revenue from NBC and Sportsnet here in Canada.""

Politicians have preferred to emphasize the positive aspects of a deal with the NHL.

Alberta Premier Jason Kenney eagerly promoted Edmonton as the ultimate hub city for the hockey league, posting videos on Twitter that prominently featured the Rocky Mountains and other popular destinations in the province.

Naraine said those public expressions by leaders are more an attempt to ""pander"" to their constituents than actually drive any meaningful economic impact. He said this is especially the case in Edmonton.

""Having major events come to town allows them to beat their chests and say, 'We exist. We're on the map. Come look at us,'"" he said.

""But the fact that the hub city will be in Edmonton is no different than whether the hub city would be in Toronto or Vancouver or elsewhere. It's not going to significantly drive tourism all of a sudden.""

Patrick Rishe, a sports professor at Washington University in St. Louis, said he sees value in showcasing a lesser known Canadian city on broadcast television with ""beauty shots"" of the locale. He said it may also sit well with NHL executives.

""You never know,"" he said. ""Doing and serving a good deed for the league now, this could pay dividends down the road.""

Any semblance of a regular hockey season would be welcomed by Dana Parris, owner of the Lockeroom sports bar in Barrie, Ont.

Even though her business is over 100 kilometres away from downtown Toronto, she anticipates the excitement would reverberate to her customers.

""If we could have sports come back and we hit Stage 3 (of Ontario's COVID reopening plan) around the same time, I will probably stop crying myself to sleep,"" she said.

""If those two come together it's just going to be the most beautiful thing.""

Collins made the comments in a July 8 update on summer travel and the impact of COVID-19 on the ferry service.

article continues below

Local governments on the Sunshine Coast and the Southern Sunshine Coast Ferry Advisory Committee have been pressing Ferries to add more trips to the Langdale-Horseshoe Bay route to meet the anticipated demand from residents, businesses and tourists now that travel within the province is no longer being discouraged.

Although BC Ferries is now running eight round-trips a day on Route 3, with two additional sailings on Fridays and Sundays starting July 10, there have still been frequent overloads and delays.

In a recent letter to BC Ferries, Sechelt councillors pointed out that the Sunshine Coast economy is “heavily reliant on tourism” and reduced capacity on the Langdale route could “limit our community’s recovery.”

“Our vision for Route 3 this summer is simple – provide the same level of service as last summer,” the letter said. “This would include the additional sailings we had last summer and maintaining increased time between sailings to ensure ferries run on time.”

Councillors in Gibsons are also sending BC Ferries a letter, asking the ferry company to “recognize the needs of small businesses on the Coast requiring deliveries of materials, including perishable goods, for their operations.”

In his update, Collins said traffic is beginning to grow again after dropping around 80 per cent in March and April and is expected to continue to increase throughout the summer.

“This summer, we are going to need your help, your patience and your understanding,” Collins said. “While we’re adding sailings as fast as we can, there still will be some sailing limitations this summer as we weren’t able to hire and train summer seasonal staff in March and April due to COVID-19. We are planning for summer service to exceed demand, but we won’t have the same number of sailings as last summer.”

Collins also acknowledged the inconvenience caused by schedule changes, some of which have happened on short notice. Sunshine Coast residents in particular have complained about trouble with rebooking reservations and long waits on hold with customer service.

“Over the past month or so, we’ve revised our schedules more often than normal, as we bring more sailings back into service,” he said. “I know this has impacted some of our customers, but every time we add more sailings, we need to revise the schedules one more time.”

Collins said BC Ferries is putting the bulk of its efforts into brining back service and is working with the province “to examine the impact COVID-19 is having on the ferry system.”

“We need to protect the core of the ferry system and continue to provide safe, reliable service to British Columbians.”",[]

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreaks at Tabor and at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred to those homes from the hospital. The outbreak at the Tabor long-term care home was declared over on July 7.

B.C.'s provincial health officer Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix said in a July 10 joint statement that the province recorded 25 new cases in the past 24 hours, for a total of 3,053 cases since the virus that has caused a global pandemic first appeared in B.C. in late January.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 990 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 51 people who reside outside Canada.

There was one new COVID-19-related death recorded in the past day, for a total of 187.

Of the 187 people actively fighting off the disease, 16 are in hospital, with five of those in intensive care. The rest are self-isolating at home.

The recovery rate has dipped below 87%, as 2,679 people have recovered.

""As we continue through summer, simple steps will help us to keep COVID-19 low and slow in British Columbia,"" Henry and Dix said in their statement.

""When spending more time with friends and family, whether that is close to home or on vacation elsewhere in the province, we remind all British Columbians to avoid closed spaces, crowds and close contact with others.

North Island-Powell River MP Rachel Blaney has been working through her parliamentary commitments to ensure the reshaped government is being responsive to Canadians.

Blaney, in an interview on July 8, said she had just sat through a hybrid sitting of the House of Commons, which was “one for the record books.”

article continues below

“We’ll see what happens next but it was interesting,” said Blaney. “There were some parliamentarians in parliament and the rest of them were across the country. When we are sitting in front of our screen, we are seeing our colleagues from all over in their offices and their homes. We are participating in our democracy in a completely different way.”

Blaney said as the parliamentarian who represents the NDP on the procedural and house affairs committee, what is being done by the committee is looking at what the House of Commons can look like in the fall, and how to address the issue of being able to do the full spectrum of work that is usually done, understanding that everybody cannot be in the house simultaneously. She said a report will come out and will be made public.

Blaney said there have been a lot of discussions at the committee level about security, such as with online platforms, and what kinds of methods should be looked at in terms of voting.

“We all know that is very important,” said Blaney, about voting. “If there is any voting happening now, it’s just the members in the house, percentage wise, representing each party. It’s definitely been an experience doing the work that you’ve done for your career but doing it in a very different way.”

Running the federal government in a hybrid system has many complexities. There are 338 parliamentarians, so accommodating the sheer number of people in the House of Commons and online is an issue. Blaney said one intricacy is that as parliament does its work, everything has to be simultaneously interpreted in French and English.

She said one of the things being looked at in the report is around the reality that in the last parliament, there was also some indigenous language spoken with an interpreter present, so there is a process that has to happen to allow that in the revised House of Commons.

“Now that we are in a different format of parliament, we are trying to find a way to follow the rules we’ve set for ourselves for that kind of flexibility,” said Blaney.

She said the committee has looked at other parliaments across the planet, seeing how other governments are coping with administration of democracy during the pandemic.

“I’m not sure what the final recommendations will be but I do believe there has to be a way to allow people who can only participate virtually to have a voice,” said Blaney. “It’s really important to honour those voices and make sure they have the capacity to represent their regions.”

In more remote areas of the country, where internet service is not as robust as it is in other areas, there may also be some issues with connectivity, said Blaney. She said the committee has worked closely with the House of Commons to make sure those issues are taken into consideration.

“If we’re in a position of taking a vote, how do we make sure those folks don’t miss out because of some sort of technical challenge that has happened?” said Blaney. “The committee has been looking long and hard into those issues, wanting to make sure we really honour parliament and the history of parliament, but recognizing that sometimes we have to adapt to these new circumstances.”

She said she is ultimately looking forward to going back to Ottawa and participating in parliament and seeing all of her colleagues there, because she thinks that part of the work is very important. Blaney acknowledges that a return to the old method of governance is an unknown. COVID-19 is the reality and everyone has seen how things have fundamentally changed, she added.

The work of the all-party COVID-19 committee in parliament is done, said Blaney, so parliamentarians will continue to meet through the hybrid system.

She said the hybrid parliament will be meeting at least four times this summer and it is something the NDP fought for during negotiations.

“We wanted to make sure, during changing times, the government was held to account twice a month over the summer months because things are changing quickly and we need the ability to ask questions and to hold the government to account during these very challenging times,” said Blaney.

She said the parliamentary structure is fundamental to Canada, and if it is going to be changed or altered, she said she hopes the government is thoughtful in how it is going to change it, and that parliament is not taken for granted.

“We need to focus on how we are going to do the work,” said Blaney, “in the middle of a pandemic.”",[]

Metro Inc. was aware of Loblaw Companies Ltd.'s decision to stop its so-called pandemic pay program before it made a similar decision, chief executive Eric La Fleche told the House of Commons standing committee on industry, science and technology Friday.

article continues below

La Fleche said that a Metro competitor's move was one of several influencing factors in its decision-making process.

He joined the Loblaw president and Empire Co. Ltd. chief executive at a two-hour session about why they stopped paying a temporary wage bump to employees as of June 13.

""Let me be absolutely clear, we did not co-ordinate our decisions,"" said Michael Medline, Empire CEO, in his opening statement before the committee. Medline, whose company owns the Sobeys and Safeway brands, was the first of the trio to give his opening remarks.

""The decision was our own.""

Loblaw president Sarah Davis echoed the sentiment, but noted she sent a ""courtesy email"" to both competitors, as well as Walmart and Save-On-Foods, on June 11. The latter two did not appear at the hearing.

The email notified competitors of Loblaw's decision to end its pandemic pay program on June 13. The company had already informed its roughly 200,000 employees, she said, and recognized ""the news would be public immediately.""

La Fleche said in later questioning that he was aware of the email when Metro made its decision to end its bonus pay program on the same day.

""We made our own decision based on the information we had, which included that last piece of information, yes,"" he said.

He called it ""one factor among others"" contributing to its decision. Other factors included the broader economic reopening, other retailers starting to open their doors, lower business volumes and a gradual return to more normal conditions.

Empire had not received Davis's email when the company made its decision to terminate the extra wages, said Medline, but had heard through the grapevine that Loblaw was considering doing so.

Davis received a reply to her June 11 email, and said she would provide copies of the original and all answers to the committee.

She also sent a courtesy email to competitors when Loblaw decided to begin its extra pay program. Davis said she doesn't recall sending courtesy emails to competitors on other topics, including executive compensation.

In addition to receiving the email, La Fleche said he made several phone calls to competitors in May and June to ask whether they planned to extend their bonus pay programs or end them on previously announced dates.

""In perfect compliance with The Competition Act, I asked my counterparts their intentions regarding whether or not they would maintain the temporary bonus,"" he said, in a translation from French, during his opening remarks.

In each case, competitors, including Medline from Empire and Davis from Loblaw, told him they had not yet decided.

""Whatever the case, those calls were made in a decisional process that was much larger and ... did not inform our decisions.""

When asked why he made the phone calls, La Fleche answered he ""wanted as much information as I could have in order to make a best decision for our company, our employees at the right time.""

He said he would ""absolutely not"" characterize those conversations as trying to obtain a tacit agreement on wages.

Those who sent emails and made phone calls said they consulted with company counsel before doing so and lawyers were present during at least one phone discussion.

The appearance was a chance for the executives to admit they were wrong to end the pay increases, said Jerry Dias, president of Unifor, a private sector union.

""What we got instead was highly paid grocery executives insisting they did not collude, and then going on to say — remarkably — virtually the same thing over and over again,"" he said in a statement.

""The executives all admitted to exchanging 'courtesy emails' and 'courtesy calls' on pandemic pay, and yet insist there was no collusion. I look forward to the committee's ruling on that.""

Unifor has been critical of retailers ending temporary wage increases while the pandemic continues and has called for the pay bump to be permanent.

The matriarchs, known as Gaandlee Guu Jaalang or ""daughters of the river,"" say in a statement the Queen Charlotte Lodge and West Coast Fishing Club reopened as a local state of emergency remains in effect because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

article continues below

""Haida Gwaii is a remote community with limited health-care services and only two ventilators,"" the statement says. ""One case would devastate our communities.""

The statement says the matriarchs are upholding Haida law through the occupation of the villages, Jung and Sk'aawats.

Both the fishing lodge and club say they are fully complying with orders and guidelines issued by the B.C. government, health authorities and WorkSafeBC.

Brian Clive, vice-president of sales and corporate development for the lodge, said it has had several meetings with Haida leadership and developed plans so that workers do not go into town or anywhere near a Haida community. It also has medical staff on site and if a COVID-19 case were to develop, there's a plan in place to evacuate the affected person by air to Vancouver.

""We have gone to incredible lengths to avoid any contact with the communities and therefore have created what we call a zero-risk chance of contamination in the communities,"" he said.

The lodge expects about 80 guests at a time, down from the typical 125, he said. None will be travelling from the United States because the border is closed, he said.

President Brian Legge said the West Coast Fishing Club is remotely located about 83 kilometres from the nearest community and only accessible by boat or air. It also has an emergency evacuation plan in place.

""First and foremost we would never put the health and well-being of Haida Gwaii communities and residents at risk and equally as important our staff and clients,"" he says in a statement.

""That's why we have worked hard and gone to significant expense to eliminate all contact with the residents of Haida Gwaii and their communities through direct helicopter transportation from the mainland to our remote island and back.""

Without the plan, the club's employees would have been out of work and the business faced possibly unsustainable losses, Legge said.

The club is continuing to speak with the council of the Haida Nation, he added.

Duffy Edgars, chief councillor of Old Massett Village, said he supports the matriarchs and expected 20 to 30 people to occupy the villages. He said he didn't expect any interactions with lodge staff.

""We're just occupying our land and doing some fishing,"" he said.

Haida member Deana Young, who was on her way to support the matriarchs, said the community is following physical distancing protocols, while children have not returned to school and are not seeing their elders.

""One person coming from outside our region is one person too many,"" said Young.

The occupation of the land is an exercise of Haida rights to the land, she said.

""What we are doing is occupying our lands, asserting our rights to harvest the foods that we live on and to ensure food security for our communities,"" she said.

Cargill's beef plant near High River, south of Calgary, employs about 2,200 people. It shut down for two weeks in April because of an outbreak that affected 350 staff.

article continues below

It reopened after bringing in safety measures that included temperature testing, physical distancing, cleaning and sanitizing.

Eventually nearly half of the workers contracted the virus and two employees died.

The lawsuit, which needs to be approved by a judge, was filed by Guardian Law Group and seeks damages for the harm done to family members, friends and other people who were in close contact with Cargill employees who contracted the novel coronavirus.

The plaintiffs do not include the employees themselves, who are covered by labour and worker compensation laws.

The statement of claim alleges that despite warnings and guidelines issued by the Alberta government, Cargill Ltd. failed to take ""reasonable precautions"" at the beginning of the outbreak to limit its spread.

""This is a sophisticated facility and a company well-versed in proper safety procedures. That's why it's so shocking to see them fall so far below the standard of acceptable behaviour that we expect from employers in this situation,"" said Mathew Farrell of Guardian Law Group Friday.

""Businesses bear a responsibility to the community to take reasonable measures to limit the spread of this disease, and where they fail to do so, we will hold them to account for the harms that result.""

The allegations have not been proven in court.

Daniel Sullivan, a Cargill spokesman, said the company does not have a comment to make at this time regarding the class action. He gave a general statement in an email.

""At Cargill, we take seriously our responsibility to feed the world and that keeping people safe is core to our values.""

The High River plant is back at full operation and processes about 4,500 head of cattle a day — more than one-third of Canada's beef-packing capacity.

Cargill Ltd. is a subsidiary of U.S.-based Cargill Inc., one of the largest privately owned corporations in the United States by revenue.

The league and NHL Players' Association announced Friday the return-to-play protocols — featuring Toronto and Edmonton as hub cities — and a four-year extension to the current collective bargaining agreement have been ratified.

article continues below

The NHL board of governors and the union's full membership gave the documents, which were tied together in an all-or-nothing bundle, the thumbs up in separate votes.

""It was pretty civil,"" Vancouver Canucks captain Bo Horvat said of negotiations on the deal that was tentatively agreed to Monday. ""We're happy to get things going.""

Bringing the hubs to Canada, where coronavirus infection rates are largely under control, proved to be the logical choice after a significant spike in cases across the United States in recent weeks.

""While we have all worked very hard to try to address the risks of COVID-19, we know that health and safety are and will continue to be our priorities,"" NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said in a statement. ""We know that all of our fans are excited about our return to the ice.""

Training camps for the 24 teams primed to compete in the league's restart to a 2019-20 campaign that was suspended March 12 are scheduled to begin Monday — also the deadline for players to opt out of participating with no penalty — in each franchise's home market.

The plan will then see Eastern Conference clubs report to Toronto on July 26, while those from the Western Conference head to Edmonton before the games resume Aug. 1. The conference finals and Stanley Cup will be held in Edmonton as part of a first-of-its-kind NHL Final Four that could stretch all the way to Oct. 4 and result in next season being pushed into December or early January.

Once in Canada's largest city and Alberta's capital, players are set to be kept away from the general public in so-called ""bubbles"" that include strict health measures, daily testing, and mostly confine teams to hotels and empty arenas.

The extension of the current CBA, which was slated to expire in September 2022 and now runs through at least the 2025-26 season, provides both players and owners clarity on a number of challenging financial realities caused by COVID-19.

It also give the green light for negotiations with the International Olympic Committee and the International Ice Hockey Federation on participation at the 2022 and 2026 Winter Games. The NHL skipped the 2018 Olympics after taking part in five straight between 1998 and 2014.

The salary cap's upper limit will remain at US$81.5 million in 2020-21 and stay there until hockey-related revenue returns to $4.8 billion — this season's projected total prior to the pandemic. Players have agreed to defer 10 per cent of next year's salaries, and have owners pay that back over three consecutive seasons starting in 2022-23.

""This agreement is a meaningful step forward for the players and owners, and for our game, in a difficult and uncertain time,"" NHLPA executive director Don Fehr said. ""We are pleased to be able to bring NHL hockey back.""

Escrow payments, a consistent thorn in the side of players that guarantees a 50/50 split of HRR with owners, will be capped at 20 per cent in 2020-21, and decrease throughout the deal. If teams are still owed money following the 2025-26 campaign, the CBA will be extended another season.

The agreement marks the first time in Bettman's 27-year tenure as commissioner the NHL has bridged two CBAs without a work stoppage. Both the 1994-95 and 2012-13 seasons were cut to 48 games because of lockouts, while the 2004-05 campaign was cancelled.

Alberta Premier Jason Kenney was the most outspoken politician with regards to having his province host one of the hubs, pointing to a low infection rate and Edmonton's facilities.

He also penned a letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in hopes of securing a waiver for the NHL when it came to Canada's mandatory 14-day quarantine for anyone arriving in the country. The federal government approved the league's proposal of a cohort quarantine last month, granting an exception that paved the way for Toronto and Edmonton to get the nod as hubs.

Speaking outside Rogers Place, Kenney said Friday's news will create jobs and millions of dollars in economic activity.

""The Stanley Cup is coming back to Edmonton, to Alberta,"" Kenney said in a video posted to Twitter as he stood next to a statue of Wayne Gretzky. ""We are going to get an unbelievable amount of free advertising across North America and around the world that will set us up well for the future relaunch of our tourism industry when travel comes back post-COVID.""

The Cup was last awarded in Edmonton when Gretzky hoisted it over his head for a fourth and final time on May 26, 1988.

Each team will be permitted to bring a maximum of 52 people into the bubbles, including a maximum of 31 players.

Meanwhile, it was also announced the NHL draft lottery's second phase has been tabbed for Aug. 10. The eight losing teams from the qualifying round will have an equal shot at the first pick in the draft, which is tentatively scheduled for Oct. 9-10.

Much like Kenney, Ontario Premier Doug Ford and Toronto Mayor John Tory supported their city's hub potential.

""There is no better place for the NHL season to continue,"" Tory said. ""We will make sure we put on a great show for the game of hockey ... while following all proper health and safety protocols.""

Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease specialist at Toronto General Hospital, said choosing to hold the NHL's restart in Canada reduces the overall risk, but it's far from a fool-proof endeavour.

""We'd be blind to think that there isn't COVID-19 in Canada, there's just significantly less of it here compared to parts of the U.S.,"" he said. ""Everyone has to pay close attention to COVID-19 because even with the best laid plans, there still can be small weaknesses that might be exploited by this virus.""

Vancouver was the other Canadian city originally in the running to host, along with seven American markets, before the provincial government expressed concerns about the NHL's health and safety protocols.

Ford was asked prior to Friday's announcement why the plan worked for his province when it didn't for British Columbia.

""They have very stringent rules and regulations for their players,"" Ford said of the NHL. ""When they told me (players are) getting tested every single day, I'm no medical professional, but I don't think they need testing every day.""

The 24-team format — which includes every Canadian franchise, save for Ottawa — will see the top-4 clubs from both the East and West play mini-tournaments to determine playoff seeding, while the other 16 will battle in a never-before-seen qualifying round.

Boston, Tampa Bay, Washington and Philadelphia are set to compete for the No. 1 slot in the East, while defending champions St. Louis, Colorado, Vegas and Dallas will do the same out West.

The East's best-of-five qualifying series include Pittsburgh vs. Montreal, Carolina vs. New York Rangers, New York Islanders vs. Florida and Toronto vs. Columbus. In the West, the matchups are Edmonton vs. Chicago, Nashville vs. Arizona, Vancouver vs. Minnesota and Calgary vs. Winnipeg.

In all, there will be as many as 52 games played over the first nine days before the teams get a break on Aug. 10.

The four winners of the best-of-five series in each conference will then be pitted against the top-4 seeds to fill out the usual 16-team playoff bracket.

There could, however, still be choppy waters before the 2019-20 season can actually resume.

Players won't be quarantined during training camp, but instead asked to practise physical distancing when not at the rink in hopes isolation and testing will be enough to avoid any outbreaks.

Of the 396 NHLers tested at team facilities between June 8 and Monday during voluntary workouts, 23 results came back positive. The league said it's also aware of 12 other positive tests for players not taking part in those optional sessions.

The Stanley Cup has been awarded every year since 1893, except for 1919 because of the Spanish flu outbreak and in 2005 when the lockout scratched the entire season.

There's now a firm plan in place to — hopefully — see it handed out this fall.

The Burnaby Community Action Team (BCAT) on the Overdose Crisis penned a letter to council in late May with two calls to action for the city, including providing overdose response training and supplies to warming centre staff.

article continues below

“As illicit drug overdoses continue to rise, it is imperative that facilities supporting the homeless population in our city follow best practice measures,” reads the letter. “This means ensuring warming centre staff have access to overdose response supplies and basic training in relation to overdose recognition and response.”

The letter is cosigned by Michel Pouliot, executive director of Burnaby Family Life, and Dr. Lindsay McCaffrey with the Burnaby Division of Family Practices, along with several BCAT member organizations, including the Progressive Housing Society, Mosaic Burnaby Centre for Immigrants and the Burnaby Society to End Homelessness.

“In the event of an overdose, the wait time between a call to first responders and their arrival can cause permanent brain injury or death. Such experiences can be incredibly upsetting for witnesses and for staff,” reads the letter.

“Frontline workers who are not provided with the training and tools to respond often feel traumatized and powerless.”

The letter notes staff have taken sick leave in other jurisdictions as a result of that trauma, and some Burnaby warming centre staff are already taking naloxone to work.

In a report to council this week, staff said the city would need to “evaluate the operational implications of the request and would have to determine the advisability and feasibility of the request in order to evaluate whether or not this would be an effective additional measure to prevent overdoses in this context.”

Asked why the city would need to study the measure when naloxone training has been widely available for years, city spokesperson Chris Bryan said it is “standard for the city’s risk manager to review all procedures which may affect the health and safety of our patrons and staff, and which may result in liability exposure.”

The BCAT letter also called on the city to expand its resources for the homeless community in Burnaby during the pandemic, including keeping the warming centres, the last of which closed on July 1, open until an emergency shelter has been established in the city.

An emergency shelter is currently planned for the Burnaby Lake Sports Complex, and in the meantime, BC Housing has secured more hotel rooms to house local homeless individuals.

That Burnaby Lake emergency shelter, however, is only expected to be open until December, when construction of the Burnaby Lake complex replacement is set to begin.

“As the health of this population is already compromised, a COVID-19 outbreak would have a devastating impact,” reads the letter. “We know that the proposed locations for the ERC may serve as recreational sites when restrictions are lifted but the need to support vulnerable people and save lives must absolutely supersede residents’ access to such facilities.”

Staff also suggested the city work with community partners to develop short- and long-term actions to address homelessness.",[]

Finance Minister Carol James said Friday the latest numbers paint a picture of cautious optimism with a long road ahead on B.C.'s path to recovery during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Gains in May and June bring back about 40 per cent of the total number of jobs lost since the start of the pandemic in February, when B.C.'s jobless rate was five per cent, she told a news conference.

The greatest losses have been in the service sector, but James said that's also where jobs are being added as accommodation and food services accounted for half of last month's gains.

Despite positive signs, James said thousands of people and businesses are still struggling, and net job losses stand at 235,000.

She said youth unemployment in particular stands out at 29.1 per cent, up slightly since May, while 45,000 young people did find jobs last month.

Women in B.C. are also more likely to have lost their job due to COVID-19 than men, James said.

She said the high jobless rate in June reflects increased demand for jobs and confidence that people will have the opportunity to return to work once they start looking again.

James also mentioned the loss of international visitors in the tourism sector, particularly in Metro Vancouver and Victoria, as a factor.

Businesses are restarting cautiously, she added.

""They're making sure that their employees are safe, they're making sure their customers will be safe, and people are starting to see that confidence by going back to businesses.""

James is set to provide more information next week on the post-pandemic spending B.C. has made so far, as well as updated revenue and deficit forecasts.

B.C. health officials reported 25 new cases of COVID-19 on Friday, as well as one additional death.

That brings the death toll to 187 among 3,053 people who have tested positive for the disease so far, Health Minister Adrian Dix and provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said in a joint statement.

Of 187 active cases, 16 people were in hospital, and there were ongoing outbreaks at two long-term care or assisted living facilities and one acute care facility.

While there are no active community outbreaks, Dix and Henry said exposure is still happening.

""When spending more time with friends and family, whether that is close to home or on vacation elsewhere in the province, we remind all British Columbians to avoid closed spaces, crowds and close contact with others,"" read their statement.

For the past four months, the legendary Toronto stage that's hosted the likes of the Rolling Stones and the Police has gone dark, and its famed checkerboard floors immortalized in the Tragically Hip's ""Bobcaygeon"" left empty.

Like most smaller Canadian music venues, the future is anything but certain.

""The live-venue industry right now in Canada is on the verge of bankruptcy,"" Cohen said.

""We're not opening, probably, until the end of this year — maybe next year... We have no income coming in whatsoever. It's a bad scene.""

Along with several other indie concert venue owners, Cohen has been making noise about the troubling years ahead for Canada's live music scene in hopes the federal government will take more action.

There was a glimmer of hope on Tuesday when Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault outlined a program that lets owners of for-profit venues apply for a piece of $20 million promised to support the live music sector.

The money will be divided among numerous corners of the industry, including venues, concert promoters, booking agents, managers and music festivals. The funding is part of the second phase of support in the $500-million emergency support measures introduced in May for Canada's arts and culture organizations.

Anyone who's granted approval will receive a minimum contribution of $5,000 that's supposed to last until the end of September.

Beyond the live music business, the federal government has earmarked $5 million for the recording industry that will be administered by Factor and Musicaction, which specialize in developing and supporting Canadian music talent.

Erin Benjamin, chief executive of the Canadian Live Music Association, which advocates for the industry, called the move by Canadian Heritage to support venues ""a good start"" that needs to be built upon in short order.

""It's better than nothing,"" she said.

""It'll help some companies for a very short amount of time...but we're not done here. We can't be done.""

While Cohen doesn't know if he'll qualify for a portion of the venue funding, he's skeptical about how much it'll actually help the Horseshoe.

""I'll be able to pay two weeks of rent,"" Cohen said, pointing out it's roughly $40,000 a month for the downtown location.

""It'll be something, and we'll be grateful for it... but I'm skeptical until I actually see the payments.""

He suspects the Horseshoe may also fail to meet some of the requirements outlined on the Factor website. Among them, a venue must have booked at least 50 per cent Canadian musicians at its venue last year to qualify.

""Horseshoe Tavern was open 360 days last year, I don't think we wrote down which bands were Canadian and weren't. I don't think we even know,"" Cohen said.

""The eligibility makes no sense.""

Smaller venues have been able to tap into other financial support measures, which include the Canada Emergency Response Benefit and the emergency wage subsidy.

In Toronto, city council recently passed legislation that allows property owners to claim a tax break of 50 per cent tax on spaces that operate primarily as live music venues. The intention is for those savings to trickle down to the tenants who are still not allowed to reopen.

Live venues in other Canadian cities are at different stages in a process many anticipate could stretch well into next year.

Vancouver bars were some of the first to reopen, though several clubs in the city warned that patrons may have been exposed to COVID-19 in recent weeks.

Montreal's music venues were allowed to legally reopen in late June, but concertgoers have to remain seated and dancing is forbidden.

In Halifax, Karen Spaulding reopened the Carleton Music Bar and Grill in the final days of June, but it hardly feels the same to her.

""It is at half capacity for three days a week, instead of normally five to seven, and it's acoustic shows only,"" she said.

""Just the world, the audience and the guests, all feel different.""

The Carleton operates as a restaurant, which helped Spaulding's attempt to get the business back on its feet, though she said overall revenues have dropped somewhere between 50 to 75 per cent.

But as much as she's concerned for her business, she's also worried about local Canadian musicians who relied on these venues to make a living. That's motivated her to look for solutions as she faces a long winter that brings a whole new round of questions.

Spaulding said she's been in conversations with lenders, while also tapping into other government programs that help support her staff. She's also looking into whether it would be worthwhile to launch streaming online concerts that would ""put more money in the artists' pockets"" over the coming months.

""I'm going to personally go out on a limb to keep the venue going,"" she said.

""We're huge believers in live music.""

Rep. Adam Schiff couldn't resist: ""We may all be moving to Canada soon,"" he deadpanned.

article continues below

But as a resurgent COVID-19 ravages the U.S., fuelled by cavalier openings in states like Florida and Texas and a White House determined to resurrect the economy at all costs, the red-alert status spreading across the continent's lower half has more Canadians than ever ignoring America's increasingly persistent knock.

An online poll by Leger and the Association for Canadian Studies released this week found a whopping 86 per cent of respondents in Canada opposed to letting U.S. tourists north of the border, compared with 11 per cent who supported it. An Abacus Data poll out Friday found much the same thing.

And when Rep. Brian Higgins, a New York Democrat, updated his bipartisan call for a plan to reopen the border, the ensuing Twitter barrage of sarcasm, satire and outright anger belied Canada's reputation as a bastion of civility, replete with memes of building walls, slamming doors and Bugs Bunny taking a handsaw to the 49th parallel.

Higgins took it all in stride.

""I don't blame them for wanting us out of there,"" the congressman said Friday of the Canadian reaction.

""I have an obligation to be honest, and I have an obligation to always keep trying. And if anything, what I hope will come from all of this is an appreciation for the tale of two neighbouring countries' response to COVID-19: America's has been deplorable, and the Canadian response has been fast, strong and united.""

When the outbreak first took hold in North America in March, Canada and the U.S. agreed to close their shared border to discretionary travel while allowing the movement of goods and essential workers to continue. That initial 30-day agreement has been extended three times now, and will surely be extended again before its next July 21 expiry date.

Since March, the U.S. has seen more than 3 million cases and 133,000 deaths, and the crisis is accelerating in states across the union. Florida is breaking records daily for new COVID-19 cases and deaths. In Arizona and Texas, one in four tests is coming back positive. Further north, states like Wisconsin and Michigan are seeing fresh spikes in their active caseloads. Hospitals are again rapidly nearing capacity.

In their letter last week to acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf and Canada's Public Safety Minister Bill Blair, Higgins and 27 other members of Congress, Democrat and Republican alike, urged the two countries to stop kicking the can down the road and draft a detailed plan for the gradual reopening of the border.

""The continual 30-day extensions without a plan for how restrictions will be modified prolongs uncertainty for both communities and creates unnecessary tension as we approach each new expiration,"" they wrote.

""We are asking that the United States and Canada immediately craft a comprehensive framework for phased reopening of the border based on objective metrics and accounting for the varied circumstances across border regions.""

That doesn't mean throwing open the border to Americans, Higgins said. But it could mean redefining essential travel to include foreign property owners and people with business interests or family members on the other side, provided they wear masks and practice physical distancing.

""Never in our lifetime have we had a situation where the health of you and your family is dependent on your fellow citizens to do the right thing,"" he said.

""A phased opening could expand the category of 'essential traveller,' but (include) certifying some way that you are adhering to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's protocol as it relates to stopping the spread of COVID-19.""

Ontario Premier Doug Ford, a pro-trade conservative and longtime champion of Canada-U.S. ties, has been among those urging zero tolerance at the border until the crisis in the U.S. has passed — a position spokeswoman Ivana Yelich reiterated Friday.

""The premier has been clear: the border must remain closed to non-essential travel until the U.S. has made significant progress in containing COVID-19,"" Yelich said. ""The recent spike in the number of COVID cases in the U.S. is very concerning. As such, the premier will continue to support restrictions at the U.S. border beyond the July 21 deadline.""

The worsening public health situation in the U.S. has not diminished the importance of cross-border business travel, including face-to-face meetings or technical on-site visits, to the health of Canada's economy, said Mark Agnew, director of international policy with the Canadian Chamber of Commerce.

Despite the best efforts of both countries, the current border measures have been confusing for some, causing stress and delays even for those who have work permits that allow them to cross, Agnew said.

""It would be helpful for the government to set out the circumstances under which border measures will start to normalize, to enable companies to plan.""

Despite the political challenges the U.S. outbreak now poses for the federal Liberal government in Canada, it's past time to start thinking about how to ease the border restrictions, said Laurie Trautman, director of the Border Policy Research Institute at Western Washington University in Bellingham, Wash.

""There is an immediate need to be more thoughtful and strategic about how our countries go about doing that,"" Trautman said, floating the idea of wider family exemptions and allowing homeowners to visit their foreign properties.

In northern Washington state, law enforcement is growing concerned about the challenge of protecting vacant homes owned by Canadians, she added.

""Grandparents should be able to see their grandkids,"" Trautman said. ""Exempting these two groups from the restrictions would not ‘open up the floodgates’ and seem reasonable and empathetic to me.""

Statistics Canada's labour force survey released Friday showed 953,000 jobs were added last month, including 488,000 full-time and 465,000 part-time positions. The unemployment rate fell to 12.3 per cent after hitting a record-high of 13.7 per cent in May.

article continues below

As in May, even though more people found jobs, more people were also looking for work as the labour force grew by about 786,000 after a gain of 491,000 in May, bringing it to within 443,000 of its pre-pandemic level.

Statistics Canada said the unemployment rate would have been 16.3 per cent had it included in unemployment counts those who wanted to work, but did not look for a job.

Job gains were made in every province, including by 378,000 in Ontario, marking the first increase since the COVID-19 shutdown, Statistics Canada said. It didn't include any gains in Toronto as restrictions in that city loosened after the survey week.

Despite the good news, economist Jim Stanford said there remains a historic crisis in the job market with high unemployment and hundreds of thousands who have left the labour force altogether.

Also, gains nationally were not shared equally among groups, with women, youth and low-wage workers still slower to rebound, which Stanford said could be problematic if those jobs don't ever come back.

""I worry about a coming second round of layoffs motivated not by health restrictions, but by companies deciding their businesses are going to be permanently smaller. So that would be qualitatively different and in a way worse,"" said Stanford, director of the Centre for Future Work in Vancouver.

""We aren't remotely out of the woods yet, but this was a really encouraging step forward.""

Some three million jobs were lost over March and April due to the pandemic, and 2.5 million more had their hours and earnings slashed. By last month, some 3.1 million were affected by the pandemic, including 1.4 million who weren't at work due to COVID-19.

Brendon Bernard, an economist at Indeed Canada, said recapturing jobs at the same pace in the coming months will be tougher.

""A lot of areas of the economy still aren't running at full capacity,"" Bernard said. ""So while doors may be open and customers might be coming in, business hasn't come back to normal.""

Despite the overall improvement, the oil and gas industry continues to struggle.

The PetroLMI Division of Energy Safety Canada says direct oil and gas employment fell by more than 6,700 positions in June compared with May, with about 70 per cent of the net job losses in Alberta.

Compared with a year earlier, employment in the oil and employment sector was down 17 per cent.

The overall job losses were unprecedented in speed and depth compared with previous recessions, Statistics Canada said, and the rebound to date sharper than previous downturns.

Ottawa's response has been equally unprecedented: a deficit of at least $343.2 billion this fiscal year as the Trudeau Liberals dole out some $230 billion in emergency aid.

In June, 28.3 per cent of Canadians aged 15 to 69 reported receiving some form of federal aid since mid-March, Statistics Canada said. Meanwhile, the proportion of households reporting difficulty paying the bills dropped to 20.1 per cent in June from 22.5 per cent in May.

""Without the federal government being there to support Canadian workers, Canadian businesses and the Canadian provinces and territories, we would be in a bigger mess in this country right now,"" Hassan Yussuff, president of the Canadian Labour Congress said in an interview this week.

The Bank of Canada and federal government believe the worst of the economic pain from the pandemic is behind the country, but Canada will face high unemployment and low growth until 2021.

In a statement, federal Employment Minister Carla Qualtrough touted the overall jobs numbers as a sign the government's plan was working, before adding many Canadians still ""face real challenges during this time.""

She and other ministers are now reshaping programs so fewer workers stay on the $80-billion emergency benefit, and more get tied to jobs through the $82-billion wage subsidy program.

""We understand the need for those emergency programs. We also understand as we reopen and recover, we have to move away from emergency programs and into stimulus and recovery,"" said Leah Nord, senior director of workforce strategies for the Canadian Chamber of Commerce.

She said there are other issues to resolve around health and safety in the workplace, transit, and child care to help more Canadians get back to work.

In provinces where daycares reopened for children five and under, employment levels returned to pre-pandemic levels for fathers in June, but not for mothers. Similarly, mothers with children under 18 were more likely than fathers to work less than half their usual hours in June, Statistics Canada said.

Job gains have come at a faster clip for men. Their unemployment rate hit 12.1 per cent in June compared to 12.7 per cent for women. And the underutilization rate — which counts those who are unemployed, those who want a job but didn't look for one, and those working less than half their usual hours — was 28.3 for women and 25.5 per cent for men.

Economist Armine Yalnizyan said the numbers underscore the need to provide child care as well as options for schooling in the fall so mothers can work.

The alternative, she said, could pull back any economic gains.

""It means that even if there are jobs, some women won't be able to take them because there's no way they can leave their kids,"" said Yalnizyan, a fellow on the future of workers at the Atkinson Foundation.

""So we are looking at the potential for an economic depression instead of talking about paces of recovery and pivoting to building to better.""

Three Cabinet ministers in the administration of Bolivian leader Jeanine Áñez have also tested positive for the virus, including Health Minister Eidy Roca and Presidency Minister Yerko Nuñez, who is hospitalized.

article continues below

The infections in Venezuela, Brazil and Bolivia, which is seeing a spike in cases, come after Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández tested positive in June and was briefly hospitalized.

Áñez said she will remain in isolation for 14 days when another test will be done, but she will continue to work remotely from the presidential residence.

""I feel good, I feel strong,"" she wrote on her Twitter account.

Bolivia’s Health Ministry says the Andean country has 42,984 confirmed coronavirus cases and 1,577 deaths, and is seeing a rebound in the number of new cases amid reports that hospitals are being overwhelmed in some regions. In the highland city of Cochabamba, scenes have emerged of bodies lying in the streets and coffins waiting for days in homes to be taken away.

Bolivia is scheduled to hold a presidential election Sept. 6. Áñez is running third in opinion polls. Former Economy Minister Luis Arce, who represents the party of ousted President Evo Morales, is in front, with ex-President Carlos Mesa in second.

In Venezuela, meanwhile, socialist party chief Diosdado Cabello revealed that he had tested positive for COVID-19, making him the highest-ranking leader in the distressed South American nation thus far to come down with the virus.

Cabello is considered the second-most powerful person in Venezuela after President Nicolás Maduro and made the announcement on Twitter, stating that he is isolated, getting treatment and will overcome the illness.

""We will win!"" he wrote in conclusion.

Economically struggling Venezuela is considered one of the world’s least prepared countries to confront the pandemic. Hospitals are routinely short on basic supplies like water, electricity and medicine.

The nation has registered considerably fewer COVID-19 cases than others in the region, but the number of infections has grown in recent weeks. As of Wednesday, the government had reported 8,010 confirmed cases and 75 deaths.

Cabello was last seen Tuesday, when he met with South Africa’s ambassador, Joseph Nkosi. Photographs released by the government showed him standing alongside and bumping fists with the diplomat while wearing a black mask.

The 57-year-old politician is head of the National Constituent Assembly, an all-powerful legislative body created by Maduro’s government in 2017. He had missed his weekly television program Wednesday, stating at the time that he was ""fighting against a strong allergy"" and resting.

Maduro said in a broadcast Thursday that Cabello’s diagnosis was confirmed with a molecular exam — a test that is usually conducted with a nasal swab sample. Venezuela has done far fewer of these tests than neighbouring countries, instead largely deploying rapid blood antibody tests. Some experts fear that relying so heavily on the rapid tests, which don’t detect signs of illness early in an infection, means cases are being missed.

""Venezuela is with Diosdado,"" Maduro said. ""I am sure soon enough we will continue on in this fight.""

In Brazil, President Jair Bolsonaro was diagnosed with COVID-19 on Tuesday.

He appeared Thursday on an online broadcast from the presidential residence as defiant as on previous occasions. He coughed once, but did not show other symptoms of the disease that has killed more than 69,000 people in the South American nation.

Bolsonaro repeated his view that the economic crisis brought on by the pandemic is more dangerous than the coronavirus itself. He insisted that mayors and governors need to reopen the country for business.

""We need governors and mayors, within their responsibilities, to reopen commerce. Otherwise the consequences will be harmful for Brazil,"" Bolsonaro said, wearing a gray shirt and sitting comfortably in front of two national flags.",[]

The Montreal-based company announced Thursday that it is sending notices to terminate the leases at the 124 stores to take effect in 30 days. The move would affect about half of its workforce of nearly 2,500, including all 366 employees in the United States.

It will also seek more favourable lease terms for the remaining 100 stores in Canada and may permanently shut additional locations if landlords are unwilling to negotiate suitable leases.

It had warned in mid-June that it could begin a formal restructuring depending on the outcome of its talks with landlords.

The company said at the time that it hadn't paid rent on any of its stores for April, May and June.

The store closures are part of its restructuring plan after it obtained court protection from creditors under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act and Chapter 15 in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.

""With the upcoming closure of 124 unprofitable stores across North America, we are certainly making good progress in creating a stronger business model for the future and ensuring the long-term success and sustainability of DavidsTea and our beloved brand,"" company founder and interim CEO Herschel Segal said in a news release.

Chief financial officer Frank Zitella said that with the closure of ""a significant number of money-losing stores"" it will focus exclusively on e-commerce sale which had a penetration rate of close to 43 per cent in the market before COVID-19.

""All 100 remaining DavidsTea stores have been closed since March 17 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and will remain so until further notice,"" he stated.

DavidsTea last month reported that it lost $23.2 million last year on $146.5 million in revenues. That includes a US$4.3 million loss in its fiscal fourth quarter on US$54.8 million of revenues.

The move by DavidsTea comes three years after Starbucks announced the closure of all of its Teavana brand stores. The coffee giant acquired Teavana Holdings in 2012 for US$620 million.

The cancellation of the 2020 national football championship game because of COVID-19, and U Sports not altering an age eligibility rule, accelerates the swan song of roughly 300 football players.

article continues below

U Sports has said student-athletes whose championships are cancelled in 2020-21 because of the pandemic will not lose a year of eligibility.

But football players have seven years after graduating from high school to complete their five-year eligibility. Many play junior football before entering the university ranks.

The only U Sports sport with an age limit is football.

University of Calgary quarterback Josiah Joseph of the defending Vanier Cup champion Dinos is among those caught in a rule designed to limit the age of players in Canadian university football to under 25.

Players who turn 25 before Sept. 1 age out of university football. Joseph turns 25 on July 10, 2021.

Approximately 300 players out of 2,335 will be similarly impacted in 2021, according to U Sports.

Joseph hoped U Sports would make an exception for players like him.

""All they would have to do is amend the rule and push it to maybe January first due to extreme circumstances,"" he told The Canadian Press.

""It's devastating there's that many players in my position.""

U Sports adopted a football age cap to prevent large gaps in physical maturation and experience between players in a collision sport, and also to create room on rosters for younger players, according to U Sports interim CEO Dick White.

""I really understand the disappointment of the players that this affects,"" said White, who took over for departed CEO Graham Brown last month.

""Our legal advice that we received was very firm. If we believe the age cap should be 25 for the health and safety of athletes then we should not under any circumstances alter that.

""The reasons for having that age cap have not changed even though we've had the tragedy of COVID.""

Joseph argues there is no physical or experience difference between a player who turns 25 in March and one who turns 25 in October.

""There's already 25 year olds playing in the league so what's the difference of a couple months?"" he asked. ""There is none.""

U Sport cancelling the 2020 Vanier Cup and the two bowl games — Mitchell and Uteck — that serve as semifinals doesn't stop conferences from playing football in the fall.

But Canada West, Ontario University Athletics and Atlantic University Sport have already declared there won't be football in 2020 because of the pandemic.

The Reseau du sport etudiant du Quebec is still working on running football this fall.

University of Bisons head coach Brian Dobie points out fifth-year players aren't the only ones impacted.

Any current university football player whose birthday falls before Sept. 1 will lose a year of football eligibility because of the combination of the pandemic and the current rule.

""What about that kid who had two years left and he just got a starting spot? Now Johnny has one year left. What about Billy who had three years left and now has two years left?"" Dobie asked.

""If you have one kid in your program that is negatively affected by this, as a coach you should be outraged. Every kid should count just the same and you should be outraged.""

Losing a year of football eligibility also means losing a year of athletic scholarship to pay for school, Dobie added.

""The reality is the age cap is 25 and it's not 26 and somewhere you draw the line,"" White said.

""If the football institutions wish to re-address the age cap to 26 or no age cap, that's up to our member institutions. There's a process to do that.

""The big picture here was there was a very good reason we put the age cap in. Our board of directors, supported by the legal opinion, said 'don't move it.'""

Joseph doesn't buy that rationale.

""It doesn't seem like it's reflecting the interests of a lot of coaches and players that make up U Sports football that make it successful, the guys that are going to be there for five years who are going to graduate that are going to be proud alumni,"" he said.

""That's what makes up university football in Canada.""

In addition to the impact on each individual’s care, test data is critical to strategic planning and public policy.

As well as informing us, however, testing issues have also created a great deal of confusion and frustration. The terminology and specifics are new to most, and the criteria for and access to testing has fluctuated a great deal in a short period of time. After four months, here’s where we stand:

article continues below

Summary points

* Testing is now available to anyone with symptoms of COVID-19, however mild;

* Those needing COVID-19 assessment are encouraged to call their family doctor or nurse practitioner's office, call 811, or attend the hospital emergency department (ER);

* Powell River and qathet Region District have had very few confirmed cases of COVID-19 to date, but remain at risk for future outbreaks. Ongoing attention to public health measures is still critically important.

Criteria for testing

Most COVID-19 patients have cold or flu-like symptoms, though onset may be gradual over days. Those with severe symptoms should attend the ER without delay. Common symptoms include fever, fatigue, cough, shortness of breath, muscle aches, sore throat, lack of appetite, and loss of taste or smell. Headaches, confusion, runny nose, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and rashes are less typical, but may occur.

People without any symptoms (asymptomatic) are not generally tested in BC, except in special circumstances such as a public health investigation of an outbreak. In addition to using limited resources, testing asymptomatic individuals can lead to high rates of false positives (test is positive, but the person doesn’t actually have the virus). An online symptom checker is available at https://bc.thrive.health/covid19/en, or through 811.

Where to get tested

People are encouraged to call their nurse practitioner or family doctor if they feel they may have COVID-19. In addition to reviewing criteria for testing, a primary care provider knows their patient's medical history and can direct them accordingly. Some clinics offer testing on site, including drive-through testing, while others will refer to another office or to the hospital.

Assessment and testing for COVID-19 at Powell River General Hospital is located in the ambulance bay of the ER. There is a separated space for one patient at a time, and it is cleaned after each use. Efforts are being made to reduce wait times, but these do vary.

Those coming to the ER for respiratory symptoms or COVID-19 assessment are encouraged to call ahead (604.485.3211), and will be directed outside to the ambulance entrance where there is a buzzer to advise staff on arrival. Testing is available 24/7, if needed.

People being assessed and tested for COVID-19 will only be brought into the main ER department if they need further investigations or treatment. Dedicated areas are used for this purpose.

Procedure for outpatient testing

Testing for COVID-19 involves essentially a small cotton swab on a plastic stick that is inserted into one’s nose, turned a few times, then removed and placed in a tube. Nasal swabs may make one’s eyes water, but are generally described as uncomfortable rather than painful.

Locally, all COVID-19 swabs are packaged at the hospital and flown to Vancouver once or twice daily for processing. Results are typically by 8 am the day after they are received in Vancouver.

Powell River Hospital has secured a small supply of rapid tests that can identify a COVID-19 result within an hour. Owing to the very limited supply, these are generally reserved for critical situations.

Most people with COVID-19 (over 80 per cent) will be well enough to stay at home during their illness.

After being tested, patients are given instructions and an information sheet on how to self-isolate until test results are available. Staying home when sick is considered by many experts as the single most effective strategy to limit COVID-19 in a community.

Results

To confirm a negative test people may wish to speak with their primary care provider, use myehealth.ca, or call the BCCDC negative results line between 8:30 am and 4:30 pm, seven days per week, at 1.833.707.2792.

Those with positive test results will be notified rapidly by Public Health. In BC thus far, over 98 per cent of positive cases were reached in under 24 hours. The family doctor or nurse practitioner will also receive the result.

If someone tests positive for COVID-19, a public health staff member will call them daily until they are cleared (usually 10 days if minimal symptoms). They will offer direction on self-isolation and help advise how to manage symptoms, including when to seek further care.

The public health team will also take a detailed history to identify who has had close contact with a positive case, including up to 48 hours before that person's symptoms first developed.

Those people identified by public health as having a significant risk of exposure (e.g. sustained close contact, household members, no physical distancing or protective equipment) will be notified as soon as possible, and will be advised to self-isolate (and to test if they develop symptoms). Contact tracing is not generally done for very brief, distanced, or other low risk encounters.

Future plans

Blood testing for immunity (i.e. past infection) is not yet available for routine use. It is still unclear how accurate these tests are, and how long immunity from natural infection can be detected.

As we move into the fall, we expect an increase in respiratory viruses of all types. Detailed plans for additional testing sites have been developed and will be implemented based on capacity and need.

Powell River data

Local medical officer of health Dr. Geoff McKee reported last week that the lower Sunshine Coast has had a total of six cases thus far in the pandemic, and that Powell River region has had fewer than five cases to date (because of the low number and the potential privacy risk for so few cases, the exact number was not given).

Dr. McKee also noted that there were no active cases being followed on the Sunshine Coast. Unfortunately, there could be cases that simply aren’t identified yet, or new cases that may arise at any time. For this reason, regardless of the exact number of confirmed cases, we all need to follow public health recommendations if we hope to protect our community from this virus.

A recent survey completed by the Powell River Division of Family Practice identified that roughly three per cent of people surveyed in our region have been tested for COVID-19. Several barriers to testing were identified by community members, which we are working to address.

Conclusion

While our region has had relatively little COVID-19 activity thus far, global cases continue to rise rapidly. Until there is widespread immunity or a universally effective treatment, we are all vulnerable.

Local physicians will continue to prepare and behave as if there are active cases in the community. Staying home when sick, washing hands, physical distancing with most people, and wearing masks or protective equipment when needed, continue to be the cornerstones of defence for all of us.

In addition public health measures, testing (and contact tracing) is an extremely powerful tool to limit the spread of COVID-19. Anyone who thinks they may have symptoms should call their family doctor or nurse practitioner, call 811, or attend our local emergency department.

Be smart, be safe, and be kind. We are in this together.

Seniors, in particular, are a focus of the report from the Senate's social affairs committee, from those in long-term care homes to those with low incomes.

article continues below

Just this week, the Liberals rolled out one-time special payments of $300 to the more than six million people who receive old-age security, and $200 more for the 2.2 million who also receive the guaranteed income supplement.

The income supports are meant to help seniors facing increased costs as a result of the pandemic, such as more frequent prescription fees and delivery charges for groceries.

Senators on the committee wrote of evidence of ""financial insecurity and increased vulnerability"" for low-income seniors as a result of the first wave of the novel coronavirus.

A potential second wave, which could coincide with the annual flu season that starts in the fall, would make the situation even worse for these seniors ""without concrete and timely government action,"" the report says.

Senators say the Liberals should deliver a plan to help low-income seniors, among other populations vulnerable to economic shocks like new immigrants, no later than the end of August, and contain short- and long-term options.

The report also says the federal government needs to pay urgent attention to seniors in long-term care homes where outbreaks and deaths in the pandemic have been concentrated.

The document made public Thursday morning is the committee's first set of observations on the government's response to the pandemic, with a final report expected later this year.

Before then, the Liberals are planning to provide another economic update like the one delivered Wednesday, or possibly a full budget. The government shelved plans to deliver one at the end of March when the House of Commons went on extended hiatus due to the pandemic.

The long-awaited economic ""snapshot,"" as the Liberals styled it, said federal spending is closing in on $600 billion this fiscal year. That means a deficit of $343 billion, fuelled by emergency pandemic aid that the government budgets at over $230 billion.

The Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada said the spending figures demand a ""full and transparent assessment"" to see what worked, what didn't and what needs to change for an economic recovery.

Hassan Yussuff, president of the Canadian Labour Congress, said the Liberals should take back up their promise to create a national pharmacare system as the government considers its next steps.

A federal advisory council last year calculated the cost of a program at over $15 billion annually, depending on its design.

""The last thing we want to have is Canadians in frail health as we're dealing with this pandemic and I think the government really needs to think of that,"" Yussuff said in an interview Wednesday.

""Had it not been for the health care system we have right now,"" he added later, ""think of how this country would have fared in this pandemic.""

The Senate committee's report also notes the national emergency stockpile of personal protective gear like masks, gowns and gloves wasn't managed well over the years, nor sufficiently stocked when the pandemic struck.

Committee members added concerns that military members could be deployed without sufficient personal protective equipment because of ""inconsistencies from international procurement.""

The stock market crash in March and the plunge in interest rates left many investors feeling uncertain and vulnerable, while still more have been left without work.

article continues below

Tina Cheung, a wealth adviser at Vancity, says it is always important to review your financial plan on a regular basis, but a review can be especially important during times like these.

""During these times of uncertainty it is important to have peace of mind, and to have that peace of mind, to achieve it, is to get a financial check up,"" she said.

Investors who were shocked at the state of their investment portfolios at the end of the first quarter might breathe a sigh of relief when checking their statements for the second quarter as stock markets have rallied off their lows seen near the end of March.

However, Canada's main stock index is still down from where it was a year ago and well off the highs it hit in February before the pandemic struck the markets.

""The effects of the pandemic on the market will eventually pass, like the global financial crisis did, but if these few months created any stress or loss of sleep, we need to go back and talk about your risk appetite,"" Cheung says.

But she says if your risk appetite has not changed and your goal hasn't changed, then it is critical to think long term and stick to your plan.

Before heading into a meeting with your adviser, it is important to have a firm grip of your budget and what your goals are for the meeting.

Cheung says you need to be prepared to have an open discussion and be ready with information like your monthly income and expenses.

For some, reviewing their financial plan may mean difficult decisions, facing depleted emergency funds due to the loss of a job and little prospect for a return to work at a level seen before the pandemic.

A poll done for TD Bank found that 38 per cent of those surveyed identified as financially vulnerable in April 2020 compared with 15 per cent in November last year. The poll also found that 13 per cent of those asked in April felt confident in their financial future compared with 20 per cent in November 2019.

If you have taken advantage of the payment deferrals offered by many lenders, you need to have a clear plan for when those deferral periods come to an end and you need to resume making payments.

Gio Bazile, a district vice-president at TD Bank, says some borrowers may start to struggle once the deferrals come to an end if their income hasn't picked back up again.

""Part of what is going to be really critical is understanding what your future cash flow is going to look like and how do you work with your financial adviser with an impending financial hardship, how do you best balance your wants and needs,"" he said.

Bazile says everyone is going to face their own situation, but it's key to have a candid conversation with your partner or family to understand where you are financially.

""If your cash flow is low or if you are kind of over-leveraged from a debt perspective, then that's probably a time to actually spend some time with your financial adviser,"" he said.

""If you're looking at your savings account and realizing, wait a minute, I may not be able to get through this next two, three months and beyond, that's probably another really big trigger.""

That is, if they can survive long enough to see daylight again.

Those were two of the conclusions in the most recent Restaurants Canada survey of its member businesses.

article continues below

The survey, which heard from nearly 1,000 restaurant owners representing more than 11,500 restaurants, found 56 per cent of restaurant owners believed it would require a year or more to recover from the pandemic, and that at least 50 per cent of them are currently operating at a loss. “Restaurateurs are eager to help rebuild the economy and revive neighbourhoods, but they’re going to need continued assistance from government to remain operational under ongoing restrictions,” said the organization’s vice-president, David Lefebvre.

The results of the survey come as no surprise to Ian Tostenson, president of the B.C. Restaurant and Foodservices Association.

While Tostenson said the provincial situation is a bit of a “mixed bag” of results as B.C. continues to open up its economy, he made it clear there is trouble in the industry.

“Of the nearly 15,000 restaurants in B.C. maybe 60 per cent are actually up and running,” he said, noting many have decided to remain closed temporarily as there’s no business for them and others have closed for good. “Some may never come back. We expect to lose between 20 and 30 per cent of the industry … it’s just too much to expect some of these small businesses to hold on.”

That is especially true in the major markets.

“Downtown Victoria and downtown Vancouver are just disasters,” he said. Downtown restaurants rely heavily on tourism and office workers to stay afloat. “Volumes in those two big markets are tracking 20-30 per cent of where they were at this point last year.”

On the upside, Tostenson said suburban operators and restaurants in small cities and towns around B.C. have reported doing alright.

Overall, he said, they are still dealing with the fact people aren’t yet feeling safe about going out to eat despite the myriad safety precautions the industry has taken.

The survey results have spurred Restaurants Canada to call for the federal government to extend and strengthen support for food-service businesses by maintaining the federal wage subsidy, extending and expanding rent-relief programs and expanding loans for small business.

The first time, he showed up an hour before the public testing site was set to close and was told they had reached capacity. He was turned away from a second centre when rain shut it down, and voluntarily left a third after someone ahead of him said they had been waiting in line for more than three hours.

article continues below

""If you have symptoms and you are just driving around the city trying to figure out how you can get a test, for people who are positive, it is not ideal,"" said Lee, who finally got a test on June 29 after he showed up at a site before dawn and waited for more than two hours. Another five days passed before he was able to view the results online, and he didn't receive a text with the results until seven days after being tested.

Four months, 3 million confirmed infections and over 130,000 deaths into the coronavirus outbreak in the U.S., Americans confronted with a resurgence of the scourge are facing long lines at testing sites in the summer heat or are getting turned away. Others are going a week or more without receiving a diagnosis.

Some sites are running out of kits, while labs are reporting shortages of materials and workers to process the swabs.

Some frustrated Americans are left to wonder why the U.S. can't seem to get its act together, especially after it was given fair warning as the virus wreaked havoc in China and then Italy, Spain and New York.

""It’s a hot mess,"" said 47-year-old Jennifer Hudson of Tucson, Arizona. ""The fact that we’re relying on companies and we don’t have a national response to this, it’s ridiculous. … It’s keeping people who need tests from getting tests.""

It took Hudson five days to make an appointment through a CVS pharmacy near her home. She booked a drive-up test over the weekend, more than a week after her symptoms — fatigue, shortness of breath, headache and sore throat — first emerged. The clinic informed her that her results would probably be delayed.

Testing has been ramped up nationwide, reaching about 640,000 tests per day on average, up from around 518,000 two weeks ago, according to an Associated Press analysis. Newly confirmed infections per day in the U.S. are running at over 50,000, breaking records at practically every turn.

More testing tends to lead to more cases found. But in an alarming indicator, the percentage of tests coming back positive for the virus is on the rise across nearly the entire country, hitting almost 27% in Arizona, 19% in Florida and 17% in South Carolina.

While the U.S. has conducted more tests than any other nation, it ranks in the middle of the pack in testing per capita, behind Russia, Spain and Australia, according to Johns Hopkins University.

""I am stunned that as a nation, six months into this pandemic, we still can’t figure out how to deliver testing to the American people when they need it,"" said Dr. Ashish Jha, director of Harvard’s Global Health Institute. ""It is an abject failure of leadership and shows that the federal government has not prioritized testing in a way that will allow us to get through this pandemic.""

Testing alone without adequate contact tracing and quarantine measures won't control the spread of the scourge, according to health experts. But they say delays in testing can lead to more infections by leaving people in the dark as to whether they need to isolate themselves.

In other developments:

— While the number of confirmed cases in the U.S. hit 3 million Wednesday by Johns Hopkins' count, health officials have said that because of inadequate testing and the many mild infections that have gone unreported, the real number is about 10 times higher, or almost 10% of the U.S. population.

— A crowd of thousands attending President Donald Trump’s campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in late June, along with large groups of people who showed up to protest, ""likely contributed"" to a dramatic surge in new coronavirus cases in the area, Tulsa City-County Health Department Director Dr. Bruce Dart said Wednesday. Tulsa County reported 261 confirmed cases on Monday, a new record one-day high, and another 206 confirmed cases on Tuesday. A spokesman for the Trump campaign didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

— Most New York City students will return to school in the fall two or three days a week and learn online the rest of the time under a plan announced by Mayor Bill de Blasio. He said schools can’t accommodate all their students at any one time and maintain social distancing. The school system in New York is the biggest in the nation, with 1.1 million students. It has been closed since March.

In New York City, the most lethal hot spot in the nation during the spring, testing was scarce early on but is now widely available. As many as 35,000 tests are conducted daily through a combination of private health organizations and city agencies, according to the city Health Department.

""Widespread testing holds the key to reopening our city safely,"" de Blasio said.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services this week said it will open free ""surge testing"" sites in three hard-hit cities: Jacksonville, Florida; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; and Edinburg, Texas. The sites will be able to conduct as many as 5,000 tests a day in each city, with results in three to five days, officials said.

In Georgia, one of the states where cases are surging, officials are rushing to expand testing capacity as demand threatens to overwhelm six major sites around Atlanta, said DeKalb County CEO Michael Thurmond.

""If you project this out over the next three weeks, we can’t handle it,"" he said.

In New Orleans, people were turned away from a free testing site for a third consecutive day after it reached its daily allotment of tests. Health care providers are running low on trays and chemicals needed to run machines used in the tests.

Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego called the situation there ""desperate"" as residents have sat in sun-baked cars for up to 13 hours to get drive-thru testing. Robert Fenton, head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said FEMA is doubling the testing supplies it plans to ship to Arizona.

Patrick Friday, a United Methodist minister in Alabama, went to several hospitals and clinics in Birmingham this week to get checked after his school-age son tested positive. But he was told that unless he had a preexisting condition, he didn’t qualify.

Finally, he ended up at a site offering rapid-result tests and his negative result came back quickly.

""We are several months into this,"" he said. ""How can it be that we can’t go in and get a test?""

""Unfortunately, as we don't anticipate ridership to be back to pre-COVID-19 levels in the foreseeable future, we had to make difficult decisions to deal with the situation as we gain a better understanding of the impacts of the pandemic on our operations,"" Cynthia Garneau, Via's president and CEO, said in a statement Wednesday.

The layoffs take effect on July 24. Affected employees will receive a temporary written layoff notice that respects their collective agreement's terms, the Montreal-based company said. It will maintain access to different programs for the employees.

The company is working to advance its service resumption plan and has seen some recent positive developments, though many routes remain interrupted.

Winnipeg to Churchill is the sole route in service, according to Via Rail's website, which was last updated June 26.

Several routes have partially resumed, while Toronto to Niagara Falls, Toronto to Vancouver, and Montreal to Halifax remain interrupted with all trains cancelled. Some of those routes are slated to resume service Nov. 1.

Via Rail said it plans to bring back employees ""as soon as the customer demand allows it.""

The passenger rail service has faced a rough year with rail blockades impacting service earlier in 2020.

""The current year has been filled with unprecedented challenges,"" said Garneau.

The company temporarily laid off roughly the same number of employees in B.C. and Ontario during rail blockades in the winter. The company said in March that most of those employees would be brought back early that month.

Some routes in those provinces were halted when protests in solidarity with the Wet’suwet’en First Nation blocked railways across Canada.

Morneau delivered a ""snapshot"" of the federal finances Wednesday, for the first time since the pandemic brought much of Canada's economy to its knees.

article continues below

In the update, he said the government is well aware some segments of the population are hurting more than others.

""This crisis has exposed and amplified many inequalities in Canada,"" Morneau said.

The same people have in many cases also been affected more by the virus itself, in part because women, new immigrants, racialized Canadians and Indigenous people are more likely to work in the jobs where contagion is a risk, such as health care, retail and warehouse work.

The documents are careful to note that while racialized Canadians are more likely to work in economic sectors hit hard by the virus — including health care, accommodation and food services — little data has been collected to truly understand the impact on visible minorities and other marginalized communities.

So for example, there is no racial breakdown of who applied for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit.

Nor has much data been collected on the ethnicities of people diagnosed with COVID-19. One recent report from Ottawa Public Health said two-thirds of cases over the previous six weeks in its territory were racialized Canadians or new immigrants, but that report was limited in scope and for just one city.

The fiscal snapshot shows women, youth, low-wage workers, racialized Canadians, Indigenous people and new immigrants all saw higher rates of job loss or reduced working hours, and are also seeing slow, and in some cases no, benefits as the economy begins to recover.

Jobs in sectors dominated by men, such as construction and manufacturing, were faster to come back than those in service industries, tourism, and accommodation, where women and immigrants tend to be employed in bigger proportion.

New Canadians in particular have seen very little job recovery thus far, the report says.

Businesses owned by women and racialized Canadians were more likely to report declines in orders and clients, and a higher need for rent relief.

Women were also hit harder by the closing of schools and daycares, with women who have kids under the age of six reporting significantly larger declines in hours worked than women with no children or older ones.

""Going forward, anything we do must be about growth, resilience, and creating opportunity for those who were most impacted by this crisis,"" said Morneau.

""This pandemic has identified clear gaps and it’s giving us a chance to reset.""

Exactly how he plans to do that is not clear. The government has said some of the $14-billion aid package offered to provinces to help them safely reopen their economies needs to include child care investments.

""We've been very clear that having access to child care is going to be critically important for us to get back to work,"" Morneau said in a news conference with reporters. ""Women have been harder hit through the course of this pandemic and our measures therefore need to consider that challenge.""

But a month after Ottawa put the $14 billion on the table, the provinces have not yet accepted Ottawa's requirements for getting access to that money.

There is also little information about how the government intends to try to level the economic playing field so the gaps that led to inequalities going into the pandemic are closed.

Morneau said for now the government is focused on the safe restart of the economy and the longer-term recovery plan is still in development.

Green MP Elizabeth May said governments have to make child care and safe school reopenings a bigger priority because without those things, parents — and most often mothers — are not going to be able to return to work.

""We know that's an economic blow we can't risk and we know that's a step back for women's rights we can't accept,"" she said.

May said the snapshot was ""exception"" for the depth of its gender-based analysis of the impact of COVID-19 on women. She said the answer to stopping the damage is three things: ""Child care, child care, child care.""

“The court has gradually resumed some regular operations, including trials, chambers applications and other hearings and conferences, many of which proceed remotely,” B.C. Supreme Court Chief Justice Christopher Hinkson said in a July 7 directive.

article continues below

“While the court has expanded the scope of its in-person operations, counsel, parties, litigants and members of the public are discouraged from attending courthouses unless their personal attendance is necessary or the court so directs,” he said.

B.C. Court of Appeal

In B.C.’s high court, the suspension of service and filing deadlines for existing appeals and chambers applications started March 18 and has been extended to July 27. As of July 14, parties may now request that appeal hearings proceed in a courtroom or by Zoom videoconference.

The court registry is accepting filings in all matters. In civil appeals, electronic filing remains mandatory for lawyers and optional for self-represented litigants.

The time periods for filing cases remains suspended.

“You can wait without concern that the limitation period to start civil or family proceedings will expire,” a July 7 directive from Chief Justice Robert Bauman said.

“Persons in the courtroom are not required to wear masks, but everyone may of course do so, except when addressing the Court at the hearing,” Bauman said. “Counsel/litigants must bring their own water supply and present their arguments from their own table (individual lecterns will be provided). Furniture will be cleaned and disinfected between hearings.”



B.C. Supreme Court

Effective July 13, in-person registry services will resume at all Supreme Court registries and the interim process for requesting a hearing of an urgent or essential matter will no longer be available, Hinkson said.

In criminal matters, bail and bail review hearings, detention review hearings, regular fix-date appearances and regular pre-trial conferences, COVID pre-trial conferences and case management conferences will continue by phone, a directive from Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes said.

Those using registries are recommended to continue using electronic, mail or fax filings where possible.

For family law matters, parties are no longer automatically relieved of the requirement to attend a judicial case conference before making an application by written submissions but that can still be done via phone.

Judicial case conferences already scheduled to occur on or after June 1 will resume by phone.

Civil and family trials scheduled to begin on or after June 8 have resumed unless otherwise directed.

“The resumption of civil and family trials may be subject to change as a result of limitations on available facilities or public health recommendations,” Hinkson said.

Jury selections remain cancelled until September. In civil cases where a jury notice has been filed and served, if all parties consent to proceeding by judge alone, they may seek such an order at a trial management conference.

Effective April 15, a ministerial order suspended limitation periods and mandatory time periods for the commencement of a civil or family proceedings from March 18, 2020 to the date on which the last extension of the declaration of the state of emergency.

“Once this suspension is lifted, more directions will be provided by the court,” Hinkson said.



B.C. Provincial Court

Chief Judge Melissa Gillespie announced July 8, provincial court would return to receiving all filings at the applicable court registry either in-person or remotely.

The provincial court had already begun re-opening June 15 courtrooms on a limited basis outside hub centres of Surrey, Vancouver Victoria, Prince George, and Kelowna where limited in-person hearings began a week earlier.

As of July 8, 2020, registries will accept all family cases filings. Small claims filings will be accepted July 13 while urgent small claims matters will only be heard by telephone.

Among the student-volunteer positions advertised as available on the I Want to Help website are 1,500 spots with YMCA Canada to help create online exercise regimes for kids and seniors in their communities.

article continues below

Yet the YMCA says those positions were actually the brainchild of WE Charity, the organization originally tapped by the Liberal government to administer the Canada Student Services Grant, and that the YMCA never agreed to them.

Both the YMCA and WE blame a miscommunication as WE scrambled to get the grant program — through which students can get up to $5,000 toward their schooling if they volunteer the maximum 500 hours — up and running as quickly as possible.

WE has since withdrawn from running the program.

In an interview, YMCA Canada president Peter Dinsdale said his organization proposed hosting 391 volunteers through dozens of YMCA locations. They would focus on three areas: helping local branches with marketing and website design; data analysis; and assisting seniors with tech questions.

The YMCA arrived at the number after reaching out to branches across the country, Dinsdale said, after which the national office drew up a draft memorandum of understanding with WE to formalize the arrangement.

""We sent a draft in and they sent a draft back and that's when we saw these other positions and we asked to separate them,"" he said of the 1,500 positions for online exercise regimes. ""And they said great. And we haven't heard from them since all this has gone down.""

""These discussions (with the YMCA) took place quickly, given our short timeline for delivery, and some confusion arose around the two separate agreements,"" WE said in a statement to The Canadian Press.

""That confusion contributed to a misunderstanding on our part which led to one group of service positions being posted, rather than the other group of service positions.""

It nonetheless means those advertised positions are not actually available.

The status of thousands of other positions apparently created by WE to meet the requirements of the volunteer program remains uncertain.

Youth Minister Bardish Chagger's spokeswoman Danielle Keenan stood by the Canada Student Services Grant program on Wednesday, saying that while there will be delays in its rollout following WE's departure, the government remains committed to it.

""The Canada Student Service Grants program provides opportunities for students who want to help with their communities COVID-19 response,"" Keenan said in an email to The Canadian Press.

""Although the delivery of the program will change, our objective has not changed which is to ensure students, not-for-profits, and communities are supported throughout the pandemic.""

WE and the Liberal government announced last week that they were ending a sole-sourced contract to have the charity manage the grant program after questions were raised about a potential conflict of interest between Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the organization.

Dinsdale said the YMCA did not know the 1,500 positions had been posted, noting the agreement with WE was never signed. At the same time, the 391 positions that the YMCA does want to fill have yet to be advertised. Dinsdale said the YMCA is waiting to hear from the government on those.

""The 391 that we're actually putting forward, our Ys are ready and willing to engage in it and there are some really interesting opportunities that could exist for youth and our YMCAs and communities,"" he said. ""So we're certainly hopeful those go ahead.""

Thousands of other positions posted on the federal website involve the creation of online content or the mentoring of other students on such topics as COVID-19's impact on the environment, nutrition and cyberbullying.

Some of those are posted in huge batches, such as a call for 1,000 volunteers to be trained to hold one-to-one sessions with people on ""the impact of COVID-19 on food security in your community.""

Another seeks 1,250 volunteers to devise ""social-media assets"" such as captions, memes and videos, for local and regional awareness campaigns to help stop the spread of COVID-19.

None of those postings includes the name of a hosting organization: they're listed as ""supporting local non-profits in your community"" rather than with a specific agency.

WE did indicate that it was behind many of them as it sought to meet the government's requirement that in order to be eligible for the student grant, positions must be linked to the COVID-19 pandemic.

""The purpose of the CSSG was to engage tens of thousands of post-secondary students in service programs to assist with the impact of COVID-19,"" WE said in its statement.

""COVID-19 has been in Canada for a relatively short period of time and there are limited new service opportunities related to addressing (it). This is partly why WE was brought in (to) develop and co-ordinate service roles that fulfil the program guidelines and deliver a meaningful impact.""

Employment and Social Development Canada, which will now administer the grant program instead of WE, did not respond to repeated questions about the positions, including whether they would move ahead or not.

Conservative employment critic Dan Albas said the questions about the federal website underscore the need for answers when it comes to the student grant program, including how positions have been chosen or created and what benefit they are expected to have.

""To find out that perhaps hundreds of positions have been put forward and in good faith maybe people have applied for those positions without having a correction from the government?"" he said.

""This is public money. They need to come clean and clean up this program so that any dollar that is spent gets the maximum opportunities for young people and value for money for taxpayer dollars.""

The service industry — which includes businesses such as hair salons, schools, hospitals, gyms, hotels and restaurants — have racked up 104 orders out of 334 issued to up to July 3.

article continues below

The next most common industry to receive an order as of July 3, is the manufacturing sector, which includes meat processing plants, which have been hard hit by COVID-19, including a poultry plant in Coquitlam, as well as breweries, sawmills and pharmaceuticals.

In mid-May, an outbreak at Superior Poultry was declared over, and the plant allowed to re-open after instituting safety protocols.

Still, WorkSafeBC reports that most employers are doing their due diligence when it comes to meeting industry-specific guidelines.

However, when employers aren’t taking measures to protect workers from COVID-19 exposure, they could be issued an order for health or safety violations.

For the most part, though, employers have been taking the proper steps to re-open their businesses safely during the provincial re-start plan.

“Overall, the vast majority of employers are taking health and safety very seriously during the re-opening. Our inspections are finding that businesses want to be in compliance, and our prevention officers are providing support to help them have an effective COVID-19 Safety Plan,” stated Ivy Yuen, media relations representative in an email to The Tri-City News.

Data is not broken down regionally, so it is difficult to ascertain how many Tri-City businesses were given an order to beef up health and safety protocols.

Since, June 26, WorkSafeBC has conducted more than 12,000 worksite inspections in B.C. related to COVID-19.

The focus of these inspections has been to ensure employers have a COVID-19 Safety Plan in place, according to Yuen, who noted: “This plan needs to assess the risks to workers, and implement measures to prevent the transmission of COVID-19 in the workplace.”

Orders are usually issued as a result of an inspection or can be part of a follow-up activity.

Data posted by WorkPlace BC online shows that employers have a lot of questions about how to manage in the new pandemic reality. In recent weeks, it has has fielded 9,823 questions, 1,728 reports of potential violations and 21 workplace incidents.

There have also been 12,646 inspections, with the large service sector receiving the most at 4,615, followed by 2,988 for trade-related businesses, which includes supermarkets, retail stores and gas stations, 1,256 for the manufacturing sector, 886 for primary resource companies, such as oil and gas, 234 for transportation and warehousing, and 180 for the public sector, including government and law enforcement.

Other industries are being ordered to improve their safety protocols, according to the data.

Inspectors have issues 65 orders for the trade sector, 60 for construction, 18 for primary resources, three for public sector and two for transportation and warehousing, which includes taxis and ride hailing.",[]

Golf Canada reports that there were 17 per cent more scores registered with the national sport body this June compared to the same month last year. A total of 1,483,506 rounds were submitted to Golf Canada's handicap calculator last month compared to 1,271,782 in June 2019.

article continues below

""It was a pretty big jump from last year, comparing 2019 numbers to this year,"" said Adam Helmer, senior director of golf services for Golf Canada, on Wednesday. ""We were expecting that as golf has emerged as one of the safest activities, where people can be physically distant and we've reduced touchpoints.""

The surge in June ended a streak of three months when recreational rounds played in Canada dropped precipitously due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

As restrictions were lifted across the country in May, the number of scores registered increased.

In May, 165,026 rounds were registered between the 1st and the 15th but 265,480 scores were submitted in the final two weeks of that month. The May 1-15 numbers are a nearly 40 per cent drop from the same period in 2019 (211,809) but the May 16-30 numbers are just five per cent lower than last year (269,266).

Helmer said he expects the number of rounds submitted to Golf Canada to continue to climb through July and into August.

""We've heard anecdotally that a lot of newcomers have joined the sport, especially now that school is done we're going to see an increase in juniors too. We think the trend is going to continue,"" said Helmer. ""Golf has seen a pretty big lift and it's emerged as the sport of the summer.""

The upward trend comes even as Golf Canada had to cancel all of its amateur and professional championships due to travel restrictions put in place to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.

A shift in how scores are registered has also been seen, with most recreational players entering their scores online instead of in the course's clubhouse or pro shop, which have largely been closed this summer because of physical distancing protocols.

Golf Canada plans to launch an updated version of its scoring app later this month, helping to keep players physically distant and improve their game.

He cautioned Wednesday (July 8) some “hotspots” still remain in long-term care and some agricultural setting.

article continues below

The prime minister made the comments in a media briefing ahead of a scheduled fiscal update — or “snapshot” — from Finance Minister Bill Morneau later in the day.

Trudeau said he would leave the details of the snapshot to his finance minister, but added it was imperative for the federal government to have acted right from the outset of the COVID-19 crisis.

“The cost of doing nothing would have been far more,” he said, adding the pandemic has not been a time for “belt-tightening.”

He said the country has been able to slow down progression of the novel coronavirus significantly and parts of the economy have since been able to reopen.

Trudeau repeatedly touted the nation’s historically low interest rates, which he said would help pay off the accumulated debt.

“If the federal government hadn’t taken on significant debt in order to send money to Canadians to support businesses and households, what would Canadians have done?” he asked.

“They would have loaded up their credit cards, they would have scrambled to try and find ways to pay their bills, pay their groceries and figure out how to care for their loved ones.”

The prime minister said he’s confident about the federal government’s response to the pandemic, which has included hundreds of billions in spending, because of the reduced spread of COVID-19 over the past four months.

“This recession is very different from the last recession,” Trudeau said, adding the 2020 economic problems are related to a health crisis.

“There are going to be really important discussions and political debates about what our economy looks like in the coming years.”

He stated earlier in the briefing that his government was also at work at addressing racial injustices that have been brought to the forefront of conversation following the death of unarmed Black man George Floyd in Minneapolis in May.

Trudeau said fighting discrimination is a top priority and mentioned the need for more capital to help fund racialized entrepreneurs.

The prime minister also faced questions on his involvement in the government’s decision to award the handling of $900-million student grant program to the WE Charity, which has longstanding ties to Trudeau and his family.

“The recommendation to use WE to get opportunities out for young people was made by the public service, but as a cabinet we ratify those decisions,” Trudeau said, adding he did not recuse himself from any cabinet decisions related to the charity.

“I love long worked on youth issues both before I got into politics and since I’ve been in politics.”

Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump and Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador are meeting in Washington, D.C., Wednesday to recognize the ratification of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which replaces NAFTA.

Trudeau had earlier declined the invite from Trump but he was quick to reiterate his concerns over the potential for the Americans to reintroduce aluminum tariffs on Canada.

He once again said the U.S. does not produce enough aluminum to fulfill domestic manufacturing needs and any tariffs against Canada imposed by the Americans would hurt the U.S. economy by adding additional costs to customers.

Trump originally hit Canada with aluminum tariffs in 2018, citing national security concerns.

Most recently, she worked full time as a server at the Chateau Victoria Hotel’s Vista 18 restaurant for two years before being laid off due to the COVID-19 pandemic on March 17.

article continues below

“Growing up in Victoria where the hospitality sector is such an important part of our economy, I always thought that this would be a safe industry to work in,” she said Tuesday during a rally for hotel workers at the legislature. “As long as I worked hard and provided good service, I never worried about the insecurity of losing my job, until now.

“Since being laid off I constantly teeter on what tomorrow’s going to look like with financial burdens and obviously emotionally it’s impacted me heavily, as well.”

Only a few people have been called back to work at Chateau Victoria since the pandemic started, Spiteri said.

“And there’s no word on when the rest of us are going to be brought back to the hotel.”

Spiteri was among about 60 people demonstrating for a legal right to return to their jobs as the recovery from COVID continues. Participants were from Victoria, Vancouver and other parts of the Lower Mainland.

Spiteri said the level of insecurity she is feeling is “overwhelming.”

“I’ve been on [Employment Insurance] for a really, really long time and at this point I’m barely scraping by.”

The industry will eventually improve, she said. “Why won’t the industry promise to bring us back? Why won’t the government make that guarantee for us?”

Spiteri said she and other hotel workers at the rally have built careers in the hospitality industry.

“These aren’t just jobs, they’re a vital part of B.C.’s economy.”

Unite Here Local 40 organized the rally. The union has 6,000 members in B.C., including 500 in the capital region working at establishments such as the Chateau Victoria Hotel and Coast Victoria Hotel and Marina, said Stephanie Fung, union spokesperson. They are among more than 50,000 hotel workers in B.C.

The B.C. Hotel Association is seeking support from all levels of government to keep its businesses — and its jobs — alive, at a time when hotels are not profitable, even if many are open.

Ingrid Jarrett, hotel association chief executive, said it is critical that province extend the temporary layoff provision past the Aug. 30 end date and for the federal government to extend the Canadian Emergency Response Benefit in tandem. It proposes that those supports last until the sector regains 70 per cent of its historic revenues.

The association wants B.C. to allow municipalities to grant property tax relief for hotels.

Without this kind of help, Jarrett predicts a third of B.C.’s hotels could shut down.

“It is a very, very dire time and we have very limited confidence that the summer is actually going to allow many of the businesses to survive.”

B.C. has 83,000 hotel rooms in 1,252 hotels. Of those hotels, 25 per cent remain closed, she said. Those that are open are running at about 30 per cent capacity.

More than 80 per cent of hotels in B.C. are small and medium-sized businesses, she said.

Jarrett would like to see B.C. opened to travellers from elsewhere in Canada this summer.

The association is proposing that B.C. allow meetings and conferences, possibility by fall. They would follow health and safety protocols, and allow attendees from elsewhere in Canada and from international locations where the infection rate is low.

Frank Bourree, tourism consultant and vice-chair of the South Island Prosperity Partnership, pointed to the relationship between jobs and a healthy industry.

“The problem is that very few tourism businesses are going to be up to full capacity in order to bring everybody back, even through the fall. So is there even a job for them to come back to?

“I think it is great that they [workers] are bringing profile to the loss of tourism jobs here but there has to be an employer there to employ them. And the industry is really precarious right now.”

Employees need to be supported until their jobs come back, Bourree said.

Another key factor is that when the temporary layoff period winds up, employers have to pay severance. “For the employers, if they’ve got a huge severance hit, that might push them right over the edge into bankruptcy,” Bourree said.

Tourism represents 10 per cent of the employment base in the capital region, Bourree said.

Greater Victoria hotels are running at about 25 per cent occupancy, down from 80 per cent a year ago, he said.

“Nobody believes that we are going to see international travel into B.C. for the balance of this year.”

Even when a hotel is open, it is unlikely to be profitable, Bourree said. Most open hotels are operating on a “shoestring,” he said.

The challenge locally and within the rest of the province, is that B.C. visitors stay on the weekends and not during the week, meaning the industry is not filling enough rooms. Travellers from elsewhere in Canada and internationally typically stay long and stay during the week, Bourree said.

It’s easy for Canadians to look southward and shake their heads in bemused smugness at the daily penchant of Americans to indulge in conspiracy theories and demonizing of disfavoured segments of society.



But I’m getting a whiff of that attitude here in Canada now. It serves as a reminder how easily irrationality and fear can spark reactions leading to full-blown witch hunts and targeting of the “others.”

The past few days I’ve seen multiple news reports of people reporting cars with U.S. plates. For some, the immediate reaction was to assume the owners of those cars have no right to be where they are, and then make the irrational link that anyone who comes from the U.S. must be dripping with coronavirus that will spread to anything they touch.

article continues below

These fears were stoked by some unfortunate remarks by the premier, which were fortunately walked back by more measured remarks by Dr. Bonnie Henry.

This jump to conclusions affects me personally. Last month, my wife and I moved to Victoria from California. It is a move we have planned for five years and was irretrievably set in motion a year before anyone ever heard of the novel coronavirus.

But now that we are here — thoroughly inspected and interrogated by both CBSA and provincial health officials at the border and after completing our 14-day isolation (which confirmed our symptom-free condition during the three months of lockdown in California) — we are now faced with a very un-Canadian attitude of guilt-by-association for anyone whose car (as does ours) bears U.S. plates.

Leave aside the fact that COVID-19 spreads generally by transmission of fluids during close (usually confined, indoor) contact with someone else; leave aside the fact that wearing a mask and keeping distance are the two most effective ways to avoid transmission, wherever the suspected carrier hails from; leave aside the fact that the incidence of mask-wearing in B.C. seems far below what my wife and I expected and practise ourselves.

The mere fact someone belongs to a “suspect group” (owners of cars with U.S. plates) does not make them public-health pariahs; that is the heart of the conspiracy-driven, fear-mongering in the U.S. we Canadians rightfully disparage.

The news reports invariably actually talk with the car owners and discover that they are here legitimately.

But they fear reprisal from the unthinking, who are quick to grab their pitchfork and call for a witch-burning.

I know my wife and I are concerned about that as well, wondering if our car will be keyed by some anonymous COVID-19 vigilante; that’s why I ask my name not be reproduced with this letter.

While we all need to remain vigilant and compliant in fighting the pandemic, turning on superficial scapegoats without knowing their full story is no solution and just imports northward a different epidemic we should work equally hard to keep out.

The CFL is reportedly looking at playing in a single hub or two hub cities to limit teams' exposure to the virus. But Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious diseases expert at Toronto General Hospital and associate professor of medicine at the University of Toronto, said positive tests remain possible and could threaten play — just like in other leagues.

article continues below

""The short answer is nothing in this era is going to be without risk,"" Bogoch said during a telephone interview. ""There are certain things we can do to minimize the risk but as with anything, there's going to be some element of risk of acquiring this infection.

""The league and players can work with medical professionals to make this as safe as possible but at the end of the day they'll have to sit down collectively and decide, 'Is this worthwhile.' As individuals they'll have to ask themselves, based on the protocols in place and individual risk perception, risk tolerance and risk threshold, 'Am I willing to play?'""

The CFL and CFL Players' Association continue to discuss amendments to their current collective bargaining agreement that would allow for a partial '20 season. The earliest action would begin is September, but commissioner Randy Ambrosie has said a cancelled campaign also remains possible.

In March, the COVID-19 pandemic forced a global shutdown of sports. In Europe, pro soccer has resumed while domestically Major League Soccer, Major League Baseball, the NHL and NBA are all attempting to either restart or open their seasons.

But it hasn't been easy as all four North American circuits have had players or team officials contract the virus. FC Dallas was forced to withdraw from the MLS is Back Tournament in Orlando after 10 players and one coach tested positive.

The NHL hopes to open training camps Monday and resume play in Edmonton and Toronto on Aug. 1. Players would stay in tightly controlled bubbles and play games without fans.

Teams can bring 52 personnel, with no more than 31 players, to their hub. Everyone in the bubble will be tested daily — including players, staff, hotel workers, food service employees and bus drivers.

Players and team officials will remain inside the bubble except in specific extenuating circumstances. That includes medical attention, the birth of a child or death in the family.

Anyone returning to the bubble will be subject to a minimum four-day quarantine with daily nasal swab tests for COVID-19.

The NHL and NHLPA have the ability to delay, postpone, move or cancel games due to a ""risk to player health and safety"" and/or chance that ""the integrity of the competition"" is in jeopardy, including ""an uncontrolled outbreak of COVID-19.""

However, perhaps the biggest challenge the CFL faces is a financial hurdle. Unlike other major sports entities, it doesn't have a billion-dollar TV deal and thus isn't flush with money.

Ambrosie has stated often the nine-team CFL collectively lost $20 million last year. That hardly puts it in an ideal position to cover food and lodging costs for its teams as well as daily testing.

Bogoch said regardless of the measures taken in a hub or bubble, positive test results are inevitable.

""Oh, 100 per cent and there already have been,"" he said. ""If they do proceed, I think the leagues and fans should be aware that anything can happen.

""The leagues could come to a halt should there be an outbreak or safety concern, individuals or teams might be pulled out. Quite frankly, as much as we want to have high expectations we should really lower them. We're in the COVID-19 era, anything can happen.""

No league has said a specific number of positive tests will result in the cancellation of games.

Bogoch said hubs and bubbles are beneficial. With the exception of baseball, the other three North American leagues are going with hub plans.

""First, they reduce the probability of introducing infection within the bubble,"" he said. ""If (infection) is introduced, it really reduces the probability that it can be transmitted.

""If there's infection it will hopefully be rapidly identified because of the high frequency of diagnostic testing and symptom checks. Now, the best-laid plans can still have holes in them but what we've seen with basketball and soccer is these plans work in that they've identified positive cases and players have been isolated. That tells me the safety mechanisms are working and that's fantastic.""

But the mounting positive tests have prompted many to question sport's return before the discovery of a suitable vaccine.

""The key is ensuring if you're going to play pro sports, you're doing it in a safe and ethical manner,"" he said. ""Safety really means player safety, safety of the auxiliary personnel but also public safety as well.

""Ethical manner means you're not drawing resources away from the community in which you're playing. Can that occur while there's still an ongoing push to ensure safety across the country and develop a vaccine and develop programs? I personally think if it's carefully planned out, they can both be done very well.""

Bogoch, a Calgary native, is a recreational hockey player in his spare time. But he also watches at least two CFL games each year: The Labour Day Classic between the Calgary Stampeders and arch-rival Edmonton Eskimos; and Grey Cup.

""That (Labour Day game) is just ingrained in my DNA,"" he said with a chuckle. ""The Labour Day Classic is so quintessential Alberta, it's wonderful.

""There's something so Canadian about (the Grey Cup), it's 40 below in a blizzard and the guys are out on the field. It's just wild.""

While Bogoch appreciates sport isn't a priority for some, he said it can definitely provide a boost for others during a pandemic.

""When we step back and think about what's been happening the last six months and especially since our lockdown in March and throughout our gradual reopening, people have taken a tremendous hit,"" he said. ""We've taken financial hits . . . we've taken emotional and psychological hits by staying at home.

""While some people might say (sport) isn't an essential service and they're correct, I think we can also say professional and amateur sports and other forms of entertainment like the arts are extremely important to the psychological and emotional well-being of our society. This may help provide some intangible benefits as well.""

Mercifully, Bogoch sees light at the end of the COVID-19 pandemic tunnel.

""I think we'll gradually see this start to wind down as vaccines are developed and rolled out globally,"" he said. ""In the best-case scenario it could be as early as late 2020 . . . but more realistically needles will start going into arms in 2021.

""I think the key word there is globally because if there's an infection in one part of the world, there's a problem in all parts of the world. This thing is pretty contagious and people are mobile so we need this vaccine deployed on a global level.""

474,richmond-news,https://www.richmond-news.com/covid-19/high-unemployment-343b-deficit-projected-in-liberals-fiscal-snapshot-1.24166665,"High unemployment, $343B deficit projected in Liberals' fiscal snapshot",[],,"OTTAWA — The Trudeau Liberals say they expect nearly two million Canadians to remain without jobs this year as the COVID-19 pandemic drags down the domestic economy and federal aid sends the deficit to a historic $343.2 billion.

The economic and fiscal ""snapshot"" from the government today lays out the Liberals' belief that there will be a slow return to a new normal, with unemployment high and economic growth low through to at least the end of 2021.

article continues below

Even though the government believes the worst of the economic harm from the pandemic is behind the country, the document says a recovery can't begin in earnest until an effective vaccine or treatment becomes widely available.

Things could, however, get worse under two alternative scenarios the Finance Department lays out.

Should prolonged shutdowns stay in place, or restrictions not fully roll back, a return to normal activity for households and businesses will be uneven and slower than hoped for, leading to a more pronounced drop in economic output than is already expected.

And should the country be hit with a second wave of the novel coronavirus during the annual flu season, the ensuing lockdowns would cause what the Finance Department describes as a ""deeper and longer-lasting negative impact on the economy.""

The Liberals have repeatedly promised to use the federal treasury as a financial shield between Canadians and irreparable harm, and the cost of that promise is now at $231.9 billion in direct spending and a deficit comparable only to those seen in the Second World War.

Whatever the costs, they're worth it, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a news conference Wednesday morning, before the snapshot was released.

""As we measure the cost of helping Canadians, we shouldn't forget that the cost of doing nothing would have been far more,"" Trudeau said, insisting that this is not the time for belt-tightening or austerity.

The document tries to make that case, saying that the $80-billion Canada Emergency Response Benefit, which had paid out $53.5 billion in benefits as of late June, has covered Canadians' estimated $44.6 billion in lost labour income through the first half of the year.

The $2,000-a-month benefit is estimated to have covered the monthly housing, food, phone and internet costs for the bottom and middle thirds of households, according to Finance Department calculations.

Historically low interest rates mean all the hundreds of billions in borrowing comes with ""manageable"" costs, Trudeau said, and the alternative would be for individuals and households to load up with debt themselves to cope with months of no or little work.

Adding to the deficit is a $37.3 billion boost to the federal wage subsidy program to bring its budget to $82.3 billion, signalling an expansion and coming changes to the benefit that covers up to 75 per cent of wages to a maximum of $847 a week for eligible companies.

The Liberals expect more workers to move onto the wage subsidy and off the Canada Emergency Response Benefit as that $80-billion program winds down.

Those who fall through the COVID-19 financial safety net are expected to be caught by the employment insurance system that has been largely dormant since the CERB replaced it in late March.

Government officials admit there will still need to be policy changes to the EI system to help some self-employed workers qualify, and capture EI-eligible workers who, due to the pandemic, haven't been able to work the necessary qualifying hours.

For this calendar year, the government expects the unemployment rate to hit 9.8 per cent, dropping to 7.8 per cent next year based on forecasts by 13 private sector economists.

Although that's a bump from the record-high unemployment rate of 13.7 per cent in May for a labour force of just over 19 million, it is still almost double the record low of 5.5 per cent pre-pandemic.

The document doesn't contain the five-year forecast traditionally part of federal budgets owing to the uncertain path the pandemic will take and the state of the economy beyond that.

""Even when the pandemic is over, lasting consequences may cast a long-term shadow over economic developments, for example via more indebted businesses and households, persistent unemployment and substantial structural changes in the economy that have been accelerated through the crisis,"" the government's update says.

""In the coming months and as needed the government will announce measures to support the recovery.""

Opposition parties had wanted Morneau to provide a road map for reshaping emergency aid measures that are set to expire in the fall and keeping spending and deficits under control.

In his own morning news conference, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said the Liberals mishandled the COVID-19 pandemic by being slow to close borders and by instituting too-rigid emergency aid programs.

Canada can't afford for the Liberals to mishandle the economy as well, he said, by keeping benefits in place that remove incentives to go back to work while the novel coronavirus remains a risk.

""Liberals put all their faith in government, Conservatives put our faith in people,"" Scheer said.

He said the Liberals should take up a Conservative proposal to offer a ""back to work bonus"" and send more money to the federal auditor general so her office can study the government's spending more closely.

Next week, the Bank of Canada is to again update its forecasts when it releases a monetary policy report along with a scheduled interest-rate announcement.

Last month, the central bank said it expected a decline between 10 and 20 per cent in the second quarter compared with the fourth quarter of 2019. That is an improvement from the 15-to-30-per-cent drop in the quarter highlighted in the bank's worst-case scenario in April.

There were no new deaths and there remain 16 people in hospital, with four of those in intensive care units.

article continues below

That makes 2,990 people who have tested positive for the virus that has caused a global pandemic since COVID-19 first appeared in B.C. in late January.

Of those, 183 people have died, 2,645 people have recovered and 162 people are still battling the disease. Most infected patients are self-isolating at home.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,013 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1,576 in Fraser Health;

• 133 in Island Health;

• 203 in Interior Health; and

• 65 in Northern Health.

""There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks and the outbreak at Tabor Home has now been declared over,"" B.C. Health Minister Adrian Dix and provincial health officer Bonnie Henry said in a joint statement on July 7.

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreaks at Tabor and at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred to those homes from the hospital.

""While there are no active community outbreaks in B.C., new cases and community exposure events continue to occur in the community,"" Dix and Henry said.

""There has been a new community exposure event at Hotel Belmont bar and nightclub in the Vancouver Coastal Health region. Public health teams have issued an alert for anyone who may have been at the premises on June 27 and June 29.""

B.C. is estimated to have a population of about 5,190,000 people so it has so far had about one case of COVID-19 for every 1,735 residents, or 0.576 people per 1,000 residents. That compares with Washington State's estimated population of 7,615,000 people and 36,970 cases, for about one case of COVID-19 for every 206 people, or 4.85 people per 1,000 residents.

B.C.'s death rate, however, at more than 6.1%, is slightly higher than other jurisdictions.

Washington State, with 1,384 deaths, has a 3.7% death rate for COVID-19 patients.

Johns Hopkins University's Centre for Systems Science and Engineering has recorded 11,712,663 COVID-19 cases and 540,582 deaths globally, for a death rate of slightly more than 4.6%.

The record high of 10,028 new cases in Texas served as another alarming new measure of the swift resurgence of COVID-19 nationwide and the failures of the country’s response. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas aggressively began one of America’s fastest reopenings in May but has begun reversing course in recent weeks, ordering bars closed and mandating face coverings.

article continues below

New York and Florida are the only other states to record more than 10,000 new cases in a single day. New York hit that grim total back in April, when New York City hospitals were overwhelmed and hundreds of people were dying every day. Florida topped 10,000 confirmed cases last week.

The record mark in Texas partly reflects a lag in testing results from the Fourth of July weekend, when newly reported cases were far below what Texas has seen in recent weeks. But Abbott said the numbers should still be ""an alarm bell for everybody"" who is skeptical about whether the virus is a threat.

""We have rapid spread of COVID-19 in the state of Texas right now,"" Abbott told San Antonio television station KENS.

Later in the interview, Abbott was noncommittal about whether he would attend his own party's convention next week in Houston, which the Texas GOP has remained bent on holding even as the mayor, doctors and businesses pressure the party to cancel. Houston has emerged as one of the nation's hot zones in the pandemic. However, Republican activists, some of whom have called the fears overblown, have resolved to press forward with the indoor three-day convention.

Texas surged past 8,000 statewide hospitalizations for the first time over the long holiday weekend — a more than quadruple increase on the past month. On Tuesday, the number of hospitalizations soared past 9,000. Texas also set a new high for deaths in a single day with 60.

Mayors in some of the biggest cities in the state and U.S. — including Austin, San Antonio and Houston — have warned that hospitals could soon become overwhelmed with coronavirus patients. Along the Texas-Mexico border, some cities imposed curfew orders in hopes of cutting down on large parties or social gatherings as cases have skyrocketed.

""Many of us are running at capacity and have created new wards,"" said Todd Mann, the chief executive officer at McAllen Medical Center, which on Tuesday had more than 130 coronavirus patients taking up more than half of the facility's beds. ""The physical space is obviously limited, and most of the hospitals are running out of that pretty quickly.""

The record count was reported on a day that also saw the State Fair of Texas cancelled for the the first time since World War II. Fair organizers said the event, which draws more than a million visitors to Dallas each fall, was not feasible during the pandemic.

It also came as President Donald Trump leaned on governors to reopen schools this fall, arguing that some are keeping schools closed not because of the risks from the coronavirus pandemic but for political reasons. Texas education officials announced Tuesday that face coverings will be mandatory for students older than 10 years old and that school districts must offer on-campus learning to any family that wants their child in a classroom.

Deaths remain lower in Texas compared to other big states. As of Tuesday, Texas has confirmed that at least 2,715 people have died due to COVID-19. But fatalities have climbed in recent days, and in addition to an alarming acceleration in new cases in Texas, the seven-day infection rate has climbed to 13.5%.

The number of infections is likely far higher because many people haven't been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected without feeling sick.

Two separate photos of the bare-faced party leader sitting comfortably in a waiting area circulated online but his office says he was wearing a mask for his trip.

A spokesperson said the photos must have been taken after he doffed the covering to take a call but before he put it back on.

Toronto's Pearson airport currently has a policy that masks must be worn at all times to curb the spread of COVID-19, with limited exceptions that include being at a food or beverage service location.

The photos shows Scheer in the lounge with several others, and while they are seated spaced apart, none is wearing a mask.

In April, Scheer was criticized for bringing his family on a government flight back to Ottawa for a House of Commons sitting, reducing the ability for the other two MPs on board to keep a distance from the Scheers.

He and other party leaders have been wearing masks around Parliament Hill. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also wears them during photo ops.

Scheer is the waning days of his leadership. The ballots to select his replacement go in the mail in the coming days and a new leader will be elected in late August.

Up to 90 centres across the country will gradually reopen in July, starting with 14 on Wednesday. Further openings are to be guided by public health advice as well as how many Canadians each centre serves.

article continues below

The government has spent the past few weeks upgrading the centres to put up clear barriers at counters, signs to encourage physical distancing and reduce seating in waiting areas.

Personal protective equipment will also be provided to staff at centres that reopen.

Face masks will be offered to people visiting centres in provinces or municipalities that have mandated their use in indoor public spaces.

Anyone going to a centre that doesn't fall under any such provincial or municipal requirement will be encouraged to wear a masks and use hand-sanitizer.

While the newly reopened centres will handle queries for social insurance numbers, employment insurance and the Canada Pension Plan among others, the government says passport and biometrics services won't be available at first.

Days after public health authorities closed businesses and ordered workers to stay home to slow the spread of COVID-19, the Liberals closed the sprawling network of Service Canada centres.

Some of the offices, such as one tucked inside Ottawa's city hall, had already started to close before the official announcement in March as confirmed cases of COVID-19 increased and workers were needed elsewhere, or resisted going in.

The government says an online Service Canada portal opened in response to the closures has seen more than 700,000 requests. That's about half the number of in-person visits Service Canada locations would see in the same period in normal times.

In a release, the government is still urging Canadians to use online services wherever possible, including to book appointments online for in-person help.

The network of 318 Service Canada centres, along with almost 250 more outreach centres, received about 8.4 million visits during the 12-month period between April 2018 and March 2019. The figure, noted in a recently posted evaluation of federal services, included over 1.9 million people walking in to use a self-service kiosk.

Central 1 says it expects home sales to recover marginally in 2020 and 2021 after tumbling by 55 per cent between mid-March and April.

article continues below

Deputy chief economist Brian Yu says despite values plunging to levels not seen since the early 1980s, home prices have stayed firm because fewer properties were available for sale.

He predicts median prices could rebound to about $710,000 before slipping to around $540,000 late this year or early in 2021.

Yu says unemployment, business and health concerns will further weaken the market, while population growth, which has traditionally propped up the sector in B.C., will slow to a trickle next year, dampening sales.

He says a second wave of COVID-19 has the potential to shave home prices by 15 per cent as more owners already hit by the pandemic's first wave are forced to sell during a second downturn.

The report released Tuesday notes positive developments as B.C. enters the third phase of its recovery plan including restarts in the accommodation, spa, film and television industries.

Vacancy rates could also climb as high as three per cent over the next year, writes Yu, ""providing an opportune time for renters to negotiate rental rates before the market tightens up again.""

Housing starts are forecast to slump 33 per cent in 2020 and remain flat in 2021, which ""set the stage for a housing supply shortage in coming years,"" the report says.

The timing of a second wave and its impact on the economy would draw out the effect on the housing market, potentially carrying into 2022, it says.

Summer is officially here, with sunny weather, full ferries, and a few statutory holidays thrown in for good measure. As much as it feels like the perfect time to relax and have fun, please continue taking every measure to prevent a COVID-19 outbreak on the Coast. We don’t have to look very far south to see what can happen if we are not careful, and we need to keep working together to keep our community safe.

While there have been some welcome changes with Phase 3 of our provincial Restart Plan, it is important to remember that all of the other personal and business recommendations from Phase 2 remain in place. Phase 3 is not a return to normal and we should all continue to act as though COVID-19 is still here.

This means that businesses should be following Public Health and Worksafe BC guidelines to ensure the safety of employees and customers. This includes limiting the number of people on premises at any one time, ensuring adequate spacing, and the use of masks and barriers when physical spacing is not possible. Please respect our businesses who are doing their very best to ensure the safety of everyone who enters.

In our local health-care facilities, visitors are allowed, but are restricted to essential visits only. For the hospital, each patient may have one visitor at a time for a maximum of two hours per visitor. For our long-term care facilities, residents may have one designated person who is able to visit. Virtual visits are allowed at all facilities, and tablets are available for residents and patients who do not have access otherwise.

For individuals, our recommendations remain the same:

• Maintain physical distancing with people outside of your household (or your very limited family/friend bubble), and wear a mask whenever you can’t maintain a distance of at least two metres.

• Wash your hands frequently, especially after touching high contact surfaces.

Do not touch your face unless you have just washed your hands, and make sure you wash your hands after touching your face.

• Avoid large groups if you can, especially indoors. If you do meet up with others, please meet up outside whenever possible and maintain physical distancing.

In a forecast released today, the organization says the Canadian unemployment rate is projected to have peaked at 11 per cent in the quarter ended June 30, surpassing the previous peak of 8.7 per cent for the third quarter of 2009.

It says jobs should return as lockdowns end, but it still expects an unemployment rate of 7.7 per cent by the end of 2021 in a single-hit scenario and 8.4 per cent if there is a second wave of infections.

The report said the average unemployment rate among the OECD countries could rise as high as 12.6 per cent in the fourth quarter of this year in a double-hit scenario.

Under the single-hit scenario, the average unemployment rate would hit 11.4 per cent in the second quarter of this year before declining to 9.4 per cent in the fourth quarter.

That's up from 5.3 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2019 before the pandemic froze the global economy.

But just three weeks before Green and her family were set to fly from Edmonton to Sydney, N.S., on July 17, WestJet announced it was ending its policy of leaving the middle seats on its flights empty.

article continues below

""I was devastated,"" Green said, noting her family spends every summer in Nova Scotia with her 93-year-old grandmother who is suffering from severe dementia and another family member with an incurable form of cancer.

""We all knew it could very well be the last summer we would spend with them.""

When Green called WestJet to see if any accommodations could be made, she told the company she has a heart condition that puts her in the high-risk category for COVID-19.

Despite her pleas, Green said the airline told her it was unable to make any special accommodations, nor would it allow her to change the date of the flight to before July 1, when the rules were relaxed, without paying a fee.

And Green's not alone: as provinces begin to relax domestic travel restrictions, the cessation of physical distancing rules by two of Canada's biggest airlines — WestJet and Air Canada — is causing frustration and grief among some passengers.

Gabor Lukacs, head of the advocacy group Air Passenger Rights Canada, said he has fielded countless complaints from passengers during the COVID-19 pandemic, many of which are related to the same issues: airlines refusing to offer refunds or accommodations amid the abolition of physical distancing rules.

While he acknowledges the effort to fill seats is due to airlines attempting to recoup billions in lost revenue, Lukacs argues the companies risk deterring customers from flying at all.

""The question is: do we allow economic considerations to override public health? We don't allow supermarkets to sell spoiled meat because it's cheaper. Are we going to allow doctors to skip disinfecting their tools to save the cost?""

There's some evidence he's right: a new poll conducted by Leger and the Association of Canadian Studies found 72 per cent of respondents say they are not comfortable flying now that Air Canada and WestJet have culled their seat distancing policies.

Only 22 per cent said they would be OK with flying under the newly relaxed rules.

In response to criticisms, WestJet forwarded The Canadian Press a statement from a July 3 blog post regarding changes to its seat distancing policy.

""The blocked middle seat was introduced at the beginning of the pandemic before the myriad of safety measures were put in place and mandated on board,"" the statement reads.

""Seat distancing was never intended to be in place permanently or throughout the pandemic.""

The post notes a number of measures WestJet has taken to help stop the spread of COVID-19 on its flights, including mandatory masking, pre-boarding questionnaires for all passengers, temperature screening, thorough cleaning of aircraft between flights, and the restriction of in-flight dining services.

However, the company has also denied it's putting passengers and staff at risk by filling flights up, pointing to other safety measures as mitigating the risk of spreading COVID-19.

Air Canada provided a similar statement, acknowledging the inconvenience the change may have caused to customers.

""While we would all like a single measure that reduces risk, we are left to use a combination of approaches to mitigate risk as far as practical,"" the airline said.

Yet some passengers report first-hand experiences in which masking protocols were not followed.

Maureen Isabel Green, 31, flew from Vancouver to Fredericton three weeks ago with Air Canada to visit her family, and said she was shocked by the lax use of masks by both airport employees and the passengers on her two connecting flights.

""I just think of all the people who are getting on a flight and risking their life, or risking the life of the people they're going to visit, because some people don't want to wear a mask for a few hours,"" she said.

Green, who is a health-care worker, said there were numerous instances on her flight from Vancouver to Montreal where a group of young, male passengers took off their masks when flight attendants were not present.

While at the Montreal airport, Green said a man was able to board a flight without wearing a mask, simply by telling attendants he had a medical condition that prevented him from doing so.

Air travel has been at the centre of several headline-grabbing incidents throughout the pandemic — particularly since travel restrictions have been eased in some regions.

On July 2, health authorities in B.C. warned the passengers of four separate flights that they may have been exposed to COVID-19.

Just a day before — on the exact day the airlines ended their social distancing policies — the Nova Scotia Health Authority warned passengers of a Toronto-to-Halifax WestJet flight from the previous week that they may have been exposed to COVID-19.

And on Sunday, a Halifax man reportedly walked off of a St. John's-bound flight after learning he was the only passenger travelling within the so-called ""Atlantic bubble,"" sparking discussion about the effectiveness of airlines' COVID-prevention policies.

The YMCA Canada, the Boys and Girls Clubs of Canada and the Royal Canadian Legion are among those that say they are facing severe financial difficulties and been forced to permanently close some locations even as demand for their services has increased.

article continues below

A YMCA facility permanently closed its doors in Yarmouth, N.S., because of the pandemic while the Boys and Girls Clubs shuttered its operations in Edson, Alta. The legion has seen three halls close for good in Ontario and one in New Brunswick.

While the fear is those are just the beginning, the government is also being warned that failing to help now could cost more in the long run as organizations that provide child care, emergency food support and other social services disappear.

""The problem is the bill will come due later,"" said Boys and Girls Clubs of Canada president Owen Charters. ""Because as these organizations disappear, the social safety net becomes a tax burden where the government needs to step in and provide those services directly.""

The sector began to bang the drums with alarm at the end of March as Canadians started to realize the pandemic would last longer than a couple of weeks and donations and other sources of income such as the provision of child care started to dry up.

Dozens of charities signed a letter on March 25 asking Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his government for financial aid to prevent ""irreparable damage,"" particularly at a time when more people needed their services.

Ottawa has since included the sector in some of its COVID-19 supports such as wage-subsidy and rent-deferral programs. It also created a $350-million fund for organizations to provide emergency assistance to Canadians during the pandemic.

While welcome, those interviewed say the already-announced federal programs and funding fall far short.

""What we need is direct supports to make sure Ys can survive the crisis,"" YMCA Canada president Peter Dinsdale said. ""There is a real need for sector stabilization. It's not just YMCAs in this country. It is Boys and Girls Clubs, the United Way. So many entities out there require support.""

The government has been told as much numerous times, with letters written and phone calls made. Yet those interviewed say there has yet to be a real response. That silence has sparked concern and frustration.

""We sent off two letters,"" said Royal Canadian Legion dominion president Tom Irvine. ""There was no acknowledgment of receiving the letters or nothing. So I'm pretty discouraged at this time, but still hopeful. This is a Canadian institution and if we don't do something, we could lose it.""

Social Development Minister Ahmed Hussen's spokeswoman Jessica Eritou on Tuesday praised the work of the charitable and non-profit sector and touted the $350-million emergency fund, which organizations say does not address the core of their concerns.

""We are continuing to look at ways to work with charities and non-profits supporting Canadians during the crisis,"" she added.

""We continue discussions with organizations to help support the important work they're doing in communities across the country and we will keep looking for the most effective ways to help Canadians during this unprecedented crisis.""

Cardus, a charity that does research on the non-profit sector, released a paper on Tuesday urging the federal government to start matching donations from Canadians to different organizations using money set aside to cover the costs of a tax credit for Canadians who donate.

But Dinsdale and Charters said matching programs will still leave many organizations struggling, and that the only real solution is direct federal support to help the sector weather the pandemic and continue providing essential services.

A lack of safe places for children to be while their parents work is an obstacle to economic recovery, economists have warned, particularly for women.

""While the federal government's been focused on macro-economic approaches like the wage subsidy, like CERB and other initiatives, they have ignored this sector,"" said Dinsdale, whose organization runs child-care centres across the country.

""And they've ignored this sector at the risk of not having the most critical social services available to Canadians as the economy reopens.""

The figure is the upper range of the scenarios the budget watchdog was asked to research as part of a report released Tuesday morning as policy-makers consider how to shape emergency supports set to expire in the fall.

article continues below

Planned federal spending to date on pandemic-related aid now tops about $174 billion, in a range of programs meant to provide a financial floor for individuals and businesses.

The idea of giving a government-guaranteed basic income to Canadians has gained steam as millions have watched their jobs or earnings evaporate in the COVID-19 pandemic.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau and other senior cabinet ministers have repeatedly been asked by senators and MPs about the concept. Advocates argue that it would be an expansion of the $80-billion Canada Emergency Response Benefit for workers who saw their incomes crash.

The CERB and a $45-billion wage-subsidy program are set to expire in October.

Providing six months of a basic income starting that month could cost between $47.5 billion and $98.1 billion, depending on how much of the benefit is clawed back from people whose other incomes increase.

Budget officer Yves Giroux's report says the average benefit to Canadians aged 18 to 64 would range between $4,500 and $4,800, with the number of recipients depending on the phase-out rate.

Sen. Yuen Pau Woo, who asked for the costing, said a basic-income program could fill in the gaps in Canada's social safety nets, a patchwork largely run by provinces, that have been exposed by the pandemic.

""It's a huge undertaking to launch a basic income for the whole country on a permanent basis. The costs are extremely high and the political resistance is likely to be fierce, but we are in a period where it is likely we will have to spend large sums of money on income support going into the balance of 2020 and into 2021,"" Woo said in a telephone interview.

""The question to my mind is how we spend it, and in what form.""

A basic income means different things to different people, but it is usually viewed as a no-strings-attached benefit that governments provide to citizens instead of various targeted social benefits.

Also known as a guaranteed minimum income, it can be delivered as a universal payment, or as a means-tested benefit that declines as a recipient's other income rises.

Giroux's report says the government could repeal $15 billion in tax measures to offset the overall cost of a basic-income program, which Woo added would likely have to wrap in existing measures to avoid duplication.

The overall cost of the program might be higher than the budget office estimates. The PBO's estimates rely on some Statistics Canada income data that doesn't include people living in the northern territories or in First Nations, or some military members.

Nor can the figures simply be doubled to determine a full year's cost because that might overstate the financial impact. The economy appears to be bouncing back slowly from a bottoming-out in April, and the cost of the program would depend on how many employees are rehired or find new jobs.

The Canadian Federation of Independent Business, which represents small businesses nationwide, said Tuesday that about one-third of members responding to a survey reported being back at full staffing levels, but suggested many believe it will take six months to get back to normal profitability.

Statistics Canada is to release June's jobs report on Friday.

Projections released Tuesday by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development estimate Canada's unemployment rate at 11 per cent for the second quarter of the year.

The 37-member international body predicted the national unemployment rate would decline to 7.7 per cent by the end of the year, or to 8.4 per cent should a second wave of the novel coronavirus force renewed lockdowns.

NDP finance critic Peter Julian said Tuesday that the uncertain economic path ahead requires the Liberals to say how the government plans to reshape emergency aid in Wednesday's fiscal update.

He said a more universal benefit, which the NDP has pushed, would have helped more people and cost less had the Liberals used it from the start.

""It makes more sense to make sure that everybody who needs the benefit can actually get it than the government's approach,"" Julian said.

The Liberals have said the update on Wednesday will provide an economic outlook, an accounting of spending to date and projections for the remainder of the fiscal year, including the expected deficit. The PBO and others estimate that to be at least $250 billion.

Seventy-two per cent of Canadians surveyed by Leger and the Association for Canadian Studies say they're not comfortable flying since a decision by some airlines to relax their own in-flight physical distancing requirements.

article continues below

As of July 1, Air Canada and WestJet both ended policies blocking the sale of adjacent seats.

The measure was seen to align with a guidance document for the aviation industry issued by Transport Canada in April to help curb the spread of COVID-19.

Among other things, the department had suggested passengers should be widely spaced when possible, though they did not make it mandatory.

Airlines, however, are required to make passengers and air crews wear masks.

Only 22 per cent of those surveyed said they're comfortable getting aboard with no in-flight physical distancing and a requirement to wear masks.

There's more to it to keep flights safe, WestJet said in a statement last week after critics attacked its plan.

""What makes an airplane, and the entire journey, safe is the layers of enhanced cleaning, the wearing of masks and the hospital-grade HEPA filters that remove 99.999 per cent of all airborne particles,"" the airline said.

""The hygiene standards we have now are world-class and backed by industry experts.""

Critics have also previously pounced on the airlines for another move: refusing to fully refund tickets for flights cancelled due to the pandemic.

Thousands of people have beseeched Transport Minister Marc Garneau to compel airlines to issue refunds, but he has refused, arguing that mandating reimbursements from a sector that's lost more than 90 per cent of its revenue would cripple the industry.

But 72 per cent of those polled say they totally oppose his decision.

In lieu of refunds, the airlines have offered vouchers but the poll suggests that it may take a while before people will rebook previously cancelled trips: 85 per cent of those surveyed told pollsters they have no plans to travel outside the country by the end of the year.

The survey polled 1,517 people and can't be assigned a margin of error because online polls are not considered truly random.

Pollsters were in the field between July 3 and 5, a historically popular few days for Canadians and Americans to be on the move between the two countries, given the July 1 Canada Day holiday and the U.S.'s July 4 Independence Day.

But the border remains closed to non-essential traffic, and the majority of Canadians surveyed said they feel it needs to stay that way. The current mutual closure agreement is due to expire July 21.

Of Canadians polled, 86 per cent said they totally disagreed with re-opening the border at the end of July, allowing Americans back into the country.

Americans seem more eager both to head north and to welcome Canadians south; 50 per cent agreed the border should re-open and 36 per cent disagreed.

The potential for cross-border transmission of the virus has been a key factor in the decision to keep the border closed. Currently, rates of COVID-19 infection in the U.S. continue to climb, while in Canada the curve appears to be on a downward trajectory nearly everywhere.

Still, the survey suggests Canadians don't feel they are out of the woods. Thirty-nine per cent believe the worst is yet to come, while 35 per cent believe the worst of the crisis has passed.

In the U.S., 42 per cent of those surveyed felt the darkest days are ahead, 25 per cent believe the U.S. is in the middle of the worst part now while 21 per cent think that's already passed.

The spike in deaths includes one death in June but which only recently was confirmed to be a result of the COVID-19 virus, Henry said.

""To lose six people, all in long-term care, over the last three days is a source of enormous grief,"" said BC Health Minister Adrian Dix.

There have been no new outbreaks in B.C. since Friday. There were 31 new confirmed cases since Friday, bringing the total number of cases to 2,978. Of that number, 2,629 people have recovered, leaving 166 active cases in B.C.

There are currently three long-term care facilities in B.C. with active cases of COVID-19, and one acute care facility.

Responding to a spike in cases in Seattle, and the question of whether public demonstrations may have contributed to the uptick, Henry was asked whether any cases in B.C. have been traced to large anti-racism public protests that took place in Vancouver in June. She said it appears those large gatherings did not result in any spread of the virus.

""Currently, we do not have any cases that have been associated with the protests that took place,"" Henry said. ""In talking with my colleagues in the U.S., they also have not seen surges related to those activities.""

The fact the protests were held outside may be one of the factors that limited the potential spread of the virus.

Henry, health authorities and long term care operators have been working together to relax the restrictions on visitations in long term care homes. Given the recent spike in deaths, Henry was asked if that did not raise concerns about reintroducing the virus into care homes.

She conceded that, once the virus is in a care home, the potential for it to kill elderly people is high.

""The good news is that we have reduced the amount of transmission in our community so much so that we have very people in hospital,"" she said. ""We have very few people who are transmitting in our community, and that's why we feel we're at that balance where we need to allow more people to go into long-term care.""

The league and its union announced Monday the two sides have hammered out a tentative deal on the return-to-play protocol as well as a memorandum of understanding on a four-year extension of the current collective bargaining agreement.

article continues below

The NHL board of governors, the NHLPA's executive board and full membership must now ratify the documents, which are tied together, in three separate votes. If the proposals get the green light, training camps would begin July 13, with the 24 teams set to resume heading to the two Canadian hub cities on July 26. Competitive game action would then commence Aug. 1.

The league has yet to announce the two hubs for its return-to-play plan this summer, but Toronto and Edmonton are the destinations, a person with direct knowledge of the decision told The Associated Press.

The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because the league and the NHLPA have not released this information. The person said the league is in part being cautious and allowing itself flexibility in the event of potential spikes in COVID-19 infections in not yet determining which cities will host the conference finals and Stanley Cup final.

Hashed out in the shadow of unprecedented economic conditions brought on by COVID-19 — and viewed as crucial for a resumption of play — the proposed CBA would bring at least 14 consecutive years of NHL-NHLPA harmony after lockouts wiped out the 2004-05 season, and cut the 1994-95 and 2012-13 campaigns to 48 games.

While details of the CBA, which would last through the 2025-26 season, weren't made public Monday, it's believed the salary cap, escrow payments from players to owners, and Olympic participation all figure prominently. Escrow, which guarantees a 50-50 split of hockey-related revenues, was a thorny issue for players before the pandemic significantly impacted the league's bottom line when the schedule was suspended March 12.

Getting back to the Olympics has also been a priority for players. The NHL, which would still have to negotiate with the International Olympic Committee, skipped the 2018 Winter Games after participating in five straight between 1998 and 2014.

The league and players unveiled the 24-team format for a resumption of play in late May.

The plan to resuscitate the season calls for players to be segregated from the general population in tightly-controlled ""bubbles"" — games will be played without fans — in hopes of keeping the coronavirus at bay. The NHL, which will test everyone inside the bubble daily, has consistently maintained one or more positive results wouldn't necessarily derail the restart.

The NHL and the NHLPA outlined extensive health and safety measures for training camps and resumption of play Monday — referred to as Phase 3 and Phase 4, respectively, of its return-to-play plan — in two documents totalling 47 pages.

Teams will be allowed to bring 52 personnel, with no more than 31 players, to its hub. Every person in the bubble will be subject to daily testing, including players, staff, hotel workers, food service employees and bus drivers. Every team member/player inside the bubble will be expected to remain there except in specific extenuating circumstances, including medical attention, the birth of a child or a death in the family.

Anyone returning to the bubble will be subject to a minimum four-day quarantine with daily nasal swab tests for COVID-19.

While the league is encouraging physical distancing at all times, players won't be required to wear masks when exercising or on the ice. The same goes for coaches behind the bench and off-ice officials. Masks are required to be worn inside the bubble by any individual not in their hotel room.

The NHL and NHLPA have the ability to delay, postpone, move or cancel games in the event there's a ""risk to player health and safety"" and/or a chance that ""the integrity of the competition"" is in jeopardy, including ""an uncontrolled outbreak of COVID-19.""

There is not, however, any specifics as to what would constitute ""an uncontrolled outbreak.""

Individuals leaving the bubble without permission may be subject to consequences up to and including removal from Phase 4. Teams could also be hit with steep punishments, including fines and/or loss of draft choices.

Players are allowed to opt out of Phase 3 and Phase 4 without penalty, but have to notify their team this week.

Vancouver, Las Vegas, Chicago, Columbus, Dallas, Los Angeles, Pittsburgh and Minneapolis/St. Paul were the other cities originally in the running to be hubs.

The NHL is looking to restart its season with a blueprint that includes eight best-of-five qualifying round series before pivoting to the typical 16-team playoffs. It's hoped the Stanley Cup, which has been awarded all but twice since 1893, will be handed out sometime in the fall.

Las Vegas was viewed as a hub front-runner because its massive hotel complexes could be more-easily secured in a bubble scenario until a recent surge in COVID-19 cases across large swaths of the United States — the death toll there currently stands at more than 130,000 people — likely made the destination far less appealing.

But despite Monday's good news, there remain difficult waters to navigate.

The league and NHLPA will not quarantine players during training camp, but instead ask they stay home when not at the rink in hopes isolation and testing will be enough to avoid any outbreaks.

Of the 396 NHLers tested at team facilities between June 8 and July 6 during voluntary workouts as part of Phase 2 protocols, 23 results — in the neighbourhood of six per cent — came back positive. The league said it's also aware of 12 other positive tests for players not taking part in Phase 2.

The Tampa Bay Lightning closed their practice facility last month after three players and additional staff members tested positive for COVID-19. Of the 24 teams poised to resume play, 18 are located in the U.S., including current virus hot spots like Florida, Texas and Arizona.

Four clubs previously confirmed 10 positive tests in the spring, with five coming from the Ottawa Senators, three from the Colorado Avalanche, and one each from the Pittsburgh Penguins and Boston Bruins.

Five questions with Lessner Gomez, director, Cuba Tourist Board, Toronto office.

How did COVID-19 impact tourism in Cuba?

Like other tourist destinations around the world, Cuba closed to international travel because of the Corona Virus. Cuba is now ready to slowly open to visitors.

In order to control and isolate any possible infection, Cuba has reopened its doors in Cayo Largo, Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo, Cayo Santa María and Cayo Cruz effective July 1.

Cuba is beginning to reopen to tourism. Who are the first international visitors Cuba will be expecting?

Cuba is looking forward to welcoming travellers from Canada and Europe. We have enjoyed a special relationship with Canada for over forty years.

We look forward to welcoming Canada back to our beautiful beaches.

How important are Canadians to tourism in Cuba?

Historically Canada has always been the biggest international inbound market for Cuba.

What does the future hold for Cuba and are there any trends we can look forward to?

As with the rest of the world, the future is hard to predict, but we are very positive.

Cuba enjoys a world class health system with particular expertise in the treatment of diseases of the lungs. In fact, throughout this pandemic we have offered medical support to countries around the world.

We believe we can offer tourists from Canada the confidence to return to our wonderful destinations and we look forward to welcoming them.

We believe that by opening gradually, tourist will feel comfortable with our planning and slowly we can begin to open other parts of our country.

What enhanced safety measures have been put in place to ensure visitors to resorts, hotels and attractions will be safe?

Over the past few months, the Cuban government has focused its efforts on the battle against the pandemic.

During this time, government officials took steps to improve all hotels and tourism infrastructure. Hygiene and sanitary protocols were put in place in order to ensure the safety of the Cuban people and its international visitors, as tourism activities are reactivated.

Hygiene and sanitary protocols will be practiced from the first phase, for example:

In order to operate, tourist facilities must obtain government certification called: Most hygienic and safest tourism (T + HS).

Workers with respiratory symptoms will not be allowed on resort premises and anyone with symptoms will be immediately directed to a health center.

International tourist circulation will only take place at the cayos (islands) where tourists enjoy their holidays.

Excursions will be offered only at the cayos for the international market.

The nautical activities and operations at international marinas of tourist centers approved for international tourism are reactivated.

As approved by the Cuban Ministry of Public Health, in the second phase, foreign tourists will undergo the PCR test free of charge upon their arrival in the country.

The ferry company announced July 3 that starting on July 10 two round trips would be added to the schedule on Fridays and Sundays – a 4:20 and 6:40 p.m. departure from Langdale and a 3:15 p.m. and 5:30 p.m. departure from Horseshoe Bay.

article continues below

BC Ferries is also adding more trips on other busy routes, including Horseshoe Bay-Nanaimo.

The addition of more sailings comes as local governments are calling for a return to a full summer schedule and travellers continue to voice frustration online.

In a lengthy post on her Facebook page July 3, Sechelt Mayor Darnleda Siegers asked residents upset with the current level of service, short-notice schedule changes, and problems rebooking reservations to “cut [BC Ferries] some slack.”

“Behind the glitches and the mistakes are humans just like you and I and they are trying as best they can,” she wrote.

But Siegers is also urging Coasters to lobby the province and the federal government for more financial support for BC Ferries.

“BC Ferries needs financial assistance from the provincial and federal government as they are using their capital funds, previously earmarked for the Langdale ferry upgrade and our second ship and other capital expenditures, to cover off their operating costs,” said Siegers.

Siegers also called the $180,000 the provincial government has already committed to keep sailings from being cut on minor routes, including Earls Cove-Saltery Bay, “a drop in the bucket.”

“There is some money earmarked for B.C. from the federal government that will be provided within the next while,” she said. “I’d like to see some of it go to BC Ferries.”

The money Siegers is referring to is part of a $14-billion “safe restart agreement” between Ottawa and the provinces.

West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast-Sea to Sky Country MP Patrick Weiler has also suggested that agreement could be the source of funding to backstop BC Ferries against the financial losses caused by the sudden drop in ridership in the early phase of the pandemic.

“I believe that one of the areas that they want to make sure that funding is going to go towards is transit, which has been very much hit hard by the pandemic similar to BC Ferries, which could also be an option for that funding,” Weiler said during a June 23 update for the Sechelt and District Chamber of Commerce.

In response to Coast Reporter’s inquiry to the premier’s office about the status of the discussions on the safe restart agreement and whether some of the money would be used to support a return to normal service levels on BC Ferries, officials with the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure replied that the government is “pleased to see the federal government agreeing to provide much-needed support for a variety of important provincial issues.”

“However, the number and size of programs that have been included in this list is substantial,” the email from the ministry continued. “So we look forward to seeing the details to make sure it can adequately support our recovery efforts.”

On the specific issue of BC Ferries the ministry said, “We know ferries are vital for maintaining the critical supply chain for food, goods and medicine, and for people who live and work on our coast, and continue to work with the federal government on solutions.”",[]

“We’re looking forward to it,” said library director Heather Evans-Cullen an hour before Monday’s official 10 a.m. opening. “If I could have a ribbon cutting or slab cake, I would.”

article continues below

At least five people had already arrived before opening hours, she said. Hours of operation are now Monday to Saturday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.

Doors may finally be open again but operations are far from normal. For the first two weeks, a maximum of 20 patrons will be allowed inside at any given time, “to make sure we can maintain distancing,” said Evans-Cullen.

The layout has been modified and Plexiglas installed to maintain physical barriers, returned books are quarantined for 72 hours and staff wear face shields.

The library has been closed to the public since March, when public health restrictions due to COVID-19 took effect. In late May it began offering curbside pickup and drop-off services on site, but patrons weren’t able to enter the building.

The curbside “takeout” book service is still being offered and access to digital media “contactless services” such as audiobooks, ebooks and databases, remains available.

About 65 per cent of the Town of Gibsons residents are patrons of the library, far higher than the provincial average, said Evans-Cullen. “I think it’s a special relationship this community has with this library.” With the opening, “they’re coming back home a little bit.”

And with the opening, two other important services will now be available to the public: computers and washroom facilities. “Our washrooms will be open. That’s been a huge limitation for people who may be homeless or not have sustainable housing,” said Evans-Cullen, adding that washroom access was something B.C. provincial health officer Bonnie Henry had asked libraries to provide, if possible.

Takeout delivery remains in place at the Sechelt Public Library. Interim library director Leianne Emery anticipates opening the doors to the public to browse shelves by the start of August, but an exact date will depend on a potential building envelope project, “which will affect the library interior,” she said in an email.

In the meantime, three major interior construction projects are underway and protective glass is being installed. Those projects should be completed by July 20, at which point the library will begin adding limited public computer access and in-person tech help to the other services it is already providing, including offering materials for “takeout,” providing online and phone tech help, exam invigilation, photocopying and faxing services and reciprocal borrowing between Sechelt and Gibsons libraries.

The Sechelt library is aiming to have outdoor “under the tent programming” up and running for small groups within the next couple of weeks. And children can pick up their reading logs at either the Gibsons or Sechelt library for the Summer Reading Club.

The Roberts Creek Community Library has been open to the public since June 19 but with modified hours.

In July, the library is open Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., Sundays from noon to 2 p.m., Tuesdays from 2 p.m. to 8 p.m. and Wednesdays from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. Safety conditions apply and instructions are available at the library’s entrance. Only one patron and child are allowed inside the building at a time.

A return to in-person services kicked off quietly at the Pender Harbour Reading Centre on July 2, according to board chair Karen Dyck. It is now open Tuesdays through Saturdays from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. and will be fully staffed with volunteers until the end of August. As with the Roberts Creek library, only one person is allowed inside at a time with some exceptions for children. Masks are required for borrowers and volunteers. And because people have been dropping off materials throughout the COVID-19 epidemic, “we have lots of books on the shelf,” said Dyck.

Over the course of the pandemic, no orders have been issued by the provincial health officer requiring libraries to close.

A May 7 letter from Vancouver Coastal Health’s (VCH) deputy chief medical health officer Mark Lysyshyn stated that VCH “believes that the risk of COVID-19 transmission in these environments can be mitigated and consistent with B.C.’s Restart Plan, that it is possible to safely operate these facilities at this time.”

Representatives from Teamsters Canada, the United Food and Commercial Workers Union Canada and Unifor point to the dozens of retail and warehouse workers who remain sickened with COVID-19 and a report Monday from CTV News in Windsor, Ont. that two workers had just tested positive in the border city.

article continues below

Some of those previously sickened have returned to work. A few workers have died from the novel coronavirus disease.

Speaking to a House of Commons committee Monday, the union leaders recommended stricter labour standards and oversight for the sector, beyond getting to the bottom of why the pay premium was abruptly rolled back by some of the largest grocery chains.

Unifor national president Jerry Dias said the fact two more workers now have COVID-19 ""is probably proof positive"" that the pandemic premium for hourly workers shouldn't have disappeared.

When the pandemic struck Canada in March, major grocery chains said they would boost front-line workers' wages on average about $2 per hour.

But late last month, one after another, the chains announced they were ending the pandemic pay bump because the pace of business had eased, giving the unions short notice about the decision.

MPs on the industry committee agreed to look into the matter and will have a chance to question retail executives at the end of the week.

""Look, the argument is nonsense and every one of us on this panel understands that and I will argue they understand that as well,"" Dias said, referring to grocery-chain executives.

""So this had nothing to do with somehow the pandemic, 'Oh we're seeing a pot at the end of the rainbow,' this was a decision made about money.""

Paul Meinema, national president of the food workers' union, said the federal government should play a more active role in boosting wages for workers in the sector.

Grocery stores were among the businesses governments deemed essential services that didn't have to close as public health restrictions forced companies to cut operations to slow the spread of COVID-19.

The pandemic pay was supposed to recognize that workers were being asked to come in to help feed a population ordered to stay home. Conservative MP Michelle Rempel Garner said she wanted to determine how to properly compensate workers who are being put in that situation.

Spending on things like gasoline and travel fell but spending on groceries has gone up — one of the few areas of the economy where things appeared positive during the lockdowns of April and May.

NDP MP Brian Masse, who represents a riding in Windsor, Ont., said the industry needs more oversight, calling the committee probe ""the first dive at this.""

The byelection is expected to fill the seat of Nick Volkow, an eight-term councillor who recently died of brain cancer. According to provincial laws, a byelection is required to fill a vacancy that opens up prior to an election year.

To kick off the byelection, the city is supposed to appoint a chief election officer, but city staff is recommending that be put off for now, citing concerns around COVID-19. For instance, strict rules on large congregations of people could put a chill on voter turnout, while lifting those rules would create a potential hazard for voters.

According to a staff report to council, the Ministry of Municipal Affairs has deferred byelections in Victoria, Rossland and Lytton, as well as a referendum in Kamloops, to protect residents from COVID-19.

The staff report noted city clerk Kate O’Connell reached out to the ministry to ask about guidelines for votes held during the pandemic. In response, the ministry indicated it was in the process of developing those guidelines and recommended the byelection be deferred.

Staff passed that recommendation on to council ahead of Monday evening’s regular meeting, saying it is “not practicable” to hold a byelection without the guidelines.

The election guidelines are being developed by Elections BC, the Ministry of Municipal Affairs, the Local Government Management Association and the Union of B.C. Municipalities, according to the staff report, and development is still in early stages. Staff noted there is still no clear timeline for when those guidelines are expected to be completed.

Options to do so are now on the table as members of Parliament and hundreds of behind-the-scenes staff begin to plan for what their headquarters could look like come fall, to the extent they can.

article continues below

""Is it better to meet in person or virtually come September?"" House of Commons Speaker Anthony Rota said to the procedure and house affairs committee Monday.

""COVID has been changing so drastically along the way it's very difficult to predict what will happen in a month and a half or two months from now.""

But in the meantime, a mobile app could be deployed to allow MPs to vote whether they're on Parliament Hill or off, Rota said.

The app is fully bilingual, meets accessibility standards, and is secure, including providing administrators the ability to know where MPs are when they vote and authenticate their identities.

""The proposed approach for an electronic voting system respects several key principles,"" Rota said.

Finding a way for MPs to vote while limiting the risk of COVID-19 transmission has been a sticking point for the Liberal government as it has faced pressure from the Opposition Conservatives to allow for the full resumption of Parliament.

MPs have grappled with how they can do their jobs ever since Parliament, like much of the rest of the country, shut down in mid-March to slow the spread of COVID-19.

Several compromises have been reached along the way, including a hybrid model that allows MPs to participate in person or virtually in debates or committee meetings.

Those debates and meetings have been limited in scope and the Opposition Conservatives have pressed for a full return to business that would expand the powers MPs have available to press the government and get more information.

Right now, Parliament is expected to resume sitting full-time on Sept. 21, though there is a single sitting day scheduled for this week.

Summer sitting days were among the concessions opposition parties won as they've fought for greater accountability.

The virtual voting plan is best to be rolled out come fall, Rota said, citing the time needed to get the right system in place.

In addition to an app, he's presented MPs with the option of a video-conferencing approach that would piggyback on the hybrid arrangement in place now.

Rota's report, however, raised several concerns with that, including unstable internet connections, the amount of time it would take, and the sensitive issue of MPs not being present to vote.

A video-conferencing approach would need to name each MP in turn to double-check an MP isn't on mute or having trouble with the connection.

""The absence of members would be highlighted to the public, to the media and to other members of the House, contrary to current practice,"" the report said.

Conservative MPs have come under scrutiny in recent weeks for their absence from the current special COVID-19 committee of MPs that replaced the normal House of Commons sitting.

Unlike in regular sittings, for the committee it is possible to see exactly who attended, and tallies have suggested many Tories haven't shown up regularly.

When it comes to virtual voting, the Conservatives have largely opposed the approach, citing a resistance to anything that keeps MPs off the Hill.

They argue it is possible to adjust regular procedures to allow for physical distancing, and had asked for a look at how voting could take place in person.

Pandemic-safe options could include lining up outside the Commons chamber to vote, voting in shifts or voting by proxy, Rota's analysis suggested.

Among the issues in-person voting raises is the question of time and resources needed to keep the chamber clean as well as how long the votes themselves would take.

The MPs are aiming to have their recommendations in place later this month.

The league says 23 of 396 players checked for COVID-19 at team facilities have tested positive since voluntary Phase 2 workouts began June 8 — a rate of just under six per cent. In that same time period, the NHL added it is aware of 12 additional positive test results.

article continues below

That's an increase of eight players in Phase 2, and one from outside the NHL's testing system, over the last week.

The NHL says it has administered more than 2,900 tests at team facilities.

Ten additional players were confirmed to have tested positive in the spring — five from the Ottawa Senators, three from the Colorado Avalanche and one each from the Pittsburgh Penguins and Boston Bruins. That brings the total number of NHLers with confirmed positive tests to 45 since the schedule was suspended in mid-March.

The league is no longer providing details on the players or clubs with positive tests. There was no word on the health status of the 35 players in question, including whether or not they experienced symptoms or have recovered.

""All players who have tested positive have been self-isolated and are following (government) protocols,"" the NHL said in a statement released on Twitter.

The league and NHL Players' Association on Sunday night agreed on protocols to start training camps and resume the season. That includes daily testing once games get under way for players, coaches and staff.

Resuming is contingent on each side approving an extension of the collective bargaining agreement and the return-to-play protocol.

The central bank's business outlook survey suggested about half of firms foresee a rebound in their sales within the next year as COVID-19's effects recede, but the expectations of a return to pre-pandemic levels often depend on lifting government-mandated restrictions.

article continues below

The survey report published Monday suggests many service-sector and energy companies don't expect a return to pre-pandemic employment levels.

The worry among workers about losing their jobs rose to the highest level seen in the bank's regular survey of consumer expectations, released alongside the business outlook report.

Workers' expectations of how easily they could find new work dropped to the lowest level in the survey since the 2015 oil-price shock as the country faces a different and far deeper economic crisis.

Lockdowns and stay-at-home requests from governments put the economy in a deep freeze in mid-March, with the thaw beginning in recent weeks as restrictions began to be rolled back.

Nearly half of all businesses reported an outright decline of their sales in the past 12 months because of COVID-19, low energy prices and the uncertainty both wrought.

More than half of businesses expect their total sales over the next 12 months to be lower than they were in the last year, with future sales indicators at record lows.

About half of firms expect their sales will ""mostly recover"" within the next year as COVID-19's effects recede, but the expectations of a return to pre-pandemic levels often depend on lifting government-mandated restrictions. Some companies said they could get back to normal operations within a month of public health restrictions being lifted.

""Overall, while the economy is on the mend, it's still early days and both businesses and consumers will continue to grapple with uncertainty over the foreseeable future,"" TD economist Ksenia Bushmeneva said in a note.

""This will manifest in lower spending by households and weak investment plans by businesses, both of which will weigh on the pace of economic recovery.""

Consumers' expectations for wage growth were below what they anticipated for inflation, while the outlook for growth in household income dropped to its lowest level in the survey's history.

The consumer survey said spending expectations have tumbled, which the bank says suggests consumers have become more cautious due to the economic impact and health risks related to the pandemic.

The bank said consumers expect to spend mostly on essentials and less on durable goods like cars and furniture, as well services that involve face-to-face interactions like eating out, travel or going to the movies.

A Royal Bank report Monday estimated the drop in economic output and sharp rise in spending could put the federal deficit at $265 billion this fiscal year.

The report said deficits could be close to double those the Liberals predicted just over six months ago as revenues drop — not including an expected need to spend more to help the economy recover.

""If they needed to extend some of the (aid) programs to ensure that the economy wasn't going to be ... more meaningfully impacted, they're in the fiscal position to do so,"" said RBC economist Colin Guldimann, who co-wrote the report.

""Of course, there is a position when some spending becomes too much spending and it's really hard to know where that is.""

Federal spending on fighting the pandemic and its effects, by the government's most recent figures, amounts to about $174 billion.

About one-third of service and energy companies told the Bank of Canada they have tapped a federal wage subsidy to reduce or avoid layoffs. Other firms looking to rehire or hire new staff cited an emergency federal benefit for workers as a hurdle to their plans.

The latest figures from the federal government show the $45-billion wage subsidy program has paid nearly $17.1 billion to 245,160 companies as of June 29. Meanwhile, the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, or CERB, has paid $53.53 billion in benefits to 8.16 million people as of June 28, since it was introduced in late March.

David Macdonald, senior economist at the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, argued in a research note Monday that the Liberals shouldn't make deep cuts to their aid measures.

He calculated that households will have a surplus in their budgets by $202.9 billion due to Ottawa's deficit spending, while corporations would see a surplus to the tune of $37.1 billion.

""As federal deficits can create surpluses in other areas, the opposite is also true,"" Macdonald wrote. ""Federal surpluses, through cutbacks and austerity, must force another sector into deficit by the same amount.""

Think you might have symptoms? Take a self-assessment

On this page

Symptoms of COVID-19

Symptoms of COVID-19 can vary from person to person. Symptoms may also vary in different age groups. Some of the more commonly reported symptoms include:

new or worsening cough

shortness of breath or difficulty breathing

temperature equal to or over 38°C

feeling feverish

chills

fatigue or weakness

muscle or body aches

new loss of smell or taste

headache

gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting)

feeling very unwell



Children have been more commonly reported to have abdominal symptoms, and skin changes or rashes.

In severe cases, infection can lead to death.

Symptoms may take up to 14 days to appear after exposure to COVID-19.

Recent evidence indicates that the virus can be transmitted to others from someone who is infected but not showing symptoms. This includes people who:

have not yet developed symptoms (pre-symptomatic)

never develop symptoms (asymptomatic)

While experts know that these kinds of transmissions are happening among those in close contact or in close physical settings, it is not known to what extent. This means it is extremely important to follow the proven preventative measures.

If you or your child become ill

If you are showing symptoms of COVID-19, reduce your contact with others:

isolate yourself at home for 14 days to avoid spreading it to others if you live with others, stay in a separate room or keep a 2-metre distance

visit a health care professional or call your local public health authority call ahead to tell them your symptoms and follow their instructions



Children who have mild COVID-19 symptoms are able to stay at home with a caregiver throughout their recovery without needing hospitalization. If you are caring for a child who has suspected or probable COVID-19, it is important to follow the advice for caregivers. This advice will help you protect yourself, others in your home, as well as others in the community.

If you become sick while travelling back to Canada:

inform the flight attendant or a Canadian border services officer

advise a Canada border services agent on arrival in Canada if you believe you were exposed to someone who was sick with COVID-19, even if you do not have symptoms this is required under the Quarantine Act the Canada border services agent will provide instructions for you to follow



Check if you have been exposed

Have you been on a recent flight, cruise, train, or at a public gathering? Check the listed exposure locations to see if you may have been exposed to COVID-19.

Take care of your mental health

The COVID-19 pandemic is new and unexpected. This situation can be unsettling and can cause a sense of loss of control. It is normal to feel sad, stressed, confused, scared or worried in a crisis. Make sure to care for your mental and physical wellbeing and to ask for help if you feel overwhelmed.

Diagnosing coronavirus

Coronavirus infections are diagnosed by a health care provider based on symptoms and are confirmed through laboratory tests.

Treating coronavirus

Most people with mild coronavirus illness will recover on their own.

If you are concerned about your symptoms, you should self-monitor and consult your health care provider. They may recommend steps you can take to relieve symptoms.

Vaccine, therapeutics and medical devices

At this time, a vaccine and therapies to treat or prevent this disease have not yet been identified. But research and development are underway. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a global review of therapies that may be used to treat or prevent the disease.

Health Canada is fast tracking the importation and sale of medical devices for use in relation to COVID-19.

Flu vaccine

If you have received a flu vaccine, it will not protect against coronaviruses, but will help prevent the flu. Getting the flu could make you more vulnerable to other infections.

Getting the flu vaccine will not increase your risk of illness from coronavirus. For more information, please refer to this recently published Canadian research study.

About coronaviruses

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness in people and others cause illness in animals. Human coronaviruses are common and are typically associated with mild illnesses, similar to the common cold.

COVID-19 is a new disease that has not been previously identified in humans. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people, and more rarely, these can then spread from person to person through close contact.

There have been 2 other specific coronaviruses that have spread from animals to humans and which have caused severe illness in humans. These are the:",[]

Limit contact

Only one healthy person should provide care.

Do not share personal items with the ill person, such as toothbrushes, towels, bed linen, utensils or electronic devices.

Use a separate bathroom from the ill person, if possible. If not possible, the ill person should put the toilet lid down before flushing.

Some people may transmit COVID-19 even though they do not show any symptoms. Wearing a mask, including a non-medical mask or face covering (i.e. made with at least two layers of tightly woven fabric, constructed to completely cover the nose and mouth without gaping, and secured to the head by ties or ear loops) can help protect others around you.

Prevent contact with animals, as there have been several reports of people transmitting COVID-19 to their pets.

Protect yourself

If possible, people who are at higher risk of serious illness from COVID-19 should not care for someone with COVID-19. These people include elderly persons, those with chronic medical conditions (e.g. heart disease, diabetes) or compromised immune systems.

If you need to be within 2 metres of the ill person, wear personal protective equipment: a medical mask disposable gloves eye protection

Wear disposable gloves when touching the ill person, their environment and soiled items or surfaces.

Avoid re-using medical masks or gloves.

Clean your hands often for at least 20 seconds, especially after contact with the ill person and after removing gloves, face masks and eye protection.

Dry your hands with disposable paper towels. If not available, use a reusable towel and replace it when it becomes wet.

You can also remove dirt with a wet wipe and then use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol.

Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.

Wearing masks Medical masks are recommended for COVID-19 patients in the home and for protection for those providing direct care to COVID-19 patients at home.

N95 respirators must be reserved for healthcare workers and should not be used for caregiving at home.

If medical masks are not available, non-medical masks or face coverings (i.e. constructed to completely cover the nose and mouth without gaping, and secured to the head by ties or ear loops) can be worn by the ill person, if tolerable. This will cover their mouth and nose, and may prevent respiratory droplets from contaminating others or landing on surfaces.

A non-medical mask or face covering may also be worn by those providing direct care to COVID-19 patients at home. However, wearing a non-medical mask or facial covering in the community has not been proven to protect the person wearing it.

Strict hygiene and public health measures, including frequent hand washing and maintaining a physical distance of at least 2 metres from the ill person, will reduce the chance of being exposed to the virus.

Non-medical cloth masks should be carefully removed when soiled or damp, laundered in hot water and then dried thoroughly.

Hands must be cleaned before and after putting on and removing a mask.

Keep your environment clean

Place used medical masks, gloves and other contaminated items in a lined container, secure the contents and dispose of them with other household waste.

Place possibly contaminated laundry, including non-medical cloth masks and facial coverings, into a container with a plastic liner and do not shake. Wash with regular laundry soap and hot water (60-90°C), and dry well. Clothing, linens and non-medical cloth masks and facial coverings belonging to the ill person can be washed with other laundry.

At least once daily, clean and disinfect surfaces that people touch often, such as toilets, laundry containers, bedside tables, doorknobs, phones and television remotes.

Use only approved hard-surface disinfectants that have a Drug Identification Number (DIN). A DIN is an 8-digit number given by Health Canada that confirms the disinfectant product is approved and safe for use in Canada.

This ratio is based on bleach containing 5% sodium hypochlorite, to give a 0.1% sodium hypochlorite solution. Follow instructions for proper handling of household (chlorine) bleach.

If they can withstand the use of liquids for disinfection, high-touch electronic devices (e.g. keyboards, tablets, smartboards) may be disinfected with 70% alcohol (e.g. alcohol prep wipes) at least daily.

Monitor yourself for symptoms

If you have always used the recommended precautions, then monitor yourself for symptoms for 14 days following your last close contact with the ill person.

Quarantine (self-isolate) at home for 14 days from your last exposure and contact your local public health authority if you have no symptoms but: cared for a person who has COVID-19 without the recommended personal protective equipment live with or had close physical contact (e.g. intimate partner) without using the recommended personal protective equipment live with or have had regular close contact (within 2 metres) with a person who has COVID-19 up to 48 hours prior to symptom onset or while they were symptomatic and not isolating had direct contact with the body fluids of a person who has COVID-19 (e.g. were coughed or sneezed on) without the recommended personal protective equipment



If you start to develop symptoms, isolate yourself as quickly as possible and contact your local public health authority for further instructions.

On Tuesday July 14, 2020, Dr. Bonnie Henry, Provincial Health Officer and Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, announced 13 new cases of COVID-19 in the province for a total of 3,128 cases in British Columbia. Of the total COVID-19 cases, 14 individuals are hospitalized, five of whom are in intensive care. The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation. Since the start of the pandemic, there have been 1,015 cases of COVID-19 in the Vancouver Coastal Health region. There are no new community outbreaks, but there have been several exposure events particularly in the Kelowna area. These occurred when a group of people from different areas including the Okanagan, lower mainland and Alberta got together. To date, 17 of these individuals have tested positive for COVID-19. Dr. Henry says as people become more active and travel, we will see more cases. Public health teams are actively working to manage cases and clusters as they emerge and keep new cases low and slow. Of note, the first incubation period since Canada Day is now complete.



Economic and fiscal update for 2020-21

The British Columbia government is forecasting a $12.5 billion deficit due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The provincial budget for 2020, tabled just months before the global pandemic, predicted a budget surplus of $227 million for 2020-21. Carole James, Minister of Finance, says the pandemic has exposed underlying gaps in our economy and society, and reminded us of the need for strong public services and supports. Government has supported people and businesses with $6.26 billion in COVID-19 supports to date. That includes the $5 billion in supplementary spending for B.C.’s COVID-19 Action Plan supports, such as workers benefits, rent supplements, income and disability assistance supports and economic recovery funding. These are in addition to $1.26 billion in other tax and relief measures for people and businesses, including the one-time increase to the climate action tax credit and property tax reductions for businesses.

Warning about calls appearing to come from Squamish General Hospital



Vancouver Coastal Health is warning the public not to provide personal information over the phone if they receive an unexpected call that appears to come from Squamish General Hospital. Someone claiming to be a hospital employee is calling people and asking for their full names, social insurance number and date of birth. This is in no way associated with Vancouver Coastal Health, and appears to be a phishing scam, where people are tricked into providing personal information that can be used fraudulently. RCMP have been advised.



Testing

Anyone in the VCH region with cold, influenza or COVID-19-like symptoms, however mild, can now be assessed for and get a COVID-19 test. Contact your physician or nurse practitioner's office, or a local community collection centre to arrange for a test. Phone numbers and locations of collection centre can be found by visiting: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/testing or by calling 8-1-1. In Vancouver, the City Centre and REACH urgent and primary care centres can provide testing as well as the St. Vincent's drive-up location at 4875 Heather Street. The Richmond Assessment Centre is located at 6820 Gilbert Road, in the parking lot of the Richmond Tennis Club. On the North Shore, testing is available at the North Vancouver Urgent and Primary Care Centre. If you think you need testing, please call ahead before visiting your doctor, urgent and primary care center or health clinic.



VCH Medical Health Officers, our provincial partners and the Public Health Agency of Canada continue to actively monitor the COVID-19 pandemic. To protect yourself while out in public, wash your hands frequently and maintain social distance. For more information on COVID-19, please visit www.vch.ca/COVID19.

Todd Norman John Bezzasso raised approximately $5 million from 85 investors through his companies, Bezzaz Holdings Group Ltd. (Bezzaz) and Nexus Global Trading Ltd. (Nexus).

article continues below

During this time, Bezzasso engaged fellow Richmond resident Wei Kai (a.k.a. Kevin) Liao to find investors on his behalf.

The British Columbia Securities Commission (BCSC) panel found that instead of using all of investor funds as promised, Bezzasso was actually operating a Ponzi scheme.

A large portion of the investors’ funds was being used to pay earlier investors, meaning many people who invested later during the scheme lost some or all of their money.

While the panel found that Bezzasso, Bezzaz and Nexus committed fraud against all 85 investors, the panel found that Liao committed fraud against one investor, traded in securities without being registered and acted as an adviser to investors without being registered.

As a result of their misconduct, Bezzasso is ordered to pay an administrative penalty of $4.5 million, and Bezzasso, Bezzaz and Nexus are jointly ordered to pay a financial sanction of $1,619,563, representing the amount they obtained or avoided losing as a result of the misconduct.

In ordering these sanctions, the panel noted that they “engaged in a deliberate and extensive fraud which deprived investors of a large portion of their invested funds.”

For his misconduct, Liao is ordered to pay $100,000 in administrative sanctions and a financial sanction of $68,530, representing the amount he obtained or avoided losing as a result of his misconduct.

In addition to the financial sanctions, Bezzasso is permanently banned and Liao is prohibited for 15 years from:

• relying on any exemption under the Securities Act

• being a director or officer of any issuer or registrant

• being or acting as a registrant or promoter

• acting in a management or consultative capacity in connection with the securities market

• and engaging in investor relations activities

They are also banned for the same time periods from trading in or purchasing securities or exchange contracts, although Liao is allowed to do so for personal use through a registered dealer.

“I checked at the self-checker,” said Gill. “I told my son, and then I had to go to another gas station to make sure it was correct. After I told my wife, they both thought I was joking and didn’t believe me.”

With original plans for a museum in Steveston waylaid for several years by more grandiose ideas for a destination museum closer to the current city centre, Richmond council has now approved reconstructing the former Phoenix Net Loft with preliminary plans to make it into a museum.

article continues below

“Some things take a long time,” Steves told the Richmond News with a chuckle.

Getting a museum built has only been one of his priority projects on council.

Steves announced his “retirement” from council in a tweet this past weekend, saying “the realtor farmers are waiting like vultures for the next election when I retire, leaving a vacancy, and voters forget to be vigilant.”

Steves was first elected to council in 1969, and then served as an NDP MLA in the Dave Barrett government between 1972-1975. During this time, he helped establish the Agricultural Land Reserve (ALR), overseen by the Agricultural Land Commission, which regulates activities on any ALR land.

He was re-elected to Richmond council in 1977 and has served as a councillor ever since.

One of the most important issues he’s advocated for was keeping the Garden City Lands as a centrepiece for agriculture. Council was able to buy the lands, which are located in the ALR.

“It probably ended up being the most important thing … we saved land in downtown Richmond and now we’re going to farm it,” Steves said.

Steves has been a vocal advocate for farming and local food security. He and his wife Kathy run an 11-acre cattle farm in Steveston.

Richmond Mayor Malcolm Brodie said Steves’ work on council and his contribution to community life has been “immeasurable,” with him regularly bringing interesting initiatives to the table “mixed with a very good dose of pragmatism.”

“Harold will bring in actual ideas… that impact on the evolution of our city, with an environmental flavour, but solid in many, many different ways,” Brodie said.

During council meetings, Steves will often give a quick historical synopsis on agenda items, often dipping into his archives, which Brodie said rival city archives for council documents, to find relevant background information on the topic of the day.

“The history that Harold Steves brings to the council table and the knowledge, the corporate knowledge, is irreplaceable,” Brodie said.

“There will definitely be a hole to be filled, and (Steves) does have very large footprints, which he will leave on the city,” he added.

Steves has often said he wouldn’t retire until Michael Wolfe was elected to council and after several runs, Wolfe was successful to get on council in the last election.

Steves still has two years left in his term, and one of his biggest priorities is to make sure the Garden City Lands become a stronger centre for farming.

In fact, he is hoping to see a greenbelt stretching from the Garden City Lands, the Department of Defence lands to its east and the Richmond Nature Park joined together as a centrepiece of agricultural viability within the city and region.

His other dream is to have all the original groups in the city, the First Nations, the Chinese, the Japanese and the Europeans, recognized for their historical role in establishing the first townsite of Richmond – Steveston – while the rest of the city was just a smattering of farms.

A museum at the soon-to-be-rebuilt Phoenix Net Loft is where it could all come together, he said.",[]

Britannia has been a popular favourite for many in Richmond and is known for their food, their own line of brews on tap and their bar program.

article continues below

Lloyd Kinney, co-founder and operating director of the Britannia Brewing Company, said they are feeling “very excited” for the opening.

“We’re just waiting for the city to provide us with a building permit and then from there we can proceed to stage two which is the fit out,” said Kinney, adding that they expect to open before Christmas.

“It’s always been part of our business plan as a brewery to have restaurant partners we would support with our craft beer.”

Their Ladner location will be a newly-renovated space of the former Ladner Village Hardware store, also known as Clayton’s Hardware store in the movie Fifty Shades of Grey.

And it will run as a restauarant with a larger space and no brewing facilities compared to Steveston's location.

However, it will feature a new “corporate private room” that large groups can book for private and public gatherings.

“We’ve always gotten requests to completely book out our restaurant in Steveston, but to be fair to our locals, we’ve never accepted full private bookings,” said Kinney.

“It’s a larger space than what we have now and so there’ll be a little more of that social atmosphere by having the bar or lounge area being bigger.”

“Advance fee loans, the second riskiest scam in Canada for 2019, continues to wreak havoc for B.C. residents in a financial bind because of the pandemic,” according to the BBB, which is warning consumers, who may be urgently trying to acquire funds, to be on “high alert” to avoid losing money and exposing their personal information.

article continues below

The BBB says that the reports its received from victims across the province show consumers are extremely susceptible to the scam.

As part of the scam, the BBB says consumers may receive an email or phone call, or – as in the case of more recent reports to the bureau’s Scam Tracker – a pop-up ad online or find a website while searching for a loan company.

In this con, scammers disguised as loan brokers and other lending institutions advertise and promise loans to those in a financial bind. The loan, which is guaranteed regardless of credit history, comes with upfront charges labelled as “taxes,” “insurance” or “processing fees.”

However, when the charges are paid, the loan never materializes and the applicant is left with larger debts. The BBB says that requiring advance fees for loans is illegal in Canada

“Typically, the scammers will ask you to pay a fee for a seemingly legitimate reason,” said Karla Laird, the BBB’s manager for community and public relations.

“Oftentimes, they require that payment to be made by wire transfer, bitcoin or some other hard-to-recover method. However, once the fee is paid, the phony loan company stops communication and the consumer cannot get a refund.”

Vancouver man loses nearly $1,500

In one instance of the scam, which was reported to the BBB, a Vancouver resident lost nearly $1,500 to a company he found online with an Ontario address on its website.

The company told the Vancouver man his loan was approved for $10,000 at the rate of seven per cent for four years, however, the company needed a three-month advance payment in order to release the funds – a total of $718.

The company also told the man that his credit is high risk, so he would need to pay $1,500 insurance for the lender, although the company would cover half. The company wanted the Vancouver man to send the money using Bitcoin.

The company, Kingsway Lending, according to the BBB, is using the address of a Canada Revenue Agency office in Ontario.

“Scammers understand that consumers are searching for websites that look professional, and will put effort into making your loan application process feel like the real deal,” said Laird.

“With this in mind, thorough research on a company before initiating any transactions, is the best way to avoid being tricked out of your money and personal information.”

What to look out for

The BBB says consumers should look out for the following red flags is they are searching for a lender or loan broker:

You receive unsolicited communication (phone call, text message, email) offering an easy loan.

What we are watching in Canada ...

OTTAWA — The first of multiple parliamentary investigations of the federal government's aborted deal with WE Charity to run a volunteering program begins this afternoon.

The House of Commons finance committee is set to hear from Youth Minister Bardish Chagger and some senior public servants as it probes how WE got a sole-sourced contract to administer the $900-million program.

The Canada Student Service Grant is aimed at students who haven't been able to find work this summer, offering up to $5,000 toward education costs in exchange for 500 hours of volunteering.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has admitted he should have recused himself from the decision to award the contract, given his family's links to the group co-founded by brothers Craig and Marc Kielburger.

WE gave up the contract amid the controversy two weeks ago.

The government has since taken control of the program, but has been struggling with the details while the summer ticks by.

TORONTO — Torontonians will have a final chance to weigh in on public consultations about police reform today, while protesters are set to take to the streets demanding that the force be defunded.

The Toronto Police Services Board's fourth and final town hall on ""police accountability, reform and community safety priorities"" is due to begin at 9 a.m.

Late last month, city council voted against a cut to the force's budget, but proposed a series of changes to policing including anti-racism measures and the implementation of body cameras.

But the group organizing the protest, called No Pride in Policing Coalition, says that doesn't go nearly far enough.

They advocate against body cameras for officers and are also calling for the force's budget to be cut by 50 per cent, with the money going towards community programs.

The protest is set to begin at noon outside police headquarters.

What we are watching in the U.S. ...

WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump is shaking up his campaign amid sinking poll numbers less than four months before the election, replacing campaign manager Brad Parscale with veteran GOP operative Bill Stepien.

The president announced the move Wednesday night on Facebook.

Trump and Parscale's relationship has been strained since a Tulsa, Okla., rally that drew a dismal crowd, infuriating the president.

Parscale was a political novice when he ran Trump's digital advertising in 2016 and was credited with helping bring about his surprise victory.

Stepien has been in politics for years, working for former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and serving as Trump's national field director in 2016.

What we are watching elsewhere in the world ...

LONDON — The European Union's top court has ruled that an agreement that allows big tech companies to transfer data to the United States is invalid, and that national regulators need to take tougher action to protect the privacy of users data.

Today's ruling does not mean an immediate halt to all data transfers outside the EU, as there is another legal mechanism that some companies can use.

But it means that the scrutiny over data transfers will be ramped up and that the EU and U.S. may have to find a new system that guarantees that Europeans' data is afforded the same privacy protection in the U.S. as it is in the EU.

In sports news ...

As one of America's most familiar sports franchises finally confronts its controversial identity, experts warn against assuming Canada is farther along than the United States in combating racist attitudes towards Indigenous Peoples.

Washington's National Football League team confirmed this week it would drop its 87-year-old name and logo, long deemed offensive to Native Americans.

The decision comes with the United States at the centre of a global reckoning with long-standing systemic and institutional racism against Black people and other racialized communities.

Lynn Gehl, an Indigenous author and scholar in Peterborough, Ont., says Canadians should resist the belief that their country is any further along than the U.S. in acknowledging and protecting First Nations, Inuit and Metis communities.

Gehl notes that both the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and a public inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls concluded that Canada has been engaged in acts of genocide.

The CFL's Edmonton Eskimos are under pressure to change a nickname long considered a derogatory, colonial-era term, while in Morden, Man., a minor-league hockey team faces similar demands to drop the same moniker just abandoned in Washington.

Arts and entertainment ...

TORONTO — A painting by Alex Colville shattered a price record for work by the Canadian master at an auction held in Toronto on Wednesday.

Colville's 1976 canvas ""Dog and Bridge"" sold for more than $2.4 million — doubling its estimated value. The work had been owned privately for decades and had never appeared at auction before.

Pablo Picasso's 1939 ""Tete de femme"" sold for more than $1.3 million — about in the middle of its estimated range.

Abstract Expressionist painter Joan Mitchell's oil on canvas triptych, ""Untitled,"" sold for nearly $1.2 million, well above its estimated price of about $500,000.

Quebec artist Jean Paul Riopelle's commanding, large-scale ""Le reveil"" sold for about $1.2 million.

Five works by Lawren Harris were also sold, two for well above their estimates. His ""North East Corner of Lake Superior (Lake Superior Sketch XXXVIII)"" fetched $481,250 and the abstraction ""LSH 89A"" went for $277,250.

ICYMI (In case you missed it) ...

PORT ALBERNI, B.C. — This is quite a fish tale.

A commercial fisherman knew he was staring at a fish out of place when a barracuda landed in his net on Vancouver Island.

Tyler Vogrig, 24, says he'd seen the long, silvery body of the muscular fish with giant teeth before, but in Hawaii.

Vogrig says he and his father Brian were catching sockeye at Alberni Inlet as part of their stock-assessment work for Fisheries and Oceans Canada when they hauled in the barracuda.

""We couldn't believe it,"" he says from his home in Vancouver. ""The fish was docile because it was being chased by some seals and one of the seals actually nipped it on its tail so it had a little gash on it.""

The duo placed the weak, predatory fish in a tank to recover for about 30 minutes before releasing it.

Jackie King, a research scientist with the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, says the presence of Pacific barracuda in British Columbia waters is rare.

The fish are normally found in Baja California in Mexico, bordering the state of California, but have also recently been seen as far north as Washington state neighbouring B.C., likely due to warming waters at home.

Police said they found evidence Wednesday night Martin Carpentier was in a trailer in the area where police have focused their search since the bodies of Norah and Romy Carpentier, aged 11 and 6, were discovered Saturday.

Carpentier took items from the trailer, suggesting he may visit other barns, sheds or cottages in the region, police said in a news release.

""We are dealing with an individual who is probably desperate and who must be looking for equipment to ensure his survival,"" Sgt. Audrey-Anne Bilodeau said in a pre-recorded audio message sent to reporters.

Police asked residents of Lotbiniere and surrounding areas west of Quebec City to check their cottages, trailers or buildings for signs of a break-in, such as missing or moved clothing, food, or equipment. Hunters who have set up cameras in the woods are also being asked to check their recordings.

Police are also suggesting worried citizens search in groups or with a police escort and to call 911 with any relevant information.

Sgt. Ann Mathieu, another provincial police spokeswoman, told reporters Thursday there's no evidence to suggest Carpentier poses a danger to the general population.

""It's an individual who is currently, if he is still alive — and the elements we have lead us to believe he is — is looking to ensure his survival and to hide,"" she said.

Investigators have said the girls and their father were believed to have been in a serious car crash on Highway 20 in the Quebec City suburb of St-Apollinaire July 8, but there was nobody inside the vehicle when they arrived on scene.

An Amber Alert was issued last Thursday but cancelled two days later after the bodies were found.

In recent days police have focused their search on a 50-square-kilometre wooded area around St-Apollinaire, where ""items of interest"" were found on Sunday.

Autopsies were performed on the two girls, but police said they won't reveal the cause of death until Carpentier is found.

Provincial health officer Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix announced July 15 that there were 21 new cases in the past 24 hours, including two cases that they call ""epi-linked,"" or presumed cases that have not been proven through testing but are being treated as official cases.

article continues below

The province has now recorded 3,149 cases since the novel coronavirus first appeared in B.C. in late January.

More than 87.4% of those infected, or 2,753 people, have recovered. Of those who haven't, 189 people have died and 207 people are actively fighting the virus. Only 14 people are hospitalized, with five of those in intensive care units. The rest are self-isolating at home. There were no new deaths recorded in the past 24 hours.

Recording at least 20 new COVID-19 cases in a 24-hour period has become common in B.C., and Henry said yesterday that she found that number ""distressing,"" even though, she added, the good news is that the province knows where the clusters of infection are, many of the infections are linked and the number is not really that large given the province's population of more than five million residents.

The numbers in the past week were:

• 20 new cases on July 9;

• 25 new cases on July 10;

• 21 new cases on July 11;

• 20 new cases on July 12;

• 21 new cases on July 13;

• 13 new cases on July 14; and now

• 21 new cases on July 15.

In June, the number of daily new cases many times was in the single digits.

""There is one active community outbreak, in addition to several community exposure events,"" Henry and Dix said. ""There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks.""

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,023 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1,659 in Fraser Health;

• 135 in Island Health;

• 216 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

• 51 people who reside outside Canada.

Mahy, who has doggedly persisted in having the police and courts pursue this case, said he was recently told by the crown prosecutor that the man charged in the fatality, Erjon Kashari, has been arrested in Bulgaria and will be sent back to Richmond when COVID-related travel restrictions are lifted.

article continues below

“She (the prosecutor) congratulated me on my persistence. In six years I haven’t given it up. I couldn’t,” said Mahy.

In an email to the Richmond News, Alisia Adams with the BC Prosecution Service, would only confirm, as she did a year ago, that Kashari has been charged with criminal negligence causing the death of Christy.

However, she directed inquiries about his arrest and extradition to the federal Department of Justice's International Assistance Group. The News reached out but did not hear back by the time of publication.

It was July 30, 2014 when Ron’s daughter, Christy Mahy, 36, was standing with her bike at the Dinsmore Bridge intersection on Russ Baker Way on her way home to Burkville, when an SUV, bearing an N, jumped the curb and plowed into her.

The driver stayed at the scene and there were numerous witnesses.

However, the driver was not charged and soon after left the country.

For the first few years after the tragic accident, Mahy said he was given little information regarding the case and, to this day, he still doesn’t understand why the driver wasn’t charged immediately, particularly as there were so many witnesses prepared to give statements.

Determined to not let his daughter’s story be forgotten, however, Mahy, a Harley Davidson rider, organized a motorcycle ride in Christy’s name in 2015, which has run every years since -- and this year will be no different.

Riders will convene at the parking lot beside the Flying Beaver Bar and Grill on Inglis Drive on July 25 at 2 p.m. and the ride will get underway at 2:30 p.m.

“It will be a good ride this year. We’ll have about 40 or 50 riders.”

The ride will end with a barbecue in Langley -- albeit with tables spread out, and masks and hand sanitizer on hand to guard against COVID, said Mahy.

Mahy, who worked in the film industry, but has since retired to the Sunshine Coast, will make his annual pilgrimage to Richmond for the event.

But before he joins the other riders, Mahy said he will take a few minutes to sit on the bench in Flight Path Park that has been dedicated to his daughter.

There, just metres away from where the crash happened, he will think about his daughter and the sad irony that this was the very same spot that he and Christy’s mother had their first date, “watching the planes.”

Christy’s mom died of cancer in 2005.

In past years, when Mahy has sat on that bench, the sadness has been mixed with bitterness and frustration at the thought that someone may never face the consequence of having taken his daughter’s life.

This year, however, he said there is a touch of hope that justice will be served, as well as a sense of appreciation for those within the court system who have not let this case go.",[]

Wisdom from Dr Bonnie Henry

We may have to live with C19 for months or years. Let's not deny it or panic. Let's not make our lives useless. Let's learn to live with this fact. You can't destroy C19 viruses that have penetrated cell walls, by drinking gallons of hot water you'll just go to the bathroom more often. Washing hands and maintaining a two-metre physical distance is the best method for your protection. If you don't have a C19 patient at home, there's no need to disinfect the surfaces at your house. Packaged cargo, gas pumps, shopping carts and ATMs do not cause infection. If you wash your hands, live your life as usual. C19 is not a food infection. It is associated with drops of infection like the 'flu. There is no demonstrated risk that C19 is transmitted by food. You can lose your sense of smell with a lot of allergies and viral infections. This is only a non-specific symptom of C19. Once at home, you don't need to change your clothes urgently and go shower! Purity is a virtue, paranoia is not! The C19 virus doesn't hang in the air for long. This is a respiratory droplet infection that requires close contact. The air is clean, you can walk through the gardens and through parks (just keeping your physical protection distance). It is sufficient to use normal soap against C19, not antibacterial soap. This is a virus, not a bacteria. You don't have to worry about your food orders. But you can heat it all up in the microwave, if you wish. The chances of bringing C19 home with your shoes is like being struck by lightning twice in a day. I've been working against viruses for 20 years — drop infections don't spread like that! You can't be protected from the virus by taking vinegar, sugarcane juice and ginger! These are for immunity not a cure. Wearing a mask for long periods interferes with your breathing and oxygen levels. Wear it only in crowds. Wearing gloves is also a bad idea; the virus can accumulate into the glove and be easily transmitted if you touch your face. Better just to wash your hands regularly. Immunity is greatly weakened by always staying in a sterile environment. Even if you eat immune boosting foods, please go out of your house regularly to any park/beach. Immunity is increased by EXPOSURE TO PATHOGENS, not by sitting at home and consuming fried/ spicy/sugary food and aerated drinks.

Be smart and stay informed!

Live life sensibly and to the fullest.—

Dr Bonnie Henry

The list isn't new to the internet, with roots going back to mid-May and a connection to a U.S. physician in Maryland. However, the list is newly showing Dr. Henry as its author.

That doctor is Dr. Faheen Younus, the Chief of Infectious Diseases, University of Maryland Upper Chesapeake Health. The list actually has its roots in the multiple tweets Dr. Younus shared into May on his personal Twitter feed. The paraphrased format first appeared, and was widely shared, thanks to an article on the site TheAZB.com.

If you take the first piece of ""wisdom,"" in the now-circulating Dr. Henry-attributed posts, it reads: ""We may have to live with C19 for months or years. Let's not deny it or panic. Let's not make our lives useless. Let's learn to live with this fact.""

TheAZB.com begins their recap of Dr. Younus' tweeted items as follows: ""He Tweets We will live with Covid19 for months. Let’s not deny it or panic. Let’s not make life unnecessarily difficult. Let us learn to be happy and live with that fact.""

Similarly, the items in the list are paraphrased and tweaked as they are adapted by each re-poster or re-formatter of the list. For example, while The AZB.com summarizes a thought attributed to Dr. Younus as ""You cannot be protected from the virus by drinking / eating vinegar, sumac, soda and ginger."" The Dr. Henry-attributed phony list reads as follows: ""You can't be protected from the virus by taking vinegar, sugarcane juice and ginger! These are for immunity not a cure.""

Dr. Younus himself discredited the viral post, which moved rapidly on WhatsApp, in a tweet on June 6:

IMPORTANT:



These are not my words. There are errors and typos in this viral post on FB/WhatsApp that someone adapted from my tweets without approval.



I share COVID info only on twitter. Just read through my TL here if you’d like accurate info.



Spread the word please. Thx pic.twitter.com/tplGscusMh — Faheem Younus, MD (@FaheemYounus) June 6, 2020

On July 15, a site called The Dallas Orthodox Jewish Life presents the list as ""Dr. Bonnie Henry’s Down to Earth Advice,"" featuring an image taken without permission from the New York Times' recent profile of B.C.'s top doc.

Forms of the list show up on Google as being reproduced all over, with varying attribution or none at all, from church newsletters to personal blogs.

Many B.C. residents are sharing the list on their Facebook pages today, however many more are trying to get the word out that the list is not Dr. Henry's.

Dr. Henry's COVID-19 provincial case media updates are published on the Province of British Columbia's website, and reputable sources readily cover the regular press conferences here in B.C. Further, B.C. has a robust online section dedicated to COVID-19, which includes reliable and accurate information.

There is no press conference scheduled for Wednesday, July 15. A representative who assists with media requests for Dr. Henry said the following via email to V.I.A.: ""[T]he information was not developed by Dr. Henry nor anyone in her office. While some of the recommendations are similar to her remarks over the past several months, there are inaccuracies and errors in the guidance that is provided. She rather recommends British Columbians refer to the excellent guidance found on the B.C. Centre of Disease Control’s website at www.bccdc.ca and share that information through their social networks.""",[]

The Federal Bureau of Prisons is expected to take Sidoo into custody on September 23 and release him from a Pacific Northwest area facility just before Christmas.

article continues below

Sidoo, 61, appeared online via Zoom in front of United States District Judge Nathaniel Gorton of the United States District Court for District of Massachusetts, as well as his lawyers and prosecutors. He wore a plaid suit while sitting in an office space inside his $31.7 million home in Vancouver’s Point Grey neighbourhood.

Sidoo, now a convicted felon, initially pled innocent to fraud and money laundering charges; he teared up before being sentenced and read a prepared statement:

“The last several months have been the hardest in my entire life and today I accept the court’s decision without reservation. No words can express how sorry I am for my decisions and actions that led to this day. I make no excuses, your honour. I broke the law and pled guilty and I now must pay for my actions.

“To my wife and boys, all I ever wanted was your love and respect and to be a good role model. And I know I have made a terrible mistake that has deeply affected our family. To my friends and colleagues and former teammates over the years, I am deeply ashamed today. To the young men and women who looked up to me as a role model, you deserve better. To the court and all of you, I wish to apologize for my actions.

“I will serve my sentence and am committed to returning to the community and doing everything possible to make a positive impact. I hope in time people will not judge me for the worst mistake in my life but for the work in the days, weeks and years ahead in which I am committed to being a better man.”

Gorton told Sidoo he was “impressed” by the businessman’s “obvious remorse.”

But Gorton pointed out two omissions in Sidoo’s statement.

“You expect to put this behind you and go forward and make up for what you called mistakes. I would call it a crime, not a mistake, but nevertheless, it is important that you acknowledge it and realize how many constituencies you have disappointed,” said the judge.

Sidoo also did not explicitly acknowledge that his crimes resulted in two students missing an opportunity to attend the universities his sons, Dylan Sidoo and Jordan Sidoo, were admitted to.

“What you accomplished, along with getting them into college, is to deprive two other deserving students of admittance into those universities — an act that is the very antithesis of one you want to be known for,” said Gorton.

Likewise, United States Attorney Andrew Lelling submitted to Gorton: “Sidoo engaged in serious criminal conduct involving fraud and deception that stretched over multiple years.

“His crimes warrant significant punishment. By engaging in the scheme, with [scheme mastermind Rick Singer] and others, Sidoo was able to steal two college admissions slots for his sons, including one from the University of California at Berkeley, one of the top public universities in the nation.”

Sidoo, said Gorton, “committed a crime that displayed an unbelievable lack of integrity, morality and common sense.

“You have let your selfish desire, your pride and your enormous wealth overcome all of what you apparently want to stand for with your works of charity,” Gorton told Sidoo.

Sidoo’s philanthropy, derived from his earnings in the capital markets, was central to his sentencing defense. According to Sidoo he has donated several million dollars to charitable causes, such as the University of B.C. football program.

In pleading guilty to fraud, Sidoo avoided a maximum prison term of 20 years and prosecutors subsequently agreed to 90 days behind bars, plus a $250,000 fine and one-year of supervised release, which will not be enforced in Canada by the U.S. Probation Department. Prosecutors also agreed to drop the money laundering charge.

The prison Sidoo goes to is expected to have harsher conditions since his options are limited due to his foreign citizenship. His attorney Martin Weinberg said he is expected to spend 14 days in isolation in a “maximum security setting,” due to COVID-19.

Sidoo will get four days credit for time already served. If he serves the full 90 days he will be released December 17 but will have to spend 14 days in isolation at home should B.C. public health rules for international travellers and COVID-19 continue into the fall.

Gorton said Sidoo’s crime would normally warrant more time in jail but there are mitigating circumstances, such as his remorse, lack of criminal record, philanthropy and “collateral consequences,” such as not being able to enter the U.S. as a felon and being stripped last month of his Order of B.C. medal for community service. Sidoo’s attorneys also previously noted he did not directly pay the universities but that his fraud was limited to cheating on the tests.

The former B.C. Lions football player worked as a stock broker in the 1990s and an investment banker between 2000 and 2010. Since 2010 he has made millions of dollars directing a handful of public companies that have failed to generate wealth for retail investors.

Sidoo was arrested March 8, 2019, in San Jose, California, on charges by the U.S. Department of Justice of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering related to the high-profile U.S. college admissions and bribery scandal, brought to light by a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe dubbed Operation Varsity Blues.

One of dozens of parents to be charged, Sidoo initially pled innocent to paying $200,000 total to scheme mastermind William ‘Rick’ Singer, who hired corrupt exam expert Mark Riddell to take Dylan and Jordan’s SAT exams, in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Sidoo also helped falsify one of his son Jordan’s university applications in October 2013 with an essay that originally included a fake claim of Jordan being held up at gunpoint by gangsters, while he was purported to be an intern for an anti-gang organization.

Co-conspirators Singer and Riddell pled guilty last year in exchange for cooperating with the government’s investigation.

The guilty parties in the case, who used Singer’s criminal services, were generally well-off individuals. Celebrities such as actress Lori Loughlin and her clothing designer husband Mossimo Gianulli and actress Felicity Huffman also pled guilty for related crimes and brought much media attention to the investigation.

Sidoo’s sons had no involvement in their father’s crime.

Jordan is now a 2018 history graduate from University of California Berkeley. Dylan graduated in cinematic arts in 2016 from the University of Southern California (USC). The two previously attended Vancouver’s prestigious St. George’s School.

Neither university has announced whether or not their degrees will remain valid. Dylan, according to the sentencing documents, had scored a 1,460/2,400 SAT score until Riddell, using a fake ID in December 2011, bumped up the score to 1,700, which was high enough for Dylan to enter Chapman University (and later transfer to USC). Riddell then scored 2,280/2,400 for Jordan in December 2012, paving the way to Berkley.

That characterization comes one day after Britain became the last of Canada's ""Five Eyes"" intelligence-sharing allies to ban the Chinese telecommunications firm from its 5G wireless internet.

article continues below

The next generation of wireless internet technology is to be dramatically faster than the current standard, with more bandwidth and faster response times. It's expected to be crucial to technologies such as autonomous vehicles and remote medicine.

Alykhan Velshi, Huawei Canada's vice president of corporate affairs, says the company hopes the Trudeau government's ongoing 5G review steers clear of political machinations by administration of U.S. President Donald Trump to undermine the company.

""We see ourselves as being caught in the middle of the U.S.-China trade war. Canada is also unfortunately caught in the middle of it,"" Velshi said in an interview on Wednesday.

""That is the context in which a lot of announcements and decisions are made, as the Trump administration is demanding that everyone pick a side whether it is actually in their interest to go all in on one side or that other.""

Britain's decision brought it firmly in line with Trump's campaign to have Huawei banned from allied countries, including Canada.

The United States views Huawei as a security threat and says its equipment and technology would serve as a back door for China's communist leaders and military to spy on other countries as they adopt 5G technology — a charge the company firmly denies.

The Trudeau government has delayed a long-awaited decision on whether to allow Huawei to participate in Canada's new 5G network largely because of China's ongoing imprisonment of two Canadian men, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor.

Kovrig and Spavor were arrested nine days after Canada detained Huawei's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, on an American arrest warrant in December 2018. That move is widely seen as retaliation by China to force Canada to release Meng.

Velshi, a lawyer and former Conservative political staffer, called the case against Meng a ""politically driven"" prosecution by Trump, and pointed to a 2018 musing by the president that she could be used as a bargaining chip in his trade negotiation with China.

He said Meng will be vindicated by the Canadian courts when the extent of Trump's political motivation is properly presented.

(The Green party issued a statement along the same lines Wednesday, saying the United States is abusing its extradition treaty with Canada for political purposes and calling on the Canadian government to demand U.S. charges against Meng be dropped.)

But at the same time, Velshi also expressed sympathy for Kovrig and Spavor and reiterated the view of the Canadian arm of his company that diplomats can somehow win their freedom.

""Like all Canadians we're concerned about their detention, we're concerned about their treatment and we want to see them home as soon as possible.""

The tensions between Beijing and Washington intensified on Wednesday following Tuesday's announcement by Britain that Huawei would be excluded from work on the 5G network because U.S. sanctions made it impossible to ensure the safety of Chinese-supplied equipment.

The Trump administration decided in May to block non-U.S. companies from using American technology to produce processor chips and other components for Huawei without Washington's approval.

On Wednesday, the Chinese government accused Britain of colluding with the U.S. to hurt Huawei. The Trump administration fired back by announcing travel bans on employees of Huawei and other Chinese companies that the U.S. determines are assisting authoritarian governments in violating human rights, including against Uighurs in western China.

Velshi said Huawei has faith in the Canadian government's ongoing 5G review and the company has nothing to say about how long it has taken for a decision to be made.

In the meantime, Velshi said that despite the tensions between Beijing and Ottawa, Huawei's revenues in Canada grew in 2019, as did its workforce, which stands at about 1,200 employees. Velshi said the company has not yet made public its 2019 financials.

""We attribute that growth to the fact that our customers … have largely stood by us and continued to buy our products,"" said Velshi.

David Reed, Britain's deputy high commissioner to Canada, had no comment on what Canada should do next, but noted the two countries enjoy strong co-operation in the Five Eyes, which also includes Australia and New Zealand.

Reed said all countries must focus on allowing more companies to thrive in the 5G market.

""The reason we're in this position is there's a global market failure,"" Reed said in an interview. ""That's the conversation we started, particularly with Five Eyes partners, earlier in the year and we're trying to make progress on that.""

John Power, the spokesman for Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains, gave no indication as to when the government would make its decision on which companies can sell 5G gear in Canada. He reiterated that the government would ""not compromise on matters of national security"" but declined to reference specific companies.

""Our government's review will consider technical and security factors, including advice from our security agencies and consider decisions from our allies and partners,"" he said in a statement, adding that it would take into account ""important domestic and international considerations.""

In one cluster, at least 17 cases have been traced to a group of people who met up in Kelowna, some from the Interior and Alberta, others from the Lower Mainland.

“There are a number of people who have been exposed in those events,” said Henry Tuesday.

More troubling still is the emergence of new cases at the Krazy Cherry Fruit Company in Oliver, where two have been identified among migrant workers. They were among 62 cases identified in B.C. between Friday and Monday.

“Public health teams are monitoring the situation closely and have placed restrictions on those living and working on the farm to limit the potential for further transmission,” said Dr. Henry in a written statement today.

But others have expressed concerns that not enough is being done to prevent outbreaks among vulnerable groups. Where newly arrived immigrants were disproportionately affected at earlier outbreaks at poultry plants in Coquitlam, others say migrant agricultural workers still run higher risks due to inadequate housing.

“As anticipated,” said Byron Cruz of Sanctuary Health, an organization that works to protect migrant workers from predatory practices. “We knew that something was going to happen because the situation for housing in that farm is terrible. They were all crowded.”

‘WAY ABOVE MY COMFORT ZONE’

Yesterday, Dr. Henry warned 25 cases a day was “distressing” and “cautionary to us.” And while not unexpected due to the increased travel and social interaction of phase 3, she said “That’s way above my comfort zone.”

Dr. Henry urged anyone who attended Canada Day parties in the vicinity of the Kelowna cluster to self-monitor for even the mildest of symptoms, noting that anyone can be tested should they feel they’ve been exposed.

Just how quickly a province or state can backslide has been painted in stark relief among our neighbours to the south.

In comments to the press Tuesday, Health Minister Adrian Dix pointed to surges in several U.S. states where record breaking daily caseloads in several states have led jurisdictions like California to re-introduce physical distancing protocols, in what Dix described as “lockdown 2.0.”

“All our neighbouring jurisdictions continue to see an increase, whether it’s our neighbouring province to the east, Alberta, or others, Washington, Oregon and California, in Nevada, Arizona and in other American states — we’ve seen record days of new cases of COVID-19 recently,” said Dix.

Here in B.C., Henry said that on Monday, she checked how weekly caseloads are tracking with the province’s modelling that suggests British Columbians keep their social contacts to 65% of normal.

“We are still skirting that line. The RT, the reproductive number, is hovering around one… which is sort of pushing the limits of where we need to be,” she said.

While health officials work to contain the outbreak in Oliver, it’s unclear how a potential surge in cases will affect that calculation, and Byron Cruz of Sanctuary Health said he expects more cases to crop up in coming days due to their tight living quarters.

What is clear is the more cases are contained to a single cluster, the easier they are to track.

“This is going to be our dance over the next few months, where we do what we can do, we travel, we have those social interactions, but we do it in a thoughtful way so we do it with the people we know we’re with,” said Dr. Henry.",[]

The man and woman, who have asked not to be identified, were taken in by what appeared to be a call from their grandson in dire need of help.

article continues below

“The guy sounded so much like our grandson. If he had said ‘Grandma,’ we’d have known [it wasn’t him] right away, but he said ‘Nan’ and so does my grandson,” said the man.

The imposter grandson, who used their grandson’s name, called on Monday and told them he had been driving a friend’s car and struck a vehicle with Quebec licence plates that had turned sharply in front of him.

The fake grandson went on to say he had been taken to jail, but a judge would free him if he could pay for the damage, estimated to be $5,000. The grandparents were told to send money to the car’s owner in Montreal.

“I wasn’t cluing in at all [that this was a scam], he sounded so much like our grandson,” the man said.

The dutiful grandparents then took cash from their bank and went to the Bank of Montreal and using an account number the scammer had provided via an accomplice posing as a lawyer, they sent money to a BMO branch in downtown Montreal.

“The kid said, ‘Please don’t tell Dad,’ ” the man said. It wasn’t until he later talked to his grandson that it became clear they had been scammed.

The couple has since been in touch with police and the Bank of Montreal, which they say has been very helpful.

“They are doing their best to try and get the money back,” said the man, who thinks the scammers “took a shot in the dark and got lucky.”

But according to the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre, it’s likely the scammers mined information like the grandson’s name from social media to make the pitch more convincing.

The centre calls these types of scams “the emergency scam.” It preys on the fear of a loved one being hurt or in trouble. The scammer claims to be someone you know and says they need money immediately. They tend to use scenarios like needing bail money because they’ve been arrested, or being in a car accident, or having trouble returning from a foreign country.

The targets are often seniors and the scammer pretends to be a grandchild, who begs them not to tell their parents that they’re in trouble, the Anti-Fraud Centre said. As a result, the grandparent doesn’t find out until after they’ve sent the money that their grandchild was not the person who asked for help.

Const. Cam MacIntyre said scammers will go to any lengths to defraud a victim.

“They will pose as a family member, a trusted member of the public, or even the police. We strongly recommend that people never deposit money into accounts of people or entities they do know personally,” he said.

“It’s so important to verify where your money is going. Call a family member, a friend, or the police if you are suspicious.”

The Anti-Fraud Centre says there were 18,803 reports of fraud, and 6,671 victims reporting losses of $22.6 million in Canada in the first four months of this year.

MacIntyre suggests if you are in the process of providing financial information or sending money to potential fraudsters, stop immediately.

“Contact your financial institutions and ensure all payments that you have not authorized are stopped. Inform them of the fraud and change both passwords and access information,” he said.

Suspected frauds can be reported to your local police or the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre at 1-888-495-8501.

Kevin McIntosh, who launched the petition on change.org in late May, sent it to politicians on both sides of the border, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump, on Monday.

article continues below

“I propose that the current list of essential reasons for persons to cross the border between Canada and the U.S. be expanded to include those persons owning personal property outside of their home jurisdiction,” McIntosh told lawmakers.

McIntosh, who is now under 14-day quarantine at home following an odyssey to get his boat out of the Point Roberts Marina, told the Optimist he expects the political powers that be to expand the list of essential reasons to cross the border into the American peninsula, hopefully prior to an expected extension of the border closure next week.

Earlier this month McIntosh flew from YVR to Sea-Tac, drove a rental car to Bellingham and then took a chartered flight to Point Roberts, where he prepped his vessel to sail back to Canada.

He said with his boat now back in Canada, his personal situation has been resolved, but he’d like to see others who signed the petition get access to their boats and cottages.

He’s hopeful politicians will agree to expand the definition of essential travel so Canadians with property in Point Roberts can cross the border, so long as they don’t have any contact with local residents and don’t stay for any length of time.

Many who have signed the petition own cottages and worry that without regular maintenance they will fall into disrepair. They raise concerns over rats and raccoons causing damage to vacant buildings as well as the possibility of leaks and other issues. There are also worries about insurance not being valid if structures are unattended for months on end.

Many suggest that crossing the border to check on property should be deemed essential travel so long as those who cross only go to and from their properties.

Delta MP Carla Qualtrough previously told the Optimist she has “a ton of sympathy” for Canadians who can’t get to their cottages and boats, but isn’t sure when they’ll be able to cross the line again.

Qualtrough said she has been in talks with cabinet colleagues in Ottawa as well as people locally in an effort to find a solution that might suit the geographic anomaly, but has yet to come up with one.

“Unfortunately, I don’t see a world where we don’t treat the whole border the same,” she told the Optimist when asked about the unique circumstances in Point Roberts.

She said the best hope for those with property in Point Roberts might be a gradual reopening of the border by region or by type of visitor that could broaden the definition of essential travel.",[]

Only 16 per cent of businesses were confident in B.C.'s restart plan and 47 per cent were not.

Two-thirds of those surveyed were relying on some form of government support and owners were braced for a ""second wave"" of shutdowns or other problems if programs expire too quickly.

Some 28 per cent believed they'll return to normal once programs end, 32 per cent expected to cut workers' hours, 27 per cent anticipated layoffs, and one business in every 10 forecast either temporary or permanent closure.

Owners say payroll and wage supports must remain key components of B.C.'s recovery plan, along with fee and tax cuts.

The joint study by researchers at the B.C. Centre for Disease Control, University of B.C., LifeLabs and public health scientists is posted on the health research website medRxiv and a news conference on the findings is scheduled for Thursday morning.

article continues below

The authors say the findings indicate successful suppression of community transmission in B.C., with an estimated overall infection rate of less than one per cent.

The study looked at anonymous blood samples collected for reasons unrelated to COVID-19 by LifeLabs in March and May, before and after public health measures were introduced.

The first samples in March found two of 869 specimens were positive, for a prevalence of 0.28 per cent, while the May sample found a prevalence of 0.55 per cent.

Health Minister Adrian Dix described the estimated infection rate as ""very low"" and says it shows the effectiveness of British Columbia's public health measures and co-operation of the public.

""It reinforces the fact that we're on the right track,"" Dix says.

""Of course, this is as the study suggests a dual-edged question, a low level of transmission but also very few people with antibodies to deal with potential future spikes of COVID-19.""

If the study's prevalence rate is applied to the whole provincial population, it could mean about 28,000 people have had the novel coronavirus, while 3,149 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed to date, however Dix noted the results are specific to the Vancouver area.

Health officials have repeatedly said that more people have been infected with the virus than have tested positive and Dix calls the estimated prevalence rate in B.C. ""encouraging.""

""Overall the level of infection in B.C. was low and that's due to the actions of people in B.C. That said, there are more people who were infected with COVID-19 than tested positive and that's something we've said clearly, especially in the period of March and April when we were focusing our testing program particularly on specific groups including health-care workers,"" Dix says.

The study is the first of its kind in Canada, he says.

The study is also important because it involved people who did not self-select for COVID-19 testing, so they likely didn't believe they had the virus, Dix says.

The study was authorized by provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry and approved by the clinical research ethics board of the university. It has not yet been peer reviewed.

British Columbia recorded 21 new cases Wednesday and no new deaths. There are 207 active cases while 2,753 people who tested positive have recovered, the government said in a news release.

The fiscal and economic report released a week ago detailed the Liberals' financial expectations, including a $343.2-billion deficit due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Parliamentary budget officer Yves Giroux says in a report that there are other numbers behind the biggest ones that MPs and senators should question.

He points to projections that enterprise Crown corporations, such as the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. and Business Development Bank of Canada, will collectively lose $12 billion this fiscal year.

Giroux notes that loss is a sharp turnaround from the $7.3 billion in gains for the 12-month period ending in March.

He says losses are unusual for these Crown corporations and adds that each should provide detailed projections to Parliament as soon as possible about its COVID-19 liquidity programs.

Similarly, Giroux says the Liberals should provide details of their own borrowing, which his office estimates will exceed by $150 billion the ceiling set by federal legislation.

The budget office estimates the government's planned debt issuance this fiscal year of $713 billion will cost $2.2 billion annually in interest.

The report released Thursday also notes $4.4 billion in spending for measures the government has yet to announce.

All the spending is expected to push the federal debt past the $1-trillion mark.

The Liberals had previously made a declining debt-to-GDP ratio key to their fiscal plans, but skyrocketing spending will push the ratio to 49 per cent from 31.1 per cent.

Giroux says fiscal transparency and accountability would be enhanced if the Liberals identify their new ""fiscal anchor,"" how they'll measure their own successful handling of the budget and national economy, which wasn't specifically laid out in the update last week.

Coroner Paul Dionne says 32-year-old Ihor Horbanov died of multiple trauma on March 11, 2019, after his car hit the pothole near Contrecoeur, Que., and crashed behind a Transport Department truck.

In his report published in April, Dionne notes the segment of Autoroute 30 where the accident occurred was known to be problematic.

Dionne also says emergency repairs were conducted on that stretch of road three days prior to the fatal incident.

He notes, however, the department has since taken steps to repair the highway and to review the way potholes are identified and fixed.

Dionne says Horbanov's car was otherwise in good condition and he had not consumed any alcohol when he skidded off the road while driving with his family.

""The ruin of the First Nations and peoples of Canada is not just statistics. As seen here, it is real pain,"" Justice Chris Martin said in a written decision delivered July 10.

Anthony McKay was sentenced to four years after pleading guilty to manslaughter in the death of his mother, Shirley McKay. He faces two years behind bars, after receiving credit for time already served, and will be subject to three years of supervised probation after that.

""As a human, Mrs. McKay deserved better. And, like anyone born in this bountiful country, her son, her killer, deserved a better start, a better chance, in life,"" Martin wrote.

The judge said the killing on the Berens River First Nation, about 300 kilometres north of Winnipeg, was a ""calamity of almost 150 years of government policy, actions and inactions affecting the Indigenous community.""

Anthony McKay, who was 21 at the time, went to his mother's home after a night of drinking on June 22, 2018.

Court was told there was blood everywhere when a cousin came over about 8 a.m. The cousin found Shirley McKay unconscious and badly beaten. Her son has said he doesn't know why he viciously beat her.

The woman was taken to a nursing station before being transported to a hospital in Winnipeg. Her son visited her in hospital daily and was overheard at her bedside sobbing and apologizing.

Court heard he was confronted by a stepbrother and admitted that he had hurt his mother.

Shirley McKay died that September. Her son was arrested the following month.

""She did not recover and died months later, another victim in a mass of slain Aboriginal women,"" Martin said. ""He pled guilty to manslaughter, joining an appalling line of young Aboriginals ending up in prison.""

Crown prosecutors were asking for a seven-year sentence in a federal penitentiary. The defence asked for two years behind bars plus the probation so that McKay could have access to programming available in provincial custody.

The judge pointed to impacts of colonization, the pass system which restricted Indigenous Peoples' movement, residential schools and the '60s Scoop in his sentencing.

""It is well accepted that the government's role, since the early days of dealing with First Nations peoples, has had the effect of isolating, infantilizing, marginalizing, and traumatizing Indigenous societies like the Ojibwa (or Anishinaabe) of Berens River,"" Martin wrote.

""Mr. McKay is a person shaped by a system historically designed to 'take the Indian out of the Indian.'""

Reports provided to the judge on McKay's background said he has partial fetal alcohol syndrome.

One of 13 siblings, he spent most of his time in foster homes on the First Nation or more often in Winnipeg. His parents struggled with alcohol and sniffing substances, and McKay followed a similar path starting when he was 13. His father died in 2010.

McKay was neglected and not cared for, files from child and family services said. He asked to become a permanent ward of child welfare in 2013 because he didn't feel safe with his family.

Martin said McKay's troubled upbringing doesn't excuse his behaviour, but does help explain why he is who he is.

Occasionally it is incumbent on a judge to underscore systemic issues, he said, adding Indigenous people are disproportionately affected by serious crime and disproportionately incarcerated.

""Like so many other cases, this case is troubling, not only for its specific facts, but because it reminds that core issues affecting many in the Indigenous population are not really being addressed sufficiently or urgently enough,"" Martin wrote.

""Many in this and the next generation of Indigenous people are at risk.""

Mohammed Shahed, a member of the governing party who regularly appeared on TV talk shows, was arrested Wednesday by the Rapid Action Battalion near the Indian border after a nine-day manhunt.

article continues below

Shahed is chairman of the Regent Group and owner of two Regent hospitals in the capital, Dhaka.

Abdul Baten, a commissioner of the Detective Branch in Dhaka, said Shahed admitted after his arrest that his hospitals did not have proper equipment to conduct coronavirus tests.

A court in Dhaka on Thursday allowed investigators to keep Shahed in custody for 10 days for questioning.

Officials said the hospitals had issued more than 10,000 coronavirus test results and about 60% were fake even though patients were charged for them. The hospitals allegedly arranged for the remaining tests to be conducted by another hospital.

The two hospitals had not renewed their medical licenses for years, but the Ministry of Health nevertheless signed a deal with Shahed to dedicate the hospitals to coronavirus testing and treatment as the number of cases rose in Bangladesh.

Bangladesh on Thursday was nearing 200,000 confirmed coronavirus cases, including 2,496 deaths. Public health experts say the actual number is much higher because only about 70 testing facilities are available in the country of 160 million people.

Shahed belongs to the governing Awami League party headed by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and is a member of its foreign affairs subcommittee. He has more than 50 illegal cases pending against him across the country on various charges including forgery and cheating.

Another doctor and her husband were also arrested recently on similar charges of falsifying test results.

Local media reports say the scams could hurt Bangladesh’s earnings from overseas workers. Last week, Italy suspended all flights from Bangladesh to Rome after some Bangladeshis reportedly presented fake negative test reports for the coronavirus.

Bangladesh earns about $19 billion a year from about 10 million overseas workers. Authorities said about 15,000 Bangladeshi workers with jobs in Italy remain stranded in Bangladesh and it is unclear whether they will be able to travel to the European country.

Bangladesh has reopened businesses including its main export-earning garment sector after a monthslong closure.",[]

The Anti-Defamation league and some Jewish leaders had condemned what they called anti-Semitic theories expressed by Cannon and demanded the apology.

article continues below

""First and foremost I extend my deepest and most sincere apologies to my Jewish sisters and brothers for the hurtful and divisive words that came out of my mouth during my interview with Richard Griffin,"" Cannon said on his Twitter account.

""They reinforced the worst stereotypes of a proud and magnificent people and I feel ashamed of the uninformed and naïve place that these words came from. The video of this interview has since been removed.""

ViacomCBS cut ties with the TV host and producer Tuesday in response to his comments on a podcast where he discussed racial bias.

Rabbi Abraham Cooper, the Simon Wiesenthal Center’s associate dean, told The Associated Press that Cannon reached out to him Wednesday and during a 30-minute telephone conversation he apologized to the Jewish community and Cooper asked him to post it on social media.

""He started out the right way, he said the right things. Half an hour is a long time, and we'll probably meet tomorrow in the LA area,"" Cooper said.

""He understood that the words and references that he thought were based on fact, turned out to be hateful propaganda and stereotypical rhetoric.""

The TV host and producer wrote earlier a lengthy Facebook post defending himself and criticizing his firing for what the company deemed ""bigotry"" and ""anti-Semitism,"" prominent members of the U.S. Jewish community said the post fell well short and demanded an apology.

""It’s not enough to say, ‘I’m not a racist, I’m not a bigot,’"" Cooper had told the AP earlier. ""The statements he made are hurtful, and they’re false.""

Cooper said Cannon should read and heed the words of Martin Luther King Jr., who ""dedicated his life for civil rights for all and a colour-blind America."" Cooper also had advised him to seek out the guidance of basketball Hall of Famer-turned-writer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who has condemned several sports and entertainment celebrities for anti-Semitic posts.

In the hour-plus episode of ""Cannon's Class"" released last month that prompted his firing, Cannon and Richard ""Professor Griff"" Griffin, formerly of the rap group Public Enemy, contended that Black people are the true Hebrews and Jews have usurped that identity.

Cannon then argued that lighter-skinned people — ""Jewish people, white people, Europeans"" — ""are a little less"" and have a ""deficiency"" that historically caused them to act out of fear and commit acts of violence to survive.

""They had to be savages,"" he said.

""When I first heard about the comments Mr. Cannon made, it was very, very disappointing,"" said Oren Segal, director of the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism. ""We’re in a time where hatred of all kinds is very much apparent. It’s in the news every day.""

""Anti-Semitism in particular over the past several years has been something that we've seen in increase , as well as racism and other issues,"" Segal added. ""So when you hear an individual who has a public profile, who has influence over people, make statements that are highly offensive to the Jewish community, the first reaction is disappointment.""

Anti-Semitic violent attacks rose worldwide by 18% in 2019 compared with the previous year, according to a report published in April by Tel Aviv University’s Kantor Center for the Study of Contemporary Jewry.

Segal said some members of the Black Hebrew Israelite movement see themselves as the true ""chosen people,"" and believe that Blacks, Hispanics and Native Americans are the true descendants of the 12 Tribes of Israel. He noted that not all spew hateful rhetoric, although many adhere to an extreme set of anti-Semitic beliefs.

Bruce D. Haynes, a professor of sociology at the University of California, Davis, who has been studying Black Jews for more than two decades, agreed that the remarks echo the ideas of extreme Black Hebrew Israelites and of Minister Louis Farrakhan, the Nation of Islam leader who last year referenced ""Satanic Jews"" in a speech denying allegations of anti-Semitism. But Haynes took a more nuanced view.

""The danger is that those groups get confused with other self-identified Israelites like (Rabbi) Capers Funnye, who has a congregation in Chicago, and who is very much involved with the Ashkenazim Jewish community. So I want to make clear that the term 'Israelites' is a tricky term,"" he said.

""Is it anti-Semitic to say Black people are the real Israelites or the real Jews? I’m not sure I’d call it anti-Semitism,"" Haynes said. ""It’s not a good reading of history, but I wouldn’t call it anti-Semitism. On the other hand, some of those groups that call Jews impostors certainly cross the line.""

Until his firing, Cannon produced ""Wild ’n Out,"" a comedy improv series for VH1, the ViacomCBS-owned cable channel.

In an earlier Facebook post, he had said that he welcomes being held accountable and takes responsibility for his words, while also accusing the company of trying to silence an ""outspoken black man"" and demanding full ownership of the ""Wild ’n Out"" brand.

""I do not condone hate speech nor the spread of hateful rhetoric. ... The Black and Jewish communities have both faced enormous hatred, oppression persecution and prejudice for thousands of years and in many ways have and will continue to work together to overcome these obstacles,"" he wrote.

Cooper had said that Cannon should reject Farrakhan’s hate speech and ""reduce the long statement to two sentences"" — a simple apology, which he did after their conversation.

""I just had the blessed opportunity to converse with Rabbi Abraham Cooper director of global social action @SimonWiesenthal. My first words to my brother was, I apologize for the hurt I caused the Jewish Community"" Cannon tweeted.

""On my podcast I used words & referenced literature I assumed to be factual to uplift my community instead turned out to be hateful propaganda and stereotypical rhetoric that pained another community For this I am deeply sorry but now together we can write a new chapter of healing.""

""My hope is that this series can be a place to explore meaningful topics together and sort through so many of the questions we’re all trying to answer in our own lives,"" Obama said in a statement.

The new podcast is the first title in the ongoing collaboration between Spotify and Higher Ground, a production company founded by Barack and Michelle Obama. Last year, the former president and first lady partnered with Spotify to produce exclusive podcasts for the platform.

Michelle Obama’s new podcast expects to hold candid and personal conversations with a focus on topics concerning relationships and health. She expects to have several guests on the series including talk-show host Conan O’Brien and Valerie Jarrett, business woman and former senior advisor to Barack Obama.

""Perhaps most of all, I hope this podcast will help listeners open up new conversations — and hard conversations —- with the people who matter most to them,"" she said. ""That’s how we can build more understanding and empathy for one another.""

Obama released her Netflix documentary ""Becoming"" in May. The project was an extension of her 2018 bestselling memoir of the same name and a kind of authorized filmic portrait of Obama.

The Census Bureau reported Thursday that retail sales are 1.1% higher than their levels from a year ago, after a brutal plunge in March and April was offset by a decent rebound in May and June. But any gains might be short-lived as infections began to rise toward the end of June.

""While today’s report gives the illusion of a fearless consumer spending lavishly, the reality is more sobering: consumers are increasingly fearful amid new spikes in COVID-19 cases and a looming fiscal cliff,"" said Lydia Boussour, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics.

The report shows how shoppers and businesses are adjusting to life in a pandemic, changing their habits in hopes of halting an illness that can quickly flare-up and wreak financial havoc.

Bars in Texas shuttered again at the end of last month as infections surged in that state. Pennsylvania this week ordered that restaurants can only seat 25% of their potential customers. Gap, Kohl’s and other stores are withdrawing clothes worn in their changing rooms from sales floors for several days as a precautionary move. Adding to all this pressure are signs that the recovery in consumer spending began to stall at the end of last month, according to analysis of credit cards by the bank JPMorgan Chase.

""I suspect the modest pullback we have seen in our card spending data since late June is driven by concern about the resurgence of COVID-19,"" said Jesse Edgerton, an economist with the bank.

June's retail numbers showed the complicated nature of an uncertain recovery.

Non-store sales—which includes online shopping—slumped 2.4% over the past month but are 23.5% higher from a year ago. Spending at restaurants and bars jumped 20% last month, but it's still down 26.3% from last year. Sales at clothiers more than doubled between May and June, yet they've collapsed 23.2% from a year ago.

Shoppers have responded by shifting their spending, and not only to online retailers. Sales at building materials stores were up 17.3% annually. Stores in the sporting goods, musical instrument, books and hobbies categories have enjoyed yearly growth of 20.6%. Purchases at grocers have increased 11.7% over the past year.",[]

Asa Hutchinson issued an order Thursday requiring people to wear face masks in public throughout the state, which has had a surge in coronavirus cases over the past several weeks.

The Republican governor had resisted a statewide mask mandate and opposed issuing a stay-at-home order earlier in the pandemic, but he signed the order requiring masks when social distancing isn't possible in the hopes of slowing the disease's rapid spread in the state. The order takes effect Monday.

article continues below

Hutchinson’s decision comes amid growing support for mask requirements from business and health leaders and a day after Bentonville-based Walmart said it would require customers to wear masks in all of its U.S. stores. The state’s largest newspaper, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, also called for a statewide requirement on Thursday.

Hutchinson previously encouraged people to wear masks and allowed cities to pass ordinances requiring their use, but he stopped short of requiring them statewide. He’s the latest Republican governor to relent on the mask issue in the face of a surge in COVID-19 cases. Alabama's governor issued a similar mask mandate on Wednesday.

Arkansas' coronavirus cases have dramatically risen since May, when the state began allowing businesses that had closed because of the pandemic to reopen despite warnings from national health officials about the risks of doing so too soon. Arkansas was one of a handful of states that did not issue a broader stay-at-home order that kept most businesses closed.

Hutchinson previously questioned how a mask mandate could be enforced in a rural state such as Arkansas, but this week he left open the possibility of such a requirement. The chancellor of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences called for a statewide requirement last weekend.

Hutchinson's order was expected to face criticism from some conservatives in the state. Hours before he issued the order, a Republican legislator urged people to call Hutchinson to oppose any mask directive.

A poll by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business suggested tensions are flaring between workers and employers, with around 27 per cent of 3,389 employers polled indicating some of their laid-off staff have refused to return to work.

article continues below

Of the nearly 870 businesses that provided the reasons their employees gave for refusing to return to work, 62 per cent reported workers ""prefer the Canada Emergency Response Benefit."" Employers could choose more than one explanation for why a worker refused to return, and respondents also selected options such as concern for health (47 per cent), childcare obligations (27 per cent) or lack of hours in return offer (16 per cent).

CFIB president Dan Kelly said it's ""clear"" that CERB ""created a disincentive to return to work for some staff, especially in industries like hospitality."" Other sectors where conflicts are arising include child care, dental offices, home health care, amusement parks, gambling and spectator sports, the study suggested.

""CERB was created as emergency support for workers who had lost their job due to the pandemic, not to fund a summer break,"" Kelly said in a statement.

But Ian Robb, Canadian director of the Unite Here union that represents hospitality workers, disagrees. He said workers are impatient to return to work — for what is usually the lucrative summer season — but employers are the ones failing to adopt measures like frequent cleaning and wage subsidies. The union previously estimated that average wages in cities like Toronto are around $20 per hour for hospitality.

""A number of our members in the U.S. have gone to work and contracted (COVID-19),"" Robb said.

""There's just not enough safety in front of service. Nobody wants to stay home and make two grand when they can make double that by working.""

The survey suggested that the hospitality sector had the biggest share of employers, 45 per cent, who had trouble recalling workers. CFIB defines hospitality as including hotels, restaurants and bars.

The CFIB study suggests that in the hospitality sector, 56 per cent of hard-to-fill positions were ""unskilled, entry-level jobs"" that pay ""at or around minimum wage,"" although across sectors, skilled and semi-skilled jobs were harder to fill.

Employment and human rights lawyer Neena Gupta says she has heard of tradespeople unable to perform jobs because workers failed to return.

She said the reason an employee is refusing the work matters. Lack of childcare, like daycare and camps, can be a job-protected reason for staying home, as can disabilities such as being immunocompromised, says Gupta, a partner in Gowling WLG's Waterloo Region and Toronto offices.

The federal government's website states that workers seeking CERB, which offers $500 per week over a limited period, ""should be seeking work opportunities and/or return to work when their employer makes a request for their return, provided they are able and it is reasonable to do so."" The government's COVID-19 guidelines also provide for employees to refuse to do a dangerous job, although the worker must already ""be at work"" to refuse such a task.

However, notes Gupta, general apprehension about the pandemic is likely not enough to merit a job refusal. She said workplaces must comply with health and safety guidelines, and that a ministry inspection must find some sort of violation to justify a job refusal.

Managers should give workers a written ""come back to work"" recall and an indication that it will be treated as job abandonment if the worker doesn't return, says Gupta. After that process is completed, the employer could consider that worker terminated for cause, and hire a replacement.

While reporting misuse of CERB by a former employee might appear to give an employer some moral satisfaction, Gupta says it’s unlikely to help with staffing concerns or worker morale.

""I do ask people to be reasonable. You can’t call someone at noon on a Thursday and expect them in at 7 a.m. on Friday,"" she says.

The agreement will be presented Friday to the Superior Court of Quebec for approval to become the new so-called stalking horse bid for any rival offers that may be presented next month.

A lawyer representing Quebecor suggested last week that the media conglomerate intended to make a bid.

The shareholders — the Texan fund TPG Capital, the Chinese firm Fosun and the Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec — presented a US$420-million bid June 29 when Cirque filed for creditor protection. They were counting on a US$200-million loan from the Quebec government.

The shareholders and Cirque agreed to terminate the agreement, said a Cirque statement Thursday.

""The shareholder's proposed agreement, which had set the bar for other bids, assured a path to survival following the forced closure of all of the shows resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic by providing the company funding, support, and a clear road map to relaunch,"" said the statement.

The lenders, who hold about $1 billion of the Cirque's secured debt, would inject up to $375 million, create a fund to retain employees and pay ex-workers and artisans, and maintain the company's head office in Montreal, according to a source familiar with the matter, but who is not allowed to speak publicly.

""The co-operation of the group of creditors has been extraordinary in order to achieve our objective of recapitalizing the Cirque,"" Gabriel de Alba, the managing director and partner of Catalyst Capital Group, the main creditor, said in a statement.

Deprived of income since mid-March due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Cirque cancelled its 44 shows and cut nearly 3,500 people.

The Richmond standout has signed with Ryerson University in Toronto for the next four years following an extensive recruiting process.

What began with enquiries from 61 schools on both sides of the border back in 2018, Gillis’ emphasis on her studies created a shortlist of six potential destinations with four wanting to sign her last September. Impressed with Ryerson’s renowned design tech program, she made a verbal commitment to head coach Wayne Nishihama a month later and officially signed with the program on Monday.

The Rams play in the Ontario Intercollegiate Women’s Fastpitch Association with a fall schedule that typically concludes in early October.

What made Gillis an attractive recruit is being as a multi-positional player, capable of playing both infield and outfield — skills she learned while being coached by her dad in her grassroots years with the Richmond Girls Softball Association.

She stayed with the RSGA program through to U12 when her team won the provincial title. She then took her talents to the US for the next four years — playing on two teams and serving as a pick-up at showcase tournaments which are designed to draw the attention of college and university scouts. Along the way, Gillis won a pair of Washington State championships.

At the age of 15 she drew the attention of Tyron McKinney a batting coach with the US women's national team, along with Heather Tarr, head coach and assistant Lance Glasoe at the University of Washington, when she finished second in a senior batting competition. All three would become involved in her further development as a player.

Gillis eventually returned home to focus more on her education and played with the White Rock Renegades. She was joined by two other local players — Emma Perry and Caitlin Bradley-Tse — and won bronze at the 2019 Canadian Championships.

The Grade 12 McMath student is returning to the RGSA for her senior year to play for one of her favourite coaches — Eric Gee — bringing her minor softball career full circle.

Other coaches Gillis credits for her development include Charlotte Dolan (White Rock), Phil Smith (Washington State), along with Tyron, Tarr, coach Lance and her father Dave.

Making friends all over the United States, Canada and Japan has been an amazing experience with far too many girls to mention. She does thank Stacey Stanchek, Ali Agular and Correy Hootch along with other members of the UW women's softball team for always making time for her, answering her questions and serving as mentors.",[]

Now he safely waits at his Victoria home wondering when he will be back on the field again.

COVID-19 has postponed the four remaining tournaments on the World Series schedule in London, Paris, Singapore and Hong Kong. Even bigger, the Summer Olympic Games have been pushed back to 2021 with the International Olympic Committee announcing the new dates (July 23 to Aug. 8) on Monday.

It’s almost hard to imagine the Vancouver tournament was such a short time ago given where the world is today.

“It’s crazy. Obviously we knew about COVID-19 and we talked about it but cancelling the tournament wasn’t even in question at that time. I didn’t even think about it,”recalled Hirayama. “Then a couple of days later (NBA player) Rudy Gobert tested positive and that’s when things kind of blew up.

“We were supposed to have been back on the field that Friday and it elevated even further. Training got cancelled. At that time we thought if (the Vancouver) tournament was held a weekend later it might not have even happened which would have been a shame.”

The Richmond native would soon learn the Canadian Olympic Committee would not be sending a team to Tokyo this summer. Fortunately, the Games were postponed 48 hours later.

“It seems silly for us to be worrying about playing a sport right now,” Hirayama continued. “Obviously a lot of us have sacrificed a lot of time and stuff for the Olympics and it was very, very important. It is my life and it is a lot of our lives but certainly there are a lot more important things going on right now in the world that should take precedent.”

Getting the opportunity to represent his country at an Olympic Games has provided Hirayama with motivation for much of his time with the national team program.

He recalls a decade ago when the process began of rugby sevens becoming an Olympic sport. Canada then missed out on a berth when it debuted at the 2016 Games in Rio.

“Some people wanted to go overseas and play professionally but it has kind of been my goal. Just how cool it would be to play rugby at the Olympics,” said the McRoberts graduate.

“There was a big group of us that stuck together for four or five years to hopefully achieve that goal. To not do it and just come (one game) short of going to Rio was heartbreaking. That being said who knows what would have happened the last four years had we gone there. Maybe some guys would have stopped playing after that Olympics.

“There’s a silver lining there. We have had some amazing accomplishments (like winning the Singapore tournament in 2017). Some of my most memorable things personally that I will always look back have happened over the last few years.”

The Olympics being pushed back doesn’t change Hirayama’s career outlook.

At 32, his game has never been better — earning all-tournament team honours in Vancouver. He attends regular work outs at the Rugby Canada training centre in nearby Langford with the same passion as his teenage days with the Richmond Rugby Club.

Once normality returns, he is looking at what could be an extended World Series schedule with the four postponed tournaments played in the fall before jumping into the 2020-21 season next December in Dubai and Capetown.

“I was just going to re-evaluate everything (if the Olympics did take place). This kind of makes my decision for me,” added Hirayama. “Just push it back and hopefully everything works out, not just for the Olympics, but for the world, first and foremost.”",[]

For the 2020-21 season, the cap was estimated to be $84 million to $88.2 million, depending on a few factors.

That has changed.

article continues below

The suspension caused by COVID-19 and the uncertain future of the 2019-20 season leaves next season’s salary cap in serious jeopardy.

That’s because the cap is tied to league revenues. There’s meant to be a 50/50 split in revenues between the owners and the players. If there’s a drop in revenue for the owners — from a loss of gate revenue for unplayed or unattended games, unplayed playoff games, or a crashing Canadian dollar — then the NHL’s Collective Bargaining Agreement leads to less money for the players the following season in the form of a reduced salary cap.

A significant increase in the salary cap would have been a major relief for a team close to the cap like the Vancouver Canucks. The Canucks were set to have a tough time navigating the cap next season, thanks to the combination of a few highly-paid veterans, performance bonuses for young stars rolling over from this current season, Roberto Luongo’s cap recapture penalty, and several restricted and unrestricted free agents they need to re-sign.

If the salary cap went up, it’s possible the Canucks wouldn’t have to choose between UFAs Jacob Markstrom, Tyler Toffoli and Chris Tanev, but could re-sign all three. A flat cap — one that stayed at $81.5 million — would force the Canucks to choose two and possibly lose another player like Troy Stecher or Josh Leivo.

If the cap goes down? Then the Canucks are in some serious trouble, with difficult decisions to make that will undoubtedly make the team worse for next season. And they’re not the only ones: plenty of other teams would feel the cap crunch from this unprecedented situation.

Potential solutions could include an artificially inflated cap, but one option that has come up in NHL circles is compliance buyouts, with Brian Burke discussing it recently on Oilers Now, a radio program with Global News.

“I’ve heard discussion of compliance buyouts to help teams get to this new cap, to solve some of their problems,” said Burke. “In the last CBA, each team got two cap-compliance buyouts which were exempt from the cap.”

A compliance buyout would differ from a regular buyout in that it wouldn’t cost money against the salary cap. For instance, the Canucks will still have a little over $1 million against next season’s cap from buying out Ryan Spooner, but the Canucks bought out Keith Ballard and David Booth in 2013 and 2014 at no cost to their cap as compliance buyouts after the 2012-13 lockout.

If teams do get a compliance buyout, it seems obvious who the Canucks would use it on. Loui Eriksson has a $6 million cap hit for two more seasons following this one and has found himself in an increasingly-diminished role, playing primarily as a shutdown, defensive forward, with little-to-no contributions offensively.

The Canucks do have other options, however. Brandon Sutter has lost several steps and has a $4.375 million cap hit next season. They could be proactive and buy out Tyler Myers’ $6 million contract for the next four seasons before his play starts to decline. Cutting their losses on Micheal Ferland’s $3.5 million cap hit for the next three seasons might be smart. They might even be tempted to buy out Sben Baertschi’s $3.37 million contract with him buried in the AHL.

Do any of those supersede Eriksson? Probably not. Where it gets interesting is if teams get two buyouts, as they did in 2013 and 2014. Buying out Eriksson would be a given, then, but who would be the second buyout? Sutter has just one year left on his contract, Ferland’s cap hit isn’t overly onerous, and Tyler Myers is still a good, useful player.

One compliance buyout would make it far easier for the Canucks to re-sign Markstrom and Tanev. Two might mean re-signing Toffoli as well.

Stick-taps and Glove-drops

A tap of the stick to Eddie Lackas he announced his retirement from professional hockey on Monday. The former Canuck said the “best time in my career” was in Vancouver and thanked the fans sincerely.

A big stick-tap to Bauer. The hockey equipment manufacturer has modified its production line to produce protective visors for healthcare workers, with Quebec already ordering 300,000 visors for their doctors, nurses, and first responders.

Big Numbers

89 In four seasons with the Canucks, Loui Eriksson has a total of 38 goals and 89 points. He had 30 goals and 63 points in just one season with the Boston Bruins prior to signing with the Canucks.

4 So far, four NHL players have tested positive for COVID-19: two from the Ottawa Senators and two from the Colorado Avalanche. The Senators’ radio colour commentator, Gord Wilson, has also tested positive, as has St. Louis Blues’ play-by-play announcer John Kelly.

A cracked bone? Good to go. What about a sore shoulder? No problem.

It's well-known NHLers battle through aches, pains and even illness. Almost like clockwork, a flu bug tears through more than a few locker rooms every season. Players often attempt to soldier on without missing any time, especially when the games matter most.

In the era of COVID-19, however, some of that old the definition of ""toughness"" is being thrown out the window.

Players and coaches are keenly aware that if they're feeling even the slightest bit off — and there are a laundry list of symptoms associated with the novel coronavirus, from chills to headaches to fatigue and weakness — it needs to be reported immediately.

""Doesn't matter if you're a tough hockey player or not,"" said Tippett, now the head coach of the Edmonton Oilers. ""I had a lot of games where I hid a broken finger or something like that from doctors. I didn't want them to know because they wouldn't let me play.

""But when you get sick, you're going to have to tell people. That's just the way of the new world.""

The NHL opened training camps this week as part of its plan to kickstart a campaign that was suspended in mid-March by the pandemic. Players and staff are getting tested every 48 hours — they're not currently quarantined — and that will be kick up another notch to once a day when the 24 teams involved in the resumption head to the hub cities of Edmonton and Toronto, where they'll be kept in a bubble separate from the general public.

Vancouver Canucks captain Bo Horvat said the mentality of the past has been turned on its head when it comes to illness.

""As hockey players you want to be in every single game, you want to play, and you want to help your teammate, and you want to be a difference-maker,"" he said. ""Before you played through colds, you played through injuries, you played through sickness and stuff like that.

""You have to step back and think a little bit now. It's a different animal, this virus. You have to be not only cautious of yourself and how you're feeling, but the people around you, too. It's not just your teammates, it's the medical staff, it's the trainers, it's everybody you're around every single day, and even obviously opposing teams. You've got to think of everybody. You've got to be very cautious.""

Edmonton Oilers centre and NHL leading scorer Leon Draisaitl said that caution is going to become the new norm.

""Every hockey player has played through certain things and we've all played through a flu or sickness or whatever it is,"" he said. ""But now with this going around, it makes it a little more dangerous.

""You have to be careful.""

Winnipeg Jets centre Andrew Copp said hockey's team-first mentality should kick in if someone isn't feeling right.

""You hope that everyone's pretty dialled in, and not only for everyone's health and safety, but for the team too,"" he said. ""If this guy gets it, he's not playing. Hopefully everyone can realize that we're all making a lot of sacrifices here.""

The NHL hasn't said how many positive tests would constitute the ""uncontrolled outbreak"" listed in its return-to-play protocol that could conceivably shut the league's resumption down. There's a difference between cases being spread out and a cluster of infections on a team or teams.

The league said earlier this week 30 players tested positive for COVID-19 during voluntary workouts at team facilities between June 8 and July 12. Another 13 positive results came outside of the league's protocol, while 10 other players tested positive in the spring. Training camps opened Monday, but individuals and teams won't be named moving forward with regards to positive tests.

It's no secret players have hid countless injuries in the past, and the league has been criticized heavily for how it dealt with the concussion issue, but Mathieu Schneider, special assistant to NHLPA executive director Don Fehr, said the virus is different territory.

""If concussions were contagious, I think players would feel differently about it,"" Schneider said. ""Guys certainly understand the notion that if they are not honest with symptoms or how they might feel, that they put their entire team in jeopardy.

""There's going to be a huge onus on the players here in (training camp) to make sure that they're taking care of themselves and looking out for their teammates — going to the rink, going home, going to the grocery store, social distancing, wearing mask, washing your hands. All the things that all of us are practising every single day now.""

Toronto Maple Leafs defenceman Morgan Rielly said it simply comes down to common sense is in this new reality.

""It's on the players and our staff to be honest with each other,"" he said. ""You don't want to put anyone else at risk.

""You want to do what's best for them.""

Matthews finished third in the NHL with a career-high 47 goals, one behind Maurice (Rocket) Richard Trophy co-winners Alex Ovechkin and David Pastrnak, while also topping the Maple Leafs with a career-best 80 points in 70 games.

The 22-year-old Scottsdale, Ariz., native also established a career-low with eight penalty minutes, tied for the fewest among the NHL's top 100 scorers. He did so while sharing second place in the League in takeaways (78) and ranking eighth among NHL forwards in total time on ice (1,467 minutes 52 seconds).

The 18-year veteran quarterback headlines the Canadian Football Hall of Fame's 2020 class that was unveiled Thursday. Burris, 45, got the nod in his first year of eligibility, becoming just the 21st player ever to do so but second in as many years after Calgary running back Jon Cornish in 2019.

article continues below

Joining Burris in the player category are offensive linemen Clyde Brock and Freddie Childress and quarterback Greg Vavra. John Hufnagel, the Calgary Stampeders president/GM, and Larry Uteck (posthumously), the former head coach/athletic director at Saint Mary’s University, were both named as builders.

Burris's family — wife Nicole and sons Armand and Barron — had known of his induction since February but managed to keep quiet about it until about two and a half weeks ago when the Hall of Fame informed Burris. Even then, the Burris clan was very nonchalant in asking the former quarterback to take in what he thought was a run-of-the-mill video.

Instead, Burris watched Hall of Famer Damon Allen (2012) outline his pro football journey to Canada, which drew a rather bewildered look from Burris. Then Allen detailed Burris's stellar CFL career before Mark DeNobile, the Hall of Fame's executive director, delivered the big news.

And the player, affectionately dubbed Smilin' Hank because of his outgoing personality, was lost for words as tears streamed down his face.

""Yeah, they got me good,"" Burris said with a chuckle. ""What's funny is whenever I've told the boys to keep anything quiet, they've always gone back to their mother and yet they didn't say a peep about this.

""I was lost for words just because to hear it shows you that people appreciated the things you did throughout your career. This is the way for the league and all the organizations and the fans saying, 'Thank you,' and for me I'm humbled by it . . . there's so many guys in there (Hall of Fame) who I looked up to and now to be able to join them is a dream come true.""

The six-foot-one, 190-pound Burris, a native of Spiro, Okla., played 20 pro seasons, 18 in the CFL with the Calgary Stampeders (1997-99, 2005-11), Saskatchewan Roughriders (2000, 2003-04), Hamilton Tiger-Cats (2012-13) and Ottawa Redblacks (2014-16). Burris also spent time with the NFL's Green Bay Packers (2001) and Chicago Bears (2002).

Burris appeared in five Grey Cups, winning three (1998, '08, '16) and being named the MVP twice (2008, '16). The CFL's outstanding player on two occasions (2010, 2015), Burris amassed 63,639 passing yards and 373 TD passes — both third all-time.

Burris retired shortly after leading Ottawa to a thrilling 39-33 overtime Grey Cup upset win over Calgary. He threw for 461 yards and three TDs despite suffering a knee injury during warmups.

Burris said his Hall of Fame induction is as much a testament to his family's resilience and perseverance as it is his on-field accomplishments.

""I had to take my wife all over Canada, drag my kids all over Canada and force them to make new friends just for dad to be able to play this game called football,"" said Burris, whose family still calls Ottawa home. ""And for them to understand and see just the emotions that ran through me . . . it just shows how big that moment is, just kind of when your whole life flashes before you.""

Burris and the other inductees will have to wait for their day in the sun due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2020 class will be honoured alongside the 2021 inductees next August.

When Burris is formally honoured, he'll be joined by former teammate Childress and Hufnagel, who served as Calgary's head coach (2008-2015) before moving into the front office full-time. Burris won Grey Cups with both ('98 with Childress, '08 with Hufnagel).

""Calgary is a machine right now and it all started in 2008 when Huf came in and we got that Grey Cup in his first year,"" Burris said. ""Calgary has always had double-digit wins and been in the playoffs each and every year Huf has been there, they've always been a strong contender for the Grey Cup and there's one reason why.""

Hufnagel, a 68-year-old native of Coraopolis, Pa., spent 12 seasons as a CFL quarterback with Calgary (1976-79), Saskatchewan (1980-83, 1987) and Winnipeg (1984-86) before getting into coaching. A five-time Grey Cup champion, Hufnagel also earned a Super Bowl ring as an assistant with the New England Patriots (2003).

Hufnagel amassed a 102-42-1 record as Calgary's head coach, his .712 win percentage being the highest among coaches with more than 100 games. He's been named the CFL's coach of the year twice (2008, 2014).

Childress, a 53-year-old native of Little Rock, Ark., played 13 CFL seasons with Shreveport (1994), Birmingham (1995), Calgary (1996-03) and Saskatchewan (2004-06). A former second-round pick of the NFL's New England Patriots, Childress won two Grey Cups with the Stampeders (1998, 2001) and in 1998 was named the CFL's top offensive lineman.

Brock, 79, of Los Angeles, played 12 seasons with Saskatchewan (1964-75), helping the club win its first Grey Cup in 1966. The former Dallas Cowboy-San Francisco 49er appeared in 169 regular-season CFL games and four times was named a league all-star before being inducted into Saskatchewan's Plaza of Honour in 1995.

Vavra, 59, of Red Deer, Alta., helped the Calgary Dinos win the Vanier Cup in 1983, his final season at the school. That year, he also became the first player in the program's history to capture the Hec Crighton Trophy as Canadian university football's top player and still holds the U Sports record for most passing yards in a game (627).

Vavra was drafted by the Calgary Stampeders in 1984 and also spent time with the B.C. Lions (1986-87) and Edmonton Eskimos (1988).

After playing seven CFL seasons as a defensive back with Toronto (1974-76), B.C. (1977), Montreal (1978-80) and Ottawa (1980), Uteck became an assistant coach at Saint Mary’s University in 1982. He was promoted to head coach the following year, a position he held until 1997.

Over that span, Uteck was named the Atlantic University Athletic Association coach of the year five times and twice Canadian university football's top coach.

Uteck served as athletic director from 1995 to 2002 and the Huskies captured two Vanier Cups (2001-02). The native of Thornhill, Ont., passed away Dec. 25, 2002 of Lou Gehrig's disease at the age of 50.

The Atlantic Bowl was renamed the Uteck Bowl in 2003.

The metaphor suggested by the title of Christian Sands’ new album is apt.

The jazz pianist says he was trying to be freer and more flexible on ""Be Water,"" and it shows. The set's 10 cuts explore a wide range of moods and instrumental combinations, with Sands' trio at the core.

Much of the material is built on the same pattern of tension and release found in a body of water. That begins with the opening ""Intro,"" which settles on the tonic chord after nearly four minutes of shimmering undulation.

The reflective ""Still,"" featuring Marvin Sewell on acoustic guitar, rides a mere ripple of rhythm. On ""Be Water II,"" a string quartet plays against the lapping beat established by Sands' piano. Marcus Strickland's woodwind work makes ""Drive"" swing as it crests with a cascading electric guitar solo by Sewell.

Sands rarely cuts loose at the piano — his objective isn't to be splashy — but he takes an active role as the producer, overdubbing extra keyboards and including sound effects and brief recitations by martial artist Bruce Lee. ""Water can flow, or it can crash,"" Lee says. Forgive the flood of puns, but ""Be Water"" flows freely.",[]

The former Accept frontman's solo band U.D.O. teams with the Musikkorps der Bundeswehr to put some real metal in heavy metal on ""We Are One.""

The pairing has undeniable power and force on 15 tracks that deal with environmental threats to the planet (""Future Is the Reason Why"", ""Mother Earth""), the refugee crisis (""Children of the World""), and a reunited Germany (""Rebel Town""), among other topics. The band lends a sweeping grandeur to most of the tracks with horns and strings punching up already-rowdy guitar riffs.

And for those who still miss the diminutive singer's 1980s heyday with Accept, U.D.O. throws them a bone in ""We Strike Back,"" a close cousin of the classic Accept concert opener ""Fast as a Shark,"" with very similar speed, style and structure, right down to the harmonic twin guitar solos. When this band sings ""We Strike Back,"" you'd best believe it, in the most literal sense.",[]

The newspaper explained the decision in a note by Bill Sternberg, editorial page editor, attached to the column online. Navarro's column originally moved online late Tuesday and was published in Wednesday's newspaper.

article continues below

Navarro wrote that Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, ""has been wrong about everything I interacted with him on.""

The newspaper on Wednesday evening also ran a fact-check story by Washington reporter Ledyard King examining five of Navarro's claims.

It wasn't clear how Navarro's column escaped such scrutiny before being published. Sternberg said in an email that he's letting his editorial note speak for itself. The incident is reminiscent of The New York Times saying last month that an opinion column by U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton hadn't been properly vetted, which led to the resignation of the paper's opinion editor.

Navarro did not immediately return a message for comment.

USA Today said it had sought Navarro's opinion to accompany an editorial that the newspaper ran calling Fauci ""a national treasure.""

That editorial said the fact that Navarro was writing the opposing viewpoint ""shows how hard it is to find an actual medical professional willing to undercut Fauci.""

It wasn't clear whether the newspaper sought those opinions.

Fauci has essentially been shelved by the White House as a prominent spokesperson on the coronavirus pandemic because he's publicly been more pessimistic than the president. He does webcasts but rarely gives television interviews anymore.

Trump distanced himself from Navarro's column, saying Wednesday that the column was Navarro's views and ""he shouldn't be doing that.""

Navarro claimed in the column that Fauci opposed travel restrictions from China that were imposed by Trump that ""might well have saved hundreds of thousands of American lives."" USA Today said there isn't enough data to conclude the restrictions made a significant difference, and that despite some initial skepticism, Fauci backed the president.

The fact-checker also gave more context to Navarro claims about masks, the drug hydroxychloroquine and Fauci's early statements of concern about the virus.",[]

He’s returned to the charts in 2020, working on songs for rising and established rap stars, including Lil Wayne, Juice WRLD, Saweetie and Doja Cat.

The songmaster, who has been entangled in a bitter lawsuit with former collaborator Kesha since 2014, has produced and co-written Saweetie’s new single ""Tap In,"" the follow-up to her double-platinum smash ""My Type."" Dr. Luke also co-wrote and co-produced Juice WRLD’s ""Wishing Well,"" taken from the rapper’s first posthumous album ""Legends Never Die,"" released last week.

article continues below

The recent successes mean all three major U.S. record label companies have worked with Dr. Luke this year, even if he hasn't always put his widely recognizable professional name to the new collaborations.

Dr. Luke marked a major comeback this year with the success of the Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 hit ""Say So"" by rapper-singer Doja Cat, who is signed to Dr. Luke's Kemosabe Records. Dr. Luke, born Lukasz Sebastian Gottwald, produced several songs on Cat’s sophomore album ""Hot Pink,"" including single ""Like That,"" which is No. 5 on Billboard’s Hot R&B songs chart. He is the only producer with two songs in the Top 10 on the latter chart (""Say So"" sits at No. 2).

For his work with Cat, he used the alias Tyson Traxe. He used the same pseudonym for his production credit on Toronto rapper-singer Benny Mayne’s ""Hokey Pokey,"" released this year. For Lil Wayne’s ""Shimmy,"" a track featuring Cat on the deluxe edition of his latest album ""Funeral,"" Dr. Luke used the name Loctor Duke.

Label representatives for Saweetie, Juice WRLD, Lil Wayne and Cat didn’t immediately reply to emails seeking comment. Neither did a representative for Dr. Luke.

Luke has sprinkled his comeback among the major labels. Cat is signed to Sony Music’s RCA Records, while Saweetie is part of the Warner Music family. Lil Wayne releases music through his Young Money imprint and Republic Records, a division of Universal Music Group.

Before Dr. Luke topped the charts this year with ""Say So,"" he last had a No. 1 with Katy Perry's ""Dark Horse"" in 2014. Months later, Kesha accused him of sexual assault during their yearslong partnership (Dr. Luke has vigorously denied the allegations.)

A New York court dismissed Kesha’s sexual abuse-related claims in 2016 because of legal issues, without ruling on whether the allegations were true. Kesha lost another round in February, when a New York judge said she made a defamatory statement about Dr. Luke on a different occasion: a 2016 text message telling Gaga the producer had also raped Perry. Both he and Perry have denied it, and the judge said there was ""no evidence whatsoever"" to support the claim.

Kesha’s lawyers have said they plan to appeal the ruling, but it didn’t resolve other aspects of his defamation and breach-of-contract suit, including the crucial question of whether Kesha’s allegation that he raped her is true. The judge said that’s for a jury to decide at trial.

Outside of rap in 2020, Dr. Luke has produced music for pop singer Kim Petras, using the pseudonym MADE IN CHINA.",[]

For the last 42 years, the chamber has been recognizing the financial success of local businesses.

This year, the spotlight will be trained on resilience, with the nominations opening today, Monday, June 15.

“Typically, financial success is a key aspect of business success, and the Business Excellence Awards have always acknowledged that,” said Fan Chun, the chamber’s chair.

“However, COVID-19 has sent shockwaves through every aspect of our economy. Excellence in 2020 might mean running PPE drives, pivoting your business model online, or finding creative ways to keep your staff employed.

“That excellence isn’t always reflected on a balance sheet. We’d be doing a disservice to Richmond’s employers if our awards didn’t acknowledge the reality of our times.”

Susan Ness, chair of the 2020 Business Excellence Awards Task Force, said that, in 2020, “…it’s more important than ever to find and celebrate the businesses in our community who deserve our recognition.

“As much as this has been a year of hardship and challenges, when we look back, I'm convinced we will find it has also been a year full of hidden and emerging opportunities.”

Awards will still be handed out in 10 categories: new business, young entrepreneur, outstanding workplace, business leadership, green business, innovative enterprise, association (non-profit), and small, mid-size, and large businesses of the year.

The changes returning nominees will see include questions centred on ways they have adapted for COVID-19, and a shorter nomination package, in recognition of the many pressures on everyone’s time.

In compliance with restrictions on gatherings, the awards gala itself will be adapting in 2020, pivoting to a virtual format.

“For an organization that’s used to throwing 400 person galas, this is going to be a big change,” said Chun.

“We’re doing a lot of work behind the scenes right now to make sure that the 2020 awards are the exceptional experience Richmond expects from us.”

Nominations will remain open until Sept. 8. Details of each category and the nomination form are available at RichmondChamber.ca.

This is the message from Richmond News publisher Alvin Chow.

The world has changed with COVID-19 and businesses have to rethink how they operate. Those who have pivoted to repurpose themselves, at least temporarily, have had a better chance of surviving. However, other business models don’t allow for the same flexibility, so staying afloat has been a challenge.

“COVID-19 has shone a light on holes in business models,” said Rob Akimow, Richmond News director of sales and marketing. “Some, for example those set up for e-commerce, fared better; others were left out in the cold.”

To support businesses in Phase 2 of the pandemic, with partial re-opening of services allowed by provincial health officers, some Richmond groups have launched websites to help spread the word on what businesses are open and what restrictions they are operating under.

Tourism Richmond, the Richmond Chamber of Commerce and the City of Richmond have partnered to build a business hub ­— WeAreRichmondBC.ca. Meanwhile, Richmond City Coun. Chak Au has launched SupportLocalBusiness.ca also to spread the word on the new normal in business.

Akimow notes that the News ­— with both its print and digital distribution channels — can also play a key role in the restart or boosting of businesses.

During the past 12 weeks, with health orders in place to stay close to home, buying patterns have changed, Akimow said. Businesses have to capitalize on those changes while also ensuring customers are aware they may be physically reopening as well, albeit with changes to ensure health and safety.

“All businesses need cash flow. Our objective at the Richmond News is to bring people in through their doors — virtually or in person,” Akimow said.

Akimow acknowledges businesses are hurting, but there are a lot of free and low-budget ways the News can help bring customers back, he stressed.

A directory called GuidedBy.ca is a free service where businesses can post information about their operation, location and business hours. The News also does free digital audits of businesses, meaning they analyze a company’s web traffic, SEO effectiveness and digital footprint to create a “report card of their online presence,” Akimow explained.

A fun initiative the News launched with local business Herbaland was a mental wellness contest, whereby readers post photos of how they take care of their mental health and are entered to win $250 in Herbaland products.

“These are all examples of unique and different ways businesses can look at marketing themselves differently. Print ads and basic digital services are just one piece to the marketing mix,” said Akimow. “We should be looking at any and all options, contesting, virtual events, even flyers; there is really nothing we cannot do.”

With its deep roots in the community as a source of news and advertising, the News reaches a wide local audience weekly in the paper and 24/7 online at richmond-news.com.

As businesses restart and rethink how they can serve their customers in this “new normal,” the News is open for business with “all hands on deck,” Akimow said, adding businesses shouldn’t be worried about asking for help, even if their advertising budgets have shrunk because of the pandemic.

“We have no illusions about how hard it will be for businesses to restart, but we are here to help,” he added.",[]

Each mask is decorated with the Christmas Fund logo and RCRG’s mascot bear, and will be sold for $20 online and at selected locations in Richmond.

Ed Gavsie, president and CEO of RCRG, said they are hoping to sell at least 500 masks, which will help provide $10,000 towards purchasing food carts to distribute to families during Christmas.

“We have lost a lot of our regular fundraising events for the Christmas Fund because of the pandemic,” said Gavsie, which is why they are kicking off their fundraising earlier.

“Decreasing fundraising and increased demand is what we are forecasting … and we can only anticipate a major increase because of people’s financial situation during COVID-19.”

Windows of Hope, Not So Silent Night and the Richmond RCMP’s toy drive are only some of the major events that have been impacted by the pandemic.

Gavsie told the Richmond News that RCRG is in the process of re-imagining these events in a way that will follow the guidelines and safety protocols put forth by the BC Health Ministry.

For example, Not So Silent Night, dubbed Not So Isolated Night for 2020, will most likely become a virtual event while plans for the RCMP toy drive and Windows of Hope are still being discussed.

The Beer, Wine and Sours fundraiser, which raised $13,000 in 2019, will be cancelled this year.

“We’re hoping that we can proceed again with most of our fundraisers especially the Windows of Hope since it’s a tremendous fundraiser that we need badly,” said Gavsie, adding that they are hoping the “public or organizations who can help will step up.”

However, like many volunteer-run organizations of its kind, they are constantly searching for new blood to infuse onto their board of directors.

And they’re hoping to see new faces appearing on screen at their forthcoming virtual AGM.

“People are leaving, which is normal, there’s always some coming and coming. We ask people to be on for two years, some stay a lot longer,” explained RFSS' vice-president Norm Goldstein.

“There are fresh challenges with the pandemic; it has been difficult to get our grants, so it’s always good to get fresh ideas and fresh perspectives.

“It’s always a challenge to get volunteers and to get volunteers with knowledge.

“But we’re a great bunch of people to work with and if food security and community is dear to your heart, then you should definitely take a look and maybe take part in our virtual AGM.”

This year, RFSS embarked on a new strategic plan on how to best serve Richmond, with a goal to provide education, services and policy that strengthen Richmond’s access to healthy and local food over a sustainable period of time.

As an example, RFSS’ passionate staff and volunteers have been able to work with community partners to provide 500 meals every week to vulnerable Richmond families during this crisis.

“We don’t know when the next crisis will impact our ability to put food on our tables. That is why we are looking for new directors who can help steer the direction of RFSS going forward,” added Goldstein.

The notion of establishing a framework to commercialize cannabis began as a promise by the Liberal Party in the 2015 federal election campaign that led to Justin Trudeau becoming prime minister. The implementation of the policy was not as smooth as first envisioned, and the provincial governments were put in charge of setting guidelines for the sale and consumption of marijuana.

article continues below

Research Co. and Glacier Media have been tracking perceptions about legalization every six months in British Columbia. Our latest survey shows that agreement with the new rules remains high across the entire province, that some residents are starting to ponder a future when other drugs could be treated in the same fashion as cannabis, and that – in stark contrast with what we found last year – marijuana users in British Columbia are starting to acquire all of their product through licensed retailers.

As more time passes, British Columbians appear happier with the decision to end prohibition. Seven in 10 of the province’s residents (70%) agree with marijuana being legal in Canada, while 26% disagree and 3% are undecided.

These findings represent a seven-point increase since a similar survey conducted in October 2019, as legal cannabis approached its first anniversary. The groups that are more likely to voice satisfaction with the new status quo are men (75%), British Columbians aged 35 to 54 (76%) and residents of northern B.C. (80%).

In recent weeks, we have seen more talk about creating a safe supply for drugs that are currently available only through illegal means. The impact of these discussions has led to a shift in the views of British Columbians about legalizing all drugs. It must be completely acknowledged that sizable majorities of the province’s residents continue to oppose a move to place any controlled substance inside a store, but the proponents of this option have grown since late last year.

At least two-thirds of British Columbians are opposed to legalizing ecstasy (66%), powder cocaine (70%), heroin (72%), crack cocaine (73%), methamphetamine or “crystal meth” (74%) and fentanyl (75%).

Support for making some of these drugs available in a fashion that would conceivably meet the same guidelines that govern cannabis has risen over the past six months, to 25% for cocaine (up from 18%) and to 24% for heroin (up from 19%). While these are still low proportions, the fluctuation could signal the start of a trend.

Just 10% of British Columbians say they only consumed marijuana after it became legal. Identical proportions of residents tried it before October 2018 (45%) or have never consumed it in Canada (also 45%). The incidence of “legal-only” marijuana users is highest among residents aged 18 to 34 (18%) and those who live in southern B.C. (19%).

But perhaps the biggest surprise, and a source of satisfaction for policy makers, is the way in which cannabis is being sought by users. Just over half of British Columbians who have consumed marijuana since legalization (51%) say that all of their product was acquired at a licensed retailer. In October 2019, only 31% of cannabis consumers in the province were getting all of their product at a licensed retailer.

We still see 16% of British Columbians who say none of their marijuana has been bought at a licensed retailer – a proportion that climbs to 25% among those aged 55 and over. Two-thirds of cannabis consumers aged 35 to 54 (68%) are buying all of their product at a licensed retailer.

Even though the delivery of cannabis products has improved over the past six months, there are significant regional differences that are indubitably related to the presence of stores in specific areas of the province. Cannabis consumers who reside in southern B.C. and Metro Vancouver are the most likely to be getting all of their product from licensed retailers (63% and 62%). The numbers are significantly lower in Vancouver Island (29%), northern B.C. (24%) and the Fraser Valley (19%).

Finally, the issue of “drug testing” remains a priority for British Columbians, with 61% saying that companies in the province should “definitely” or “probably” be able to administer these examinations to any employee now that marijuana is legal.

After a bumpy start that featured slow store openings and hitches with delivery options, there are signs that cannabis legalization is starting to work in a better fashion. More consumers are getting all of their product through licensed retailers, and the number of “new users” has not increased dramatically. Still, the significant regional disparities suggest that more marijuana outlets will need to be authorized in order to effectively eliminate the black market.

The award-winning novelist also pens comics, TV scripts (CBC’s ‘North of 60’), and is an internationally renowned storyteller. Steeped in the oral traditions of his people, the Tlicho (Tłı̨chǫ) of the Dene First Nations, Van Camp’s storyteller’s voice is wonderfully evident in his highly recommended short story collection, Moccasin Square Gardens.

Set primarily in the Northwest Territories, or Denedeh, Moccasin Square Gardens vividly evokes the rhythms and characters of small-town life ""north of 60."" While some tales bring to mind Stephen Leacock or Stuart McLean, those comparisons fail to capture the dazzling range of themes and genres in this collection. Family discord and reconciliation, environmental degradation, sexuality, fantasy, mythology, and even a smattering of horror is all found here. Yet, even the darker stories are permeated with the author's optimism and sense of humour.

article continues below

Moccasin Square Gardens opens with 'Aliens’, a lyrical tale of budding romance and two-spirit identity. In 'Man Babies', a resourceful park ranger confronts the lay-about, videogame-obsessed son of the woman he's considering moving in with. In 'Super Indians', an embezzling band chief is hilariously held to account at a community sports day. In the haunting 'I Am Filled with a Trembling Light', the social ills of addiction and abuse are explored when a dying man tries to reclaim the home his father has lost to gambling debts.

The outliers in the collection are the two 'Wheetago War' stories. Van Camp, a fan of Star Wars who also writes graphic novels, combines Indigenous myth and popular culture in the form of Zombie-like Wheetago monsters, brought back to life by global warming.

It's a cliché, but this clear-eyed, emotion-filled collection will have you laughing and crying, while at the same time contemplating questions of Indigenous and Canadian history and culture.

No example is better than the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks in the United States, which gave us the “Patriot Act” after just 45 days of deliberation to expand government surveillance of Americans to previously unimagined levels.

In mid-April, the actions of Gabriel Wortman led to the deaths of 22 people in Nova Scotia after multiple shootings and fires. Most Canadians, at the time still under lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, were horrified at Wortman’s actions, which included impersonating a police officer.

article continues below

It took the federal government only 13 days after Wortman’s criminal activity was evident for the entire country to announce a nationwide ban on 1,500 types of military-grade “assault-style” weapons in Canada. Any Canadian who possesses these firearms will have two years to get rid of them. The prohibition led to many new discussions about the role that firearms play in Canada’s urban and rural areas.

We know now that the perpetrator of the 22 murders in Nova Scotia had obtained his weapons illegally from Canadian and American sources. This was not a surprise for Canadian authorities, who have consistently reported that more than 70% of the weapons used in gun-related crimes in our country come from the United States.

On the issue of firearms, Canada is decidedly different from the United States. In Canada, it is not legal for a person to own or carry a firearm for the purpose of self defence against human beings. When Research Co. and Glacier Media asked Canadians about this key precept of Canadian law, more than three in four (77%) agreed with it, while 18% disagreed and 5% were undecided.

Atlantic Canada (31%), Saskatchewan and Manitoba (29%) and Alberta (24%) boast the highest number of residents who openly question Canada’s long-standing regulations for firearms. While higher than what is observed in Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia, these are not proportions of voters that would sway an election, certainly not in the way American statewide and congressional races can be tilted if your candidate can adequately hold a shotgun and recite the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution in a manner that panders to the base.

Fewer than one in five Canadians welcome the notion of citizens carrying firearms for something other than hunting or scaring wildlife away. Any survey measuring opinions on banning “assault-style” weapons would be met with near unanimity. The opposition reacted to the announced ban as it always has under its outgoing leader, by claiming the regulations would affect law-abiding Canadians. Lost in this unfortunate combination of inadequate polling and incapable opposition are the solutions that matter to Canadians.

In our survey, more than three in five Canadians (63%) told us that gun violence in Canada is a “very serious” or “moderately serious” problem – a proportion that climbs to 69% among women and 68% among those aged 55 and over.

Sizable majorities of Ontarians and British Columbians, who have experienced gang wars in urban areas, are more likely to look at gun violence as particularly problematic (76% and 67%, respectively). The COVID-19 pandemic did little to curb gun violence in Toronto, where 61 people were shot in the first four months of the year.

We asked Canadians about the effectiveness of four possible measures, and their responses outline a public that is ready for bold action. More than three in five Canadians (62%) think enacting a complete ban on handguns would be “very effective” or “moderately effective” in reducing gun violence in Canada. Most crimes, after all, are not being committed with the military-grade “assault-style” weapons that the federal government was quick to ban.

A higher proportion of Canadians deem two other measures as effective: imposing mandatory jail terms for crimes committed with firearms (74%) and introducing new outreach programs to steer youth away from gangs (also 74%).

Canadians place dealing with firearms smuggled from the United States as the most important issue that needs to be addressed. Many of the country’s residents also want to make sure gangs are not attractive to our country’s youth and believe mandatory minimum jail sentences would act as a deterrent.

Banning military-grade “assault-style” weapons is low-hanging fruit in a challenge that definitely has Canadians preoccupied and wishing for a type of government intervention that goes beyond a photo-op celebrated by poorly executed survey charity work.

True sociologists know that we learn nothing from posing the wrong questions to Canadians, and capable politicians should go beyond voicing displeasure with plans and proposals just because that is what they are expected to do. Meanwhile, Canadians are still worried about gun violence and expecting their elected officials to do better. •

Richmond actors and playwrights Jovanni Sy and Leanna Brodie have joined fellow Canadian artists in two “live” interactive projects called Red Phone and Plays2Perform@Home to keep people connected during COVID-19.

Sy, Gateway Theatre’s former artistic director, said that Brodie, who is also his wife, and he were more than happy to join in the two projects when invited by Boca del Lupo’s artistic director, Sherry Yoon and artistic producer, Jay Dodge.

“They came to us and it sounded like a great idea and something that would benefit people in these times,” said Sy.

Since stepping down from overseeing programs and administration work at Gateway, Sy has been spending more time in rehearsal halls and working on projects like Plays2Perform@Home -- which is exactly what he wanted, he told the Richmond News.

“I’ve loved my seven years at Gateway, but I was ready for some new challenges and so far it’s been wonderful” said Sy.

Brodie, an award-winning playwright, said the two projects were created in response to the COVID-19 crisis in their own ways.

“Jay and Sherry had the Red Phone series ready and tailor made for this kind of situation, but they went in the opposite direction of the norm by taking the technology out of the project,” said Brodie, adding that many events have gone virtual since the pandemic hit.

“The projects (turn) the audience into the performers and whatever their social bubble is, where they can have this live unmediated experience with each other and do something completely out of the ordinary and essentially perform for each other.”

The Red Phone project is an audience to audience interaction based on a scripted conversation and will be at Granville Island from July 1 to Aug. 22. Photo submitted

Red Phone is a project where two people engage with each other using a red telephone in a five-minute conversation in two separate phone booths.

The interaction is facilitated by a teleprompter and conversations written by four different Canadian script writers – including Sy and Brodie.

The phone booths are located on Granville Island and are open to anyone from Thursdays to Saturdays.

According to Boca del Lupo Theatre, the act of having a conversation with an unseen partner provides an “anonymity that adds to the intimacy of the performance.”

Meanwhile Plays2Perform@Home is a script “box set” that is ordered and delivered to a home.

The box includes 10 to 20 minute play scripts with three to eight characters that friends and family bring to life with their own performances. Each script is a different genre ranging from a “kitchen sink drama” to a “satirical farce.”

The projects, said Sy and Brodie, are to help keep people and the voices of artists in the community, but at arm’s reach.

“They are right here in Richmond and across the country,” said Brodie.

“I think what these projects have in common is a belief in the power of telling stories, which human beings have been doing for thousands of years. It’s not only how we pass on lessons and pass the time, it’s how we understand the world.”

The two projects will run from July 1 to Aug 22 and can be found at www.bocadellupo.com",[]

Riley Scott, who graduated from the Technical Apparel Design program in December 2019, was recognized at the annual Core77 Design Awards 2020, an annual design contest.

article continues below

The awards cover 18 distinct design disciplines and Scott was a student runner-up for the Sports and Recreation Award. His jacket, Stratus Ski Touring Mid-Layer, varies its insulation to the thermal needs of the user.

“The initial inspiration for this jacket came from my own ski touring expeditions and being frustrated with the amount of time and energy that was wasted while altering my layering system,” says Scott.

“I wanted to create an ‘invisible’ layer that could adapt to different temperatures and exertion levels - without removing any garments. To realize this goal, I took inspiration from window blinds as they transition from a 2D object to a 3D object when either side of the baffle is pulled in opposite directions.”

The jacket was Scott’s capstone project in the Technical Apparel Design program. He credited his instructors in helping him achieve success in the project.

For Scott’s instructors, the jacket reflects a commitment to the design process they teach.

“Riley did a fantastic job, not just in what the jacket became as a prototype but in the whole approach to understanding the context of use, defining the problem and technical design requirements, material and construction exploration, and iterative prototyping and testing of possible solutions,” said instructor Dan Robinson.

He says the jacket went beyond finding a solution for taking layers on and off during backcountry ski touring.

“The Stratus jacket is also sensitive to other context-specific requirements for carrying a pack, for providing more traditional vent zips that are usually absent in a mid-layer, for keeping sleeves in place with arm movements, and for packing the jacket when not in use,” Robinson added. “And he did both engineering tests to show changes in insulation and user tests to demonstrate effectiveness in simulated use of the jacket.”

This is the second consecutive year a Technical Apparel Design program graduate has been recognized at the Core77 awards after Philip Siwek’s autonomous vehicle cycling jacket won the Strategy and Research student category in 2019.

Scott, who now works for Mountain Equipment Co-op, is passionate about his future in technical apparel design as he hopes to push the boundaries of what’s possible in developing products.

“I feel so honoured to have been recognized by the designers at Core 77 for a project I put so much time and passion into,” he adds. “It has been incredibly validating to realize that judges from Jacksonville, Luxembourg and Stockholm are all discussing my design as it is something I have thought about every day for months.”

The Technical Apparel Design program has been developed in collaboration with employees from Vancouver-based technical apparel companies such as Arc’teryx, lululemon, Mountain Equipment Co-Op and Mustang Survival, along with top academics and researchers.",[]

In particular, the City advises against tree topping. Tree-topping is the indiscriminate cutting of tree branches to stubs, which leads to a far broader negative impact than just altering the appearance of a tree.

article continues below

When done, tree-topping can increase issues with pests, cause sunburn and shock to the tree, and, in the most dire of situations, lead to the starvation and death of the tree.

It can also negatively affect property value, and, on a larger environmental scale, detract from the urban region’s tree canopy, which supports wildlife, provides much-needed shade from the sun and helps maintain proper drainage during heavy rainfall.

Unfortunately, many believe limiting a tree’s height through tree-topping is the correct way to trim a tree.

But, the survival mechanism of crudely topped trees causes them to produce numerous shoots below each cut. The rapid growth of these shoots means that the tree will return to its previous height quickly and even more densely than before.

Tree-topping also often results in large, open pruning wounds that expose the sapwood and heartwood of the tree to infestation. The stress of losing a large amount of wood and greenery can also inhibit the tree’s ability to close its exposed wounds and guard against insects and disease.

In general, proper pruning practices rarely remove more than one-quarter of the leaf-bearing crown or green portions of a tree, which help protect it like an umbrella from the harsh rays and heat of the sun. Topping often removes about half or more of the crown and can weaken the tree through loss of its food-making leaves.

Tree owner resources

For a guide of the correct way to prune trees on your property, and the environmental regulations protecting them, the City of Richmond has a number of information links homeowners can access.

The topping of trees is prohibited under Richmond’s Tree Protection Bylaw 8057 and can result in fines up to $10,000 per tree.

To learn more about the dangers of decay, insects and disease, shock and sun-scorch to trees that result from topping, read more or consult City of Richmond’s Tree Protection Bylaw 8057.",[]

“There are a lot of things to consider when picking a tutor or learning centre for your child,” says Jade Chan, Centre Director at the Sylvan Learning Centre in Richmond. “Every child has their own specific needs, and you need to find the environment that works best for both the child and the parents.”

article continues below

Jade offers these five great tips for finding the right tutor or learning centre for your child:

1. Length of time in business: Sylvan Learning Centre has been in existence for over 30 years, more than 20 years in Richmond. ""There's a reason we're still here,"" notes Jade. ""We're successful because our tutoring programs and methods work.""

2. Quality of teaching experience: Sylvan hires only tutors who are qualified to teach in B.C. ""That way, you know you're getting experienced teachers who are familiar with the B.C. education curriculum that your child is learning in school,"" says Jade. She suggests you ask any tutor or learning centre your considering about their qualifications.

3. Online research: Type the name of the tutor or learning centre into Google or other search engine with a qualifier like “reviews” or “ratings” and see what kind of ratings pop up. Reading about other clients’ experiences may provide insight into the level of service you can expect.

4. Type of assessments and feedback provided: Ask how a learning centre will assess your child and what kind of feedback they will give. ""At Sylvan Learning Centre, we ask a lot of questions about your child and their relationship with learning. We talk to both the parents and the student to find out where the issues are and how we can support the student.""

Monthly conferences with parents and regular check-ins with students around their progress should be a standard part of any program, says Jade. And ultimately, the tutoring programs should be designed to support what children are learning in school.

5. Payment plans:Be sure to ask tutors and learning centres about rates and payment plans before you commit. “At Sylvan Learning Centre, we design individualized programs for students with varying needs,” says Jade. “We also offer a variety of payment plans to suit each family’s financial situation, because we want to ensure tutoring is available for as many children and young people as possible. From a month-to-month plan to a long-term contract, Sylvan has an option that works for most people.”

The BC Centre for Disease Control is releasing COVID-19 data by health service areas, of which Richmond is one, twice a week.

Since the opening of a COVID-19 testing site in mid-June in the parking lot of the Richmond Tennis Club, 1,100 people have been tested for the virus.

While the testing site is referred to a “drive-through” site, there is a dedicated lane for those arriving by foot. It’s open from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Monday to Friday and statutory holidays.

Vancouver Coastal Health reported about 60 people – ranging in age from 12 to 100 - visit the centre every day, either in cars, by bike or by foot with one person arriving in a wheelchair. Only those with symptoms are tested, however.

The testing site opened on June 10 after a previous plan to open a site at Thompson Community Centre was nixed.

According to VCH, 80 per cent of those being tested at the site are Richmond residents, and the most common age groups are those between 20 and 34 and 45 and 64. Twenty per cent are seniors.

There is no need for an appointment to be tested, but there can be a short wait time, according to VCH. The busiest times are at 10 a.m. and 2 p.m.

As of the end of June, 90 people had tested positive for COVID_19 in Richmond.

The testing site will be in place “as long as there is a need for it,” according to a VCH spokesperson.

The employee, a member of the mall’s management team which works in Lansdowne’s administrative offices, was exposed to the virus while offsite at a private family event.

Mall management was informed of the exposure July 11, spokesperson Bronwyn Bailey told the Richmond News in an email.

“The team member…has not experienced any symptoms associated with COVID-19 and is currently self-isolating, and will not return to work until they receive proper health clearances,” said Bailey, adding that the administrative offices are separate from the retail shops, and are only accessible to staff.

Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Vancouver Coastal Health said the health authority is not aware of any risk to the public at the mall, and that VCH has not issued any public notifications about the exposure.

A notice circulating on social media claims there has been a potential COVID-19 exposure at Lansdowne Centre. - Submitted photo

On Monday, a notice was issued to Lansdowne tenants advising them of the potential exposure. A photo of that notice was then widely circulated on social media.

The notice said that the centre had been “potentially exposed to the novel coronavirus through an individual, or a group of individuals, either visiting or working in the building.”

And while the notice stated that an unspecified individual had been in contact with someone who has a “confirmed case of the coronavirus,” there are currently no suspected or presumptive positive cases at the mall.

“We are actively working with the tenant, and other involved parties, to confirm all details, and have provided them with the appropriate resources to address the situation. There is currently no confirmed risk to our building’s occupants,” reads the notice.

Dr. Meena Dawar, Richmond’s medical health officer, said all cases of COVID-19 are reported to health authorities, which will alert the public if there is any health risk.

“Please reach out to (public health) first before issuing notices,” Dawar told the Richmond COVID-19 Community Task Force.

She said some retailers might be working with limited information but public health can assess any risks to the public.

Bailey said that, out of an “abundance of caution and as per our established response protocols,” the administrative office space was disinfected, Lansdowne Centre staff were asked to monitor themselves for potential symptoms, and all tenants were informed of the situation.

“There have been no other confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19 reported at our offices or the retail facility, which remains safe and open to guests,” said Bailey.

“Since the start of the pandemic, we have maintained close contact with and followed relevant guidance from the City of Richmond and local health authorities, which have assessed the risk of this current exposure incident to be low,” she added.

“There is currently no confirmed risk to our building’s occupants.”

However, the owner a restaurant in the mall, who asked to remain anonymous, told the News that he never received the notice from management, despite being at his restaurant all of Monday.

He said he only became aware of the letter after he returned home and began receiving messages from friends, who sent him the social media photo of the notice and suggested he self-quarantine. He added that he is trying to contact Lansdowne Centre management about the situation.

The owner also told the News he is aware of at least one other restaurant owner who didn’t receive the letter.

The notice states that, in the meantime, any affected premises within the mall will be disinfected as part of the mall’s “precautionary measures,” while an unnamed business has been “professionally disinfected already and will be safe for use soon.”

Management also states in the notice that COVID-19 causes “only mild to moderate symptoms, such as fever or cough,” and that most people recover, however, some people – such as older adults or those with pre-existing health conditions – can develop more severe illness and may require medical attention.

“The health and safety of our occupants is our top priority and our property management team is in continuous contact with our risk management team to provide you with the most up-to-date and accurate information,” the notice reads.

Dr. Meena Dawar, Richmond’s medical health officer, said all cases of COVID-19 are reported to health authorities, which will alert the public if there is any health risk.

Vancouver Coastal Health (VCH) is reaching out to Lansdowne to clarify what the situation is.

Meanwile, according to a spokesperson for VCH, there are cases where businesses notify customers as a part of best practices in response to a potential exposure to COVID-19 in their establishment.

However, if the risk is small, the health authority doesn’t need to take any further measures, such as issuing a public notice, said the spokesperson.

As she was getting out of her car, a man got out of the BMW, ran towards her and pepper sprayed her in the face.

Then, a woman emerged from the same BMW, and blocked the victim’s way, asking her if she needed help.

“However, the female didn’t help me. Instead, she dragged me and let the man pepper-spray me for the second time. Then they tried to pull me into their car with my hoodie.

“I got rid of my hoodie and ran desperately towards the elevator door,” said the alleged victim.

In the elevator, she went up to her apartment floor, ran down the hallway and banged on the door to her apartment. Her boyfriend quickly answered and immediately called the police.

The student said her eyes were stinging and watery, and her nose was running from the pepper spray. Her arms and legs are still bruised, she added.

“The whole experience was very traumatic, and I still feel the pain while recalling the memory. But I don’t want to see this horrible thing happen to others.

“Especially for women who live or travel alone, always be careful and take necessary precautions to ensure your safety,” said the woman.

Richmond RCMP confirmed they are investigating the incident.

It is unclear if this in fact was a kidnapping attempt, but in April 2019, Wanzhen Lu, 22, an international student from China was forced into minivan in an underground parking garage in Markham, Ont.

Despite a long-time career in the engineering industry, Eric Ho has never forgotten his first love and passion – baking.

article continues below

Ho, a Richmond resident and owner of Little Fox Bakery, was a successful engineer for 13 years before he made the courageous career switch to pursue his passion in culinary arts.

“Towards the end of my 13 years, I kind of felt I was losing my interest in the field and struggled for nine months with myself wondering if I should leave or not for baking,” said Ho, adding he had been managing his own engineering design firm for five years at the time.

Work-related travel to Paris each year, said Ho, gave him exposure to European cuisine and “broadened (his) views and interest in French pastries.”

His travels, however, were not what pushed him to switch industries; rather, it was a growing interest since he was a child.

Ho told the Richmond News that he has always loved baking and cooking since he was young and would always watch cooking shows on TV after school.

After leaving his engineering career, Ho studied at the Pacific Institute of Culinary Arts, with no experience in the food industry, and opened up his first bakery in Vancouver shortly after graduation.

However, he sold the bakery after four years when his wife had a job change in 2018, which allowed Ho to open up his current shop, Little Fox Bakery, closer to home in Richmond.

Little Fox Bakery, which is located inside President Plaza, is known for their homemade croissants and was inspired from a plush toy fox Ho and his wife came across on their trip to Paris a few years ago.

“When I decided to take the plunge, I (knew I) was going to be okay if I failed because at least I knew I tried,” said Ho.

“I probably would’ve gone back to engineering if the baking route didn’t follow through … but what I’m doing now is built on the experience from having my own engineering firm in the past and I’m thankful for it.”",[]

They started delivery services in Richmond during the last week of March to get drinks to residents who couldn’t enjoy their beers at the brewery in-person.

As of April 3, they expanded their service to Ladner, Tsawwassen and Vancouver – Granville Street to Knight Street from Kent Avenue to 16th Avenue.

Zach Fox, operations manager at Fuggles and Warlock, said their delivery service as well as their curbside pickup has received a good response from the community since they started.

“It’s been a busy couple of weeks, that’s for sure, and the response has been more overwhelming than expected,” said Fox, adding that curbside pickup is equally as popular with locals.

For pickup service, customers order online, pay and then select the curbside option. When they arrive at the brewery, they call and Fuggles and Warlock staff place the beer straight in the trunk.

For delivery, customers who place their orders in by 2 p.m. can expect their beer delivery the same day, while orders made after 2 p.m. will arrive the next day.

To qualify for delivery, which costs an extra $3, customers must order a minimum of $20.

Fox told the Richmond News that Fuggles and Warlock considered beer delivery an option “because (we are) probably one of the only breweries in Richmond that can offer this service” during COVID-19.

“I think the silver lining in all this is that everyone has banded together and has become like a family with the feeling of needing to take care of the community,” said Fox.

Shanna Munro, president and CEO of Restaurants Canada, said that “restaurants are vital to the social and economic fabric of communities across Canada” and that the food service business can be tough even during the “best of times.”

“Not only was our industry among the first to feel the impacts of COVID-19, we’ve been one of the hardest hit so far, with nearly two-thirds of our workforce now lost,” said Munro.

“We would love to see Canadians embrace #TakeoutDay and support those restaurants who are still able to operate through takeout or delivery.”

Pay Chen, an ambassador for Canada Takeout, said the initiative intends to save not only businesses but to preserve our culture through the culinary industry.

“Our robust and diverse culinary scene is an integral part of Canada’s unique identity and we stand to lose an important part of our culture and heritage if we don’t do our part,” said Chen.

During the kick-off, Canada’s Great Kitchen Party will be hosting a live variety show with music entertainment via Facebook at 5 p.m. PST on April 15.

The show will be headlined by artists including Jim Cuddy, Alan Doyle, Ed Robertson, Barney Bentall and Tom Cochrane.

Stephen Clark, executive chef of CHOP Steakhouse, and Alex Chen, executive chef of Boulevard, recently launched their new Steak Masters menu at the Richmond CHOP Steakhouse and Bar.

The pair first met while working at the Wedgewood Hotel in Vancouver two decades ago.

And when both chefs were given the “okay” to showcase an all-steak menu in November, Clark and Chen got to work and had the dishes in the kitchen by January.

The finalized menu features steak tartare, sirloin cap picahna, tomahawk, and a pineapple upside-down cake.

“Steak tartare is a pretty classic thing for us to have on the menu and the picahna is like (a dish) ready for summer barbecue,” said Clark, adding that Chen has a “real big thing” for outdoor barbecue these days.

“Tomahawk was just a go big or go home.”

Both agreed that they share similar “philosophies” and “palates” in the kitchen, which created a work environment with good energy.

“I couldn’t wait to work with him to create this menu that celebrates steak as much as it does our 20-year history together in the kitchen,” said Chen, adding that it was easy to work with Clark despite working in different restaurants.

“It’s always tough when we both represent different brands, but it was such a great collaboration.”

Clark said he “hopes Richmond sees (CHOP) as their steakhouse” and that the ""feature tells people how seriously (they) take steak and how not very seriously (they) take (themselves).”

The Steak Masters menu is only available in Richmond until April 7.

Clark and Chen’s “steak excellence” menu will be launching in Edmonton, Toronto, Calgary, Regina and Winnipeg throughout the year.

Happy Lamb Hot Pot, which opened its doors last November, has taken over Little Sheep Mongolian’s old spot at Lansdowne Centre.

Philip Wang, manager at Happy Lamb Hot Pot, describes the soup as the most important part of the meal.

“The soup broth is the soul in hot pot where people can put various types of food they like into the soup,” said Wang, adding that food added to the soup is like adding personality to the soul.

The two most popular broths, said Wang, is the “house original” milky-looking broth and the “house spicy,” which is dried Sichuan peppers and house-made chili oil added to the house original soup.

“The (house original) soup is very rich and is as white as milk from the simmering chicken bones.”

He added that both broths contain longan, goji berries, black cardamom pods and angelica root – ingredients that have health benefits.

The Inner Mongolia-based restaurant offers more than 20 different styles of meat including lamb, beef and seafood.

Because Inner Mongolia is famous for their lamb, said Wang, the restaurant offers “one-of-its-kind” lamb meat that is imported from various countries.

“Our lamb meat has different flavours depending on where they come from. Some are from New Zealand and Australia, while others come from Canada.

“We also have special lamb dishes offered only at the Richmond location such as fresh lamb cuts as opposed to frozen.”

The restaurant opened with hopes to bring together the community and provide a welcoming and comfortable meal to its customers, said Wang.

“Hot pot is made for sharing and we decided to open in Richmond because of (the city’s) inclusiveness and different cultures.”",[]

L’Opera Patisserie, a small family-run patisserie, on Minoru Boulevard close to Westminster highway, will be introducing its new fondue menu this spring.

Janice Marta, co-owner and manager of the patisserie, said she is excited to introduce the menu after having waited for a year.

“We are going to introduce a squid ink fondue and a truffle fondue,” said Marta, adding that she hasn’t seen anything like it in Richmond yet.

The complete menu is still under construction, but she anticipates the white-wine cheese sauce with shrimp, lobster and scallops with the option to add truffles will be popular.

“The tier will come out with things to dip like roasted potatoes, house-made baguettes, some mini croissants, seafood and meat,” explained Marta.

For the time being, she said, L’Opera’s most popular items are their macarons, afternoon tea and new croissant flavours – salted duck egg yolk, dirty matcha and masago – which were released last October.

“The patisserie has grown since 2010 and looking back, it was nothing short of a miracle that we are still here,” said Marta.

Marta, who was a UBC student at the time, baked as a hobby for friends and relatives.

She told the Richmond News that she was “so desperate” to recreate the croissant she had on a trip to France that she consistently baked the French pastry 35 times before coming close to the results she wanted.

“I was giving them out to relatives at the time and word got out,” said Marta, adding that others started placing orders.

“It got so popular that at one point I had 300 croissant orders in a day and it was crazy!”

Her grandfather suggested she should open a small shop with the help of her relatives who owned the property space.

“Opening (L’Opera) was challenging because I’ve never worked in the food industry before,” said Marta, adding that she had no business background either.

“My mother was here day in and day out from the beginning and it was just me and her … until six months in business just took off. I’m not sure who spread the word, but it was like a chain reaction.”

L’Opera has been a steep learning curve, she said, but because of family and customer support these past years, she is thankful.",[]

Money Tea has its own culture and beliefs — hoping to bring good fortune and luck to anyone who visits the store, said Jian Zhou, the store owner.

About 50 cat figurines are perched quietly on store shelves, their paws raised as if they are signalling wealth and prosperity to shoppers.

“If you’ve ever visited a Chinese or Japanese restaurant, you might have probably noticed a lucky cat sitting by the cash register or business entrances,” said Zhou, adding that all lucky cats displayed at his store are from Japan.

According to Zhou, there are different colour variations of lucky cats, and they each have a special meaning.

For example, the white lucky cat symbolizes happiness and positive things to come; the gold cat will bring people wealth and the red is for success in love and relationships.

Zhou got hooked on bubble tea and fortune cats on his travels to Japan where bubble tea spots have exploded in popularity.

Money Tea is now gearing up to offer milk tea with a wide selection of toppings like tapioca and jellies.

The eatery also features French toast stuffed with pudding filling and honey Castella cakes.

Richmond is just one of the 19 cities, and the only Canadian city, featured in the US-based food and dining website’s “Where to eat in 2020” travel feature.

According to Eater, which is published by Vox Media, “These 19 vital destinations are places where, for whatever reason, the food scenes today are resonating with appetites more than ever before.”

The cities included in the feature are the most dynamic in the world “right this second.”

And, according to Eater, Richmond is a “culinary destination of its own,” with a majority of the population with Asian heritage.

Much of the food scene is an “exploration of the traditional and hyper-regional foods of its largely Chinese and Taiwanese residents,” reads the Richmond guide.

“But (Richmond is) also an apex for Canada’s young Asian-Canadian chefs building off the traditional towards something completely their own.”

The Richmond list ranges from high-end establishments to “low-key nooks in strip malls and overlooked food courts,” and includes restaurants, food courts, bakeries, breweries, a chocolatier and night and public markets.

According to Eater, “Eating (in Richmond) is an immersive experience not to be missed.”

The majority of restaurants chosen by Eater lie near No. 3 Road and city centre, while others are in Steveston, Ironwood or along River Road.

Some of the eateries included in the list are: Lamajoun, an Armenian eatery located in north Richmond at 11782 River Road, near No. 5 Road; the food court at Parker Place, located at 4380 No. 3 Road near Browngate Road; and newly-renovated, Netflix-featured HK BBQ Master, at 4651 No. 3 Road near Leslie Road.

Local brewery Fuggles and Warlock, which won the best beer in B.C. award last year, also made the list, along with Persian restaurant Anar located at 12051 Third Ave. in Steveston.

The full list of the 22 Richmond restaurants can be found on Eater’s website, here.

People with a pre-arranged funeral plan who move to another province, or even into the United States, will likely find that there are funeral homes in their new area that will honour their pre-arranged plan.

“This eliminates the hassle of cancelling one plan and pre-arranging a new funeral plan,” Andrew explains. “The existing Forest Lawn Funeral Home or Ocean View Funeral Home plan can be transferred directly to another funeral home within the Dignity Memorial® network.”

It also means that residents of Richmond and other Lower Mainland communities can receive expert advice from a compassionate, locally operated funeral home, while benefitting from both locations’ involvement in the larger network of funeral homes and cemeteries.

Being part of a large funeral service provider network also means that customers of Forest Lawn and Ocean View Funeral Homes can get help quickly in the event of an unforeseen accident.

“We work very closely within our network,” Andrew says. “If a customer with a pre-arranged funeral plan passes away suddenly in another part of Canada or the United States, there would likely be a funeral home from our network close by that could help the family at no additional cost, other than shipping costs for bringing the loved one home.”

Nobody knows for sure who put the mysterious red bell here or why, but Inukpak Outfitting’s Martine Dupont is happy to share one of the urban myths floating around the capital of Nunavut.

article continues below

Our loved ones are up in the sky and when you ring the bell, they come down, in the form of dazzling lights, to say hello. There’s another legend, this one Inuit, which says the magical and fleeting lights represent spirits playing with a walrus head.

I know something of the science behind the aurora borealis, but let’s just say it always feels like a miracle to spot the lights in Canadian skies. Especially tonight when the aurora forecast was calling for just a 10 per cent chance of success.

Dupont continues our aurora hunt by quickly zipping over to a boat launch that has an unobstructed view of downtown. The light show continues. Today it’s green. Other days it mutates to shades of yellow, violet, pink and even orange.

It’s the start of winter on Baffin Island. The sea ice is starting to freeze. The number of daylight hours has dwindled to five. The sun, even when it comes out, hangs low in the sky. The 8,000-odd people who call Iqaluit home are ready to have fun. So are the dogs.

Jovan Simic gets his sled dogs ready, putting on their harnesses and figuring out the current state of their hierarchy. His young company Kool Runnings offers dog-powered adventures. It’s too early to safely travel on the sea ice, so we will brave the rocky tundra.

“There’s a short loop we can do — it won’t take much more than an hour,” Simic promises. “We’re going to be pretty alone out there running through different valleys. I’ll try not to flip you although I flipped Jagmeet Singh last week.”

It’s true — the New Democrat Party leader just visited Canada’s youngest territory with newly elected Nunavut MP Mumilaaq Qaqqaq. Singh, his party’s critic for Indigenous affairs, was thrown from the sled, but was a good sport and jogged through the snow to catch up.

When the sea ice isn’t frozen, Kool Runnings heads out on the tundra. Photo Jennifer Bain

Dogsledding here is different than in southern Canada, where you’re likely to stand on your own small sled as pairs of dogs run in a straight line. Here, Simic’s 12 Canadian Inuit dogs are each attached to a long, wooden sled by their own towlines and fan out to run. The musher (Simic) and the passenger (me) follow behind, seated on a qamutiq (traditional Inuit sled).

“There’s always a chance of ptarmigan and rabbits,” offers Simic. “There was a polar bear not far from here last week. I’ve seen wolves four or five times in the last four years.” None of those creatures come out today — just lots of ravens, a low-hanging sun and endless tundra once we pass through Sylvia Grinnell Territorial Park and cross a narrow river.

We dodge most of the exposed rocks, but it’s Simic who goes flying this time when the sled hits a large rock and comes to a dead stop.

We laugh about the ejection over lunch at Yummy Shawarma, Iqaluit’s first Lebanese restaurant. Owner Khaldoun El-Shamaa happily dishes out extra garlic sauce to go with my chicken shawarma. Later I pop into the popular Black Heart Café for a caffeine fix and food made from scratch

I’ve been to Iqaluit four times — twice on the way to other Nunavut communities and twice as the main event. It’s a ridiculously expensive flight, so a journey that too few Canadians make. Here’s a secret — use Aeroplan miles. It’s just 25,000 points for long-haul flights within Canada, but you have to call the Aeroplan Contact Centre to book so it’s still a largely unknown option.

Once you’re in Iqaluit, hail one of the flat-rate taxis for $8, but don’t be surprised when the driver stops to fill the empty seats. You can explore downtown by yourself on foot, but to cover more ground take the historical and cultural tours that Inukpak Outfitting offers when it’s not leading outdoor adventures.

Iqaluit has most things a remote city could need. “Hopefully one day we’re going to have a local performing arts centre,” says Inhabit Media’s Jesse Unaapik Mike, who recommends visiting during April’s Toonik Tyme spring festival.

Whatever you do, don’t miss the satellite community of Apex. The Grizzlies, based on the true story of how lacrosse transformed an Inuit community, was partially filmed here and the beach is home to several historic and very photogenic Hudson’s Bay Company buildings.

And the abandoned red lifeboat on that same Apex beach? The White Stripes made it downright famous by putting it in their 2007 music video for “You Don’t Know What Love Is (You Just Do As You’re Told)” when they visited Iqaluit during a cross-Canada tour.

I love that song. After admiring the red boat, I climb the hill between Apex and downtown Iqaluit one last time to admire the mysterious red bell, this time in daylight.

608,richmond-news,https://www.richmond-news.com/living/popular-japanese-tempura-restaurant-opening-first-canadian-location-in-vancouver-this-week-1.24058738,Popular Japanese tempura restaurant opening first Canadian location in Vancouver this week,['Lindsay William-Ross'],,"Can you hear the sizzle? That's fresh tempura-battered fish and veggies getting golden and crispy in the deep fryer.

Japanese import Kaneko Hannosuke is opening its first Canadian location of its famous tempura restaurant in Vancouver, and opening day is set for Thursday, Jan. 23.

article continues below

Hannosuke is known for their ""tempura tendon."" The Japanese specialty is a type of donburi (rice bowl with toppings) that features crisp tempura atop the freshly steamed rice and a light soy sauce.

While many restaurants serve donburi and tempura dishes in Vancouver, Kaneko Hannosuke focuses exclusively on tendon tempura, and is considered top of its game.

With locations in Japan — and its main branch located in Tokyo's Chuo City area — as well as outposts in Taiwan and the U.S. (including in major cities such as Los Angeles and Chicago), the new Vancouver location on Robson Street marks its first foray into the Canadian market.

Hannosuke is named for Hannosuke Kaneko, who ""served as the second chairman of Japanese cook association 'Isshin-kai,'"" according to its website. Hannosuke’s grandson, Kaneko Shinya, inherited his grandfather's recipe book, which included a treasured recipe for a secret ""Edomae"" rice bowl sauce. Kaneko Shinya worked to create a tendon tempura dish using the sauce, and his popular brand was born.

I checked Hannosuke out last month in Los Angeles at the Mitsuwa Marketplace, and the forthcoming Robson Street outpost should be a vibrant addition to Vancouver's expanding Japanese food scene, thanks to its masterful tempura (hello, tempura fried soft boiled egg) and combo plates.

Hannosuke is located at 1725 Robson St. in Vancouver. Daily opening hours will be 11:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. for lunch and 4:30 to 9:30 p.m. for dinner service. You can follow @kanekohannosuke.vancouver on Instagram for more info and updates.

Whether it’s a pair of blue jeans, Converse All-Stars or Canucks’ fans unrealistically high expectations, some things are timeless.

When it comes to classic craft beer styles, West Coast IPAs are what I like to reach for when I want something familiar and delicious. The IPA has seen all sorts weird and wonderful mutations over the past decade, but I keep coming back to the classic West Coast style with its citrusy, resinous flavours, sturdy malt backbone, dry finish and endless pairability with food.

article continues below

Good Clean Fun by Port Moody's Twin Sails Brewing is a great example of a modern West Coast IPA. A touch hazy with a creamier, chewier body than its predecessors, it undoubtedly has taken some East Coast influence and used it to its advantage.

The flavour profile is immediately familiar and with dank, resinous notes of grapefruit and pine, along with some tropical fruit. Unlike most East Coast IPAs, there’s actually some malt character here to balance out the hop bitterness, making this pretty crushable.

If you were turned off by overly bitter IPAs back in the day, I think it’s worth it to try some of the more well-balanced modern examples like Good Clean Fun.

Good Clean Fun by Twin Sails Brewing

India pale ale • 6.4 per cent ABV • 55 IBU • 473 mL tall cans

Appearance: Slightly hazy copper colour with a thick and persistent off-white head.

Aroma: Dank, citrus, stone fruit, pine.

Flavour: Über dank, citrus, pine, grapefruit, pineapple, stonefruit, assertive hop bitterness, cereal malt character.

Body/Finish: Medium bodied with a creamy mouthfeel. Finishes dry with moderate lingering hop bitterness.

Pairs with: Greasy cheeseburgers, pizza, and four or five more beers.

The two-hour event will include a question-and-answer session and meet-and-greet, with a second hour reserved for meditation and a demonstration.

According to Jeremy Berry, who is coordinating the event, participants will gain some insights into the benefits of kung fu, including gaining confidence and strength, the power of self-healing, principles of deep breathing and meditation.

Chang has worked with Bruce Lee and David Carradine. His film credits include Rambo and Kung Fu: The Legend Continues.

“I started training with Stephen through a mutual friend,” Berry said. “Stephen lives in Vancouver. We asked him if he would be willing to put on a teaching event and he said yes, so I booked the room at the church and we’re all set. It’s a free event and open to all.

“He has had a pretty cool career, so it’s going to be a neat opportunity to learn from one of the best.”

Those who hate even the thought of the punishment of the Grind’s 2,830 stairs might want to try the winter version instead.

article continues below

The 4.3-kilometre mountaintop trail, with a 240-metre elevation gain, was designed so that people could complete it at a comparable time to their normal Grouse Grind records.

The Snowshoe Grind is one of five snowshoe trails in the Munday Alpine Snowshoe Park, and promises both a challenge and a chance to embrace the snowy winter landscape.

The well-marked trail starts at the relocated Grouse Grind timer, outside the chalet adjacent to the Skyride ramp and just southwest of the skate pond, and leads to Dam Mountain, which sits at 1,372m, offering views of the surrounding snow-capped mountains.

Most people take about an hour to complete the hike, but those who want to challenge themselves, can try and compete with the best times recorded in last year’s Snowshoe Grind Mountain Race.

In 2019, Shaun Stephens-Whale broke the record for the fastest completion time in the men’s 19 to 29 division in a speedy 27 minutes and six seconds. He was also the previous record holder, with a time of 29 minutes and 15 seconds in 2018.

From the seasoned veteran to the first-timer, anyone who is reasonably fit can tackle the trail and have some fun.

Snowshoe enthusiasts can also track their times and rank among other grinders by using a Grind Timer Card. The card will set you back $25. For it to work, participants must swipe the card at the Grind Timer station at both the beginning and end of the hike.

To access the Snowshoe Grind, or any of our other snowshoe trails, a ski and snowboard pass, Alpine Experience ticket or annual membership is also required.

The Snowshoe Grind is open during daylight hours, seven days a week in winter. You can check trail opening times and current mountain conditions HERE.

QUICK NOTES

Trail length: 4.3 kilometres (2.67 miles)

Elevation gain: 240 metres (787 feet)

Average time: About one hour

Safety first: Be sure to check current weather, terrain and wildlife conditions prior to embarking on a hike. In addition, make sure that you know your physical limitations, tell someone where you are going, bring enough food and water, wear appropriate clothing and never hike alone.

Don’t attempt dangerous poses for photographs.

The North Shore’s Grouse Mountain has a snowshoe adventure that aligns with each coming full moon and new moon until April.

article continues below

The tours offer a unique way to explore the mountain after dark, with light from only a headlamp and the glow of the night sky.

""On our Full Moon Tours, you will witness the wonders of the wilderness under the soft glow of the moon,” the tour description states.

""In contrast, on our New Moon Tours, we will have no glow from the moon, allowing for the stars to shine brightly as we learn about the stories they have to share.""

Both the experiences begin by traveling through the mountain’s Light Walk, a stunning light installation amongst the fir and spruce around Blue Grouse Lake, before heading into the wilderness of Munday Snowshoe Park lit by headlamps.

Snowshoe guides then take participants on a journey to their favourite places to explore the night sky.

Julia Grant, Grouse Mountain communications manager, said the tour is relatively new to the mountain’s winter offerings.

“They were quite popular so we’ve brought them back again for this winter season,” she said.

With a mix of city views and wilderness, the snowshoe hike promises to “leave you with a lasting connection with the mountains.”

The next full moon to dazzle the night sky will be Jan. 10. January's full moon is commonly referred to as the ""Wolf Moon.""

Full Moon and New Moon Snowshoe Tours

When: New Moon – Jan. 24, March 24 and April 22 from 7:30 p.m. until 10 p.m. Full Moon – Jan. 10, Feb 8, March 9 and April 7, from 7:30 p.m. until 10 p.m.

Your beloved MP3 player is now considered “vintage.”

An exciting date with your partner means canoodling on the couch in your fuzzy socks rather than hitting the restaurant district in those uncomfortable but oh-so-fashionable shoes.

And you finally understand why your parents insisted on turning down the thermostat when they went to bed at night: they were the ones paying the heating bills.

Ah, to be an adult.

Your priorities have changed, along with your idea of a good time. But that’s okay. It’s even something to celebrate for all the opportunities that await.

Here’s one way to embrace your newfound appreciation of adulthood: switch your home heating to natural gas. It helps you save you money on utility bills so you can spend it on the things that bring you joy — especially being warm and cosy in your home.

Heating with natural gas is one-third the cost of electricity. Not only will your energy bills be lower, but when it’s cold and dark outside, you won’t feel the need to go out to have an enjoyable evening.

The warmth from natural gas feels, well, more natural. Forced-air natural gas furnaces provide comfortable, evenly balanced warmth while natural gas hydronic heating systems use radiant heat to keep you cosy. And who doesn’t want to feel radiant?

The conversion to natural gas doesn’t need to be a daunting project, either. Natural gas room heaters and wall furnaces are compact and economical. Remember when, as one of your first steps towards adulthood, you figured out that Santa doesn’t really need a chimney to do his job? Well, neither do you if you want to enjoy that warm, seasonal glow. The heaters can be installed on most exterior walls. No chimney required.

There’s more.

By reducing your energy usage (and, therefore, your utility bills), you can contribute to a lower-carbon future for BC.

A new ENERGY STAR® natural gas furnace is almost 100 per cent efficient. Here’s the math: when the furnace is installed correctly, for every dollar that you spend on natural gas, between $0.95 and $0.99 is used as heat. Since we’re now a penny-less country, when you round it up that’s a near-perfect system for wise use of our resources.

After you have it installed, you can make sure your natural gas furnace is working as efficiently and safely as possible by having a licensed contractor service it regularly. You can find qualified contractors in the Trade Ally Network Directory here.

Yes, but... (Sigh. Isn’t there always a “Yes, but…” in life?)

When you become an adult, the things you want tend to cost more than the running shoes or concert tickets that you simply had to have when you were younger. You might want to save money by switching to natural gas, but what about the cost?

There’s good news. You can get rebates up to $1,000 on high-efficiency natural gas furnaces and $1,500 for high eligible efficacy space and water heating systems. Here’s how.

And, finally, if becoming an adult means taking pride in your own do-it-yourself skills, here are a few handy things you can do to ensure you’re literally not throwing money out the window.

Draftproof your home by applying weatherstripping where exterior doors and windows meet.

Look for caulking for windows and doors at the hardware store. You can apply an acrylic/latex interior caulk around windows where the trim meets the wall.

Install a connected thermostat that lets you be as cost-smart as your parents without having to hear their voices in your head — “Don’t forget to turn down the heat!” — every time you settle down for the night. BTW, the recommended temperatures are 20° when you’re at home and 17° when you’re sleeping.",[]

Certainly that lyric was running through my head as I sat behind the steering wheel of what is absolutely not a large automobile a few months ago. In fact, it was the smallest automobile I’d ever driven, and indeed the smallest ever made.

article continues below

The car in question was a Peel P50, built on the Isle of Man, and simultaneously rare, valuable, slow, silly, fragile, and dangerous. When you’re basically driving a three-speed eggshell with no reverse gear and fuel sloshing around by your right hand, you tend to pay attention.

The Peel was certainly one of the more interesting rides I found myself in this year, but there were others. As has become tradition, it’s time for me to look back over the year and see what kind of ridiculous stuff I got up to.

Mini celebrated its 60th anniversary this year, a storied history that includes rally racing in little Coopers like this one. photo supplied, Brendan McAleer

As an automotive freelancer, I write for about seven publications currently, which means about four or more feature stories per week. Of those roughly 200+ stories, some are regular looks at new cars or emerging technologies, and other stuff that editors essentially have to force me to do at gunpoint lest I get distracted.

When they’re not paying attention, the fun happens.

Things kicked off this year with a double-whammy of Mini goodness as the little car celebrated its 60th anniversary. The Mini looms particularly large for anyone with Northern Irish heritage, thanks to the rally exploits of Paddy Hopkirk.

Not only did I get a chance to interview Hopkirk himself – still a lively gent in his 80s – but I had a chance to drive an original Cooper set up like his rally car. Hammering around in a cloud of poorly combusted hydrocarbons, I imagined myself at the Monte Carlo rally, sawing at the wheel and muttering Norn Iron curses under my breath.

Later in the spring I had a go at America’s version of the Monte Carlo mountain roads, the Tail of the Dragon between North Carolina and Tennessee. Put this one on your bucket list, but don’t forget to explore a bit when you get down there, as some of the surrounding roads are even better than the Dragon itself.

Lots of Japanese car heritage was a theme this year, as I drove some of the earliest Hondas in the U.S. and Canada, and tracked down some early Datsun and Subaru history too. Having found a Honda S600 up in the Interior, I can report back that it was a highlight drive of this year for its jewel-like perfection. We got Honda a little earlier in Canada than in the U.S.

Datsun history turned out to be more about the people than the machinery. I drove a first-generation Fairlady, which was audacious but a bit slow, but it was digging into the history of the 240Z that really rewarded. I found one local owner, and one in Tokyo, and while they didn’t speak the same language, the appreciation each had for their Z was a bond across the Pacific.

Bonds across generations were also a theme this year. At our local Carbs and Coffee events, I met plenty of youthful enthusiasts who were still interested in cars. I even met a Dodge Rampage fan who was still in high school, yet volunteered at the vintage truck museum.

And, when the snow was still capping the Cascade Mountains, I headed down to Tacoma with my eldest daughter to get a look at the original Bullitt Mustang. We got to watch “the chase” together, which she loved, and it was great to see that a Mustang can still appeal across generations. It helped to have a great drive up and into the mountains for a camping weekend.

There’s nothing to beat the sound of a big American V-8 all revved up.

Weirdly, I also found myself hearing the growl coming from beneath the hacked-up hood of a 1970s Volvo. Built by a young machinist, this Mad Max looking car had a great story, one that both young and old readers really responded to.

Finding new ways to look at cars was also a big part of the year, with a couple of stories taking me into the mountains again. I drove a Nissan GT-R out to our local Japanese classic car show (a must-see event, catch it next year if you missed it), and then down to the Hanford Site, the place where the Manhattan project kicked off. The GT-R being nicknamed Godzilla, visiting an atomic wasteland seemed highlight appropriate (and radioactive).

I also popped over to Leavenworth, Wash. in a Supra. The new Supra is actually a BMW underneath, and Leavenworth is a fake Bavarian mountain town. The pairing worked.

Other miscellaneous oddballs include driving a Citroen 2CV around Yokohama, pitching an electric Renault Twizy up against a mid-engined Clio V-6, and driving the fastest Nissan 300ZX in the world. This last was the actual Bonneville speed record car, capable of 260 miles per hour (420 kilometres per hour). The parachute was removed and a licence plate attached. Japan can be like that.

Everywhere I went, I met new and interesting people, all with a unique love of cars. There were hot-rodders obsessed with swapping electric powertrains into classics, young people determined to turn 1980s and 1990s cars into the new vintage cars, rally drivers, show and shine folks, and people who just liked to get out for a good long drive.

All of them, from the owner of a flawless Sunbeam Tiger to a young Japanese woman with a Lancia Delta, were only too eager to tell their stories and talk about cars. I have so many thank you notes to write at the end of this year, I might be doing so well into January.

Really, that’s how I find myself in this seat, typing away at my laptop, getting ready for what 2020 might bring. How did I get here? Well, many people helped me out, including the owner of that Peel P50. There are so many stories still to find and write, and so little time to do it.

Bring on the New Year. Let’s hit the road.

Totally redesigned for 2020 model year, the all-new Toyota Corolla is actually beautiful, maybe even bold, and now offers a hybrid option. The Corolla has become a household name in terms of reliability, safety and affordability, and the 2020 model brings all of these traits to a new level.

article continues below

Toyota has made the right move by improving on key areas and by adding new features to stay competitive on the global scene. After selling more than 45 million cars, the newest Corolla offers better drivability and handling, comprehensive safety features, a hybrid option, and a much improved infotainment system.

Design

The body of the 2020 Toyota Corolla is lower, wider and built on the TNGA (Toyota New Global Architecture) which provides many engineering advancements and includes such items as a multi-link rear suspension system.

This new platform has improved everything from shock absorption to safety – Toyota claims this is the “most fun to drive” Corolla ever produced. Let me elaborate on that later.

The new Corolla has a bold look that holds up well when compared to more expensive European luxury machines. photo supplied Toyota

A sloped and angled hood ends in an attractive honeycomb grille that results in a bolder, much more modern design. The new car is attractive enough that it almost looks like a small Audi or something out of Europe.

Even though the Toyota Corolla is not known to be a luxury vehicle, the quality of the interior materials is excellent and the whole interior shows much more upscale feel than before. The intuitive infotainment system is hugely improved and the Corolla comes with many standard items, including advanced safety features. Toyota even offers a Toyota+Alexa app right in the infotainment system to help you navigate, play music and ask just about any question that comes to mind via Alexa. Apple CarPlay is included in the 2020 Toyota Corolla, while Android Auto is not yet available.

Toyota’s Safety Sense 2.0 suite of features are impressive for an entry level car. With features such as lane tracing assist, road edge detection, full-speed range dynamic radar cruise control, as well as bicycle and pedestrian detection, Corolla drivers can drive with confidence and those around them can also have peace of mind.

Performance

There are many trim levels for the Toyota Corolla including L, LE, XLE, SE, XSE, and Hybrid. For all trim levels, buyers have a choice of two engines plus a hybrid option.

Included in the base L trim as well as in the LE and XLE trims is a 1.8-litre in-line four-cylinder engine with 139 horsepower and 126 foot-pounds of torque. Combined city/highway fuel economy for this engine is 7.1 litres/100 kilometres for both manual and automatic transmissions.

The engine upgrade for the SE and XSE is a 2.0-litre Dynamic Force in-line four-cylinder which produces 169 h.p. and 151 foot-pounds of torque. Combined city/highway fuel economy for this sportier Corolla is at 7.4 l/100 km for the manual transmission and 6.7 l/100 km for automatic. SE and XSE trims also include a sporty grille and bumper, rear diffuser, dual exhaust tips and tail spoiler.

For the new hybrid option, Toyota equips the car with a 1.8-litre in-line four-cylinder combined with eCVT (Electronically Controlled Continuously Variable Transmission), which produces 121 h.p. It isn’t the strongest hybrid engine out there on the market today, but you get a significant fuel improvement (combined city/highway driving will get you an impressive 4.5 l/100 km).

Regardless of the trim, the new Corolla brings a level of refinement and feel never seen in previous Corollas. The car is generally quiet (though the engine can be somewhat buzzy), tracks straight and rides silky smooth. The handling is balanced and predictable, but it’s not as sharp as the feeling in the Honda Civic or the Mazda3. The car is a very “easy” car to drive, and overall delivers good performance for an entry level vehicle.

Despite being somewhat old now, I would say the Honda Civic still provides slightly better handling and performance. And the new Mazda3 delivers BMW-like refinement and handling that is still a cut above the Corolla, though that vehicle costs more.

Summary

Weighing all options, the SE or XSE might be the best choice as it comes with a better engine, better styling, more comfort features and a larger infotainment panel. The Toyota Corolla has been a staple vehicle over the years and has represented top-level reliability and practicality at an affordable price. Most of us can say we have owned or know someone who has owned a Corolla, and as such, it represents an important history for the auto industry.

The 2020 Toyota Corolla starts from $18,990 and goes up to $26,990 for the L, LE and XLE trims. For the SE trim, prices start from $22,290 and go all the way to $28,490 for the XSE. The hybrid option for the Corolla rings at reasonable $24,790 – a surprisingly affordable price.

All in all, the new Corolla is the best Corolla to date, and I would argue that it is in fact the best handling Corolla ever. It just isn’t the best handling car in its market, but that may not matter to 99 per cent of the customers who are more concerned about quality, reliability, fuel efficiency and smooth feel.

The familiar flavours of an old fashioned or a whisky sour have remained relevant for more than 100 years because they work. They are delicious and balanced — with elements of bitter, sweet, sour and alcohol all working in perfect harmony.

For craft breweries, tapping into those flavour profiles allows their beer to at once taste familiar and completely revolutionary. Recent examples include Field House’s Whisky Sour and Twin City’s Vanishing Act, which tastes exactly like a piña colada. Central City even won Beer of the Year at the 2019 Canadian Brewing Awards for its After Dark Old Fashioned Pale Ale.

Yellow Dog’s Run Free is another beer that arguably falls into the cocktail-inspired category. This rye and ginger beer instantly brings to mind a dark ‘n’ stormy or a Moscow mule with its refreshing, zesty kick. The spiciness of the rye wonderfully complements the earthy, woody tang of the ginger, while the citrusy hop bitterness stands in for the lime juice.

You don’t need to drink this beer from a copper cup, but it couldn’t hurt!

Run Free by Yellow Dog Brewing

Ginger beer • 5.7 per cent ABV • 40 IBU • 473 mL tall cans

Appearance: Brilliant light amber with a fleeting fine white head.

Aroma: Ginger and spice and everything nice!

Flavour: Ginger, spice, citrus, earthy, woody, cereal, very refreshing, moderate hop bitterness.

Body/Finish: Medium bodied with a dry finish and a touch of lingering ginger and hop bitterness.

Pairs with: Spicy paella, jerk chicken, dickhead beef and passive aggressive duck.

For the 2020-21 season, the cap was estimated to be $84 million to $88.2 million, depending on a few factors.

That has changed.

article continues below

The suspension caused by COVID-19 and the uncertain future of the 2019-20 season leaves next season’s salary cap in serious jeopardy.

That’s because the cap is tied to league revenues. There’s meant to be a 50/50 split in revenues between the owners and the players. If there’s a drop in revenue for the owners — from a loss of gate revenue for unplayed or unattended games, unplayed playoff games, or a crashing Canadian dollar — then the NHL’s Collective Bargaining Agreement leads to less money for the players the following season in the form of a reduced salary cap.

A significant increase in the salary cap would have been a major relief for a team close to the cap like the Vancouver Canucks. The Canucks were set to have a tough time navigating the cap next season, thanks to the combination of a few highly-paid veterans, performance bonuses for young stars rolling over from this current season, Roberto Luongo’s cap recapture penalty, and several restricted and unrestricted free agents they need to re-sign.

If the salary cap went up, it’s possible the Canucks wouldn’t have to choose between UFAs Jacob Markstrom, Tyler Toffoli and Chris Tanev, but could re-sign all three. A flat cap — one that stayed at $81.5 million — would force the Canucks to choose two and possibly lose another player like Troy Stecher or Josh Leivo.

If the cap goes down? Then the Canucks are in some serious trouble, with difficult decisions to make that will undoubtedly make the team worse for next season. And they’re not the only ones: plenty of other teams would feel the cap crunch from this unprecedented situation.

Potential solutions could include an artificially inflated cap, but one option that has come up in NHL circles is compliance buyouts, with Brian Burke discussing it recently on Oilers Now, a radio program with Global News.

“I’ve heard discussion of compliance buyouts to help teams get to this new cap, to solve some of their problems,” said Burke. “In the last CBA, each team got two cap-compliance buyouts which were exempt from the cap.”

A compliance buyout would differ from a regular buyout in that it wouldn’t cost money against the salary cap. For instance, the Canucks will still have a little over $1 million against next season’s cap from buying out Ryan Spooner, but the Canucks bought out Keith Ballard and David Booth in 2013 and 2014 at no cost to their cap as compliance buyouts after the 2012-13 lockout.

If teams do get a compliance buyout, it seems obvious who the Canucks would use it on. Loui Eriksson has a $6 million cap hit for two more seasons following this one and has found himself in an increasingly-diminished role, playing primarily as a shutdown, defensive forward, with little-to-no contributions offensively.

The Canucks do have other options, however. Brandon Sutter has lost several steps and has a $4.375 million cap hit next season. They could be proactive and buy out Tyler Myers’ $6 million contract for the next four seasons before his play starts to decline. Cutting their losses on Micheal Ferland’s $3.5 million cap hit for the next three seasons might be smart. They might even be tempted to buy out Sben Baertschi’s $3.37 million contract with him buried in the AHL.

Do any of those supersede Eriksson? Probably not. Where it gets interesting is if teams get two buyouts, as they did in 2013 and 2014. Buying out Eriksson would be a given, then, but who would be the second buyout? Sutter has just one year left on his contract, Ferland’s cap hit isn’t overly onerous, and Tyler Myers is still a good, useful player.

One compliance buyout would make it far easier for the Canucks to re-sign Markstrom and Tanev. Two might mean re-signing Toffoli as well.

Stick-taps and Glove-drops

A tap of the stick to Eddie Lackas he announced his retirement from professional hockey on Monday. The former Canuck said the “best time in my career” was in Vancouver and thanked the fans sincerely.

A big stick-tap to Bauer. The hockey equipment manufacturer has modified its production line to produce protective visors for healthcare workers, with Quebec already ordering 300,000 visors for their doctors, nurses, and first responders.

Big Numbers

89 In four seasons with the Canucks, Loui Eriksson has a total of 38 goals and 89 points. He had 30 goals and 63 points in just one season with the Boston Bruins prior to signing with the Canucks.

4 So far, four NHL players have tested positive for COVID-19: two from the Ottawa Senators and two from the Colorado Avalanche. The Senators’ radio colour commentator, Gord Wilson, has also tested positive, as has St. Louis Blues’ play-by-play announcer John Kelly.

There are technical details like whether the material will be hardy or slippery, and if it’s stain-resistant. There’s design – how a small or big tile will flatter your space, and how certain colours will look in your light. And then there’s finding out what you look for and what fits your taste.

If you go to a hardware store you might get some guidance. But if you go to a specialist like Tile Town, you’ll get genuine expertise. “Our goal is not just to sell you tile – it’s to improve your quality of life,” says owner, Richmond native Mike Scardina. “We have thousands of options in store, and even more that we can order, but we will curate the choices and help you find the perfect fit for your space and needs.”

The team has always encouraged customers to bring in samples of design elements such as paint and flooring. “Bring the kitchen sink, if you can fit it in your car,” jokes store manager Mark Gantly. You can also bring tile home to see how it works in your lighting. The brand’s new online service, Town Square (see Mytiletown.ca), elevates things further. You create an account and upload photos of your space, swatches and inspiration shots so you can share your vision with your consultant in store.

“It’s all about our goal of delivering excellent customer service – no pushiness or aggressive sales techniques, which is I think why we’ve won multiple Consumer Choice Awards,” says Gantly. “Our new space at Bridgeport Road will be a game changer in that respect. It’s a showroom with a warm and welcoming atmosphere and natural light. There’s a coffee station and we really encourage customers to take their time to shop.” There are Cantonese and Mandarin speakers on staff too – an important feature in Richmond. “We are committed to participating in the community, through our fundraising work and also our inclusive hiring policy,” says Scardina. “For the past four or five years we’ve employed people with disabilities.

Many of these vegetables can be grown in our own gardens such as pac choi, mustard greens, napa cabbage and many other delicious greens.

One of the vegetables he highlighted, is growing in most of our gardens. Garlic scapes. After his description on how to cook these unusual looking plants, we couldn’t wait to harvest these delectable greens.

article continues below

You will notice in early to mid June that your garlic is sending up a stalk in from the centre of the leaves. The stalk is thicker than the leaves. These pretty spiral stems are edible.

Garlic scapes are the flower bud of the garlic plant. If left on the garlic plant, the scapes will flower and then seed. You can even eat the tiny seeds.

The bud should be removed late June though, to encourage the garlic bulbs to thicken up. Scapes are delicious to eat. They taste just like garlic. They can be used in exactly the same way as garlic in any recipe.

To cut your scapes, wait until it grows up and begins to curl or spiral upward. At that point, cut the stalk as far down as you can with cutting any leaves off.

Garlic scapes are very versatile. Try them sautéd, roasted, pickled, added to soups and more. The most tender tops of the stem and buds are delicious chopped up raw.

Garlic lovers can roast or grill entire scapes to serve as a side dish. To do so, lay the scapes on an oiled cookie sheet and roast at 350 degrees for about 20 minutes, or toss the scapes in olive oil, season with salt and pepper and place on a medium-hot grill, turning occasionally until they are slightly brown.

Garlic scapes keep well in a plastic bag in the fridge for two to three weeks. They will keep a few days in a glass of cool water, on a counter in a cool room. You will need to change the water daily.

You can even add scapes to your flower bouquets for a really unique arrangement.

Remember that not all of your scapes will come at once, so visit your garden regularly until all the scapes have been removed.

Our garden has these tender treats ready for harvest. Having never tried garlic scapes before, I now can’t get enough of them. Daily trips out to our garden always include harvesting this green stem. And, because I am cutting them, in couple of months, we will be enjoying thick juicy garlic bulbs.

So one of the huge benefits of belonging to your local garden club is gaining valuable knowledge on how to get all the benefits out of the sweat and sore muscles you put in tending to your gardens.

Although Mother Nature had been unpredictable at the start of the season, this year’s crop is still bountiful and tastier than ever, according to the BC Blueberry Council.

Blueberry lovers have the next six weeks to enjoy the fresh and plump fruits.

Humraj Kallu, owner of CanWest Farms on Blundell Road, says their U-pick blueberries have “become more popular in the last two to three years (as) more people are catching on with the trend of an outing experience.”

The farm is hosting its ninth annual blueberry kickoff this Saturday starting at 11 a.m. There will be a free kids’ zone with face painting and an animal petting zoo, food vendors and even interactive African drumming and Chinese lion dancing.

“The event gets larger every year, and we are trying to gear it towards families and kids,” added Kallu.

Richmond offers a lot of U-pick locations, including Birak Berry Farms located on No. 6 Road, which has no entrance fee and charges $2.50 for every pound of blueberry picked.

“Our blueberries are nice and big this year and people love to bring their families and pick them themselves,” said Harminder Birak.

Along with U-pick opportunities, blueberries can be found at local grocery stores, markets and roadside sales. One can buy them pre-picked at Nijjer Berry Farms for $20 per 10 pounds.

Do not fret if you accidentally picked too many blueberries because you can always freeze them to snack on later in the year.

Whether you’d like to get on your hands and knees or buy the berries fresh, grab them before they are all gone by late August.

627,richmond-news,https://www.richmond-news.com/living/column-defending-against-the-chafer-beetle-1.23782749,Column: Defending against the chafer beetle,['Lynda Pasacreta'],,"I have to talk about it again. Everybody is in a tizzy at this time of year because of the terrible damage to their lawns. Skunks, racoons and crows are enjoying a very tasty feast of grubs brought to you by the European Chafer Beetle.

This destructive insect was introduced to the Lower Mainland in 2001. It has become a very serious pest in our lawns.

article continues below

Many homeowners have had their grass ripped out and replaced with new turf to have the grubs appear in the new grass again. Some people spread topsoil and reseed hoping to chase these nasty insects away. Back it comes!

Another solution some homeowners are doing is replacing grass with artificial lawn. This is not a good solution as artificial grass is an oil based product which contributes to greenhouses gases which is not good for our planet. Think about what will happen to the plastic grass when it is at the end of its life cycle? Off to our landfills.

Some of our neighbours are spraying with nasty chemicals. These chemicals affect our pollinators and beneficial insects. There is a decline in the pollinator population due to chemicals in our environment. Pollinators are key to our food production. This is not a good choice at all, sacrificing pollinator insects for a green lawn!

I am helping out our neighbours with their lawn that has been damaged badly by the grubs of the chafer beetle. The beetles lay their eggs in lawns in most cases where there is a poor root system. Infested lawns may feel spongy due to the grubs making their way up to the surface. The grass will be wilted or dead and is easy to pull back.

My neighbours decided to remove a section of their damaged lawn and convert it into a garden bed. My hand went up to volunteer.

I am removing sections of the turf and removing the chafer grubs by hand. Crows are sitting in the trees around me yelling at me to get out of the way so they can enjoy a snack of juicy grubs. It is a long, labour-intensive task but worth the effort. Many of our neighbours are stopping by to take a look at my bucket of chafer grubs.

Once I have dug up all the damaged grass and created my garden bed, I will mix in an organic soil to amend the current soil and then plant up the garden bed with drought resistant perennial plants and shrubs.

Another of our neighbours went through the same process on their damaged lawn last year. The turf was removed, the soil dug up about a foot deep, chafer grubs were removed by hand and then new soil was added. A chafer resistant blend of grass seed was spread which contains a type of fescue and micro clover that the chafer beetle does not like. The most important step in this method is to water the newly seeded grass deeply every day to make sure deep roots are established. Our neighbours lawn is green and lush this year with no signs of chafer damage. We will continue to monitor their lawn for any signs of chafer damage.

If you are lucky and have not been affected by the chafer beetle, make sure to not cut your grass too short. Longer grass blades means a longer root system which is more resilient to the chafer beetle. Leave your grass clippings in the lawn which will naturally act as a fertilizer. Overseed your lawn right now to contribute to a lush and dense lawn. This is also a great time to add lime to your lawn. Lime counteracts the soil’s natural acidity which prevents grass from taking up key nutrients it needs for optimal growth.

Check out the City of Richmond’s website (www.richmond.ca) for more information about dealing with this prolific pest.

As a final note, I beg you not to use any chemicals. There are no insecticides allowed to be used under the City of Richmond’s Pesticide Use Control Bylaw No. 8514. Laws aside, chemicals are destroying our bees, butterflies and other beneficial insects that contribute to our food production. I also beg you not to install artificial grass. It can increase temperatures and can affect storm water runoff which can carry debris into our storm sewers causing water pollution. Parts of artificial grass is often made from recycled tires. Artificial grass does not appear to be a healthy solution for the homeowner nor the environment.

3. Learn how to sell yourself

Intelligent marketing is one of your best tools for finding success in any industry. Clients want to know what you can do for them and why your services are different and better than the competition. This is important to remember when you’re seeking new leads.

Ensure you have an up-to-date, informative and visually appealingwebsite, which should include a blog, an information page with a working contact form and separate pages so clients can learn about you, your services and the advantages in choosing you to handle their business.

Successful brokers should also have active social media pages and an established presence in search engine business indexes.

4. Find your niche and be vocal about it

What makes your particular freight brokerage better than your competitors'?

Don’t rely on vague promises of reliability and ""putting the customer first"" to gain the interest of potential clients.

Successful freight brokers should be professional, reliable and client-focused, so using these tactics as the thrust of your marketing would be like a car salesman trying to close a deal by telling your that the vehicle comes with four tires and a steering wheel.

Instead, take time to figure out what your unique offerings are, such as experience in a certain mode of trucking or logistics competitors may not have.

Dedicate some time and creativity to finding your niche, and base your marketing strategy around capturing that corner of the industry and making a name for yourself.

5. Never stop learning and growing

One secret to becoming a more successful freight broker mid-career is to never feel like you’ve learned all there is to know. Make it a habit to constantly look for conferences, webinars, news articles and classes that can help you stay at the cutting edge of your industry. Develop relationships with industry professionals you can learn from, and don’t be afraid to ask questions or try something new.

These are four benefits to customers who choose 12 Baskets Nutrition & Health Co. at Blundell Centre over shopping at larger retailers.

“What sets us apart is the fact we operate like a small, local health food store when everything else in the marketplace is going the way of big box stores,” says Christina Liu, 12 Baskets’ sales and purchasing manager. “The advantage of us being smaller is our staff have more time to talk to the customers, find out why they came in and help them find what they need.

“Customers come in here, and we can educate them and make recommendations.”

Plus, 12 Baskets is price competitive.

“You get premium products for the best possible price,” Liu says.

There are a total of four locations, one in Burnaby, another in Vancouver, and two in Richmond - at Blundell Centre and on Cambie Road.

All four pride themselves in not simply selling products to customers, but taking the time to understand why they came in.

“We look at their lifestyle,” Liu explains. “We educate them on what to eat and what not to eat, basics like that.

“We learn about their history. It’s not just a matter of having someone walk in, and we sell them a product.

“There’s much more to it.

“We look at general health and prevention,” she says.

“Customers can go to a doctor and get medicine to treat their symptoms. We want to help treat the underlying issues.”

In many cases, especially at large stores, there can also be an overwhelming volume of products that customers may end up having a hard time choosing the one that’s best suited to their condition.

At 12 Baskets, regular training keeps staff up-to-date with what will be the most effective for customers.

“And customers are getting the opportunity to talk with someone who is knowledgeable about what they are recommending,” says Liu, who is trained as a holistic nutritionist and uses that education when it comes to purchasing products for the store.

“I will not carry every brand out there. Plus, I want to ensure what is on the shelves is backed up by scientific studies and will be effective for our customers,” she says. “That way, they can purchase items with confidence.

“Ultimately, we want customers walking away from the store feeling better,” she says.

Luckily, Aldila Boutique is here to help.

“It is important that your clothing choices are right for you,” says Elif Costello, one of the owners of Aldila. “Don’t worry about what’s trendy– it’s more important to find something you really like.”

Accoding to Costello, women need to feel comfortable with what they’re wearing—and to feel empowered when they get dressed in the morning.

“It’s great to try new things,” she says, “but if you’re not feeling it, don’t buy it. Otherwise, it’ll just sit in your closet.”

Costello knows how easy it is to get wrapped up in what’s in or what’s out but she’s quick to remind clients that they are the one who has to wear it, not the model in the magazine.

“It doesn’t matter if skinny jeans are popular one day and boot cut jeans the next,” she says. “There are lots of different fits available at any given time. You need to find the fit that best suits your personal style.”

A pair of jeans is one of the best clothing investments you can make, according to Costello. They can be dressed up or dressed down, and worn 12 months a year. Aldila carries a wide variety of jeans including NYDJ, Yoga Jeans (which are made in Canada), Liverpool, and premium denim products from MAC Jeans.

“We wear jeans more than we wear anything else,” she says. “In our Lower Mainland casual environment, you’re wearing jeans all the time. So get a good pair that fit right.”

For women looking to completely revamp their wardrobes, it’s good to start with the basics, says Costello. Jeans and blouses are a good foundation for everyday wear, and it’s easy to add jackets, scarves and jewelry.

“Start with the core and build from there,” she advises. “And make sure you’re comfortable with everything you add.”

Aldila carries a wide range of lines from Montreal, New York, California and Europe. Collections include Joseph Ribkoff, Cream, Sandwich, Dolcezza and their own private line, Aldila Designs, which is made right here in Vancouver.

What was once a humble lemonade stand has blossomed, with the help of innovation and guidance, into a myriad of potential prospects. Take, for instance, CupPaul, an original non-stick cup holder invented by seven-year-old Paul, or Time Caps, made by Coby, 15, who fashions clocks made of old hubcaps.

These are just some of the ‘kid-preneurs’ and ‘biz-kids’ at Young Entrepreneur Learning Labs, an after school enrichment program designed to engage children in entrepreneurial thinking using fun, creative ways. Founder and CEO, Tressa Wood, is the woman behind the business, putting her own entrepreneurial talents, once again, to good use.

“One of the fundamentals of entrepreneurship is solving problems and looking for opportunities,” Wood, who has her own entrepreneurial background in franchising, said. “If you teach kids to start looking at the world like that from a young age, you are giving them a real advantage in the future, even if they don’t become an entrepreneur. Taking initiative, finding solutions to problems and learning from your mistakes are crucial to success in any career.”

After looking at the school system, Wood saw how the rapidly changing economy influences what is being taught – and what should be taught – in school. Driven to ensure that the future generations, like those of her daughters aged seven and nine, would be well equipped to enter the workforce by nurturing skills that are associated with entrepreneurship early in life.

Starting Young Entrepreneur Learning Labs was part of Wood’s plan to get children to start thinking critically and creatively about solving problems that they see in the world. “Kids are naturally entrepreneurial,” Wood said, speaking to the imagination and boldness of children’s ideas, those of which are not bound by the status quo.

The programs, designed by Wood herself with the help of instructional design and educational experts, are divided by age group from seven-year-olds to fifteen-year-olds. Their 15-week program introduce the buildings blocks of business in an engaging and fun way, as kids work toward launching their own mini-business at a public Market Day.

Young Entrepreneur Learning Labs is committed to helping kids get a leg up and find their passion through entrepreneurship. At the end of it, these young entrepreneurs will appreciate the value of money, the rewards of increased confidence and can reflect on how business can be fun.

That’s what Robbie Holloway sees when he looks out at his fleet of pale blue and white work trucks proudly carrying the Holloway Painting logo.

article continues below

“We want to leave a positive imprint with our customers every time,” says Holloway, who started the family-owned and operated business in 2013 to provide interior and exterior painting services for residential and commercial customers from White Rock all the way to West Vancouver.

“When we go to a job, we are going to do something better and different from another painting company,” Holloway says. “We are going to provide that full service that customers deserve. And we have a company motto for that - Do it the right way, do it the Holloway.”

What that entails is a start-to-finish service that provides clients with confidence.

“You can post before and after photos of your work. But at the end of the day the customer has to trust that you are going to do a good job for them,” Holloway says, adding his business is one of the highest-rated painting companies in terms of reviews on Google in Canada.

“We have about 135, five-star rated reviews,” he says. “But there are so many variables when it comes to a painting company. I always tell my clients we are a high service operation.”

That means Holloway Painting is much more than a crew who shows up at your home or business with paint and brushes.

“When I first started the company, I found that the painting industry lacked proper service,” Holloway explains, adding that usually indicated a company’s lack of expertise and experience, or poor business practices by over-promising and under-delivering.

“That didn’t mean they were bad people, they just didn’t know how to run a business,” Holloway says. “Fortunately, I was pretty good at both - painting and running a business.

“Not many painting companies have sales reps, managers, and offer colour sampling. Those are just some of the additional things we do.”

Holloway Painting is also process-orientated.

“We do the colour sampling and provide scheduling updates, then there is a mid-job check-in with the client followed by a final day walk around. The paint job also comes with a three-year warranty,” Holloway explains.

“We work hard to ensure a positive experience for each and every one of our clients.”

And during current social distancing recommendations, Holloway Painting has adjusted by switching from four, to two-person crews.

But Morgan Lechner, Executive Chef of the Pier 73 Restaurant at the Pacific Gateway Hotel in Richmond, has discovered the extraordinary taste and quality of white sturgeon.

“White sturgeon can be found and fished for in the Fraser River,” he explains. “It really is an incredibly versatile fish. It’s been around in the Fraser River since the dinosaurs and it hasn’t changed at all.”

article continues below

Chef Morgan gets his supply of sturgeon from Target Marine, a producer of the world’s only certified organic caviar made from sturgeon eggs.

“Target Marine is located in Sechelt on the Sunshine Coast,” he explains. “About 18 years ago it received some white sturgeon from a local university and turned a land-based fish farm into a sturgeon farm. Because female sturgeon reach the age of about 15 before they produce eggs, it wasn’t until four or five years ago that Target was able to start producing caviar in any decent quantity.”

While Target’s caviar quickly gained popular acceptance as a certified organic brand, Chef Morgan and his team at Pier 73 opted to serve the fish.

“It’s an absolutely amazing and versatile fish,” he says. “We removed halibut from our fish and chips menu and now use white sturgeon instead. We batter and deep fry the fish and serve it with our tartar sauce, coleslaw, and hand-cut fries, and customers love it!”

If you don’t want to batter sturgeon, how else could you cook it?

“Because it’s so versatile,” Chef Morgan says, “you can fry it, bake it, or even barbeque it. Sturgeon has a dense, meaty consistency that, even when overcooked, doesn’t dry out. I call it the ‘chicken of the river’ for its versatility. It sears nicely and does well on the BBQ.”

If you’d like to try one of Chef Morgan’s sturgeon dishes, but aren’t really a fish and chips fan, he also serves sturgeon crab cakes and a sturgeon crab cake salad as well as a delicious sturgeon BLT on a brioche bun with a slice of Gelderman pork.

“Seafair had its roots as a private skating and curling club back in the 1960s,” explains Nigel Shackles, president of the Association. “The club had its own building, which was subsequently sold and demolished to make way for condos. Seafair became a community-based, minor hockey association in 1991, taking the name of the community that surrounds us.”

After the demolition of the original building, Seafair moved into the newly built Richmond Ice Centre.

“We share the venue with Richmond Minor Hockey and the Richmond Ravens, an all-female hockey association,” Nigel says. “The City of Richmond is in a unique situation; we have two community-based co-ed minor hockey associations and one of the best all-female hockey associations in North America, all within the city boundaries.”

Seafair offers both competitive and recreational programs for kids aged between four years and 20 years old.

“In 2015, we reached 802 registered players, more than ever before in our history and over double from the 391 registrations in the 1994-1995 season,” says Nigel.

Registration is now open for the 2017-2018 season and Nigel suggests you register early.

“We try to get as many registrations in as soon as possible, because it affects our ice allocation,” Nigel explains. “We work with the City of Richmond and, while they are fantastic, we do try to help them as much as possible.”

Seafair welcomes new Canadians who perhaps have never played hockey before.

“It’s a terrific way for kids to socialize,” Nigel says, “but the parents can benefit too. We find that the parents get to integrate and socialize with other parents who were born here or have been here for generations, while their kids are having fun playing hockey.”

And the friendly and knowledgeable staff at the new Benjamin Moore location at Blundell Centre can help you out.

Run by the Shivji family - who has been selling Benjamin Moore products in the Greater Vancouver area since 1996 and has eight locations in the Lower Mainland, including one at Bridgeport Road and Sweden Way - they have an extensive team of sales reps and decorators on hand to help customers of all types and needs.

Whether it’s a new look for your bedroom, updating the kitchen, or making the family room cozier and inviting, the staff at Benjamin Moore can provide you with the latest in fashionable colours to suit your style and taste using the extensive lines of premium Benjamin Moore paints and stains, which set the standard for excellence in the paint industry.

Benjamin Moore manufactures all of their own resins and colourants, allowing them full control of the manufacturing process.

Their Gennex waterborne colourants give their paints vibrant hues that will last for years.

And their colour consistency is the precise result of Benjamin Moore paint and Benjamin Moore Gennex colorant, working together, which is impossible to replicate.

So, if you’ve spent days, weeks or even months choosing the right Benjamin Moore colour, it’s critical to buy it from a Benjamin Moore paint store, versus getting it matched from a competing paint dealer.

Plus, you can rely on the expertise from Benjamin Moore’s experienced staff, who play a vital role in providing a positive customer experience.

Since there are so many issues that can come up during a home renovation project, having staff who can provide solutions and suggestions goes a long way to help customers form a strong, and hopefully long, relationship with Benjamin Moore.

The new location at Blundell Centre, which replaces the store in Steveston, brings all of that Benjamin Moore quality and experience together in one, central and easy-to-access destination.

We are not by any means in a recession yet. Investors should focus more on the mid- to long-term approach.”

That’s where NAI’s expertise come into play at GCFF. “We look at what’s doing well and what’s not. We invite companies in the positive spectrum to present their stories, as well as experts in the various markets. It’s a good opportunity to learn more about the latest trends in the investment world.”

Of particular interest to Chan is smaller companies that have higher growth potential. “Yes, there’s higher risk but high risk/high reward is what we focus on.”

Tech companies are certainly of interest. “The excitement in the future is to think about all the new advances in technology,” he says.

“This new technology is helping our daily lives. At GCFF, investors can learn about some of these technology firms. Because of the platform approach, we are not telling people what to do. Investors have to do their homework, talk to their investment advisor and make their own final decision.”

Over the past 20 years of hosting GCFF, Chan’s company has earned the trust of small cap investors. To say thank you to the community, NAI will be donating a portion of the day’s proceeds to the Richmond Hospital Foundation.

640,richmond-news,https://www.richmond-news.com/standout/4-reasons-you-should-pre-arrange-your-funeral-1.2325312,4 reasons you should pre-arrange your funeral,[],,"Should you pre-arrange your funeral?

While it may not be something you’re keen to think about, particularly when you’re in good health and enjoying life, Andrew Knapman, Location Manager at Forest Lawn Funeral Home in Burnaby – and along with Ocean View Funeral Home is part of the Dignity Memorial® Network of funeral home and cemetery providers – is quick to point out that it can make things a lot easier for your loved ones in a very difficult time.

article continues below

“In the Dignity network, there are thousands of people who have taken the responsible step of pre-arranging their funerals, just as they would any other part of their estate planning,” says Andrew. “It’s a really sensible approach to take when planning for the future.”

Still not sure? Here are four reasons why pre-arranging your funeral makes sense:

1. Less worry for loved ones

“When you pre-arrange your funeral,” Andrew explains, “you’re relieving your family of the burden of having to make difficult decisions when grieving. They also won’t have to worry about funeral expenses.” With a pre-arranged plan, family members can sit down with a compassionate funeral director who will guide them through what’s been pre-arranged and discuss dates and times for the service.

2. Making your wishes known

Another worry for any family when a loved one dies is making sure that the funeral arrangements are in keeping with what the deceased would have wanted. “Pre-arranging your funeral means that you’ve made the decision of what type of service you want – traditional or less formal – whether you want burial or cremation, whether your cremated remains will be scattered or interred, and so on,” says Andrew. “Your family won’t be left to second guess what you would have wanted in their time of grief.”

3. Lock in at today’s prices

“When you prearrange your funeral with Dignity Memorial®,” says Andrew, “you also pre-pay. This means that if prices rise, and there are bound to be price increases over the years, your plan is locked in at the price in effect at the time of arrangement.” Again, no surprises or worry for your family and loved ones.

4. Finding the value and quality you want

Dignity Memorial® recognizes that investigating the different funeral options is an important part of making your final arrangements. Comparing the various products and services of funeral providers allows you to find the quality of service that’s right for you and your family. Sitting down with an experienced director will help you understand all your options.

That pretty much sums up the philosophy behind exercising the Pilates way, which is coming to the Coppersmith Corner Shopping Centre at Ironwood with the opening in early June of a brand new Club Pilates studio.

Located between Nando’s and Mark’s Work Warehouse, it covers 2,000 square feet and is equipped with 12 Pilates reformers - specialized workout machines which incorporate flexibility and resistance exercises developed by Joseph Pilates, who created the exercise format around the conclusion of the Second World War. He used his experience working with injured soldiers to help them regain their mobility.

In the 1950s and ‘60s, the Pilates method gained a following with celebrities and athletes of the era, and it has continued to grow in popularity to this day.

Club Pilates started in San Diego in 2007, California, as an affordable format for customers.

Today, Club Pilates has expanded to 600 franchised locations across the U.S. with nine in Canada, and others across the globe.

“Our new location is one of just four Club Pilates in B.C.,” says franchise owner Siew Baxter. “And we will be offering classes for everyone at any level of fitness.

“We don’t try to make all of our customers look like bodybuilders,” Baxter adds. “But we still want them to develop muscle tone that will help them with their everyday life. We want them to be both flexible and strong.

“It’s not always about how you look. It’s more about how you feel.”

In keeping with social distancing guidelines during the current COVID-19 pandemic, Club Pilates at Ironwood will be incorporating special measures to help keep its members safe.

Each of the reformers will be placed six feet apart.

And when classes do start, the studio will run at half capacity.

“We’ll have just six members per class, one person on every other reformer, keeping us well within the social distancing guidelines,” Baxter said. “Everyone will be at least 12 feet apart.”

There will also be a half-hour break between classes so studio staff can thoroughly clean and disinfect the equipment before a new class begins. And those incoming customers will then switch to the reformers not used by the previous class.

To help customers ease into the Pilates format, there are virtual exercises posted on the Club Pilates website which can be performed without a reformer machine - all you need is a mat and floorspace.

And the Ironwood studio will celebrate its soft opening in the first week of June with free introductory classes. From June 8, regular classes for signed-up members begin, but will also feature some free sessions throughout the week.

When children have extended gaps in learning, they can find that their skills and comprehension erode by the time school starts again. Normally called the summer slide, this phenomenon has been exacerbated by school closings across the country in light of COVID-19.

Mathnasium of Richmond, an after-school math and learning centre that helps children from kindergarten to grade 12, is helping students fight the COVID slide and prepare them for the upcoming academic year.

The math learning centre will reopen July 1 but Mathnasium of Richmond BC has also launched Mathnasium@Home, an online platform that offers real-time, face-to-face instruction that students can access wherever they have an internet connection.

“We’re still able to have face-to-face with the kids, and they’re able to see a teacher working on a whiteboard with them over the internet. We’ve found the kids like this because they can talk and have interaction,” Mathnasium of Richmond owner and director Tony Colabella says.

The centre will be reopening July 1 with the COVID-19 health and safety protocols in place, ensuring social distancing and hand hygiene. Mathnasium will be open to students all year round, even in the summer, and will offer flexibility for parents – whether that means dropping students off at their convenience during office hours or the option of online sessions while on holiday.

“We find that kids who go to school year-round hold onto skills a lot more,” Colabella says.

“Kids will have been away from school around more than five months by the time school starts again in September. It’s amazing how many skills they can lose in that time.”

Mathnasium combines quality, personalized instruction with learning games to help students excel in math. When students first enter the program, Mathnasium does a comprehensive assessment to understand their knowledge and skill gaps, as well as their strengths. After that, they will receive an individual learning plan to work through with their engaged, face-to-face instructors.

Mathnasium improves a child’s confidence in math by fostering an understanding of the foundational skills of math. The centre doesn’t give out homework, but students can bring in their assignments and work through it with Mathnasium’s instructors. Students have a chance to earn rewards for completed assignments.

“It’s very easy to forget things you memorize and nearly impossible to forget things you understand,” Colabella says.

“We prefer to help kids understand the concepts – if we can help students understand, they’ll be able to hold onto those math skills.”

Rest Your Head: Set on an expansive double lot in a community nestled on the hill overlooking Gibsons Marina, The Seasalt Cottage is a quiet home base from which to explore Gibsons Landing and the nearby towns of Sechelt and Roberts Creek. The owner, Michele, has lovingly renovated the two guest suites—one on the ground level and one on the “Upper Deck,” in the complex in which she resides with her adorable French bulldog, Chloe.Each suite is bright and stylishly decorated with plush furnishings and marine-inspired décor touches (think seashells and a white and blue pastel colour scheme). Both guest units boast soaker tubs, TVs/Netflix, wifi and kitchenettes which are perfect for those wanting to stay for more than a couple of nights (and who wouldn’t want that when this adorable pup is one of your hosts?).

article continues below

While the interiors are pristine and calming, the exterior space at The Seasalt Cottage is truly spectacular. Both suites have their own private patios where guests can enjoy a glass of wine while relaxing and enjoying the refreshing sea breeze. These terraces extend onto a huge garden filled where undulating pathways winding past lush bushes, vines and flowers.

Michele has created a few different seating areas nestled within the garden where guests can while away summer afternoons swaying in one of the suspended rocking chairs while taking in views of the sparkling sea and listening to the sound of water trickling from the fountains installed throughout the garden. Guests can also make use of the communal barbecue, grilling up seafood bought at the Gibsons Farmer’s Market (or caught on a fishing trip) and enjoying it in the outdoor dining area under a grapevine-covered arbour.

Wine & Dine: Just a three-minute walk down the hill from The Seasalt Cottage you’ll find an array of hip boutiques, coffee shops, restaurants and pubs at Gibsons Landing. My friend Fran and I arrived late on a Friday night and as soon as we dropped our bags in our suite we made a beeline to Tapworks pub, on Michele’s recommendation. The brewery has recently expanded from a hole-in-the-wall behind Gibsons Art Gallery to a two-level hotspot to see-and-be-seen while sipping locally crafted brews.

After ascending to the second floor, Fran and I made ourselves comfortable next to the firepit and ordered beer tasting flights, flatbread and spinach and artichoke dip from the snack menu. It wasn’t long before we had made friends with a couple of folks in their sixties who were visiting from West Vancouver and a group of twenty-somethings who were in town from Kitsilano. By the end of the night, we were playing board games with our new friends in the pub’s first-floor area. I mentioned to Fran later that night that it was Gibsons’ friendly small-town vibe that had likely inspired us to bond with complete strangers so quickly: if we had encountered the same people in a Vancouver bar we probably wouldn’t have connected in the same way.

Other notable (and super hip) dining experiences in Gibsons include Buono Osteria, a new Italian restaurant with a warm ambiance that overlooks the marina. Opened by Wally Buono’s son, the eatery serves traditional Italian fare with a modern twist, as well as excellent wines. Fran and I loved the locally foraged wild mushroom Bucatini with celery root and sherry cream. For happy hour drinks, super fresh oysters and a fun environment, head to Smitty’s Oyster House which is set right on the water. Next door Lunitas Mexican Eatery serves up beer, margaritas and excellent Mexican fare.

No trip to Gibsons is complete without a meal at the infamous Molly’s Reach restaurant which made its mark in the ’70s as one of the locations in the infamous Beachcombers series. On Day 2, Fran and I started our morning with a bacon and egg breakfast at the eatery while listening to Elvis tunes and overlooking Gibsons Marina.

Later in the day we had coffee at the locally owned and operated Beachcomber Coffee shop, an energetic little place located right on Gibsons’ Gower Point strip. I loved the unexpected, youthful vibe of the space known for its neon yellow and green branding and club-style music. On the last morning of my stay, after Fran had returned to Vancouver, I sat on the patio for a couple of hours, drinking coffee and snacking on pastries from Sandy’s Bake Shoppe down the street, people-watching, chatting with the locals and listening as they caught up on life.

Explore: The Sunshine Coast is a haven for nature-lovers so hiking, kayaking, fishing and beach-going are givens for visitors to the area. Soames Hill is a beautiful intermediate hike that we completed in about an hour and rewarded us with spectacular views of the Georgia Strait and Keats and Bowen Islands. Davis Bay is a beautiful beach to park yourself for the day with a blanket and a book. And for breathtaking sunsets Bonniebrook beach comes highly recommended by the locals I chatted with a Beachcomber Coffee.

But there is also lots to do right in Gibsons. You could spend a few hours visiting the many shops and boutiques along the strip which sell well-curated homewares and local art, as we did. And the Gibsons Public Market, opened in March 2017, is a fun place to pick up local cheeses, fresh fish, produce and flowers, and to visit the Nicholas Sonntag Marine Education Centre which temporarily holds local marine life in its tanks until they are returned to their natural habitat.

After spending a weekend getting to know Gibsons, it’s strange for me to think that it was once a town I’d drive through, without a thought, on my way to Sechelt. Now I realize it’s a gem in its own right—and I’ll definitely be back the next time I want a fun and laid back experience just a boat ride from Vancouver.

Instead, the market—whether it’s a buyer’s market or a seller’s market—is the determining factor when setting a home’s final sale price. Other factors include the unique and individual circumstances surrounding each seller or buyer at the time of the transaction.

article continues below

“In a nutshell, the commission you pay has no correlation to the selling price of your home,” says Nari Thiara, a real estate agent with One Percent Realty.

For One Percent Realty, the role of the Realtor® has changed to that of one who facilitates the negotiation between a homebuyer and a home seller. It’s why the full-service discount real estate company has eliminated charging the high commission that usually comes with the sale of a home.

“There’s no need to pay Realtors® so much commission when their role has changed,” says Nari, who’s been a real estate agent in Richmond for 12 years. “The people have access to all the listings online. The Realtor® is no longer providing information that’s inaccessible to the general public. Instead, their role is really to help the with the negotiations and the signing of any documents.”

Prospective clients looking to sell their homes may have some concerns about a One Percent Realtor’s® incentive to negotiate a higher sale price on their behalf. After all, if the Realtors® aren’t being paid a high commission, they might not be as motivated to sell the home.

“My drive to serve my clients’ best interests is not driven by a commission rate,” says Nari.

For traditional real estate agents—those who charge 7% commission on the first $100,000, and 2.5% on the balance—there’s little difference in commission between a home that sells at $1,000,000 or one that sells $1,020,000, she points out.

“It’s the difference of either $29,500 in commission or $30,000—that’s only $500 more,” she says. “A home price that accurately reflects current market conditions will sell regardless.”

But the name actually comes from a song made popular in the 1960’s by Italian singer, Betty Curtis.

“Al di la is an Italian song,” says Elif Costello, whose parents founded Aldila Boutique 30 years ago. “It means ‘beyond’ in English. It just happened to be one of my parents’ favourite songs back then.”

At the time, the original store imported leather goods from Turkey, according to Costello. In the years that followed, the product line expanded- and so did the number of stores.

Today, there are seven Adila Boutiques with locations across the Lower Mainland, including Richmond, Kelowna and Alberta. The fashion boutiques now carry women’s lines from Montreal, New York, California and Europe, as well as their private label, Aldila Designs, which is made right here in Vancouver. Brands include Joseph Ribkoff, Sandwich, Mac jeans, and Dolcezza.

“We try to focus on what made us successful— providing women with great fashion and fantastic customer service,” Costello says.

The clothing appeals to a wide range of women, Costello adds, noting that many daughters bring their mothers in so that they can shop together.

“It makes sense because my mom and I do the buying for the stores,” she says. “My mother can buy for her age group and I sort of buy for my age group.”

Costello is proud of Aldila Boutique’s connections in the communities it serves. In Richmond, Aldila was a sponsor of the Nite of Hope fundraiser for five years, which raised money for the B.C. and Yukon chapter of the Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation. The company also sponsors a number of school and local charity events.

These are the questions asked by Co-operators agents concerned for the well-being of their customers.

article continues below

“The financial security for Canadians and their communities is a key aspect of what we do,” says Insurance and Financial Advisor Daniel Wang of Daniel Wang Agencies “We know that if something happens to the head of a household, there’s a significant impact. What’s going to happen to the family? What happens to the roof over their head?”

That’s why you need to consider a life insurance policy that will provide for your family or beneficiaries, or take care of expenses and taxes after you’re gone.

When looking at life insurance, it’s important to distinguish between permanent and term insurance, says Wang.

“Permanent life insurance builds in value within your policy, so when you pass away, there is enough at death to cover capital gains tax,” he explains. “This is important if you have a rental property, because the capital gains tax becomes due when the owner passes away.”

Term policies don’t work that way, says Wang, because the price goes up each time the term renews and usually people just walk away from the policy, so it never pays out.

“Permanent policies will never lapse,” says Wang. “They are initially more expensive, but they will pay dividends in the long term.” And once you set a premium, it never changes.

You can also start with term insurance and convert it to permanent if you want. And you can cancel your permanent policy and get your money out.

“People who are value-focused tend to gravitate toward a permanent policy,” says Wang.

Even if you already have a life insurance policy, if you’ve had it for a while, you should consider reviewing it, says Wang.

“People’s lives change – you get married, you have kids, you get a job, you lose a job – you should always chat with your advisers,” he says. “What are your needs now compared to three years ago? Are they the same? Great! If not, let’s start talking about it.”

Nigel Shackles, president of the Association, is passionate that young people should enjoy the game and have fun rather than stressing over winning all the time.

“Sure, we all love to win and no one likes to lose,” he says, “but there’s so much to learn in the process.”

Nigel points out that our kids are only kids for a very short time.

“I know it seems like forever at the time,” he laughs, “but they only live under your roof for a short period. When you look back and think, ‘what did I teach, what did I model?’ winning a tournament or a game won’t rank at the top of the list. But the kind of relationship you have with your kids, those things will last a life time.”

Letting kids have fun on the ice is a priority for Nigel and his team of coaches, administrators, and volunteers at Seafair.

“Every minor hockey association provides skating programs and skill development programs. Parents demand these programs and we provide them. It’s not enough to just practice anymore; parents expect skill development. But essentially, minor hockey is about kids playing the sport and having fun.”

To emphasize the fun and camaraderie part of belonging to Seafair Minor Hockey Association, the club organizes off ice events for the kids. One is the annual Steveston Sweep at Garry Point Park in Richmond, where for the past eight years about 150 parents, coaches, and young hockey players have volunteered their time and efforts to clean up the 75-acre park, which is located at the mouth of the ecologically sensitive Fraser River. Their cleanup has resulted in more than 100 bags of garbage being removed from the park.

Speaking about the Association’s success, Nigel notes, “When growing our club, we choose to not over promise and under deliver. We look after our kids and their parents. Parents refer us to other parents and that’s how you get players in and how you grow. Keep treating people well and they will keep coming back.”

Registration is now open for the 2017-2018 season and Nigel recommends you get the registration in for your young hockey player in early.

“It helps us secure the best ice allocation if we know for sure what our registration numbers look like,” he adds.

As the owner of Ember Indian Kitchen, an upscale, casual restaurant in Richmond serving up Ugandan and Indian fare, Amin set out to bring people together the one way he knows best: through flavour.

Amin named his restaurant after the burning char used to grill food and cook curries back in his home in East Africa. “Today, we are introducing the fusion of African and Indian cooking using such flames to ensure succulent and memorable meals in a warm, trendy atmosphere,” he added.

Every dish is unique in its fresh ingredients and bold spices; sharing and even eating with hands is encouraged. “This is a whole new taste experience for most people – even those familiar with Indian or African dishes,” Amin said. The elegantly designed restaurant offers a curated selection of East African and East Indian dishes that you would likely find in Uganda.

Though the names may be unfamiliar, the rich flavours and ingredients are inherently comforting, regardless of where you come from or what language you speak. Just try the coconut curry chicken, Kuku Paka, which is Amin’s grandchildren’s favourite, and, in the restaurant’s early months, became a hit right away. Vegetarian and gluten-free options are available as well; the Vegetable Pakora and Spinach Bhajia, a spinach and chickpea flour dish, are perfect for sharing. Like dishes that you would find on the streets of Kampala, Uganda, at Ember Indian Kitchen they use homemade marinades for meat and cook their vegetarian dishes with distinctive herbs and spices celebrating memories from the owner’s life.

What is Amin’s favourite dish? Probably the Kari Kebabs, an appetizer that the Sunderji family continues to enjoy on a regular basis. “They are flavorful meatballs spiced with cumin, garlic, ginger, and cilantro,” he explained.

In a place where “you can try new things and know they will be delicious,” stop by to enjoy lunch, dinner or snacks and drinks. “We look forward to sharing a fabulous patio season with everyone,” Amin said.

And at Real Mortgage Services, help will always be found.

“The employment of a mortgage broker, especially by first time buyers and even returning clients, has increased roughly 38%,” said Gord Pipkey, owner and broker at Real Mortgage Services. “We hope to provide all our clients with the best professional service and rates from our team of experienced mortgage brokers.”

Gord has been a prominent broker in the industry for decades and, in order to weather this complex industry, here are five tips he would like to share to all potential clients:

1. Potential clients should engage with a broker to find the best rate based on qualifications rather than going from lender to lender

2. Clients should provide broker sufficient information and documentation as requested in order for the broker to produce an accurate preapproval

3. Clients should always complete a personal consultation with a broker to develop an efficient, trusting working relationship

4. Clients should always advise their broker of any substantial change in their application

5. If clients are no longer interested in working with their broker due to developing a working relationship with a lender or another broker, clients should always advise their original broker to cancel their open file

The team at Real Mortgage Services hopes all potential clients consider the impact their decisions have and how important help can be in this difficult decision.

In order to build individualized programs for each student, Glen Eden draws on the skills and experience of its own diverse staff as well as outside professionals. We asked these outside professionals what makes Glen Eden different.

Rob Padgham is a speech and language pathologist who has been working with Glen Eden students for over four years. One of the things that impresses him the most is Glen Eden’s detailed tracking system, developed by Dr. Rick Brennan, Founder and Executive Director.

article continues below

“The data system allows Glen Eden staff to prevent behaviour rather than reacting to it,” Mr. Padgham says. “Other programs do have tracking systems, but I have noticed that Glen Eden’s is powerful and preventative.” He notes that other programs may not focus on physiology – the body that is driving the behaviour. “The reason the students are able to make so much progress at Glen Eden is because the staff track their physiology and really understand how to help them function best.”

Mr. Padgham also says Glen Eden is unique in integrating his techniques and strategies into the classroom, and in how quickly the program can adapt to new research. “They invite me to train their staff and teach classes to students, for example in Social Thinking skills. Other schools may not be as willing to have me involved,” says Mr. Padgham. “In other schools it might take time to adapt to new approaches and research. I have noticed that Glen Eden can be flexible and incorporate new models and evidence-based research quickly.”

Julia Johnson Baker, a certified yoga instructor and the director of Yoga It Up, an organization dedicated to bringing the benefits of yoga into schools, has been teaching weekly sessions at Glen Eden for two years. “We focus on physical improvement, empowerment…. how to calm, breathe and self-regulate their bodies in moments of high emotion and stress. Our sessions on the mat provide that mind-body connection that is huge for school.”

“To me it is a place that respects the needs of each child, and family, individually,” Johnson Baker says. “The staff work hard to discover and develop a plan for each child so they he or she can feel respected, valued and cared for. Every staff member is exceptional and students have a wonderful rapport and respect for their leaders. (Staff at Glen Eden are) always taking current research into consideration and applying it where appropriate to support decisions for each child.”

Because of Glen Eden’s small class sizes, and detailed data collection system, the school is able to offer highly personalized programming. “Glen Eden provides a unique and essential service,” says Dr. Robin Friedlander, Clinical Head of the Neuropsychiatry Clinic at BC Children’s Hospital, who has worked with several Glen Eden students over the years. Each child gets a program specifically designed to meet their needs, help them to improve their functioning, and ultimately meet their long-term goals, whether that be returning to mainstream school, going to post-secondary, or simply finding a greatly improved quality of life.

Well, if you are looking for it to do more than just keep a roof over your head, Jeff Evans, mortgage broker with Canada Innovative Financial – Mortgage Architects, has some suggestions.

One is the Manulife One Mortgage.

“It is a fairly unique and powerful product,” says Evans, who has been providing mortgage services to home buyers and homeowners since 2007. “Sometimes, people have a little difficulty understanding it, but it can provide results that can be beneficial for a lot of people.”

One of the main differences between it and most other banking products is that when you make a mortgage payment, the line of credit component within the mortgage is automatically increased, Evans explains.

“You don’t have to request any increases in the loan amount.”

Pretty much every other financial institution in the marketplace has a static line of credit.

“The fixed mortgage component decreases in the amount owing, but the line of credit doesn’t increase,” Evans says.

Normally, clients simply expect to make their monthly mortgage payments and have their balance owing reduced accordingly.

“With the Manulife One Mortgage, they can have funds available for investments if an opportunity comes up,” Evans says.

“That type of flexibility surprises many clients. It kind of blows their mind and many don’t really have a full grasp of what they could do with it.”

One strategy, sometimes referred to as the Smith Manœuvre, can be a powerful way to reduce your mortgage quickly.

“It’s a method of leveraging referred to as a tax-deductible mortgage,” Evans says.

Under the plan, when you make a principal payment on your regular fixed rate component of the mortgage, it automatically becomes available on the line of credit.

“Whenever that takes place, you can borrow the funds from the line of credit and put it into a qualifying investment which is tax-deductible,” Evans says. “It can effectively have the mortgage paid off in full, depending on the return on investment you obtain, in half the normal time, without any extra payments being made.”

The main risk comes with losing money on the investment, so identifying your risk tolerance for your portfolio is key.

“You will also need an investment advisor and accountant to make sure you stay onside with the CRA (Canada Revenue Agency),” Evans says. “It’s a more sophisticated product for someone who is more investment savvy,” Evans says. “But it can save people money.”

The courses, which cover both academic and elective subjects, are designed to give students a chance to get ahead, catch up, and have a productive summer.

Michael Khoo, the Director of Instruction - Continuing Education of the Richmond School District, said “it’s a great opportunity to engage in some learning that is different than the regular school year, and that is really focused to an area of interest or an area that needs improvement.”

From baking to badminton and jazz band to STEM, the Summer Learning program is also a great prospect for intellectual exploration. With free tuition for Canadian citizens and permanent residents, it also happens to be one of the most popular ways Richmond school-age students spend their summers. In fact, over 4,000 school-age students enrolled last year, tallying up to an impressive 20 percent of the district’s student population.

The program, which includes camps and classes for students aged six to 18, is also a great opportunity to get hands on experience. “Students really get the choice, so if they are interested in a certain area or have a summer project, the Summer Learning program can be the perfect place to get those practical and academic skills,” Khoo said.

Khoo added that the summer camps and classes are also designed to balance learning indoors and outdoors. The recently introduced summer exploration program, going into its third year, combines outdoor learning and activities with technology. Its counterpart, the summer innovation program, is ideal for students who are interested in learning with technology, as it focuses on coding and using applications for learning. All classes and camps are led by high quality teachers who engage students in a variety of dynamic and interactive learning.

“As part of Dignity Memorial®, we belong to a large network so we are able to offer a wide range of services to our customers,” says Andrew Knapman, Location Manager at Forest LawnFuneral Home. “That’s important to us because we always want to be able to provide our customers with the best possible service.”

Both Forest Lawn and Ocean View locations have operational funeral homes with reception areas. “Customers can visit the location of their choice and be comfortable knowing that all arrangements can be made in one place,” Andrew explains. “We have a large number of offerings, so they can make the best possible decision on funeral arrangements. We pride ourselves on educating people on the options, then allowing them time to decide.”

Options include a full range of funeral services for burial or cremation. Compassionate funeral professionals are familiar with burial customs of many faiths and cultures and are able to incorporate any traditions important to the family in a service held in their funeral chapels. Personalized details that make a funeral service unique often include the time-honoured traditions of personal photographs, favourite readings, or special songs.

“Because of the size of our network,” Andrew says, “Dignity is able to offer a number of programs and pre-planning arrangements not found with smaller funeral service providers. For example, we offer a national transferability program that allows customers to take their pre-arranged funeral plan to another location in the event they move within Canada or even to the United States.”

In addition, both Forest Lawn and Ocean View staff can arrange a variety of services to help grieving family and friends and honour the memory of a loved one. “People ask us to order flowers, provide a funeral service folder to distribute, plus we can also create a DVD movie from photographs they provide and set up an online memorial, which stays online in perpetuity.”

A Compassion Care Line is also available for family through the pre-arranged funeral plan, connecting people with professional counselors experienced in bereavement issues.

UCMAS (Universal Concept of Mental Arithmetic System) is a globally recognized Abacus based Mental Math program for children aged 6-13 years. The program is scientifically proven to help children perform complex calculations mentally at the kind of speeds typically associated with math geniuses. The first UCMAS center opened its doors in 1993 and today it is established in more than 80 countries and 6000+ different locations across the globe, including one right here in Richmond.

But the benefits of this innovative and effective learning process goes way beyond numbers alone:

“UCMAS is a whole brain development program, proven to enhance not just the mental math calculating skills of children, but also their concentration, focus, memory, retention capacity, listening skills, speed & accuracy. UCMAS is a platform to educate and to empower a new generation of youth with not just math, but life-skills and develop future leaders with compassion, who over a period of time will make a better world for all.” says Krishna Kumar, Director of UCMAS Richmond.

“Strengthening these fundamental functions creates a lasting improvement in children’s learning ability as well as building their confidence and self-esteem, setting them up for success across every area of their lives. The system is very simple and needs practice daily.”

Students attending UCMAS will learn all of these skills in a structured and engaging environment. They also get the opportunity to participate in regional, national & international competitions, as well as have their achievements recognized at the highly anticipated annual graduation event.

“Your child will experience achievement and success and we can work together to give your child the best chance of succeeding in school and life. At UCMAS Richmond, we are constantly looking at ways to improve a child’s abilities and will be soon introducing a pre-school program iMaths (ages 4-6) and a Robotics program O’Botz (age 10+)

Since 2006, Amron’s Gourmet Meats has been providing the service with locally sourced and cut beef, chicken, turkey, plus game meats such as bison, deer, elk and even ostrich.

“We have free-range and grass-fed local B.C. products that have no preservatives,” says Gurjeet Chahal who runs the business with his wife. “The vast majority is lactose and gluten-free, as well there are no colours added at all.”

And unlike most other mainstream grocery chains that carry U.S. produced meats that end up in this market as frozen items, Amron’s Gourmet Meats only offers fresh products.

“Plus we cut and clean everything in the store,” Chahal says. “That way, our customers know exactly what is going into their order. It’s 100 per cent what they asked for.

“Other big chains also clean and pack their meats in places as far away as Calgary.”

So, when Amron’s talks about local meat, that means it has come from producers in the Lower Mainland and the Fraser Valley.

“It’s from no more than 100 km away,” he Chahal says.

While the cost for all of this might be a little higher than big box or chain grocery stores, the superiority is in the eating.

“It’s way better,” Chahal says. “You won’t find any substandard meat products with us. With our chicken, you will not find any chewy, tough pieces that you might get from a large producer.

“If you use a local butcher like me who cleans and cuts locally raised products in-house, the meat stays tender.”

For more exotic meats, Amron’s has a selection of products that include buffalo, elk, deer and ostrich.

Some of those products are sourced locally, while others are imported from eastern Canada, the U.S. and overseas.

“Our venison comes from Alberta and sometimes New Zealand,” Chahal says.

Customers who are into physical fitness programs and closely watch what they eat tend to be fans of the leaner meats, such as buffalo and deer.

“The fat, protein and iron contents are totally different than regular beef or chicken,” he says.

This is something personal trainer Gary Dhillon knows from experience.

Dhillon, owner of U Rise Personal Training in Richmond, developed his own fitness routine through studying and research before opening his studio. He was also certified as a personal trainer by the National Strength and Conditioning Association.

Now, he and his employees work to create a personalized plan for each client.

“Everything's done based on that individual, so there’s no generic plan, there's no 12-week program, those don't even exist,” he explains. “We create the program for you based on your goals, age, lifestyle, and availability.”

The trainers at U Rise focus on listening to their clients and helping them ease into their routine without straining or injuring themselves.

“You have to start at your own pace. You just can't dive in. You really need to ease into all of this stuff – then increase difficulty,” he says. “They can't just jump into this one day and go do a two-hour workout. They won't be able to move the next day, they're going to be so sore, and they’re going to hurt themselves.”

The other major focus is food, even over exercise, according to Dhillon.

“You can work out seven days a week, it doesn't matter. The food is the most important part,” he says, adding if a client is only going to stick with one thing, he’d rather they follow their food plan than come to the studio three times a week.

It’s best that clients incorporate healthy eating into their lifestyle, Dhillon says, instead of going the diet route, which isn’t sustainable.

Dhillon and his staff warn their clients against under-eating, since cutting too many calories can badly affect their metabolism.

Calorie cutting is when a person is eating healthy but not eating enough throughout the day. For example, only eating one or two meals a day.

“Even though they're eating healthy, they're actually gaining weight,” Dhillon explains.

Whatever challenges clients face in meeting their goals, Dhillon and his team work with them to overcome them in a private, welcoming setting at the studio.

“People feel really comfortable here because there's no one watching them, no one judging them,” Dhillon says. “This is about them. Everything is made for them, designed for them.”

U Rise Personal Training is located at Suite 141 6151 Westminster Hwy, Richmond. For more information on the services provided by the studio, contact them by email or go to the U Rise website.",[]

""Often, when that conversation doesn't happen, children are unclear as to their parent's wishes,"" Nicole explains. ""I've seen cases where one child has said that their parent wanted to buried and another felt that cremation was wanted. It leads to family arguments and the possibility that your wishes may not be carried out.""

The Memorial Society of B.C. has been encouraging members and their families to have an end of life planning conversation for more than 60 years. With in excess of 242,000 members around the province, the Society is the largest memorial society in North America.

""Your survivors can benefit from our help when the time comes,"" says Nicole. ""Their first phone call should be to the Society. We can have your wishes for the disposition of your remains on file. We can then refer them to a registered funeral service provider that can offer them our member discount rate.""

That one phone call can relieve your loved ones from the anxiety and discomfort related to shopping around for the best funeral services rate at a time of emotional stress.

""Unfortunately, we live in denial,"" says Nicole. ""At the Society, we try to reach out to the children, who are usually in their forties and fifties, and encourage them to have the conversation with their parents. I've been at information sessions where a parent has shared that they have a pre-paid plot for their remains, but their child sitting next to them was totally unaware. They can't carry out your wishes if they don't know what they are.""

It seems natural that we all plan for our vacations and retirement, but we don't want to plan for the end of life. This is a mistake, says Nicole.

""A man I know opens his lectures by saying, 'Dying is not a choice. It is going to happen.' With that in mind, it is important that we plan for the end and make sure our loved ones know our wishes. It will save them money and heartache at a difficult time.""

The bank's report says 1.5 million women lost their jobs in the first two months of the pandemic.

The report found that women tend to work in industries hardest hit by the crisis, their employment level has been slower to rebound as the economy reopens and they are more likely to fall out of the workforce in the long-term.

The study says one-third of women who lost jobs between February and June did not seek work, putting them at higher risk of long term job-separation and future wage penalties.

Employment among women with toddlers or school-aged children fell seven per cent between February and May, compared with a four-per cent decrease for fathers of children the same age.

Single mothers with a toddler or school-aged child saw their employment drop 12 per cent between February and June, compared with a seven per cent decrease for single fathers.

The study says women accounted for about 45 per cent of the decline in hours worked over the downturn, but will only make up 35 per cent of the recovery.
