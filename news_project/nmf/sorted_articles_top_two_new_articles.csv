Michelle Obama used Donald Trump’s own words to skewer him on the first night of the Democratic National Convention, arguing the President was too incompetent to lead the United States through its mounting health, racial and economic crises.

“Donald Trump is the wrong president for our country. He has had more than enough time to prove that he can do the job, but he is clearly in over his head. He cannot meet this moment. He simply cannot be who we need him to be for us. It is what it is,” the former first lady said, echoing the five-word phrase with which Mr. Trump dismissed the country’s COVID-19 death toll this month.

Ms. Obama’s speech was the capstone to a sombre evening in which Democrats laid out their case against Mr. Trump, assailing his handling of the pandemic and crackdown on demonstrations against police racism. They also painted him as a threat to democracy, accusing him of attempting to disenfranchise Americans with reforms to the U.S. Postal Service that would make mail delivery so slow that mail-in ballots won’t arrive in time for the election this fall.

The night was also the first extended look at pandemic-era election campaigning – a convention moved entirely online because COVID-19 made it unsafe to proceed with the event in person. Cutting between hundreds of people in different locations across the country, the evening was a major technical feat that hit just a few snags.

The convention continues for the next three nights, culminating in Joe Biden accepting the presidential nomination Thursday.

Strange bedfellows

The Democrats pitched the biggest possible tent, with a string of Republican former office holders speaking on the same night as the Senate’s only self-described socialist. The messages from these two sides of Mr. Biden’s putative voting coalition were often contradictory.

John Kasich, a former governor of Ohio who ran against Mr. Trump for the Republican nomination in 2016, exhorted conservative voters to back Mr. Biden with a pledge that he would steer a moderate course.

“I’m sure there are Republicans and independents who couldn’t imagine crossing over to support a Democrat. They fear Joe may turn sharp left and leave them behind. I don’t believe that,” Mr. Kasich said, standing at a literal crossroads. “He’s reasonable, faithful, respectful.”

Leftist Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, for his part, argued that Mr. Biden would enact progressive policies such as universal health care, affordable child care and stronger unions.

Both Mr. Kasich and Mr. Sanders did, however, acknowledge the ideological chasms separating the disparate factions coalescing behind the former vice-president. But they argued that the re-election of Mr. Trump was too dangerous not to put aside their differences.

“Nero fiddled while Rome burned. Trump golfs,” said Mr. Sanders, who spoke in front of a large pile of firewood that appeared to be stacked in his home office. “The future of our democracy is at stake.”

The telethon convention

Aiming to avoid a national political event resembling an awkward family Zoom call, the Democrats went for a rapid-fire mix of live speeches, pre-recorded voter testimonials, musical performances, brief panel discussions and archival footage, all anchored by actress Eva Longoria.

At times, the format resembled a frenetic cable news channel. Sometimes it was more like a telethon on community access television, with frequent technical slip-ups.

During a speech by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, for instance, his face suddenly jump-cut across the screen while a needless graphic of the Statue of Liberty briefly appeared and then vanished.

A production assistant walked in front of Alabama Senator Doug Jones.

Footage of an emotional speech by Mr. Biden on police brutality was abruptly interrupted by a smash cut to the former vice-president presiding over a group discussion.

In an attempt to recreate some of the crowd energy of a live convention, the feed sometimes cut to viewers cheering from their living rooms, who often took several seconds to realize they were on camera. The effect was like that of people caught on the Jumbotron at a baseball game.

At the evening’s high points, the display would show hundreds of people cheering at once, each reduced to a tiny box on the screen.

The sharpest line

Kristin Urquiza delivered the single-most memorable attack on Mr. Trump’s handling of the pandemic. She blamed him for the death of her father, Mark Anthony Urquiza. Mr. Urquiza had voted for Mr. Trump, she said, and prematurely broke quarantine to go to a karaoke bar because the President had downplayed the seriousness of the pandemic. After Mr. Urquiza died of COVID-19 in Arizona in June, Ms. Urquiza wrote an obituary in which she fired a broadside at the state’s Republican Governor, Doug Ducey, for swiftly lifting physical-distancing measures and triggering a surge of infections.

“My dad was a healthy 65-year-old. His only pre-existing condition was trusting Donald Trump – and for that he paid with his life,” she said.

The moment of silence

The brothers of George Floyd, whose death at the hands of Minneapolis police sparked the massive wave of protests against police brutality and racism this spring, led the convention in a moment of silence.

“People of all races, all ages, all genders, all backgrounds peacefully protesting in the name of love and unity is a fitting legacy for our brother,” Philonise Floyd said.

The mother of Eric Garner, who was choked to death by police in 2014, directly pressed Mr. Biden during a panel to use federal legislation to end police brutality.

“When my son was murdered, there was a big uprising. Then it settled down,” Gwen Carr said. “We can’t settle down.”

Mr. Biden pumped his fist in support. “I think people are ready,” he said.

CanCon

The only explicit reference to Canada came from Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar. Mocking Mr. Trump’s fragile ego, she busted out one of the lines she used regularly on the stump during her presidential nomination bid this year.

“He blames the Prime Minister of Canada for cutting him out of the Canadian version of Home Alone 2. Who does that?” Ms. Klobuchar said.

The President falsely suggested last year that Justin Trudeau had ordered his cameo edited out of a CBC broadcast of the Macaulay Culkin movie as part of the trade war between the two countries. In fact, CBC made the cut at least as early as 2015 as one of several edits to fit a television time slot.

Michelle Obama

Much of Ms. Obama’s speech was an impassioned plea to voters – many of them young or visible minorities – who had supported her husband in 2008 and 2012 but had since become disenchanted with politics.

“If you think things cannot possibly get worse, trust me, they can,” she said. “And they will if we don’t make a change in this election.

“If we have any hope of ending this chaos, we have got to vote for Joe Biden like our lives depend on it.”

She conceded that Mr. Biden “is not perfect” but said he could seize the moment nonetheless if elected.

“I know Joe. He is a profoundly decent man, guided by faith,” she said. “He knows what it takes to rescue an economy, beat back a pandemic and lead our country.”

As Democrats gathered virtually, Trump targeted voters in a pair of key swing states and sought to curry favour with women voters by pardoning Susan B. Anthony, a leader in the women’s suffrage movement.

In Arizona, one of the top 2020 battleground states, the president sought to paint a Biden victory in apocalyptic terms, insisting ""the survival of our nation is at stake"" in November, as he slammed what he hyperbolically labeled the ""insane and lethal policies"" of his opposition.

""Biden’s plan is the most radical, extreme, reckless, dangerous and deadly immigration plan ever put forward by a major party candidate,"" he said. ""It must be defeated. and it will be defeated on November 3.""

Trump repeatedly mischaracterized Biden’s views on immigration, which are more centrist than many others in his party. Biden, for instance, does not support abolishing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and he argues that crossing the U.S. border illegally should be criminally prosecuted rather than made a civil offence, as many other top Democratic presidential hopefuls proposed.

With his second campaign trip in two days, Trump was hoping to halt an expected convention polling bump for his rival and shore up support with his focus on immigration, one of the most important issues to his political base. He was also trying to stanch an erosion in support among female voters with a symbolic nod on the centennial of the ratification of the 19th Amendment.

In recent weeks, Trump has been trying to build support within the pivotal female voter constituency and has stepped up his events aimed at women. His campaign has launched another ""women for Trump"" bus tour, and the president has embraced a ""law and order"" message with renewed vigour.

The president also worked in a last-minute stop in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, for a briefing about damage from the derecho last week that has left thousands without power and caused catastrophic damage across the battleground state. Many there have expressed outrage that their plight has not received more national attention.

The storm, which packed 100 mph winds and similar power to an inland hurricane, blew down trees, flipped vehicles and caused widespread damage.

""We’ve come through for you, and we will always come through for Iowa,"" Trump said, as the city's mayor urged him to consider enhanced federal disaster funding for people there.

Trump highlighted his immigration agenda during his stop in Yuma, and got an update on construction of his southern border wall. The president insisted that, in addition to fulfilling his pledge to build the wall, Mexico was also paying for it — even though they’re not.

""They are paying for it,"" he said as he stood in front of a replica of his wall, telling reporters he’s planning to enact a border crossing toll at some point in the future.

""Mexico will be paying,"" he said. ""We’re figuring how much we have to charge.""

Before leaving Washington, Trump held a White House event to announce the pardon of Anthony, convicted of voting in 1872 in violation of laws permitting only men to vote. But he quickly pivoted to the upcoming election and the issue of voting by mail.

""Win, lose or draw, we have to get it right,"" Trump said of the November vote count, levelling a fresh offensive against mail-in voting.

""You can’t have millions and millions of ballots sent all over the place, sent to people that are dead, sent to dogs, cats, sent everywhere,"" Trump said.

In fact, voter fraud has proved exceedingly rare. The Brennan Center for Justice in 2017 ranked the risk of ballot fraud at 0.00004% to 0.0009%, based on studies of past elections.

Only nine states have plans for ""universal"" mail-in voting, in which ballots are sent automatically to registered voters. Five of those states relied on mail-in ballots even before the coronavirus pandemic raised concerns about voting in person.

Trump's pardon announcement came on the 100th anniversary of the ratification of the 19th Amendment, which ensured women the right to vote. The amendment states, ""The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex."" Congress passed it in 1919, and the amendment was ratified on Aug. 18, 1920.

Anthony was arrested for voting in Rochester, New York, and convicted in a widely publicized trial. Although she refused to pay the fine, the authorities declined to take further action.

""She felt the trial was the greatest miscarriage of justice because she had not had an opportunity to have a jury of her peers, and the jury didn’t get to vote,"" according to Deborah L. Hughes, president and CEO of The National Susan B. Anthony Museum and House in Rochester, where Anthony died in 1906.

""So to pardon her is to validate the trial, and she would not buy that idea at all,"" Hughes said.

Hughes said the question to ask on the anniversary is how she would want to be honoured. ""She would be the first to say if any president wanted to honour her, the best way to do that is to make sure there is no voter suppression anywhere in the United States,"" Hughes said.

Preparations for Trump's own acceptance speech next week were under way at the White House, where a stage was being erected on the South Lawn.

As was the case Monday in Minnesota and Wisconsin, Trump did not venture beyond the airports in Iowa or Arizona — a reflection of the new realities of campaigning in the midst of a pandemic. But Trump's Yuma rally felt much like his rallies of old, with a tightly packed crowd of hundreds shouting and cheering — though many were wearing ""TRUMP"" and ""MAGA"" masks.

Grappling for votes – and the spotlight – as Democrats hold their national convention, President Donald Trump targeted voters in key states and constituencies Tuesday and promised a pardon for Susan B. Anthony, a leader in the women’s suffrage movement.

Trump flew to Arizona, one of the top 2020 battleground states, to press his case against his Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, painting him as radically left in one of his harshest broadsides yet of the campaign.

“The Biden plan would unleash a flood of illegal immigration like the world has never seen before – it would be a torrent of biblical proportions,” Trump was to say, as he prepared to accept the endorsement of the National Border Patrol Council. “Biden’s plan is the most radical, extreme, reckless, dangerous and deadly immigration plan ever put forward by a major party candidate.”

With his second trip in two days, Trump was hoping to mitigate a convention polling bump for his rival and to shore up support by contrasting his position with Biden’s on immigration, one of the most important issues to his political base.

Trump aimed to highlight his immigration agenda in Yuma, Arizona, and receive an update on construction of his southern border wall, making his second trip to the city in two months. It was an effort to highlight his work to deliver on a key 2016 campaign pledge.

“MS-13 is on the run, many of its leaders are behind bars, and we are deporting its members in record numbers,” Trump was to say. “But if Biden wins, it will be giant jailbreak for MS-13 and vicious criminal gangs. My administration is the only thing standing between the American people and these deadly criminals.”

Trump responded at a White House event, saying it was Mrs. Obama who was in “over her head” and calling her remarks “divisive.”

Preparations for Trump’s own acceptance speech next week were under way at the White House. The South Lawn was filled with scaffolding and equipment that would be needed for what would appear to be a rather large stage.

As was the case Monday in Minneapolis and Wisconsin, Trump’s schedule Tuesday did not show him venturing beyond the airports in Iowa or Arizona – a reflection of the new realities of campaigning in the midst of a pandemic. Instead, Trump has been delivering speeches that have had the feel of small outdoor rallies in airport hangars, often flouting recommendations against large gatherings and mask-wearing.

Trump is set to travel to Pennsylvania on Thursday, visiting an important battleground – and the state of Biden’s birth – ahead of his opponent’s acceptance speech.

Senate Republican leaders are preparing a slimmed-down coronavirus relief package of roughly $500-billion that will include extended payments for unemployed people and smaller businesses, a GOP senator said Tuesday.

The measure will also include $10-billion for the embattled Postal Service, said one top GOP aide. The agency has become the focus of a campaign-season battle over whether it will have enough resources to handle an expected flood of mail-in ballots for this November’s presidential and congressional elections.

The fight between President Donald Trump and congressional Democrats over weathering the pandemic has become a critical battle that’s highlighted Trump’s troubled handling of an outbreak that has killed over 170,000 Americans, cost tens of millions of jobs and shuttered businesses in virtually every community.

Story continues below advertisement

It’s also focused recently on newly imposed cuts in Postal Service operations that critics say are aimed at curtailing the agency’s ability to deliver mail-in votes in time for them to be counted this November. That has coincided with Trump’s repeated insistence, without foundation, that expected record levels of mail-in votes by people eager to avoid polling places will lead to widespread fraud in the elections.

Under intense public and political pressure, Postmaster General Louis DeJoy said Tuesday that he would withhold some of the operational changes he has begun to impose, like the removal of mailboxes, until after the elections.

Negotiations over a far larger coronavirus relief bill are expected to resume after Labor Day between the White House and top congressional Democrats.

“I’m hoping that we actually can get back together, and in spite of the proximity to the election, put it aside and reach an agreement some time soon,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Tuesday in Manchester, Kentucky.

With Democrats demanding that bargainers piece together a wide-ranging measure, the trimmer package emerging from McConnell and other top Republicans seems to be an effort to show voters what the GOP would favour enacting quickly. With the party’s presidential convention next week, the measure could give Republican senators facing difficult re-election races this fall an opportunity to vote for a relief measure with popular provisions, even though it would probably be blocked by Democrats demanding a more generous bill.

The GOP package was also taking shape as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has summoned the House to return to Washington for an unusual Saturday vote to provide $25 billion for the Postal Service and to block changes in the way it operates.

Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., a member of the Senate Republican leadership, said the emerging legislation will provide $300 weekly in extra federal payments for unemployed people above the state payments that beneficiaries receive. He said he believes the extra payments would run through 2020.

Story continues below advertisement

A massive relief bill approved earlier this year provided $600 extra per week, but those payments expired at the end of July. Democrats want to continue the added $600 in payments, but Trump and congressional Republicans have pushed for less.

Blunt said the trimmed-down measure would also have money for schools to cope with the coronavirus pandemic and for businesses struggling to stay open and retain employees during the staggering recession.

A second GOP Senate aide said the new proposal includes $105 billion for education.

That aide said the plan also has $16 billion for virus testing and $29 billion for developing vaccines, manufacturing treatment and other initiatives aimed at conquering a virus that has killed more than 170,000 Americans and infected more than 5 million this year.

The bill does not include a renewal of the one-time direct payments of up to $1,200 for taxpayers and dependants that were part of early legislation aimed at providing relief to people as the economy slowed to a near halt.

The Democratic-led House approved a $3 trillion relief plan in May, while Senate Republicans offered a $1 trillion package. In negotiations between Democrats and the White House that dissolved in bitterness earlier this month, Democrats dropped their proposal to $2 trillion and asked Republicans to meet them at that halfway point, but that has not happened.

The two GOP aides spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the legislation publicly.

As the U.S. marks the 100th anniversary of women’s suffrage, many event organizers, mindful that the 19th Amendment originally benefited mostly white women, have been careful to present it as a commemoration, not a celebration.

The amendment to the U.S. Constitution was ratified on Aug. 18, 1920, but many women of colour were prevented from casting ballots for decades afterward because of poll taxes, literacy tests, overt racism, intimidation and laws that prevented the grandchildren of slaves from voting. Much of that didn’t change until the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

From exhibits inside the Arizona Capitol Museum to a gathering on the North Carolina State Capitol lawn, many commemorations, including those that moved online because of the coronavirus pandemic, have highlighted a more nuanced history of the American women’s suffrage movement alongside the traditional tributes to well-known suffragists such as Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton.

The 100th anniversary has arrived during a year of nationwide protests against racial inequality that have forced the United States to once again reckon with its uncomfortable history.

“Like many movements, the stories are complicated and I think it’s important, as we have an opportunity to reflect and to celebrate, that we also are honest about how we didn’t meet all of our aspirations,” said Rhode Island Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea, a Democrat born and raised in Puerto Rico who has helped to organize her state’s suffrage commemoration efforts. “It’s important to have these conversations so we can do a better job of going forward.”

The Connecticut Historical Society last month unveiled an online exhibit titled The Work Must Be Done: Women of Color and the Right to Vote. It highlights Black women from Connecticut who fought for suffrage rights, as well as other issues, such as anti-discrimination, anti-lynching, labour reforms and access to education.

“We have really been wanting to make sure we talk about the complicated history of these issues in our country,” said Arizona assistant secretary of state Allie Bones, whose office came up with a program after working with about 60 community groups across the state, many of which were “very focused on not calling it a celebration, but … a commemoration.”

The complicated nature of the suffrage movement came full circle last week when Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden chose California Senator Kamala Harris as his running mate, making her the first Black woman on a major party ticket.

In an appearance with Mr. Biden last week, Ms. Harris said she was “mindful of all the heroic and ambitious women before me whose sacrifice, determination and resilience makes my presence here today even possible.”

While their names are not as well known as the white suffragists, Black women played both prominent and smaller roles in the movement. Sojourner Truth, an emancipated slave, who died in 1883, is considered one of the first known Black suffragists. She travelled throughout the U.S. speaking at women’s rights conventions and suffrage events, including at the Akron, Ohio, women’s convention in 1851 where she was credited with giving a powerful speech that’s been remembered as “Ain’t I a Woman?” Some historians, however, have questioned the wording.

Through the years, there were many prominent Black abolitionists and suffragists who worked in their own women’s clubs and suffrage organizations and sometimes side by side with white suffragists, often working for both voting rights and civil rights.

The young founding members of the Delta Sigma Theta sorority participated in the 1913 suffrage march in Washington in their first public act. The Howard University students took great personal risk and were not welcomed by some white suffragists who ultimately insisted the Black women march at the end of the procession, said Cheryl Hickmon, national first vice-president of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority Inc.

“They felt that it was their obligation, if you will, even though it was unsafe to march with the other women and show their dissension and feelings,” said Ms. Hickmon, whose organization has been working with organizers of the Turning Point Suffragist Memorial that’s being constructed in southern Fairfax County, Va., and includes an overview of the entire movement, including Black suffragists.

The 100th anniversary marks an opportunity to “honestly examine” the relationship between white and Black women in the women’s rights movement, said Johnetta Betch Cole, a former college president and anthropologist who is currently the national chair of the National Conference of Negro Women, an organization that was founded in 1935 to advocate for women’s rights.

“There is more acknowledgment of the complexities of the strains, of the racism in the suffrage movement than ever, ever before,” Ms. Betch Cole said. “Unfortunately, one can be virtuous in one form of oppression and then turn around and victimize others on another basis.”

In June, protesters in Iowa demanded that Iowa State University remove the name of suffragist and alumna Carrie Chapman Catt from a building because of white supremacist and anti-immigrant statements attributed to her.

Doris Kelley, a former Democratic Iowa House representative who chairs the state’s 19th Amendment Centennial Commemoration, said it’s important to remember the historical context that suffragists navigated while acknowledging the movement’s complexities. The logo of Iowa’s centennial commemoration “Hard Won, Not Done,” Ms. Kelley said, is a nod to that unfinished history.

In North Carolina, Janice Jones Schroeder, a member of the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina, said she was impressed that organizers of the state’s suffrage anniversary activities thought to include her in a commemoration event last September on the lawn of the Statehouse.

“At that time, American Indians were not even considered citizens of the United States,” she said. While the Snyder Act of 1924 admitted Native Americans born in the U.S. to full U.S. citizenship, it was left up to the states to decide who had the right to vote, and it took more than 40 years for all 50 states to agree to grant them voting rights.

Ms. Schroeder said there are still challenges today for tribal members who want to vote, including voter ID laws, long distances to register to vote on some reservations, lack of access to mail and socioeconomic disparities.

Women of colour in Black, Latino and other communities face similar barriers, making the anniversary of the 19th Amendment and the ensuing decades-long fight all the more relevant a century later in a high-stakes election year.

“I look at politics now,” Ms. Schroeder said, “and I think, `Do we still have a voice?‘”

Kim Reem recounted Tuesday how the unusually powerful storm that tore through Iowa last week destroyed her Cedar Rapids home and laid waste to more than 100 large trees on her property.

During a briefing at the airport in Iowa’s second-largest city, Reem, who heads a local homeless shelter, told President Donald Trump that it would cost roughly a quarter of a million dollars to clear the trees from her land because that damage wasn’t covered by insurance – leading Trump to express surprise.

Reem said the people staying at her Mission of Hope shelter are “hungry for compassion from our leaders. Just to know our leaders care.” And she said people are generally worn down by the coronavirus pandemic that left many without work. Some had just returned to their jobs only to be idled again by the Aug. 10 storm.

“We’re strong and resilient, but Mr. President, we are tired and we need your help,” she said.

Eight days after the storm, a rare derecho, raked the state with hurricane-strength winds, thousands are still picking through the pieces of broken homes and hauling fallen trees and other debris from their properties. About 40,000 customers still don’t have power, and a group of African refugees was living in tents outside of their decimated apartment building, initially refusing to leave despite the pleas of human services workers.

Cedar Rapids, which is in eastern Iowa, was hardest hit and drew the attention of Trump, who promised to approve a request for $180 million in aid for damaged homes and infrastructure in the state. He also promised additional funding for farmers who were affected by an unusually powerful storm that tore through the state last week.

During the Tuesday briefing, local officials and homeowners spoke of the devastation to their communities, including Marion Mayor Nick AbouAssaly, who said up to 95% of the homes and businesses in his city of 40,000 northeast of Cedar Rapids were damaged.

On Monday, Trump signed a portion of Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds’ disaster relief request that covers extensive debris removal and repairs to public buildings, streets and bridges in 16 counties. That portion of the request totalled about $45 million.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency, however, is still assessing the governor’s individual assistance request, which includes $100 million in damage to private utilities and $82.7 million in damage to homes, according to early state estimates. In additional, farmers sustained an estimated $2.7 billion in damage to crops, grain storage and buildings, which is part of the declaration and would likely be covered under various U.S. Department of Agriculture programs. The individual assistance request covers 27 counties.

Trump indicated Monday that he had signed the state’s disaster aid request in full, but he had not approved the individual assistance, which makes up the largest portion of the $3.99 billion aid request.

Reynolds on Monday thanked Trump for his approval but didn’t acknowledge that the bulk of the state’s request was pending. The partial funding approval was later acknowledged during Tuesday’s meeting.

The governor’s spokesman didn’t respond to a message seeking comment.

Cedar Rapids Mayor Brad Hart told Trump the individual portion is important to help homeowners remove trees, which in many cases will cost thousands of dollars and isn’t covered by insurance. He said an estimated 60,000 homes in Cedar Rapids have some degree of damage.

“Adding the individual assistance component to the disaster declaration would really help so many people get those trees out of their yards and not have such a financial burden to them,” he said.

Reynolds pointed out to Trump that the individual assistance was part of the state’s declaration and that FEMA and the state were working on gathering the damage estimates. “We should be able to do that in a short amount of time,” she said.

FEMA spokesman Mike Cappannari said the assessment for the individual assistance portion of the declaration was under way.

“It’s not uncommon across the country for the governor to make a request for a preliminary damage assessment, public assistance and individual assistance and a portion of it is approved just to start the flow of federal resources to get that process going,” he said.

Trump assured Reynolds and others that he would get the individual aid approved.

“We’ll get it taken care of. We’ll get it done very quickly,” he said.

Concerns have been voiced since the storm that the nation hasn’t understood the extent of damage to Iowa, which Reynolds described as “basically a 40-mile-wide tornado with 112 mph winds.”

The National Weather Service said the derecho packed intermittent wind in eastern Iowa in the 110-130 mph range. That would be the strength of an EF2 tornado. The storm “destroyed or damaged numerous outbuildings, barns, grain bins, homes, mobile homes, apartment buildings, trees and power poles,” the weather service said.

“The rest of the country is starting to take note, and so we’re getting volunteers and help from around the country, and that’s really important,” Hart said.

Trump at one point turned to White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany and asked if the world was aware of what happened in Iowa. She replied that it was now because he was in the state and the media had accompanied him to report on the disaster.

Joe Gosnell, a renowned treaty negotiator, politician and leader of the Nisga’a Nation, has died at the age of 84.

The Nisga’a Lisims government said Tuesday that Mr. Gosnell died in his home in New Aiyansh after a long battle with cancer.

Mr. Gosnell was a hereditary Nisga’a chieftain of the Eagle Clan and was president of the nation when it finalized a landmark treaty in 2000 that gave the First Nation control over its land including forestry and fishing rights. It was the first modern-day treaty signed in B.C. since the 1800s.

Nisga’a Nation President Eva Clayton said Mr. Gosnell’s wisdom, dignity and determination helped lead the First Nation into self-government over its territory northeast of Prince Rupert.

“Today, we have lost a giant,” Ms. Clayton said in a statement. “His legacy will help shape the project of reconciliation for generations to come.”

Mr. Gosnell was admitted to both the Order of Canada and the Order of B.C., and held an honorary doctorate of laws from Royal Roads University in Victoria.

He leaves his wife of 64 years, Audrey, their seven children and numerous grandchildren and great-grandchildren.

Mr. Gosnell grew up in the Nass River Valley in B.C.‘s northwest. He worked as a commercial fisherman, carpenter and traditional carver before he was elected as a band councillor and chief of the Gitlaxt’aamiks Band, one of the Nisga’a village governments.

Mr. Gosnell was appointed chancellor of the University of Northern B.C. last year and served until his death.

University interim president Geoffrey Payne said Mr. Gosnell’s dedication to education was evident during his time as chancellor.

“The world has lost a tremendous leader, a man who repeatedly demonstrated a love for his community, his people, education and a commitment to enhancing the lives of others,” Dr. Payne said in a statement.

Ms. Clayton said Mr. Gosnell’s work to negotiate the Nisga’a Treaty produced a “beacon of hope” for people around the world.

“His focus was always on what the Nisga’a, British Columbians and Canadians can achieve together,” she said.

When a bill to accept the treaty was introduced in the legislature in December, 1998, Mr. Gosnell told the house the agreement proved to the world that reasonable people can sit down and settle historical wrongs.

“It’s a triumph because under the treaty, we will no longer be wards of the state, no longer beggars in our own land. It’s a triumph because under the treaty, we will collectively own approximately 2,000 square kilometres of land, far exceeding the postage-stamp reserve set aside for us by colonial governments.”

He said the treaty proved that negotiations – not lawsuits, blockades or violence – are the most effective and honourable way to resolve Aboriginal issues.

“It’s a triumph, I believe, that signals the end of the Indian Act, the end of more than a century of humiliation, degradation and despair for the Nisga’a Nation.”

Premier John Horgan said in a tweet that everyone can learn from Mr. Gosnell’s legacy of working to make life better for people and that he’ll be missed.

“He was instrumental in helping the Nisga’a chart a new path of self-governance through BC’s first modern treaty.”

New Brunswick will become the first province to head to the polls during the COVID-19 crisis, as Premier Blaine Higgs tries to turn support for his handling of the pandemic into a majority government.

Mr. Higgs called the election Monday afternoon, after the opposition Liberals rejected a proposed four-party deal last week that would have avoided an election for two years. The Premier says an election is needed to give his province stability, and sees the Sept. 14 vote as his best chance at securing a majority.

His minority Progressive Conservative government, elected in 2018, holds 20 seats in the legislature, the same as the Liberals. The People’s Alliance of New Brunswick and the Green Party both hold three, while two seats are vacant and one is held by an independent MLA.

It will be the first time voters head to polling stations in Canada during COVID-19 restrictions, with rules around gathering and physical distancing in public settings. The Premier said he called the election only after the province’s chief medical officer of health advised an election could be held safely next month.

The Premier, who took office after former Liberal premier Brian Gallant’s government failed to win the confidence of the legislature following an inconclusive election, was also facing three by-elections this fall that could have cost his party its tentative hold on power.

Recent opinion polls have favoured the Higgs government, which until now had been getting unprecedented co-operation from the other parties during the pandemic. But calling an election at this time remains a gamble, with both political and public-health risks, observers say.

“In normal times, it would make sense to roll the dice, but the risks involved are different here,” said J.P. Lewis, a political scientist at the University of New Brunswick.

“When premiers and prime ministers have gone to the polls early, it’s not unusual for that to be a story. But none of those have been during a time when there could be a stay-at-home order.”

The Premier acknowledged many conventional campaign methods will be off-limits to candidates.

“We are in a pandemic and the coming election campaign will not be like any election we have ever experienced,” Mr. Higgs told reporters Monday.

Story continues below advertisement

Candidates will need to be creative and innovative to get out the vote during the 28-day campaign while following health directives to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, the Premier said.

“As difficult as it is to imagine, our candidates will not be going door-to-door and they will not be leaving any hand-delivered papers or brochures on your doorstep,” Mr. Higgs said.

Liberal Leader Kevin Vickers, the former Canadian ambassador to Ireland and sergeant-at-arms of the House of Commons of Canada, said calling an election during a pandemic was a power grab that needlessly endangers voters.

“New Brunswickers are in an election they do not need or want,” he said. “The Premier of New Brunswick chose political opportunism instead of the health and safety of our citizens.”

The election will also be Mr. Vickers’s first big test, with a narrow path to victory that will require stealing back seats in the largely conservative south, while holding onto francophone support in the province’s northern regions.

The Liberal Leader seized on language divisions in the province – a well-worn critique of Mr. Higgs’s government among some French-speaking Acadians – as well as environmental concerns and persistent economic challenges in rural areas in his pitch to voters.

Story continues below advertisement

Green Party Leader David Coon argued holding a general election is not in the public’s best interests.

“The vast majority of people don’t want to have an election in times of pandemic. People’s fears and concerns about the health of their families are very justified and legitimate and we understand them,” he said.

The Premier said the election timing makes sense because of a lull in cases that presents a window of opportunity. The opposition points out the 15 active cases in the province, including six added over the weekend, are the worst since an outbreak in June.

On the whole, however, New Brunswick has fared batter than most provinces when considering the human toll from COVID-19. It’s had 186 confirmed cases and two deaths since the pandemic began. Its economy has also been reopened for months – by the end of June, it boasted that more than 70 per cent of small businesses were up and running again, more than any other province.

Mr. Higgs is attempting to end the turnstile pattern of the premier’s office in his province, by doing something no New Brunswick premier has been able to do since Bernard Lord in 2003 – win a re-election bid.

CHERISS MAY/Reuters

The latest flashpoint in a country that has politicized almost everything – wearing masks, the number of people who can crowd around the polished metal bar in the neighbourhood pub, whether college football teams play their fall schedules – is perhaps the most prosaic function of government.

And so it was almost inevitable in the Donald Trump years that the local American post office – founded by Benjamin Franklin, revered as a village gathering place, dreaded by criminals pictured on “most-wanted” posters, defended even by those who revile Washington as perhaps the only essential domestic function of central government – has become the most controversial place in the United States.

But there it stands – the brick building with the white trim and the musty smell inside, on Main Streets from coast to coast – as a 2020 election battleground.

Like the post office itself, the contretemps is simply described. The pandemic has made lines at polling stations into a threat to public health. Democrats, who hope a big turnout will elect Joe Biden, support massive mail voting. Mr. Trump sees peril in near-effortless voting and seeks to curtail postal services by limiting funding, prompting mail delays and undermining perhaps the most favoured institution in American life. Indeed, according to the Pew Research Center, the United States Postal Service has a 91-per-cent approval rating – higher than Congress, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and twice Mr. Trump’s own.

This month the President, who for months has sowed distrust in the postal service, opposed US$25-billion in emergency funding and a separate, supplemental US$3.5-billion to handle a flood of mail ballots. The House of Representatives will hold a special session Saturday to approve funding to assure the postal service can redeem its revered motto that “neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds.”

The rush to register for postal ballots is real. In tiny Conway, N.H., population 10,266, the town clerk is getting 30 to 50 applications a day. Already North Carolina officials have received 163,374 applications for mail ballots – seven times the 2016 requests. Ballot-drop boxes to bypass the post office are sprouting on the landscape.

And Monday night, Eva Longoria, the moderator of the virtual Democratic National Convention, made postal voting a prominent theme, with Nevada Senator Catherine Cortez Masto describing it as “a secure, proven” voting method employed by Mr. Trump himself. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota complained the President’s actions meant “seniors won’t be able to get their [mail] prescriptions because he wants to win an election.”

The controversy is less about the USPS’s capacity to handle a ballot flood than about operational changes – overtime, work rules – being implemented by Mr. Trump’s appointees that could affect the processing and delivery of mail ballots, and that already are leaving mail in depots for days. On Tuesday, under heavy pressure from state attorneys-general, Democratic lawmakers and the public, Postmaster-General Louis DeJoy announced the suspension of changes until after the election. It did little to quell the furor.

This post office controversy is not only about the present threat of Trump voter suppression nor about the future of the mail in an era of texts, e-mails and Amazon deliveries. It is also about the past.

No institution is so embedded in American culture as the post office – and no art form is so esteemed in American life as the letter.

William Hill Brown’s 1789 book, The Power of Sympathy, structured as a series of letters, is considered the first American novel. (It was preceded by 20 years by the first Canadian novel, The History of Emily Montague, also an epistolary work.) The horse-mounted 19th-century mail carriers of the Pony Express may have operated for 18 months but they remain a well-loved element of American folklore.

The American Revolution was foreshadowed by the publication of Letters from a Pennsylvania Farmer. The French-born J. Hector St. John de Crèvecœur, later a Canadian cartographer who served with Louis Montcalm and was wounded in the 1759 Battle of Quebec, introduced the new American character to Europeans through essays he published in 1782 called Letters from an American Farmer. Martin Luther King Jr.’s 1963 civil-rights manifesto was called the “Letter from the Birmingham Central Jail.” Richard Nixon’s resignation from the presidency came in a letter. It was a single sentence of 11 words.

And perhaps the most poignant American letter came from Major Sullivan Ballou, a Union soldier wounded and dying during an 1861 Civil War battle, addressed to his soon-to-be-widowed 24-year-old wife: “If there be a soft breeze upon your cheek, it shall be my breath; or the cool air fans your throbbing temple, it shall be my spirit passing by.”

Mr. Trump’s offensive against the post office has erased its mystique. In the coming week, the House oversight and reform committee will question Mr. DeJoy and USPS board chair Robert Duncan; Mr. DeJoy will face the Senate homeland security and governmental affairs committee in a separate hearing. Democratic Representatives Ted Lieu of California and Hakeem Jeffries of New York of the House judiciary committee this week called for an FBI criminal investigation into Mr. DeJoy over nationwide USPS delays.

And yet the mail – especially in a time of pandemic – endures as a public necessity as well as a symbol of romance.

Shakespeare’s double-death 1597 tragedy of Romeo and Juliet was the result of the very sort of failure of mail delivery Democrats fear in 2020. Friar Lawrence’s letter about the plan to salvage the fate of the famous lovers never arrived. The letter carrier was quarantined, having been “visiting the sick … in a house /Where the pestilence did reign.”

U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday said a massive shift to mail-in voting in the November presidential election could cause so many problems officials might have to redo the vote.

Trump has said repeatedly and without evidence that a shift to universal mail-in voting – something most states have not proposed doing – will lead to fraud in the Nov. 3 election, when he faces Democratic challenger Joe Biden who currently holds a substantial lead in public opinion polls.

Trump does not have the authority to reschedule an election. A national election “redo” has never occurred in the more than 200 years the U.S. has held elections, including during the Civil War, the Great Depression and two world wars.

“It will end up being a rigged election or they will never come out with an outcome,” Trump told reporters on Tuesday. “They’ll have to do it again, and nobody wants that.”

As much as half the ballots in the November election could be cast by mail due to America’s coronavirus crisis, election experts say. That is up from about one in four ballots that were cast by mail in 2016.

Trump himself votes by mail.

As with other forms of voting, documented cases of mail-ballot fraud are extremely rare. But Trump on Tuesday repeated an allegation he has made in recent months that mail-in voting will lead to massive ballot fraud.

U.S. states run presidential elections and most only plan to mail absentee ballots for November’s election to voters who request them.

A handful of states regularly hold elections with what is known as universal mail-in voting, in which every voter receives a ballot by mail. A few other states, including California and Nevada, plan to mail ballots to all voters for the November election due to the health crisis.

“Absentee is great but universal is going to be a disaster,” Trump said.

Sustaining energy through four days of a political convention is never easy. It’s even more challenging during this, the first virtual convention. On the second night of the Democratic National Convention, party leaders tried to blend its past with its future.

Here are key take-aways from night two.

DEMOCRATS DISPLAY BIG TENT

Joe Biden, who was being formally nominated Tuesday night in a virtual roll call of states, doesn’t shy away from the obvious: He’s a 77-year-old white man leading a party that celebrates its racial and ethnic diversity and gets a majority of its votes from women.

Story continues below advertisement

He has at times offered himself as a bridge to bring together that coalition, calling himself a “transitional figure” for the party and the country.

Democrats tried to put that on vivid display, an ideological arc that spanned the New Democrat centrism of former President Bill Clinton to the new century progressive, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who was born in 1989, the year after Biden’s first presidential run.

Democrats were trying to show that their party tolerates differences in ways that the Republican Party led by President Donald Trump does not. The Democrats honoured Clinton, and former president Jimmy Carter, along with the party’s nominee in 2004, former Secretary of State John Kerry. Cindy McCain, whose husband, John, was the Republican nominee in 2008, appeared in a video praising Biden.

Former President George W. Bush, the only living GOP ex-president, and Sen. Mitt Romney, the party’s nominee in 2012, will not be part of the Republican convention next week.

In a 17-person keynote address that was part relay, part reminder of the party’s blended constituencies, followed by a roll call of the states, the ethnic and racial contrast with Republicans is obvious. For Democrats, that was the point.

PUNCHES LANDED, NOT PULLED

Donald Trump’s journey to the presidency began with then-President Barack Obama mocking the reality TV star relentlessly during the White House correspondents’ dinner in 2011 – a brutal ribbing that propelled the notoriously sensitive mogul toward his 2016 run.

But nobody’s making jokes now. During the first two days of the Democratic National Convention, the party’s luminaries – and even some Republicans – have grimly warned the public that he represents a fundamental danger to democracy.

Story continues below advertisement

“He treats our country like it’s his family business,” warned former Assistant Attorney General Sally Yates. “America, Donald Trump has quit on you,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said. Even senior leaders like Michelle Obama and Bill Clinton devoted chunks of their speeches to warning that the president is a fundamental threat to the country.

Usually conventions feature stinging put-downs of the rival standard-bearer and the occasional lacerating speech. But the 2020 Democratic convention is notable for the consistency of dire warnings about the other party’s leader.

KEYNOTE BY COMMITTEE

Conventions usually follow a standard ritual. But it’s not surprising that a virtual convention would change that.

Biden’s campaign used the moment not to anoint a single emerging party star, but rather 17 of them, reflecting the diversity of race, age, geography and identity.

It was a stunt for sure, with selfies, ring lights and tightly scripted hits on Trump. But it also seemed effective to make the point, that Biden, 77, wants to provide a gateway for young leaders.

“A new generation of leaders is rising up,” said Pennsylvania state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta, an openly gay lawmaker who praised Biden for supporting marriage equality earlier than many older politicians.

Kenyatta and 15 other speakers led up to Stacey Abrams, the 46-year-old Georgian who in 2018 narrowly missed becoming the first Black woman elected governor of a U.S. state. Abrams also was among the 11 women that Biden interviewed as finalists for his running mate.

The keynote was bookended Monday by a lineup of the Democratic old guard, led by Kerry and two former presidents, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter.

Biden has made clear he’s casting a wide net in November. The convention’s first night was mostly showcasing ideological diversity. The keynote and the rest of Tuesday showcased what Biden hopes is generational diversity in his coalition.

CLINTON, BRIEF FOR ONCE, HAMMERS TRUMP

Bill Clinton has now spoken at 11 Democratic national conventions. But he’s never had a more tentative grasp on the party, or a tighter window, than he had Tuesday.

That Clinton was speaking at all was mildly surprising given how his sexual dalliances appear to some in the post-MeToo era. But the notoriously prolix president – whose 2012 speech for Barack Obama ran nearly 50 minutes – was kept to five minutes during the tight, all-online convention. And he wasted no time scorching the man who defeated his wife in the 2016 election.

“If you want a president who spends his day watching hours of TV or zapping people on social media, he’s your man,” Clinton said of Trump in his pre-recorded speech. He slammed Trump for making the Oval Office “the storm centre” rather than “the command centre” during the pandemic, and for the nation’s dismal track record fighting the disease.

Story continues below advertisement

For once, Clinton showed that less was more.

LATINO SNUB? ‘TWITTER IS NOT REAL LIFE’

Every convention has an off-script moment, and for Democrats this week, that came when Twitter was aflutter over the snubbing of Julian Castro, who gave the Democrats’ keynote address in 2012 and challenged Biden, sometimes quite personally, in the primaries this year.

The criticism was that Biden was taking the Latino vote for granted. The actual roster of speakers says otherwise.

A famous Latina actress, Eva Longoria Baston, hosted the first night of the convention, which also featured a cameo by labour icon Dolores Huerta, remarks by Nevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto and a breakout speech from Kristin Urquiza, an Arizona Latina who told the story of her father’s death from COVID-19 with the memorable line, “His only pre-existing condition was trusting Donald Trump.”

On Tuesday, Ocasio-Cortez gave the official nominating speech for Sen. Bernie Sanders’ presidential bid, and the party’s “rising stars” keynote mash-up of 17 young Democrats featured Hispanic Democrats from California, Nevada and Texas.

The Biden campaign’s mantra during the primary was that “Twitter is not real life.”

So far it’s been notable that the convention’s main critique of Trump has been over his handling of the pandemic. It’s the biggest issue affecting people right now, but it’s also a disease disproportionately sickening Latinos, who routinely list health care, rather than immigration, as their top priority. That focus may have more of an impact than the speaking list.",1093,0.7562681945572003,politics

At our annual general meeting last week, all the votes had been pre-counted and when it came to the election of council there were no additional nominees permitted and the council were simply announced as elected based on the restricted proxies that were issued. We were basically observers at the meeting. Is an electronic meeting really any different than a meeting with in-person attendance?

Margo W. Richmond

An electronic meeting is a fully constituted meeting like an in-person meeting. All the provisions of the bylaws and the Act must still be followed.

The only difference is the address, which is the electronic address and the method of electronic attendance that requires everyone to be able to communicate with each other. The obligation for eligible voters to register and be issued a voting card is still a requirement. Eligible voters may be identified at point of registration, or a ballot showing their strata lot number can be sent with the notice package, which they can use to identify their strata lot and used for voting during the meeting. If an owner cannot attend the meeting, it is the owner’s privilege to decide whether to assign their proxy to a person who can attend electronically, or to a council member in attendance.

A restricted proxy is only a privilege of the strata owner, this is not a function the strata corporation can impose on owners.

The Strata Property Act permits proxies, subject to any limitations or restrictions imposed by owners. By issuing a restricted proxy the owner can confirm their voting instructions or limitations are restricted to what was instructed. The person who is appointed on that proxy must be present at the meeting for the proxy votes to be counted at their instructions.

Proxy votes, or a restricted proxy is not an absentee ballot. It must still be exercised at the time the votes are taken, which may be after each resolution or a designated voting window at the end of the resolutions and elections. At this time every eligible voter, including the assigned proxies submit their votes either in a ballot method, by email, a verbal call of the roll, an electronic poll or some other method determined in the bylaws of the strata.

Secret ballots are a bit more complicated to manage as the only method the strata has to verify if an eligible voter has submitted a ballot is to be able to identify the person who voted or submitted the votes.

While an email ballot is secret from the remainder of the owners at the meeting, the scrutineers who are receiving the balloting instructions must be able to identify the source of the vote. At an in-person meeting, secret ballots can be easily managed as a sequential audited paper ballot may be used to ensure the vote count can be audited and compared to the registration without identifying the voters.

While this may seem a bit excessive at times, strata corporations are frequently required to approve millions of dollars of special levies, expenses, or bylaws that often result in serious limitations to use of property.

A helpful solution to prepare for the registration and voting is to develop an instruction page to explain the voting procedures that is included with the notice package. This is both helpful for the owners to understand how they will be voting and the property manager and chairperson to administer the voting procedures.

Several strata corporations are including a voting card showing the strata plan number and the strata lot number with the notice package. This makes the electronic meetings much easier to conduct registration and identify voters and the chairperson can still call for a show of voting cards.

The real challenges, of course, are to manage 200 participants electronically. While a traditional two-hour meeting is easily taking four-plus hours, there is a much greater participation by owners with the convenience of electronic meetings

With the U.S. election less than 100 days away, what are your concerns? Will the likely election of a Democrat as president make the markets nervous, or will the replacement of Donald Trump add confidence for the future? What should we as Canadian investors be considering?

Most polls are pointing to a decisive victory for Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. Oddsmakers also have Mr. Biden as a clear favourite to win on Nov. 3.

But whether a Biden victory will be good or bad for the stock market depends on whom you ask. Mr. Trump, predictably, has warned that stocks will “disintegrate” and “drop down to nothing” if he loses. His hyperbole aside, some investors have expressed concern that Mr. Biden’s proposals – including his plan to raise the corporate tax rate to 28 per cent from 21 per cent – could deal a blow to the economy just as it is recovering from the coronavirus pandemic.

But worries about a Democrat becoming president are almost certainly overblown, for a couple of reasons. First, the stock market is forward-looking, so market sentiment should already be reflecting, at least to some extent, a Biden victory. Yet, as Mr. Biden’s lead has widened to double-digits in many polls, the S&P 500 hasn’t fallen; it soared about 48 per cent from its March low – not the sort of reaction one would expect if investors were terrified of Mr. Biden becoming president.

Story continues below advertisement

Second, given the fragile state of the economy – and the fact that policy platforms are often subject to compromise after an election – it’s unlikely that Mr. Biden will try to ram through reforms that could deal a blow to the economy.

“Even in a scenario where the Democrats sweep the 2020 election … we still think it is unlikely that we see any fiscal-tightening measures in the near term,” Tom Porcelli, chief U.S. economist with RBC Capital Markets, said in a note this week.

“In fact, if the recent House bills are any indication … the path of least resistance should the Democrats sweep [the presidency and both houses of Congress] in November is for much, much more fiscal largesse,” to stimulate growth, Mr. Porcelli said.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. sounded a similarly optimistic note about a Democratic victory. “Given the current economic weakness, business recovery and job growth are likely to be prioritized over policies that could dampen economic growth and perhaps even jeopardize the desired 2022 midterm election outcome,” JPMorgan strategists, led by Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, said in a July note. “We see [Mr. Biden winning] as neutral to slight positive.”

Even if the market were to sell off initially, history suggests that the damage would be short-lived. In the five instances since the Second World War when the Democrats swept the presidency and Congress, the S&P 500 fell by an average of 2.4 per cent in November after the election. But the index gained an average of 10.4 per cent in the following calendar year, with just one decline, according to CFRA Research data reported by CNN.

A more pressing risk is how the market will react if the outcome of the election is contested. Given Mr. Trump’s call this week to delay the vote, his complaints about mail-in ballots and his refusal to say whether he will accept the results, it’s possible that he will not go quietly if he loses. Markets hate uncertainty more than anything, and such a scenario could rattle investors. In 2000, for example, in the five weeks from election day until George W. Bush was declared the winner after a recount dispute in Florida, the S&P fell 12 per cent.

With coronavirus, widespread social unrest and Mr. Trump’s unpredictable nature all creating a volatile election backdrop, a lot could happen between now and election day. It’s also possible that Mr. Trump could prove the polls wrong again and win a second term, although he would have to overcome Mr. Biden’s commanding lead to do that.

But my advice is the same now as in any other year, election or not: Own a diversified portfolio of high-quality stocks (or low-cost funds), keep a portion of your capital in guaranteed investment certificates or bonds, and have some cash on hand for emergencies.

Eventually, the pandemic will recede and, perhaps with the help of new leadership, the chaos gripping parts of the United States will pass and the economy will recover from its worst slump since at least the 1940s. Focusing on the long term, and resisting the urge to change your strategy based on an election – or any other short-term event – is the surest way to build wealth.

As multilateral institutions attempt to respond to today’s unprecedented global challenges, one that already works well is the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB).

Established in 1959 and headquartered in Washington, the IDB is widely recognized for its important role in supporting efforts to reduce Latin American poverty and inequality in a sustainable way and to facilitate inter-American economic co-operation. It is the largest source of development financing to our hemisphere, channelling some US$12-billion a year in loans to Latin American and Caribbean countries to support well-reviewed projects in infrastructure, state modernization, education and social programs. Annually, the IDB finances more projects in Latin America than any other multilateral development bank, including the World Bank. The Bank’s significance, moreover, should be even greater in the future, as Latin America copes with the triple whammy of COVID-19 (with 28 per cent of the world’s fatalities so far), the steepest economic downturn of any developing region (projected by the International Monetary Fund to plunge by 9.4 per cent), and major social upheavals in many countries.

Story continues below advertisement

That is the context for the Trump administration’s unprecedented nomination this month of a White House aide, the first from the United States, to serve as the IDB’s fifth president. The choice risks alienating the region and politicizing this successful institution. Sixty years of tradition – of Latin American leadership of the IDB – should not be overturned in the bank’s presidential elections, currently scheduled for mid-September.

The surprise announcement has provoked a storm of negative reaction in Latin America. Five recent Latin American presidents – Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil, Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico, Ricardo Lagos of Chile, Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia and Julio Sanguinetti of Uruguay, all outstanding statesmen and warm friends of the United States – issued a strong statement in opposition.

The Trump administration, for its part, is pressing Latin American governments to support the nomination, dangling the carrot of the Bank’s upcoming capital renewal and brandishing the stick of withholding postpandemic relief.

Yet, opposition is building. In recent days, Chile, Mexico, Costa Rica and Argentina have called for a delay of the election to 2021. The European Union is lobbying its member countries who are IDB shareholders to join them. And Canada, which controls just over 4 per cent of the vote, is weighing its decision. The tipping point to block the needed quorum – more than 25 per cent of voting shares abstaining – is within reach.

This is not about Mr. Trump’s nominee, who brings relevant background in economic, financial and foreign affairs. The main objection to his nomination is that it disregards a decades-old practice started under president Dwight Eisenhower’s auspices, which provides that the Bank would be headquartered in Washington, its president would be Latin American and its executive vice-president would be a U.S. citizen. This formula has worked well for six decades, years in which Latin American countries have increased their capital contribution and sense of ownership, and have made the Bank’s loans and programs ever more effective.

The U.S. is the largest single contributor to and shareholder in the IDB, but Eisenhower’s decision to agree to Latin American leadership of the Bank is consistent with the traditional postwar U.S. approach to multilateral organizations that he championed – influence, yes, but one-country dominance, no.

If the Trump administration’s unprecedented effort to place an American in the IDB presidency is intended to counter growing Chinese influence in Latin America, hijacking a successful multilateral institution is the wrong approach. The right way to restrain Chinese clout would be to reinforce meaningful inter-American co-operation to meet economic and social needs. Moreover, naming an American as head of the IDB shortly before the November presidential election risks marginalizing and politicizing the institution.

The pandemic has delayed or made virtual many multilateral meetings. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, for example, postponed its annual meeting because of the pandemic. The IDB postponed its September annual meeting for six months for the same reason. It should also defer until March 2021 the vote to elect its new president. That is the prudent step.

And at that time, the U.S. government – whether led by Donald Trump or Joe Biden – should return to the well-established norm that the IDB’s president be a Latin American. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.

As the Democrats prepare for their quadrennial convention, the world’s oldest active political party – the philosophical home of Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, Franklin Delano Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy – is undergoing vast changes. Again.

Those changes go beyond the fact that, for the first time, this midsummer conclave is being held entirely remotely, with delegates confined to their dining-room tables, living-room sofas and basement bunkers. These transformations are happening in the character of the party, the content of its ideals and the coalition of its various interests. They are going on as the party leans left even as it girds itself to nominate a standard bearer whose instincts reside resolutely in the political centre. They are in train as the party seeks an awkward, almost certainly artificial, sense of unity in a desperate effort to wrest power from a President whose instinct is to divide.

“Parties change. The moment changes,” former secretary of state John Kerry, the Democrat’s 2004 presidential nominee, said in an interview. “And I hope we have changed in some respects. But this numb-skull nonentity in the White House won votes that are Democratic votes that we had taken for granted.”

The great defection of those very Democratic voters – grandchildren of the union members and immigrants who flocked to the party and its New Deal program to combat the Great Depression, and the children of the voters who stuck with the party during the tumult of the Vietnam War years – is what helped make Donald Trump president. And so the great, consequential question the Democrats face in their rump convention in the delegates’ homes, scattered from coast to coast: Can they win back those voters while still retaining the urban and university elites, minorities and women who increasingly have become the face of the new Democratic Party?

“Oh my God, there have been great changes,’' said former governor Michael Dukakis, who was the party’s 1988 presidential nominee. “Those of us who were big reformers in the 1960s and 1970s are the distant past for the whole new generation of new activists who are taking us in different directions, and taking us further. This is a time of change and we are looking at a very different party.’'

Indeed, the Democrats are in the throes of an enormous transition, in some ways mirroring the transitions in the broader American society; when the party’s putative nominee, former vice-president Joe Biden, selected Senator Kamala Harris as his running mate this week, he chose a woman who is both Black and South Asian and is married to a Jewish man – a vivid portrait of a changing country.

Moreover, Mr. Biden, 77, has acknowledged that he would be a “transitional” president – an inadvertently poignant self-description of a political figure who himself has undergone substantial change in an age of vast waves of change. In important ways, the Biden-Harris ticket is the personification of the transitions that have transpired in the party and in the country.

Mr. Biden was born into the New Deal voting bloc writ large, growing up with FDR as president in the blue-collar rail and coal-mining centre of Scranton, Pa. He graduated law school in 1968, the annus horribilis that included the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and senator Robert F. Kennedy and the riots outside that year’s Democratic National Convention. He was elected to the Senate in 1972, the year the Democrats overhauled their convention system to invite more women and Black Americans to power in the party. He presided over the bitter 1991 Clarence Thomas Supreme Court confirmation hearings that served as a precursor to the Me Too movement.

Two numbers underscore the changes in the Democratic Party and in American politics. In the election after the birth of Mr. Biden, his native Pennsylvania county sided with the Democratic ticket led by Roosevelt, by an 11-point margin. Just four years ago, Mr. Trump came within four percentage points of winning there – and captured Pennsylvania’s 20 electoral votes. Today, the Scranton area – along with the suburbs around Pittsburgh and Philadelphia – may be the most important battleground in U.S. politics.

The Democratic Party that is undergoing such fundamental change was itself the party that fought change through the last half of the 19th century and sporadically in the 20th. The Democratic Party that is now rooted in the cities and in the North was the party of the South until the mid-1960s. The Democratic Party that was the vanguard of racial change in the civil-rights era and again in the age of Black Lives Matter was the party that fought integration – indeed, was unabashedly the party of white supremacy – after the Civil War and as late as the early 1960s. The Democratic Party that today speaks of increased Washington intervention in the economy and health care was the party that fought big government for decades.

The party that relied on white voters from the lower strata of 19th-century America is today struggling to win back the support of what political professionals call “non-college whites.” And the party that is today congenial to elites was the ultimate enemy of the nation’s elites at the end of the 19th century and into the early years of the 20th century, when three-time presidential nominee William Jennings Bryan inveighed against privilege and spoke of “the avenging wrath of an indignant people.’'

“We used to run against the elites,” said former vice-president Walter Mondale, who was the Democratic presidential nominee three-quarters of a century after Mr. Bryan’s last campaign. “Ivy League faculties didn’t vote for us. We didn’t fit. But they are voting for Democrats now.”

Several key moments of change stand out. One was in 1924, when, in a marathon 17-day convention that required 103 ballots to select a presidential nominee, the party deadlocked on whether to condemn the Ku Klux Klan. Four years later, with the first Catholic presidential nominee, the Democrats won the 10 biggest cities in the country; they had lost all 10 in the 1920 election. By 1964, when Congress was debating the Civil Rights Bill, the Southern mastodons of the Democratic Senate – avowed racists – discovered they could not muster the filibuster needed to kill the legislation.

“It was a slow evolution, driven in part by demography – by the growth of diversity in the country – and by the changing nature of the economy,” said Bruce Schulman, a Boston University historian. “By 1936, the Democratic coalition as we know it had taken shape, identified with liberalism and with activist government.” That was the year of FDR’s 46-state landslide, the first time a Democrat had enough support nationwide to win the White House without a single Southern electoral vote.

The fissures in today’s Democratic Party have been bridged in part by time, and in part by the Trump phenomenon.

It has been six months since the most recent multiple-candidate Democratic debate. Since then, Mr. Biden has vanquished his rivals. Meanwhile, the coronavirus – as well as the protests and revival of awareness of Black pain prompted by the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis – have dominated the news, blunting the effect of the differences among Democrats, but not eliminating them.

But the Democratic debates – 11 in all, the first coming 14 months ago with 20 candidates tangling in a two-night format – put the party’s divisions in sharp relief. And in every one of those sessions, Mr. Biden stood at the centre of the proceedings, not by virtue of his strength as a candidate – in truth, through most of the primary season it was his weakness, not his strength, that attracted the most attention – but by virtue of his Goldilockian political porridge: not too hot, not too cold. The battle lines swiftly took on an overarching theme: How much change did the modern party of change want, and how much could it stomach?

That debate can be distilled into one sentence, uttered by Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and directed at a moderate with views not so different from Mr. Biden’s, former Representative John Delaney of Maryland: “I don’t understand why anyone goes to all the trouble of running for President of the United States,” she said, “to tell us what we can’t do and shouldn’t fight for.”

Ms. Warren – along with Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who was the last of Mr. Biden’s rivals for the nomination when he dropped out of the race in April – saw the Trump phenomenon as an opening for major change in the party and, if successful, in the country. Understanding that the party eventually would unite against just about anyone – lawn signs Democrats placed throughout the country urged the election of “Any Functioning Adult 2020” – the pair calculated that this was the year to work for fundamental change: a broad centralized health-insurance scheme to cover all Americans, far-reaching environmental structures to fight global climate change, dramatic changes in the tax code to battle the wealth gap. The two New England lawmakers spoke of revolution, and they meant it. “If there is going to be class warfare in this country,” Mr. Sanders said at the AFL-CIO union’s convention last year, “it’s time that the working class of this country won that war and not just the corporate elite.”

At the same time there was ferment in the Democratic grassroots – ferment that continued throughout this summer.

Last month, Jamaal Bowman, a progressive insurgent, upset Representative Eliot Engel of New York, the powerful 16-term incumbent who was chairman of the House foreign affairs committee, in a Democratic primary. It was the third example in two years when a progressive candidate of colour toppled an urban establishment liberal in a Democratic primary.

His victory, combined with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s 2018 unexpected win over former fourth-ranking House Democrat Joseph Crowley in New York and Ayanna Pressley’s defeat of Michael Capuano of Massachusetts, laid bare the growing ideological and generational tensions in the party.

This new rebellion has all the potential power of the liberal insurgency of the 1960s, which G. Calvin Mackenzie and Robert Weisbrot described as “The Liberal Hour” in a landmark 2008 book of that title.

“Today there’s an agenda that resembles the 1960s in some ways – the Green New Deal and Medicare-For-All,” said Mr. Mackenzie, an emeritus political scientist at Maine’s Colby College.

“But the forces of resistance – the vise-hold that special-interest groups and social media have – are far stronger than the resistance in the 1960s. Getting the magnitude of legislation that we had in the 1960s is extremely difficult and unlikely today.”

For months, Mr. Biden resisted the entreaties from the left. He calculated that he was the “remainder man,” the candidate who would be left standing after Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren cancelled each other out and as the other moderates in the field – former mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota – faded.

That worked, but not without a large boost from Black voters in South Carolina and in the state primaries that followed. And as Mr. Biden moved closer to his apparent nomination, it became clear that he had to court the contenders to his left and, perhaps more importantly, their supporters.

Part of that was hard; Mr. Biden had to inch left on health insurance (he is now supporting Medicare for those at the age of 60, five years earlier than current law) and climate change (his is a Pale-Green New Deal). But part was not so difficult at all. Mr. Biden’s blue-collar roots and the party’s post-1932 profile make that a natural.

“Coronavirus and the economic meltdown have cast the Green New Deal and Medicare For All in a different light,” said Democratic Senator Edward Markey of Massachusetts. “These things don’t seem so radical any more.”

Democratic strategists are arguing that, with Mr. Biden at the top of the ticket, the party’s leadership is no more elite than that of the Republican Party, and they’re emphasizing the party’s heritage as representatives of those at the bottom of the economic ladder.

“The party is interested in helping out people in the middle and lower classes,” said Molly Michelmore, a Washington and Lee University historian. “Very few people are paying much attention to the very poor, but if anybody is, it’s the Democrats.”

Ordinarily, a struggle like the one that the two-dozen 2020 Democratic candidates engaged in would have played out in raucous midsummer platform hearings and in a colourful convention scene. But the virus has drained the colour from customary political activity, and the level of antagonism against the President has prompted Democrats to focus on their differences with Mr. Trump rather than their hesitations about Mr. Biden.

“We need a united front in this emergency and against this president,” said Edward Widmer, a Bill Clinton speechwriter who teaches at the Macaulay Honors College of City University of New York. “But progressives have qualms about centrist policies, and centrists have qualms about the progressives. The party will unite to defeat the President, but if Biden wins there will be fights among Democrats about which way to go next.”

That is, to borrow the title of an influential 1963 James Baldwin book about the sort of racial injustice that Americans are examining 57 years later, the fire next time. For now, and at this convention, it is only smouldering.

Andrew Cuomo, who has gained a national following through his management of the coronavirus pandemic, is writing a book that looks back on his experiences so far, and includes leadership advice and a close look at his relationship with the administration of President Donald Trump.

Crown announced Tuesday that Cuomo's ""American Crisis"" will be released Oct. 13, three weeks before Election Day, when Trump is expected to face presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden. The news comes the day after Cuomo addressed the Democratic National Convention and called the virus' spread a metaphor for a country weakened by division. New York State has one of the lowest infection rates in the U.S., a welcome contrast to the spring, when it had one of the highest.

The book is an unusual and risky case of reflecting on a crisis that is still ongoing, and could intensify in the fall.

""In his own voice, Andrew Cuomo chronicles in ‘American Crisis’ the ingenuity and sacrifice required of so many to fight the pandemic,"" according to Crown, ""sharing his personal reflections and the decision-making that shaped his policy, and offers his frank accounting and assessment of his interactions with the federal government and the White House, as well as other state and local political and health officials.""

Over the past few months, Cuomo has been praised for his calm but forceful demeanour, while also being accused of waiting too long to close schools and other indoor facilities, and criticized for the high number of deaths at New York nursing homes. He had said in July he was thinking of a book, commenting during a radio interview on WAMC that he wanted to document the ""entire experience, because if we don't learn from this then it will really compound the whole crisis that we've gone through.""

In an excerpt from ""American Crisis"" that Crown shared with The Associated Press, Cuomo emphasized the importance of confronting fear.

""The questions are what do you do with the fear and would you succumb to it,"" he wrote. ""I would not allow the fear to control me. The fear kept my adrenaline high and that was a positive. But I would not let the fear be a negative, and I would not spread it. Fear is a virus also.""

Financial terms for ""American Crisis"" were not disclosed. Cuomo was represented by Washington attorney Robert Barnett, whose other clients include former President Barack Obama and former President George W. Bush. Cuomo is also the author of ""All Things Possible: Setbacks and Success in Politics and Life,"" which came out in 2014.

Cuomo, currently serving his third term, became known to many for his blunt, straightforward press conferences, and for a time was even mentioned as a possible presidential candidate. His style has differed notably from the more erratic approach of President Trump, a Republican with whom he has clashed often. In his speech to the Democratic convention, Cuomo bemoaned the ""dysfunctional and incompetent"" federal response to the pandemic. Trump, meanwhile, has blamed Cuomo’s ""poor management"" for New York’s tens of thousands COVID-19 fatalities.

Cuomo has received some of his strongest criticism for the thousands of virus-related deaths at New York nursing homes. A recent AP investigation found that the state's death toll of nursing home patients, already among the highest in the nation, could be significantly more than reported. Unlike every other state with major outbreaks, only New York explicitly says that it counts just residents who died on nursing home property and not those who were transported to hospitals and died there.

John McCain of Arizona.

She’s just the latest Republican to join in the convention, after a number of notable GOP former elected officials — including former Ohio Gov. John Kasich — endorsed the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee on Monday night. It's a continuation of a major theme that Democrats have pushed through the first night of the convention — an effort to broaden the party's appeal to occasional Republicans and disaffected Trump voters.

In an advance clip from the video shared with The Associated Press, Cindy McCain talks about how Biden, then a Delaware senator, met her husband when John McCain was assigned to be a military aide for him on a trip overseas. The two became friends, and the families would gather for picnics in the Bidens’ backyard.

""They would just sit and joke. It was like a comedy show, sometimes, to watch the two of them,"" she says in the clip.

Cindy McCain is not expected to offer an explicit endorsement, but her involvement in the video is her biggest public show of support yet for Biden’s candidacy. McCain was the 2008 Republican presidential nominee against Democrat Barack Obama, who won the election with Biden as his vice-presidential running mate.

Both Cindy McCain and her daughter Meghan have been outspoken critics of President Donald Trump, and the family is longtime friends with the Bidens. Trump targeted John McCain personally in 2015, saying the former prisoner of war wasn't a hero ""because he was captured. I like people who weren’t captured."" McCain later angered Trump with his dramatic thumbs-down vote against repealing President Barack Obama’s health care law.

When McCain died on a Saturday in 2018, the Trump administration lowered the American flag over the White House to half-staff but then raised it by Monday. After public outcry, the White House flags were again lowered. Trump wasn't invite to McCain's funeral.

Biden consoled Meghan McCain on an appearance on ""The View"" after her father was diagnosed with the cancer that eventually took his life. She has said Biden often reaches out to her to offer support, after losing his own son Beau to the same cancer in 2015.

But while Meghan suggested in April she’d be voting for Biden, Cindy has pointedly stayed out of the presidential race. In April of last year, amid rumours that the McCains would wade into the election in support of Biden, Cindy McCain tweeted that Biden is ""a wonderful man and a dear friend of the McCain family.""

President Donald Trump is eyeing a White House funeral service later this week for his younger brother, Robert, who died over the weekend in a New York hospital.

“We’re looking at Friday. And we may do just a small service right here at the White House,” Trump told reporters Monday as he departed Washington on a trip to the Midwest.

The president said such a service would be a “great honour” for his sibling.

Robert Trump, a businessman, died Saturday after being hospitalized in New York. He was 71.

President Trump announced his brother’s death in a statement Saturday that referred to his sibling as “my best friend” and promised they “will meet again.”

Trump had visited his brother in the hospital on Friday; White House officials had described him as seriously ill. The cause of death has not been released.

Trump discussed his brother’s death during a nationally broadcast interview Monday.

“This was not a great weekend. It’s very hard. You knew it was going to happen, but still when it happens it’s a very tough thing,” the president said on Fox News Channel’s “Fox and Friends.” “He was a great guy. He was a tremendous guy. He was my friend. I guess they say best friend, and that’s true. And losing him, not easy.”

Trump said Robert Trump had always supported him and there was no rivalry between them.

While the public’s attention has been focused elsewhere, the Trump administration has been pressing ahead in its attempt to crush a fellow sovereign state in the Americas: Cuba.

I am no apologist for the government of Cuba, and I believe the Cuban state, like all others, is accountable to all of its citizens. When I was Canada’s ambassador to Cuba, we had robust conversations with the Cubans on human rights and political reform in order to better understand each other. We certainly disagreed on some matters.

Cuba may not be top of mind in the face of so many pressing global issues, but the way in which the United States and Cuba deal with each other is a litmus test for larger issues: peace and stability in our hemisphere, how countries manage conflict, and the limits of the extraterritorial reach of domestic law (known in “diplomatic-speak” as bullying).

The Trump administration has torqued the U.S. trade and investment embargo against Cuba to unparalleled levels with a series of recent measures. The aim of some measures is to stir uncertainty among foreign companies, including Canadian ones, doing wholly legal business in Cuba. The efforts will effectively work to cripple investment and commerce in Cuba, and throttle the Cuban economy.

An element of U.S. embargo law was activated for the first time in April, 2019, which effectively handed over to certain Cuban Americans the ability to use the U.S. justice system to conduct lawsuits. As an unexpected consequence, several main targets of this exercise have been American companies doing legal business in Cuba. Having purposefully stirred a hornets’ nest, the Trump administration facilitated a legal assault on America’s own corporate citizens.

Other measures injure the well-being of everyday Cubans directly. For example, remittance transfers from the U.S. and elsewhere to recipients in Cuba have been choked by the Trump administration. Approximately 56 per cent of all Cubans depend on this money from family overseas.

The Trump administration’s approach to Cuba is characterized by a seemingly willful misunderstanding of how Cuban society is structured, in which the state provides many services to the population. There is an absence of concern from the White House about the effect of these heightened sanctions on individual Cubans.

The remittances are life-changing money transfers. Most of them pass through a Cuban financial entity belonging to a military holding company, before ending up in the pocket of the plumber or office worker who is waiting anxiously for the funds. If the remittance is blocked for political purposes, that money will simply never get to the pocket for which it was intended by a loving family member or friend.

The Trump administration has rationalized that its current intensification of an economic offensive against Cuba is necessary because of Cuba’s relationship with Venezuela. However, that narrative posits that Cuba can somehow control the behaviour of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, the entire Venezuelan military and Venezuela’s national institutions, as though Cuba is a marionettist pulling the strings of a puppet. The idea strains credulity; Venezuela’s leaders are hardly thinking of Cuba when making their own policy decisions.

Story continues below advertisement

Each new sanction from the U.S. affects real people inside Cuba, especially during a global disease pandemic. This is not an abstraction, though it may seem that way for American policy makers safely ensconced far away in Florida or Washington.

Every time the White House celebrates economic damage to a foreign or Cuban company, it means individual Cubans lose their jobs and the essential livelihoods of entire families are effected. When remittances do not arrive, people in Cuba do not have the option of a backup plan. They are collateral damage in an American campaign to pressure their government regarding Venezuela, with no discernible endgame in sight.

By contrast, by the end of May, Cuba had sent 2,000 doctors and nurses to 23 countries battling COVID-19. Despite condescending criticisms from Washington, citizens and local dignitaries in the town of Crema in Italy applauded and cheered for a Cuban medical unit that had assisted with their pandemic response.

Cuba is far from perfect – but what country is? Cubans face many serious daily challenges, to be sure. But domestic politics inside Cuba itself will adjudicate the choices Cubans get to make for their futures. Setting aside the questionable goal of regime change in Cuba being pursued by the Trump administration, the additional hardship caused to the Cuban people along the way seems a high and unfair price to pay.

That worst-case scenario was on the minds of some federal politicians as they watched New Brunswick Premier Blaine Higgs pull the plug Monday on his minority Conservative government, becoming the first jurisdiction in Canada to send voters to the polls in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.

New Brunswick's example will doubtless offer some lessons on how to conduct an election safely.

It may also embolden other federal opposition parties to join the Bloc Quebecois in its determination to bring down Justin Trudeau's government at the first opportunity. That opportunity will arise sooner than expected with the prime minister's announcement Tuesday that Parliament is being prorogued and will return Sept. 23 with a throne speech. A vote on the speech will be a test of confidence in the government.

For that matter, Higgs' example may embolden Trudeau to pull the plug himself.

And it has NDP democratic reform critic Daniel Blaikie appealing to his counterparts in other federal parties to begin discussing now how best to safely conduct a federal election during the pandemic rather than sleepwalk into potential chaos.

""The worst thing would be to get to the point where we're saying, 'OK, we're having an election' and then having these disputes about the process and having somebody within the political system decide that it's in their best interests to start assailing the legitimacy of the process that's already under way,"" he said in an interview.

Without some all-party consensus on how to conduct an election safely, Blaikie fears Canada could wind up in a situation similar to the United States, where Donald Trump is making unsubstantiated assertions that mail-in ballots will result in rampant voter fraud during November's presidential election.

""We don't need a political crisis on top of a public health and economic crisis,"" he said.

As part of its preparations for a possible election during the pandemic, Elections Canada has set up an internal working group to assess the agency's ability to conduct the vote safely — including its capacity to handle mail-in ballots, find alternative polling station locations and keep both voters and poll workers safe.

But there's only so much Elections Canada can do under current law. In a post on its website about the impact of the pandemic on election planning, the agency notes for instance that Parliament would have to change the Canada Elections Act to allow for an election to be conducted entirely by mail-in ballots.

And it adds this warning: ""In an extreme case, based on the advice of public health experts, the chief electoral officer could certify that it has become impracticable for Elections Canada to administer the election in one or more electoral districts and recommend to the governor-in-council (the governor general on the advice of cabinet) that the election writ be withdrawn.

""This has never been done in Elections Canada's history.""

It's that warning that particularly worries Blaikie. His nightmare scenario is that the government is defeated or Trudeau chooses to call an election, the governor general duly dissolves Parliament ""and then Elections Canada says, 'We're actually not sure we can do this.'""

""So then you have a dissolved Parliament, you have an executive with no Parliament to hold it to account and how long does that go on? ... If that is a possibility, I think it's one we should all be very concerned about.""

Back on June 25, Blaikie wrote his counterparts in the other federal parties asking that they work together to find a way to ensure an election can be conducted safely during the pandemic with a process that is ""politically legitimate.""

No one has so far responded to his letter.

""I find it kind of shocking that we've got people out there talking really strongly about wanting an election and the conditions under which they would precipitate an election when we don't actually know how to have an election properly right now.""

Higgs predicted Monday that New Brunswick will have little difficulty pulling off a safe election, albeit one in which candidates don't go door-to-door or hand out pamphlets.

With fewer than 200 cases of COVID-19 and just two deaths since March, New Brunswick has been relatively unscathed by the virus, which has infected more than 122,000 and killed more than 9,000 countrywide. Moreover, the pandemic is in something of a lull at the moment - which may no longer be the case later in the fall when the Trudeau government's fate could be on the line.

The province's chief electoral officer, Kim Poffenroth, said her agency has instituted a number of measures to ensure voters' and electoral workers' safety. Among them: marking the floors at polling stations to keep voters at least two-meters apart, requiring the use of hand sanitizer when voters enter and exit polling stations, providing disposable masks to electors, requiring workers to wear masks or face shields and hiring additional workers to manage the flow of voters and to clean high-touch surfaces.

As well, she said Elections New Brunswick has cancelled polling stations in long-term care and seniors' homes and will make it easier for residents in those facilities to vote by mail. It has also stocked up on mail-in ballots.

However, should a second surge of COVID-19 cases erupt before Sept. 14, Poffenroth conceded it could impact voter turnout.

""We may have even greater challenges finding workers to work at the polls and then we may run into problems with the owners of buildings where we're supposed to have polling locations not wanting us to use those locations.""

But regardless of how difficult it might become to administer the election, Poffenroth has no legal authority to recommend that it be called off - unlike Canada's chief electoral officer, Stephane Perrault.

""There's really no playbook for how to do this,"" she said. ""It's a learning curve for both ourselves and other election management bodies across the country and we just happen to be the first ones out the gate.""

The Nisga'a Lisims government said Tuesday that Gosnell died in his home in New Aiyansh after a long battle with cancer.

Gosnell was a hereditary Nisga'a chieftain of the Eagle Clan and was president of the nation when it finalized a landmark treaty in 2000 that gave the First Nation control over its land including forestry and fishing rights. It was the first modern-day treaty signed in B.C. since the 1800s.

Nisga'a Nation president Eva Clayton said Gosnell's wisdom, dignity and determination helped lead the First Nation into self-government over its territory northeast of Prince Rupert.

""Today, we have lost a giant,"" Clayton said in a statement. ""His legacy will help shape the project of reconciliation for generations to come.""

Gosnell was a recipient of the Order of Canada, the Order of B.C. and held an honorary doctorate of laws from Royal Roads University in Victoria.

He is survived by his wife of 64 years, Audrey, their seven children and numerous grandchildren and great-grandchildren.

Gosnell grew up in the Nass River Valley in B.C.'s northwest. He worked as a commercial fisherman, carpenter and traditional carver before he was elected as a band councillor and chief of the Gitlaxt'aamiks Band, one of the Nisga'a village governments.

Gosnell was appointed chancellor of the University of Northern B.C. last year and served until his death.

University interim president Geoffrey Payne said Gosnell's dedication to education was evident during his time as chancellor.

""The world has lost a tremendous leader, a man who repeatedly demonstrated a love for his community, his people, education and a commitment to enhancing the lives of others,"" Payne said in a statement.

Clayton said Gosnell's work to negotiate the Nisga'a Treaty produced a ""beacon of hope"" for people around the world.

""His focus was always on what the Nisga'a, British Columbians and Canadians can achieve together,"" she said.

When a bill to accept the treaty was introduced in the legislature in December 1998, Gosnell told the house the agreement proved to the world that reasonable people can sit down and settle historical wrongs.

""It's a triumph because under the treaty, we will no longer be wards of the state, no longer beggars in our own land. It's a triumph because under the treaty, we will collectively own approximately 2,000 square kilometres of land, far exceeding the postage-stamp reserve set aside for us by colonial governments.""

He said the treaty proved that negotiations — not lawsuits, blockades or violence — are the most effective and honourable way to resolve Aboriginal issues.

""It's a triumph, I believe, that signals the end of the Indian Act, the end of more than a century of humiliation, degradation and despair for the Nisga'a Nation.""

Premier John Horgan said in a tweet that everyone can learn from Gosnell's legacy of working to make life better for people and he'll be missed.

""He was instrumental in helping the Nisga'a chart a new path of self-governance through BC's first modern treaty.""

The nation said funeral arrangements will be announced by the family.

Tijana Martin/The Canadian Press

Vonny Sweetland has yet to decide if he will be sending his 12-year-old sister Josephine back to class in September, but just in case he does, he’s been stocking up on supplies for months.

He picks up hand sanitizer when he sees it in stores, grabbed new masks last month, bought a fresh uniform and has been testing out Josephine’s muscle power with some new lunch containers.

The new additions to her backpack and are all part of a wave of changes families – and their wallets – are being confronted with as they prepare for back to school, whether it’s sourcing protective equipment or choosing a thermos their child can open unassisted.

“In a COVID-era, all of these things we take for granted or think are minuscule are actually really important,” said Sweetland, who is his sister’s guardian.

“These are things as simple as a teacher helping you unpack your lunch or zipping a zipper. To prevent potential spread, I don’t think teachers are really going to be doing these things.”

The cost of so many new supplies can easily add up.

A Deloitte survey of 1,200 parents who have at least one child attending school in grades K-12 this fall found the average family will spend $102 on school supplies, $216 on clothing and accessories, $395 on computers and hardware, $316 on electronic gadgets and digital subscriptions.

The survey, which was conducted between May and July, found those families will allocate $61 on a new category: home or health supplies.

Even so, back-to-school shopping doesn’t have to be more expensive than any other year, said Seung Hwan (Mark) Lee, an associate professor of retail management at Ryerson University.

He recommends shoppers compare prices and take advantage of sales.

Anne Marie Taber said she’s noticed plenty of sales, though she hasn’t sought them out when shopping with seven-year-old daughter Avery because she tries to minimize her time in stores and instead use online options with delivery to lessen her exposure to the virus.

She stocked up as soon as she could on Old Navy’s uniform-style clothing because several sizes were out of stock and also grabbed Avery a new backpack.

On top of masks and hand sanitizers, they bought a wide-mouth water bottle without a straw to make cleaning easy, plastic Duo-Tangs that can be wiped down and a set of art supplies that Avery has been reminded not to share.

“This is extra stuff we haven’t had to buy in the past but it’s a small dollar to pay to make sure that that is just hers exclusively,” Taber said.

Parents may also want to consider disposable cutlery, if they have children that bring lunches to school and are worried about germs spreading through anything reuseable, Lee said.

If your child is doing virtual classes, he suggests ensuring you have a reliable laptop or tablet with a webcam.

Those who want to go all out or are older and have specific needs for programs they are enrolled in, may need to think about microphones and speakers too.

Those supplies don’t come cheap. However, the cost of those high-ticket items could be partially offset by a change he sees happening across universities and colleges during the pandemic.

“It’s no longer really about carrying around the heavy textbooks,” he said.

“Many professors aren’t holding lengthy exams because the exams are becoming very difficult to monitor and you can’t really get a proctor to look at how students are conducting their exams... so using test banks or textbooks no longer apply.”

If you’re feeling anxious or stressed about back to school shopping and advertisements are making you feel you better get to a store soon, Lee says not worry.

“I would advise parents right now not to rush into getting supplies,” he said.

Here’s a primer on how to choose a mask that’s right for you and use it properly.

Canadians may be free to visit other countries depending on the entry rules at their destination. Self-isolation is mandatory: All Canadians coming home from abroad are required to go home immediately and stay there for 14 days. They should get groceries and supplies delivered rather than going to the store. Under federal law, authorities can charge up to six-figure fines or put people in jail for refusing to do this.

Planes and trains: If you’re travelling between cities by air or rail, make sure you’re feeling okay first. Anyone who flies or rides a Via train must wear a mask that covers the face and mouth, and temperature checks are mandatory before boarding planes.

The province is at Level 2 of its five-level alert system, which increased the gathering limit, reopened more public facilities and allowed more free movement within the province. Level 1 will be as close to a “new normal” as possible until a vaccine or effective treatment for COVID-19 is found.

Public gatherings: Restricted to 50 or fewer people outdoors or at functions like weddings and funerals. Two individual households are allowed to form exclusive “double bubbles” to gather together in person, and each bubble can invite up to six others from different households to join, as long as they’re not exceeding the limits for their own bubbles by doing so.

Phase 4 of the Renew PEI Together plan, which began on June 26, raised the gathering limits again and reopened accommodations to non-islanders, including bed-and-breakfasts, inns and campgrounds. The phased plan has no specifics on when PEI might allow free access to non-Atlantic provinces.

Public gatherings: Personal gatherings are limited to 20 people or fewer outdoors and 15 indoors, with physical distancing. As of June 26, more than 50 are allowed at “larger organized gatherings” like weddings, funerals and graduations.

Since June, most businesses and community activities have been reopened with physical distancing in place, and since the start of July, the Atlantic bubble allows Nova Scotians to more freely travel within the region.

Public gatherings: Events like weddings, funerals, festivals and concerts can have up to 250 people outdoors and 200 (maximum half-capacity) indoors, and family gatherings can have up to 50. Physical distancing is required. But Nova Scotians are also allowed to form 10-person circles that can meet without physical distancing.

All health regions of New Brunswick are currently in “yellow” mode, the second-lowest of four colour-coded stages in its recovery plan. The lowest stage, green, won’t be reached until there is a COVID-19 vaccine or another effective method for preventing the virus’s spread.

Public gatherings: Restricted to 10 or fewer people, with the limit for outdoor gatherings in most of New Brunswick due to increase to 50 in June. One household is allowed to “bubble” with one other household.

Montreal reopened at a much slower pace than the rest of Quebec, but relaxation measures in June brought them a little closer together: Restaurants can now have dine-in service provincewide, and gyms, arenas, concert venues and movie theatres can open too.

Public gatherings: Limited to 50 people outdoors and 10 indoors, with no more than three households at any one indoor gathering. Some indoor venues like restaurants and theatres can have 50 people at a time if physical distancing is in place. Children under 16 are also able to interact at a closer distance than adults: One metre instead of two.

Ontario

As of July 31, all of Ontario’s health regions except Windsor-Essex are at Stage 3 of the reopening plan. Stage 3 still prohibits overnight camping, saunas, dancing at restaurants and bars and table games at casinos.

Public gatherings: In most of the 34 health regions, gatherings of 50 inside and 100 outside are allowed as of July 17, as long as physical distancing is observed. That doesn’t include the Windsor-Essex area, where the Stage 2 limits of 10 people (indoors or outdoors) still apply. Ontarians can also form “social circles” of up to 10 people that they can visit freely, but are discouraged from joining more than one circle at a time.

If you’re going to a store, some cities (including Toronto) require masks to be worn indoors, but the Premier hasn’t supported making that mandatory provincewide.

Saskatchewan was the first province to set specific dates for reopening its economy, a five-stage process that is now in Phase 4.2. Indoor pools, indoor sports and casinos are due to reopen in the next stage of the plan. Details are scarce about what Phase 5 would look like, but the province might consider lifting limits on public gatherings.

Public gatherings: Restricted to 30 indoors and outdoors, with exceptions for church services, weddings and funerals (up to 150 people or a third of the venue’s capacity, whichever is less) and graduations (30 graduates and an overall attendance of 150).

Northwest Territories

Since June 12, the territory has been in Phase 2 of a four-phase plan. The implementation of the next phase depends on when the rest of Canada clears a second wave of infections, which could come between August and October. The final phase would lift all restrictions, but only if there is a vaccine or an effective treatment accessible within the territory.

Public gatherings: Outdoor gatherings of up to 25 indoors and 50 outdoors are allowed with physical distancing, but at home, Northwest Territories residents can have only five people over, to a maximum of 10. The government recommends having a “fave five” who can come over to limit mixing among different households.

Ontario school boards can stagger the first two weeks of children returning to classroom, the government says, as the Toronto District School Board looks at unused spaces for classrooms and targets more resources for schools in areas with high rates of COVID-19.

In a memo to school boards Tuesday, Education Minister Stephen Lecce said some boards had requested to stagger reopening beyond the first week of school, adding that the “foremost priority is the health and safety of students and staff in the reopening process.”

Trustees at the TDSB were looking at several options on reopening on Tuesday evening. Carlene Jackson, the TDSB’s interim director, also confirmed that the board was given the “green light” on a new secondary school model. It sees students doing a combination of live, synchronous online learning and independent work at home, with about 40 per cent of their time spent in classrooms.

High-school students learning in-person will be in classrooms for the first half of every second day, break between 12:30 p.m. and 2 p.m., and follow the remainder of their lessons online at home.

Jim Spyropoulos, the TDSB’s executive superintendent, said the board still needs to finalize what will happen over the midday period aside from students travelling back home.

“I don’t want to leave people with an idea that teachers are going to be sitting on a lunch break from 12:30 to 2:00, that’s not going to happen,” Mr. Spyropoulos said.

In less than a month, millions of kids will return to school. Here’s what parents need to know

Teachers could use the time to provide additional help to students, contact families whose children have been missing class, co-ordinate with colleagues about lessons and more, he explained.

“We still need to finalize some of those details.”

The TDSB and other large urban boards in Ontario were sent back to the drawing board late last week after the province rejected their plans for in-person elementary and secondary school instruction. The TDSB’s previous high-school schedule had students in classrooms for 25 per cent of the time. Mr. Lecce recently said he wanted high-school students in class for about 50 per cent of the time.

The board, the country’s largest, also planned to shorten elementary school days by 48 minutes, a move that would have kept classes between 15 and 20 students while ensuring teachers maintain their daily 48 minutes of preparation time.

The government is now asking teachers to be flexible with their prep time, typically used to grade assignments, prepare lessons or conduct research – a request the province says teacher unions refuse to discuss. The unions have said the government is attempting to shift blame amid growing unrest among parents and educators about last-minute changes to reopening plans.

TDSB trustees also revealed data from their parent pre-registration survey, to which 67 per cent of parents responded. At the elementary level, 29 per cent of parents said they would keep their children at home if class sizes remained the same. If they were reduced, 23 per cent of parents would be doing the same.

Some 17 per cent of parents with high-school students in the TDSB system have opted for full-remote learning.

This summer, experts from Toronto’s SickKids Hospital and the Public Health Agency of Canada both emphasized that smaller class sizes were crucial to maintaining physical distancing among children, and helping limit the spread of COVID-19. However, the task has proven difficult across the country, with provinces such as Alberta and Ontario not mandating smaller class sizes.

Children – who have been out of schools since March – and their parents are now trying to make the difficult decision of either pursuing education remotely or returning to school buildings amid warnings of a second wave of the virus.

Ontario’s Ministry of Education had earmarked $309-million for the purchase of masks and other personal protective equipment, cleaning, and the hiring of public-health nurses in school boards across the province. It had also committed $50-million for heating, ventilation and air conditioning upgrades in schools, and has designated $30-million for the hiring of additional teachers and assistants.

Last week, Mr. Lecce also announced school boards could use their reserve funds to cover additional hiring costs, but boards have said that it won’t be nearly enough to lower all class sizes at the elementary level.

Several boards, including the Ottawa-Carleton District School Board (OCDSB) and the Halton District School Board (HDSB), have been scrambling to rework timetables as the government changed direction with just weeks before school starts.

Andréa Grebenc, chair of the Halton District School Board, said that her board, like others, presented their plans to the Ministry of Education in late July and there were no concerns expressed at that time.

“Boards are now back at square one with classes beginning in exactly three weeks,” said Andréa Grebenc, chair of the HDSB. “It is time for the Minister to start truly listening and collaborating with school boards as education partners instead of making intermittent proclamations that just sow chaos.”

The board, she said, had to pause its survey of how many students are returning to the classroom after Mr. Lecce changed direction.

The OCDSB said the changes from Mr. Lecce came three days before its survey of families was set to close.

“We understand that the upcoming adjustments to the return to school plan may result in a change of decision for some families,” director of education Camille Williams-Taylor wrote in an e-mail to parents last week. “We will establish a process to allow families to make a change. However, timelines are tight and we need to do as much forward planning as possible.”

Earlier this week, the Ottawa board said that about 26.9 per cent of its elementary students opted for remote learning, while 21.5 per cent of secondary school students did the same.

Other boards are seeing similar results. The York Region District School Board said 33 per cent of elementary school families opted for learning online, and 20 per cent of high-school students made that choice. The Durham District School Board said about 20 per cent of its elementary and high-school students chose remote learning.

Canada’s back-to-school plans: The latest news, and resources on COVID-19 and your kids

Along with the teachers’ unions, some parents and school boards have expressed concern about the government plan, which does not cut elementary school class sizes.

In response to those concerns, the province said boards can access $500 million of their own savings to achieve physical distancing in classrooms.

Meanwhile, Ontario is reporting 125 new cases of COVID-19 and four new deaths related to the virus.

The total number of cases now stands at 40,870, which includes 2,793 deaths and 37,126 cases marked as resolved.

Health Minister Christine Elliott says the “uptick” in cases is due to increases in Peel Region, Toronto and Windsor-Essex. She said 27 of Ontario’s 34 public health regions reported five or fewer cases, while 16 reported no new cases.

The province was able to complete 23,067 tests in the previous day.

At first, I chatted with parents asking their thoughts about schools reopening and if they were going to send their kids. I’ll admit I felt a little outnumbered, as each parent I spoke with had no intention of sending their kids back to school. I was even wondering if was making the right decision.

I don’t think there is a right or wrong answer here, it’s about personal preferences and family circumstances. This is one of those topics that we need to respect people’s decisions and not try to sway them to stand with us.

We all need to make the best decisions for our families. Also, as schools are operating within a smaller capacity and limiting student numbers, it is actually great that there are some families who are willingly keeping their children home.

It’s been a couple of weeks since schools have reopened, and there have been many children returning to school. I wasn’t alone. At one point I pictured an empty school with my daughter sitting in a class with only her teacher.

My daughter has been in school twice a week and spends other days in child care with a small group of kids. This experience has been extremely positive, and she is almost an entirely new child. She comes home beaming with excitement and happiness. Honestly, her reaction to these outlets opened my eyes to the effects a couple of months in quarantine had on her.

I am grateful to the schools and child-care centres that are opening and offering children the support, activities and mental stimulation they need and crave.

Before sending my daughter to school, we talked about how things might be different and what she could expect. I was worried the changes might be hard to adjust to. There were news stories and letters sent to parents all addressing this.

When my daughter came home the first day, she didn’t mention any of it. Her updates were on her teacher, her friends, and what they were learning. This was another reminder to me on how resilient children are.

My daughter took the school bus for the first time in months and told me how great it was. I had to nearly pry it out of her that she has to use hand sanitizer to board and that the first few rows need to remain empty to give the bus driver space.

I found this interesting because as adults I think we are often focussing on what the changes are going to be and how they will affect us.

Interestingly, there are some things in place that my daughter did point out, such as having to wash her hands before and after she eats. Which is something we should all do, all the time. If this is a new practice that gets drilled into us a little bit more, it’s a good thing.

Many of us are starting to experience the opportunities of going back to school or returning to work, and there will be some big changes in doing so.

At my daughter’s school, she said there are arrows on the floor now, similar to grocery stores. This is something that I think we will continue to see in more places. I remember the first time I saw this on social media and, honestly, I didn’t think it would happen here. It goes to show how fast we are able to implement practices that keep people safe and how quickly we can all adapt to them.

Teachers have now seen their duties multiply, with not only educating children in the classroom, but creating and facilitating online learning, and then the added responsibilities of ensuring the students are adhering to physical distancing. It’s no easy task, and I want to thank all teachers, particularly my daughter’s teacher for stepping up to the challenge.

According to the Conference Board of Canada, this country earns an “A” for its high-school completion rate, and ranks second out of 16 peer countries.

However, you might feel you are facing more uncertainties in the current climate than normal, so this is a good time for both some good news and some not-so-good news about what the future might hold, career-wise.

article continues below

But first, the bad news. You’d be justified in some level of anxiety about the future if you have plans never to darken the doorway of some kind of classroom again.

Recent graduates who enter the labour force straight out of high school are not faring as well as previous generations. That’s partly because 88 per cent of working-age Canadians have already graduated from high school and the competition for jobs which require only high school graduation is fierce.

The better news is that Canadian high-school graduates who pursue some level of post-secondary education or training do much better financially in the long run.

But as a Grade 12 grad, you probably already know all that. The somewhat more hopeful news is that baby boomers now make up Canada’s largest demographic group, and many are nearing retirement.

According to Statistics Canada, the baby-boomer generation made up almost 26 per cent of the population in 2018. And by 2024, one in five Canadians will be 65 or older.

That means many job opportunities could become available for younger Canadians who still have all or most of their careers ahead of them.

That’s an encouraging prospect for this year’s Grade 12 grads, but just as important as increasing job availability will be, according to the Conference Board of Canada, the kind of flexibility that some form of post-secondary education offers.

If current trends continue, Canadians can expect to hold as many 15 jobs, sometimes on different career paths and sometimes as variations of the original career direction.

A survey of 4,000 Canadians in September and October last year found that only six per cent of people have held just one job in their career, while 16 per cent said that they had already held more than 10.

Times have changed since previous generations posted a qualification and then worked in the same career all their lives. Job security, benefits and pensions defined their decision not to branch out.

So the not-so-good news for high school grads who think it’s all over is that their education is not over by far.

There is a growing consensus among employers that high-school completion is simply the prerequisite, a first step to post-secondary education of some kind.

A post-secondary qualification of some kind, even if it does not apply specifically to a job, is now deemed essential to success in a wide variety of labour-market opportunities.

Again, according to StatCan and other people who keep track of employment trends, most Canadians don’t think they will stay in the same line of work for their entire career.

In a survey of more than 1,000 people, nearly 73 per cent said that they do not expect to remain in the same profession for life. The most common reasons people gave for changing career paths range from discovering a new opportunities they have become passionate about (35 per cent), becoming bored/disillusioned with their original work (24 per cent), and a variety of setbacks, real or imagined, such as lack of advancement and cutbacks in times like these that result in layoffs (19 per cent).

That at least takes some pressure off the immediate decision to commit to a lifelong career direction.

Beyond that, there is a long lineup of notable people, too many to mention here, who did not discover what they really wanted to do until somewhat later in life.

Andrea Bocelli began singing opera when he was 34 and Martha Stewart was 35 when she started her catering business in a friend’s basement. She was 42 when her first book of recipes was published.

J.K. Rowling was a divorced mother on public assistance before she created Harry Potter at age 35, and the list goes on.

None of this has anything to do with being a “late bloomer.” It is simply illustrative of the fact that the decisions that you, as a newly certificated Grade 12 graduate, make now might, or more likely might not, lead to a lifelong career.

But with some post-secondary qualifications, the variety of opportunities is probably better than ever before.

British Columbia will require staff and students in middle and secondary schools to wear masks in common areas and on school buses when classes resume, a shift from the original plan, which had masks recommended but not mandatory.

The change came after British Columbia tabulated one of its highest-ever counts of new cases, 236 since Saturday. Public health officials say most cases are among young adults.

Under the new guidelines for schools issued on Monday, masks will be required in the higher grades when students and teachers are outside their classrooms in crowded common areas such as the hallway or the bus. They will also be mandatory any time students and teachers cannot maintain an appropriate distance from others outside of their learning groups. School districts are dividing students into cohorts of no more than 60 in elementary school and 120 in high-school.

Back to school: When do school open? Are masks mandatory? A guide

Reka Gustafson, the deputy Provincial Health Officer, told reporters at Monday’s COVID-19 briefing that masks generally don’t offer a high level of protection from the virus.

“That’s why, when we do recommend them, they’re limited to the settings where usually, during brief periods of time, the other control methods cannot be used,” Dr. Gustafson said.

She said the current science shows children are not “very efficient transmitters of COVID-19″ and that it has been uncommon for adults to get the virus from working in schools.

“We have a lot of reassuring data from around the world that is telling us it’s possible to be safe,” she said.

Ontario has announced students in Grade 4 and up will be required to wear masks, including in class, while younger students will be encouraged to do the same. Alberta is requiring masks for students Grade 4 and up in common areas, but not in class for working at their desks. Quebec has done the same for students in Grade 5 and up. Nova Scotia is requiring them for high-school students in common areas.

On Friday, Calgary’s two main school boards imposed the strictest rules in the country, requiring face coverings beginning in kindergarten and, for students in the city’s public school system, in classrooms during lessons.

Last week, B.C.‘s Provincial Health Officer, Bonnie Henry, defended the province‘s earlier decision not to make masks mandatory. She said masks can interfere with students’ ability to learn, but they can help where physical distancing cannot be maintained, such as in hallways.

“It is a challenge. To think of, particularly a young child, 10, 11, 12, sitting all day in a classroom with a mask on is probably not realistic,” she said. “There’s lots of things we can do to make those environments safe without requiring someone to sit with a mask on for long periods of time.”

The Public Health Agency of Canada developed guidelines, released last weekend in collaboration with public health experts, that recommend non-medical masks for children at the age of 10 – around Grade 4 – and older based on current evidence of COVID-19 transmission.

On Monday, the education ministry said students who can’t wear masks for medical reasons will be exempt from the updated health and safety guidelines.

B.C.‘s schools are scheduled to open on Sept. 10.

B.C. Health Minister Adrian Dix says the province will announce stricter penalties this week for those who flout public-health rules as COVID-19 cases climb in the region. The Canadian Press

The B.C. education ministry also said on Monday it is providing additional funding to schools to help pay for up to 1.5 million non-medical masks. The money would provide for at least two masks for every staff member and student at the province’s public schools.

A spokesperson for the ministry said it is also giving school districts new technical guidelines and checklists developed by industry experts to help improve the ventilation in classrooms.

The BC Teachers’ Federation did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday, but has said it prefers a stricter mask policy.

The government also says it is increasing the cleaning of things like doorknobs, keyboards, desks and chairs.

As well, students, staff and visitors will be required to clean their hands before boarding school buses or entering schools. Hands will also have to be cleaned before and after eating, when using washrooms and playground equipment.

BRITISH COLUMBIA

British Columbia has laid out its plan for studies to resume in ""learning groups"" this fall. School districts are to post final back-to-school details online by Aug. 26.

Back to class: Schools will welcome students back full time on Sept. 8, but parents will still have the option of registering their kids for remote learning or home schooling.

Groups: Students will be sorted into learning groups to reduce the number of people they come in contact with. For elementary and middle school students, groups will be no larger than 60 people. Secondary school groups will be capped at 120.

Physical distancing: Students and staff don't need to maintain physical distancing within their learning group, but contact should be minimized. Outside the group, physical distancing is required. Students should be more spaced out in classrooms.

Masks: Students and staff will not be required to wear masks in schools, but the province says it's a ""personal choice that will always be respected.""

New routines: The province is urging schools to stagger recess, lunch and class transition times and take students outside whenever possible.

Transportation: Middle and high school students are asked to wear masks on buses. Students should be assigned seats, and a transparent barrier may be used to separate the driver.

---

ALBERTA

The province is planning to fully reopen schools from kindergarten to Grade 12 this fall. Measures will be tightened if an outbreak occurs and class sizes could be reduced to 20.

Back to class: School will be back in session with extra safety measures, but the province says there are programs to support remote and alternative learning.

Groups: Schools should sort students into cohorts by class when possible to minimize contact with others.

Physical distancing: Physical distancing is recommended when possible. Rooms should be rearranged to increase space between desks.

Masks: Masks will be mandatory for staff and many students in some school settings. Students in Grades 4 to 12 must wear masks in all common areas, such as hallways and on buses. Staff are required to wear masks whenever physical distancing cannot be maintained. Mask use will be optional for kids in kindergarten through Grade 3. The government says all students and staff will receive two reusable masks as part of the policy.

Transportation: Parents are asked to bring their children to school if they can. Students who take the bus will sit in the same seat every day.

New routines: Schools are advised to consider a ""no sharing policy,"" with each student bringing their own supplies. Class, lunch and recess schedules will be staggered.

SASKATCHEWAN

Saskatchewan first unveiled a set of back-to-school guidelines in June, but released more details Aug. 4.

Back to class: Students will return to class as early as Sept. 1.

Groups: Groups of students and staff members assigned to them should stick together throughout the day and try not to mingle with other groups. Schools should aim to minimize the number of different instructors who interact with students throughout the day.

Physical distancing: Officials say maintaining physical distance is ""less practical"" for younger children, and the focus should be on limiting physical contact. Officials suggest limiting hugs and hand holding and suggest using alternative greetings such as air high fives. Schools are also to have dedicated quarantine areas where symptomatic students can go before they are picked up by parents.

Masks: Staff are not required to wear masks or eye protection except when in close contact with someone who is sick. The province says they should only be used when ""all other controls have been fully explored.""

Transportation: Parents should take their kids to school when possible, and pickup and drop-offs should happen outside. Students using school transportation should be assigned seats, and a partition may be used to separate the driver.

New routines: Start times, recess, lunch and class transitions may be staggered to allow for more space for physical distancing. Schools should rearrange their classrooms to space out students. Students and staff are asked to bring hand sanitizer.

MANITOBA

The Manitoba government says most students are to be back in classrooms on Sept. 8 with new guidelines to reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19.

Back to class: All students from kindergarten to Grade 8 are to have in-class instruction five days a week. High school students will also be in class full time, except in schools where there is inadequate space for physical distancing, in which case there will be some days of remote learning.

Groups: When physical distancing isn't possible, students will have to be organized into cohorts no larger than 75, and minimize contact with others. In these cases, there must be at least one metre between their desks.

Physical distancing: The province says students are required to maintain a two-metre distance to ""the greatest extent possible."" When it isn't possible, physical barriers may be an option. Spaces should be arranged to encourage separation.

Masks: Masks are not required for students or staff.

Transportation: Buses will be running at reduced capacity, and parents will be asked to transport their children to school if they can.

New routines: Lunch and recess are to be staggered to minimize congestion, and in many cases teachers will change classrooms instead of students.

ONTARIO

Ontario students will be back in class September, but their schedules and class sizes may vary depending on where they live.

Back to class: Elementary students and many high schoolers will be in school five days a week in standard class sizes. However, secondary students at two dozen boards that are higher risk will only attend class half the time, and will spend the rest of the week working on ""curriculum-linked independent work."" Parents will also have the option to keep their kids out of class, and boards must provide options for remote learning.

Groups: For high schoolers in high-risk districts, class sizes will be capped at 15. Meanwhile, elementary students won't be broken up into smaller groups, but will be grouped into cohorts and their exposure to different teachers will be limited.

Physical distancing: While Education Minister Stephen Lecce said the aim is to keep students one metre apart from each other, a guidance document says only that schools should promote ""as much distancing as possible"" rather than being strictly enforced.

Masks: Masks will be mandatory for students in Grades 4 through 12, and will be strongly encouraged for younger kids when they're in indoor common areas. Staff will be expected to wear masks.

Transportation: Some school boards may have more than one student assigned to a seat. When physical distancing isn't possible, masks will be mandatory for students in Grades 4 to 12, and younger students will be encouraged but not required to do the same.

New routines: Students in some districts will have to pre-register for in-person schooling. Some schools may limit or even ban visitors, including parents. Breaks will be scheduled to allow students to wash their hands.

QUEBEC

All elementary and high school students in Quebec will be required to attend class in September unless they have a doctor's note indicating they're at high risk of COVID-19 complications or they live with someone at risk. Those students will be allowed to study remotely.

Back to class: Class attendance is mandatory for elementary and high school students. For Grades 10 and 11, schools have the option of alternating schedules where students attend one day out of every two — as long as schools cannot maintain stable classroom bubbles. Grade 10 and 11 students are encouraged to attend classes as much as possible.

Groups: Each classroom will be its own bubble and students will not be required to maintain a two-metre distance between classmates.

Physical distancing: Students will need to keep a two-metre distance from all school staff, as well as all other students outside their classroom bubble. There are no physical distancing requirements for children or teachers in pre-school.

Masks: All students in Grade 5 and up — as well as all school staff — must wear a mask inside all common areas of the school except the classroom. Masks can also be removed when students are eating.

Transportation: No more than 48 students will be allowed on a school bus, with no more than two students sitting on the same bench. Preschool and elementary school students are strongly encouraged to wear masks, while older students are required to wear them.

New routines: When schools return in the fall, teachers will move from classroom to classroom, but students will stay put.

Backup plans: In the event of an outbreak in one class, the entire classroom bubble will be sent home to continue studies remotely. Authorities are also putting together an emergency protocol in the event of a second wave to ensure instruction continues online if entire schools are again forced to close. Ideas include quickly distributing tablets or laptops to students needing them and establishing a digital platform to continue courses and maintain communication.

NEW BRUNSWICK

The province has outlined a set of requirements schools must follow in developing their plans for the fall.

Back to class: Students in kindergarten to Grade 8 are to attend school full time, while those in Grades 9 to 12 are to be taught using a combination of in-class and remote instruction. At-home course work can include online learning, guided projects and experiential education.

Groups: For kindergarten through Grade 2, group sizes will be reduced to about 15, wherever possible. Group sizes should also be shrunk for Grades 3 to 5. Grades 6 to 8 will resume at regular class sizes. Students in Grades 9 to 12 will not be grouped because of their schedules and course options.

Physical distance: Grade 9 to 12 classrooms are required to maintain a one-metre distance, while a two-metre distance is recommended in common areas at all grade levels.

Masks: It's unclear where the province stands on staff and students wearing masks.

Transportation: The province says it's working with school districts to develop plans for transportation. Pickup and drop-off schedules may be staggered.

New routines: Arrivals, breaks and lunches are to be staggered. Public access to school buildings will be limited, and students, staff and visitors may also be subject to screening. High school students will be expected to have their own laptop or similar device, and some subsidies will be available.

PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND

Schools on the Island are preparing to welcome all students back to class, while drafting backup plans for remote studies if required.

Back to class: Schools are to reopen for teachers and staff on Sept. 1 and for students on Sept. 8.

Groups: Students will be organized into cohorts when possible and limit their exposure to others.

Physical distancing: Students will be taught about the importance of physical distancing, and extra teaching and cleaning staff may be hired. Schools are also asked to reduce class sizes as much as possible, reconfigure classrooms and make use of spaces such as libraries and multipurpose rooms.

Masks: The province says all staff and students in Grades 7-12 are ""strongly recommended"" to wear masks when physical distancing cannot be maintained. Students from kindergarten through Grade 6 may wear masks when physical distancing is impossible. Staff interacting with children who have complex medical needs are strongly recommended to wear face shields and gloves.

Transportation: Parents are asked to take their kids to school whenever possible. To reduce the number of riders on buses, schools may add vehicles and routes or implement walk-to-school programs. It is strongly recommended that all students and drivers wear masks on the bus.

New routines: P.E.I. education authorities are revising curricula for this school year to make up for learning gaps caused by lockdown constraints. Schools will stagger schedules to minimize congestion. The provincial school food program will be expanded next year in keeping with public health precautions. Elementary school students will stay in their classrooms for lunch.

NOVA SCOTIA

Education Minister Zach Churchill says the province's objective is for schools to return to 100 per cent capacity in the fall, but its plan includes measures to address the possible onset of a second wave of COVID-19.

Back to class: The province aims to have all elementary and high school students in classrooms by Sept. 8.

Groups: Students will be asked to keep to cohorts.

Physical distancing: Students and staff will be encouraged to maintain a two-metre distance whenever possible. Lecture rooms will be reorganized to increase space between desks.

Masks: Masks are not required in classrooms, but students and staff may choose to wear them. While it's recommended that they bring their own, masks will be provided to those who don't have one. Staff and students in Grades 10 to 12 must wear masks when physical distancing is difficult.

Transportation: Students who take the school bus will be required to wear non-medical masks.

New routines: Only students and staff will be permitted to enter school buildings. When possible, teachers will be asked to move their classes outdoors. Students will be asked to bring their own computers to school, and the province says it has acquired an additional 14,000 devices for those with limited access to technology.

Backup plans: If a COVID-19 outbreak occurs during the academic year, schools will move to a blended learning model with smaller class sizes and home learning for older students.

---

NEWFOUNDLAND AND LABRADOR

The province's back-to-school plan aims to maximize in-class attendance with the option of a return to remote learning if the COVID-19 risk increases.

Back to class: The province's plan outlines three scenarios — in-class instruction, remote learning or a combination of both, depending on the COVID-19 risk in a particular community.

Groups: Cohorting by class is recommended when it's feasible, but students' schedules shouldn't be disrupted to support smaller groupings.

Physical distancing: Schools should aim to create a two-metre distance between desks, or as much distance as possible. However, provincial authorities say these precautions should not interfere with the daily school routine, and strict physical distancing should not be ""over-emphasized"" to children, because it is not practical and can cause psychological harm.

Masks: The province does not recommend masks for children, but says their use should not be ""stigmatized"" for those that choose to wear them. Staff will not be required to wear masks if physical distancing is possible.

Transportation: It will be up to school districts to determine their transportation operations, considering precautions such as assigning seats and separating the driver with a physical divider.

New routines: All students must bring their own supplies in keeping with a ""no sharing"" policy.

Backup plans: In the event of moderate-to-widespread transmission of COVID-19, school districts will move to online learning. Classroom attendance should be limited to about 50 per cent when the COVID-19 risk in a community is considered low to moderate. Newfoundland and Labrador says it will spend $20 million to purchase laptops for teachers and students in Grades 7 through 12 to support remote learning.

YUKON

The territorial government says it's making plans for the next school year that include flexibility around the number of students in classes if there's a second wave of COVID-19 or increased risk of transmission. It says each school will determine how it will adjust its operations to meet those guidelines, and school principals and staff are expected to share that information prior to September.

Back to class: Preliminary plans indicate that in rural communities, all students will return to school full time. In Whitehorse, however, kids in kindergarten through Grade 9 will return to full-day in-school instruction, while Grades 10 to 12 will spend half their day in the classroom, and the rest learning remotely.

Groups: Class sizes may be smaller to meet safety restrictions.

Masks: Wearing masks is a personal choice.

Transportation: Bus school and schedules will be posted to the territory's website.

New routines: Schedule shakeups may mean that some students won't have their regular teacher or the same classmates. School meal programs may be adapted with new safety measures and pickup options.

Backup plans: The territory has outlined a spectrum of school options if the risk to the community increases, ranging from rotating schedules to suspension of face-to-face learning.

NORTHWEST TERRITORIES

All N.W.T. schools have submitted plans to reopen their doors this fall. The territory says education authorities are taking a flexible approach in their planning to account for a potential second wave of COVID-19 in the fall.

Back to class: While plans will vary from school to school, the territory will offer in-person instruction whenever possible, while ensuring alternative options are available.

Groups: Students in kindergarten through Grade 6 will be in classroom ""bubbles,"" and won't have to practise physical distancing within these groups.

Physical distancing: For Grades 7 to 9, students are asked to maintain a one-metre distance from each other, and two-metre distance from staff. Grade 10 to 12 students are asked to allow for two metres of distance from their peers and instructors.

Masks: Students of all ages may be required to wear masks in situations where physical distance cannot be practised, such as moving through the hallways.

Transportation: There may be changes to bus schedules, and all riders will be required to wear masks.

New routines: More time will be spent learning outside. School hours and schedules may also look different. Students are asked to label personal items and not share.

Backup plans: The territory says schools are preparing to shift between in-person, distance and blended learning at short notice should there become active COVID-19 cases.

---

NUNAVUT

The territory has released a four-stage plan for reopening schools based on the risk of the novel coronavirus in a community.

Back to class: There are no reported COVID-19 cases in Nunavut, so all schools are set to reopen this fall with enhanced cleaning and safety precautions.

Groups: It is recommended that schools cohort students by class and limit mixing as much as possible.

Physical distancing: Distance requirements will depend on what stage a community is in, and will primarily be achieved by limiting school attendance.

Masks: In most cases, the use of masks is not recommended for children. If there are exceptions, parents will be notified, and masks will be provided.

Transportation: As it stands, bus schedules are set to resume. Students older than 13 may be required to wear masks.

New routines: Group activities will be limited. Students won't be allowed to share food in lunchrooms.

Backup plans: The territory says schools could go part-time if contact tracing were to identify a possible source of COVID-19. All schools would be closed if community transmission were to take place.

Issues in focus

Missed connections: For families whose fall plans include remote learning, the challenges could be greatest for the youngest students, educators warn. Michelle McKay, who taught kindergarten in Ontario’s Peel District School Board last year, says the Education Minister’s planned “Zoom-style classrooms” for kindergartners are inconsistent with his ministry’s own guidelines, which focus on play and inquiry.

Split decisions: In some schools, families weighing the risks of in-person versus at-home learning could be locked into their choice until early 2021. “I’m frustrated because I’m being asked to make a really big decision, but without all the information that I need,” said Allison O’Grady of Edmonton, who has until Friday to choose what to do for her sons, aged 7 and 9.

Key differences for students

Attendance: In Quebec - which has the strictest policies for in-class instruction - attendance is mandatory for all elementary and high-school students. The only exceptions occur if a class suffers an outbreak (in which case they’ll be sent home and continue studies there), a student has a doctor’s note saying they’re at high risk of COVID-19, or a student lives with a high-risk individual. Ontario, by contrast, requires school boards to provide remote-learning options for those who want them.

Ontario, by contrast, requires school boards to provide remote-learning options for those who want them. Masks: Masks will be mandatory in all classrooms in Ontario for grades 4 to 12. Alberta has restrictions for the same grades in settings where physical distancing can’t be maintained; Calgary’s two main boards are going a step further, requiring masks for all grades, though not necessarily in classrooms. In Quebec, B.C., Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador, masks are required for middle- and high-school grades in common areas like halls and buses. But in other jurisdictions, it’s generally up to students or school boards to decide on masking practices, and schools may vary in their policies about when and how many masks can be provided to students who don’t have their own.

But in other jurisdictions, it’s generally up to students or school boards to decide on masking practices, and schools may vary in their policies about when and how many masks can be provided to students who don’t have their own. Cohorting: Most provinces will aim to have cohorts (B.C. calls them “learning groups”) to limit how many students come in contact with each other. In Quebec, Ontario and Alberta, the cohort is the class itself, though Ontario is also capping the size of high-school classrooms in high-risk areas to 15. B.C. allows the largest cohorts: 60 for elementary- and middle-school students, and 120 for high schoolers.

Key differences for teachers and staff

Masks: Mandatory mask policies will be more common for teachers and other school staff than for their pupils, but the rules aren’t consistent nationwide. They’ll be mandatory in many settings in Quebec, Ontario and Alberta schools. In B.C. and Nova Scotia, masks are optional. In Prince Edward Island, gloves and face shields are strongly recommended if staff are interacting with students with complex medical needs.

Indoors vs. outdoors: The federal COVID-19 guidance for schools encourages classes to be moved outside when the weather allows it, and jurisdictions like Nova Scotia plan to follow that advice. But thinking ahead to the winter, when outdoor instruction won’t be as easy, many school boards are pressing for ventilation upgrade that could reduce the airborne spread of the virus: Ontario has pledged $50-million for heating, ventilation and air conditioning improvements.

Transportation: In some provinces, the most complicated physical-distancing challenges fall to bus drivers, who will have to consider capacity limits (Quebec buses can have no more than 48 passengers) or fixed seating arrangements (Alberta pupils will have to stick to assigned seats). B.C. and Saskatchewan buses may have partitions for drivers. As for masks, they’re required for Manitoba’s bus drivers and encouraged in PEI but not necessarily required everywhere else.

Key differences for parents

Transportation: The Prairie provinces and PEI are strongly encouraging parents to take their children to school whenever possible, while in other jurisdictions, boards are adding new buses or walk-to-school programs to make physically distanced transportation easier.

Visiting: Some jurisdictions are limiting access to schools to staff and students only; parents may not be allowed to enter buildings. Instead, there will be designated outdoor pickup areas. Manitoba schools plan to have areas where students who report COVID-19 symptoms can be quarantined before pickup.

My child is going back to class. What can they do to get ready?

Learn how COVID-19 works

Because closing schools was one of the first steps taken in Canada and abroad when the pandemic was declared, little is known about how children contract or spread COVID-19. Children aren’t invulnerable to the virus, but the good news is that they make up far less of the infection toll than older people, and when they do get sick, their symptoms are often less severe. The bigger risk is that students with mild or absent symptoms will spread COVID-19 to teachers, family members or immunocompromised classmates who are more likely to get seriously ill. To prevent that, it’s essential that children know the COVID-19 symptoms (a dry cough, fever and difficulty breathing) and isolate themselves quickly if they’re not feeling well.

Talk about hygiene

Students at school will be expected to wash their hands a lot more often than usual, and may be given dedicated break times to do so. The video below demonstrates the federal government’s recommended practices for good hand-washing.

Story continues below advertisement

Talk about mental health

The pandemic has been a stressful time for everyone, including children who’ve been unable to see their friends or enjoy normal summer activities. But going back to school may give students new and more immediate anxieties to manage. Here are some pointers from the federal government on listening to your child’s concerns, and a mental-health hub for youth that includes various provincial crisis lines your child can contact if they’re in distress.

Help children stick to a routine

New school routines will be more regimented. They could include staggered lunch and recess breaks to avoid crowding, different lengths to the school day or an alternation between in-class and at-home learning on designated days of the week. Make sure that your child has a day planner or scheduling app and they keep it up to date.

Items to bring

The old standards: Pencils, pens, paper, scissors and other back-to-school staples are still as necessary as ever, even more so in schools with no-sharing policies to stop the spread of the virus on surfaces. Consider buying a washable pouch to store these items.

Consider buying a washable pouch to store these items. Computer: Some jurisdictions, like Nova Scotia, expect students to have their own computers that can be used for remote learning. If an outbreak sends the rest of the class home, this may be students’ only option for continuing lessons. If your child has a laptop or tablet, make sure they’re familiar with the software needed to stay in contact with their class; if they don’t, check with the school board to see if they provide computers or subsidies to buy one.

The trick is finding one that’s the right size for your child and can be worn comfortably for long periods of time. Health reporter Wency Leung talked to medical experts who suggested four things to consider.

I don’t want my child back in class. What are my options?

Open this photo in gallery Students work on an assignment in a pandemic learning pod at home in Woodland Hills, Calif., on Aug. 12. Rodin Eckenroth/Getty Images

Virtual studies or home-schooling are still an option in some provinces, notably Ontario, but every family’s situation is different. Ultimately, it’s a question of assessing risk: Is it better to send a child to school and be ready if they get sick, or to keep the child at home and disrupt your family’s working routine? Risk-assessment experts who spoke with The Globe caution that, in a new situation like a pandemic, gut feelings can be less reliable than the advice of experts. But “there’s no right answer as to how that trade-off should go. Everything depends on your own values,” says Paul Slovic, a psychology professor at the University of Oregon.

Some families, skeptical of their local back-to-school plans, have begun organizing “education pods” like those that emerged in the United States over the summer. The idea is to have families pool resources to hire a private teacher to instruct children in small groups. But many education advocates say pods will only segregate privileged families from racialized and low-income ones who will have to face the risks of public education alone. “Wealthy families have the resources to do whatever they want. It’s not a luxury for us parents who have four or five kids,” says Sureya Ibrahim, an Ethiopian-Canadian community organizer in Toronto’s Regent Park neighbourhood.

Ontario Premier Doug Ford says the province’s teachers unions must be flexible as his government seeks major changes to the Toronto District School Board’s pandemic reopening plan just three weeks before classes begin.

Last week, the Ontario government rejected plans from the Toronto board, the country’s largest, that would have reduced class sizes in elementary schools and shaved 48 minutes of teaching time off each school day to preserve contractually guaranteed preparation time for teachers.

Now, the province is asking teachers to be flexible on their preparation time in order to maximize in-class instruction – a demand the government says teacher unions refuse to discuss.

The confrontation echoes the bitter, drawn-out contract talks that just ended in the spring, as COVID-19 hit.

Speaking to the media on Monday, Mr. Ford accused the unions of failing to work with the government and mounting political attacks. Union leaders say they have been flexible, and that Mr. Ford is trying to deflect blame for the confusion over school reopening plans.

“I’m begging the teachers unions. Like, just work with us. Like man, come on. We work with everyone, absolutely everyone,” Mr. Ford said.

He added that his government has listened to the unions’ concerns, announcing millions in new funding for better ventilation in schools, enhanced cleaning and allowing the use of school board reserve funds to hire more teachers.

“Anything you ask, we do. We ask for a little bit more, and you shoot it down. It’s just not fair,” the Premier said.

Asked if the government wants teachers to prepare on their own time, Education Minister Stephen Lecce called on the unions to make sacrifices, as others have, noting that many people have lost their jobs or had to change how they work.

“What we’re asking for is flexibility,” Mr. Lecce said. “Every single subsect of society has had to be flexible, changed their behaviour, adapted, pivoted, to really rise to the challenge, which is a generational, once-in-a-century pandemic.”

The Ford government has also told the TDSB to rework its plan for high schools, which included a hybrid of in-class and online learning, with 25 per cent of time in a classroom. Ontario says it wants that number at 50 per cent.

Union leaders insist they are being flexible, and that the issue of prep time hadn’t come up before.

The Elementary Teachers’ Federation of Ontario said it “did not get far enough in the discussions” to talk about preparation time with the Ministry of Education or the Ontario Public School Boards’ Association. In a statement, the union declined to comment further on the Premier’s remarks.

Harvey Bischof, president of the Ontario Secondary School Teachers’ Federation (OSSTF), described the government’s comments on the lack of union flexibility as “patently false.” He said that since the government downloaded planning to school boards, the provincial union has given more authority to its locals and told the government it is prepared to approve local changes to the central collective agreement “where that is constructive.”

He added that Mr. Lecce’s “efforts to continue to blame the unions for his incompetence are frustrating and counterproductive.”

Leslie Wolfe, president of OSSTF Toronto, said the government is simply looking to shift blame, especially as parents and educators grow more anxious about the return to school.

“The problem is this government has tried to create a school reopening plan on the cheap,” Ms. Wolfe said.

Educators use preparation time to plan lessons, mark assignments, liaise with special-education teachers, respond to parents and even to help individual students. Elementary teachers receive 240 minutes every five days. High-school teachers receive 75 minutes a day, although some of that time could be used to cover a class for an absent teacher or supervise cafeterias or hallways.

A draft discussion document on reopening that circulated between the government, school boards’ association and the unions earlier this month included some language on preparation time.

The document, marked confidential and obtained by The Globe and Mail, said that in some circumstances, teachers could be asked to use prep time to cover for absent staff.

“Lost preparation time can be ‘paid back’ and it is noted that an extended period of time may be required to compensate for the lost preparation time,” the document said.

The summer of COVID-19 has been screen-soaked. From virtual camps and online summer school to chatting with friends and engaging in endless hours of gaming, the onslaught of screens on children has been relentless and, to a large extent, unavoidable.

But come September, when the new school year begins, tech habits will need to be recalibrated. “This is a great time to rewire our kids’ brains and create new healthy pathways for the use of technology,” says Dr. Shimi Kang, addiction psychiatrist, speaker and author of The Tech Solution. “Take food, for instance. In the beginning of the pandemic, we let go a little – stress eating, snacking, etc. – but quickly realized that this is not sustainable, that it is unhealthy for us in the long run. Similarly, after having loosened up on the rules around technology and screen time, we now need to scale back the use of junk tech, especially by our kids.”

In her book, she cites examples from sessions with her own patients and explains how screen consumption affects adolescent brains. She also offers practical strategies that parents and caregivers of children can adopt to augment the benefits of good tech. “Parents always talk about setting time limits for tech usage or banning tech for long periods of time. This simply won’t work, more so now since tech has completely embedded our lives. We need to move from screen time to screen quality. We need to understand what screen consumption is doing to us at a biological level, to our brains and bodies,” she says.

Kang outlines a plan that aims to rebalance tech consumption using the metaphor of a diet. The steps involve motivating your child to make a change in their tech habits, guiding them through the process and finally taking inventory and celebrating their efforts. But Kang acknowledges that every family will respond to the strategy differently based on its unique challenges.

“In general, it takes a certain amount of time – 21 to 90 days – to change our habits … the science differs. The point is to establish an understanding that it takes time to move off certain neuro-trails, rewire our brains and move on to healthier habits. Change is a process. We know that when we are making a behavioural change, the first response is to be in denial. Then with more information, we start to contemplate that maybe there are benefits to this change, we then prepare for change, implement it, we also relapse but then get back,” she says.

Here are Kang’s top strategies from The Tech Solution.

Talk to kids about toxic tech

Just like you talk to your child about the benefits of healthy food for their bodies and minds, speak to them about how the kind of tech they consume affects the way they feel and behave. Engaging negatively on social media, sexting, constantly looking for online validation from peers and cyberbullying are all examples of toxic tech and need to be dealt with firmly. “We block all potential gambling and pornography sites, and with our older kids I frequently check in and discuss the toxicity of FOMO, online comparisons and unintentional multitasking,” says Kang.

Limit junk tech

Scrolling mindlessly on Snapchat or constantly checking likes on Instagram are classic examples of indulging in junk tech. “When it comes to tech, there is no regulation around it. On one side of the screen is a child’s brain, which is underdeveloped ... the other side of the screen is the most sophisticated neuroscience known to us. The persuasive design of the platforms, apps and devices we use are intended to capture their attention and keep it. I suggest that parents discuss, limit and monitor video games and social media until their child seems able to regulate their own use of it,” says Kang. For parents of kids with learning differences and vulnerabilities, there’s co-morbidities like anxiety and depression that are connected to gaming addictions.

Encourage healthy tech

Kids, especially pre-teens and older, crave peer and social connection, indulge in risk-taking behaviours and seek novel experiences. Tech can be used smartly to satisfy all these propensities. “Teachers and parents will have to get creative with the tasks they assign to them – getting them to take risks and learn new things, write an essay in a different way, create a video project using tech, there’s so much that technology can do from an innovation standpoint. With healthy tech you allow yourself to care, make meaningful connections with people and are able to be creative. You can be flexible and let your kids enjoy exploring the world online as long as their time is balanced with other healthy real-life habits,” says Kang.

After years of research and hard work, this summer I was promoted to full professor by Brock University. It’s ironic that this progress for a visible minority happened during the “great pause” of COVID-19, and when society was finally – remarkably – awakened to racism by the killing of George Floyd.

Like a lot of people in these never-before-seen times, I took a long look in the mirror. How could this be happening? I had been in academia for a quarter-century and thought I was making a difference. How to find hope now? Just because I had “made it” in academia? What next?

Incidentally, my research is on brain and language, which means I could be in either linguistics or psychology departments. Out of curiosity, I did a web search of those department types at major Canadian universities. My search revealed that just a handful of full professors at those schools are both female and non-white. That reality alone says, “Houston, we have a problem.”

Words can heal and words can hurt – one minority doctor’s experience

Nevertheless, I do have hope.

July 5 was Gurupurnima, a day in Indian culture that celebrates one’s teachers (a guru is one who removes darkness, or a teacher; Purnima means full moon). My son had just completed a week-long tabla (Indian drum) workshop given by a McGill University music faculty member (online, thanks to COVID-19). The workshop ended with a lovely Gurupurnima ritual, where the instructor patiently explained the significance of each step, such as how to use incense and where to place it.

Here’s the thing: The instructor, Shawn, was not of Indian origin. He explained how to perform the ritual as taught to him by his guru, a renowned virtuoso from India. And there I was, a granddaughter of a Sanskrit guru, learning about this ritual on Zoom. I chuckled on the inside at this beautiful reminder that a unique feature of our human brains (other than our neurocognitive ability to use language) is that we can be flexible with social identity. We can have, and adapt to, more than one. In fact, if we simply (and figuratively) look in our own backyards, we know this to be true. We each have two parents, and so we each have extended family on either side, two groups with whom we likely interact just a bit differently. And yet, we love them equally (for the most part) and are always ourselves with them.

This idea of multiple identities, being able to belong to different tribes, is an important facet of ourselves to remember as we traverse these extraordinary times.

I’ve always been aware of my several cultural identities, thanks to being from Quebec, having parents from India, and studying and working in the U.S. in my 20s. In fact, I would have to say that being aware of my different identities has always helped me navigate difficulty.

But the way in which I was formally introduced to my “other” identity was a bit of shock.

On my first day of kindergarten, my parents sat me down at the kitchen table. Dad (a statistics professor at Sir George Williams University before it became Concordia) looked serious, so I got a little nervous despite still feeling excited about starting school. He said, “Don’t feel bad if you raise your hand and the teacher doesn’t call on you.”

I sat there, puzzled.

“People prefer people who look like them. And you don’t look like your teacher. She will call on the Canadian kids.” (For my parents, “Canadian” meant “white.”)

More bewilderment.

“It’s just human nature. What you have to do is work harder than everyone else, so you can be the best in your class.”

Talk about pressure. And all I wanted was to wear my new cardigan and start school.

“If you are the best in your class, your teacher can’t ignore you. This is Canada. You can make it here – if you work really, really hard. In India,” he said (keep in mind this was the 70s),“it’s about who you know, not how good you are. But not in Canada. Here, you can make it.”

Story continues below advertisement

And then, as if we’d just been idly discussing the weather, we walked to school.

Like many kids, I refused to listen to my parents. After all, I’m Canadian! I was born here! Sure, kids at the neighbourhood playground called me racist names, but they were just ignorant kids. As a five-year-old, I was convinced grown-ups would know better and do better.

Today, we are all too familiar with the term “unconscious bias.” Today, we know that, unfortunately, my dad was not entirely wrong. Still, I’m glad I didn’t take his words to heart. If I had, I might have, or would have, or could have seen racism (and its close cousin, sexism) everywhere I went.

The story of George Floyd reminds us that racism is definitely still here. But I’m here, too. I can’t give Mr. Floyd his life back; I can’t return the land my house sits on to the Haudenosaunee and Anishinaabe peoples. But as a professor, I’m at the top of a system (finally), and I have a voice. In the classroom, I will continue to call on students of all shapes and colours and backgrounds. I will continue to speak up, respectfully, when I see or hear things I disagree with, or that are simply incorrect.

And I will remember that our humanity lies in our flexibility. We have the brains for it, and due to the aftermath of George Floyd’s death, we now know we have the heart for it, too.

The elementary math update – the first since 2005 – comes one year after the province’s newly revised curriculum for the Grade 10 career studies course. That rollout has been problematic from the start, say some experts.

Launched July 2, 2019, and implemented last fall, the half-credit course represents the first time a financial literacy component has been mandatory in Ontario high schools, rather than merely slipped into elective business or accounting classes.

For Fred Masters, now a retired senior finance teacher at Resurrection Catholic Secondary School in Kitchener, Ont., that 2019 curriculum change – a culmination of countless meetings since 2016 and 29 pilot projects involving hundreds of students – meant an exciting opportunity for young people to learn real-world money management skills at school.

He should know. Before leaving teaching in 2018, Mr. Masters ran a lunchtime personal finance club for students.

“I didn’t know if anyone would give up their lunch period and listen to a teacher talk about money,” he says now. “And they came in waves. The sessions were packed. It was standing room only. Even the staff started to come.”

Now Mr. Masters is a financial literacy presenter, so when his former school board asked him last summer to create the teacher resource package for the financial literacy portion of the revised careers course, he wasn’t surprised. What did shock him was the curriculum document he had to work from.

“There were 19 course expectations in the new careers course, and only three dealt with financial literacy,” he says. “So that was just a huge missed opportunity for all students to learn key skills foundational for a successful life.”

Story continues below advertisement

What’s more, much of the financial literacy portion of the new course focuses on developing a post-high-school budget, leaving only five or six remaining hours to teach everything else. Fortunately, budgeting will be covered in Grade 8, according to the new elementary curriculum, so one hopes the students will already have basic knowledge to draw from.

Stacy Yanchuk Oleksy, director of education and community awareness for the Credit Counselling Society in Toronto, says the new high-school curriculum is a start, but would also like to see it cover topics such as how to pay bills and taxes. In other words, the boring but useful stuff – a deeper dive into what students will soon be expected to learn in grade school.

“As much as I appreciate Pythagorean theorem, I haven’t really used it too much in my everyday life,” she says. “We need to teach students really basic life skills so when they get into the world of work, they’re better prepared.”





The wish list

Fred Masters, a retired senior finance teacher and president of Masters Money Management, developed a teacher resource package for the new mandatory Grade 10 career studies course. Although the curriculum is a first step in helping students become financially literate in high school, he would like to see three further changes:

Make it mandatory for every high-school student in Ontario to take a business course before graduation. Much of the material the new Grade 10 course is missing can often be found in business classes right now. Embed financial literacy into one strand of every high-school math course. (Practical lessons in math? Bring them on.) Every student must take one personal finance course in college or university. At that age, they’re ripe to learn real-world lessons.

The prime minister shared his uncertainty during a news conference on Parliament Hill on Tuesday, only weeks before classes in Ontario and much of the rest of the country are set to resume after being suspended in the spring due to the pandemic.

""Like so many parents, that's something we are in very active discussions on,"" Trudeau said outside the House of Commons, where he announced that Parliament was being prorogued after a small cabinet shuffle.

""We are looking at what the schools' plans are, we're looking at class sizes, we're looking at how the kids are feeling about wearing masks. All my friends as parents are asking these same questions.""

A new survey by Leger and the Association for Canadian Studies suggested the majority of parents plan to send their kids to school, but that most would want classes cancelled if there is a new COVID-19 outbreak in their community.

Those results suggested many parents are torn, with 66 per cent of respondents with children saying they were worried about children returning to school but 63 per cent saying they planned to send their kids anyway.

Yet 69 per cent also felt all classes should be suspended and learning shifted back to home if there is a significant increase in COVID-19 cases in their community, with 19 per cent saying classes should continue and 12 per cent unsure either way.

The online survey of 1,510 Canadians over age 18, including 385 parents with school-aged children in their households, took place Aug. 14-16. An internet poll cannot be given a margin of error because it is not a random sample.

The results underscore the nervousness and sensitivities around the planned reopening of school, says Leger president Jean-Marc Leger, with many parents supporting the return of classes but ready to shut it down again at the drop of a hat.

""People are nervous,"" he said. ""It's a very sensitive question.""

For his part, Trudeau said the federal government is making infrastructure money available for provinces to help retrofit schools and other public buildings to help curb the spread of the novel coronavirus. But he also acknowledged the concern many parents are feeling.

""I know that lots of parents are going to be watching carefully what their local school boards' plans are,"" he said. ""There is a lot of reflection in a lot of households, including mine, as to what's going to happen when September rolls around.""

The Leger survey also found strong support among respondents with children for requiring certain protections to be taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19 at schools, including 76 per cent who said students should have to wear masks.

The result was not broken down by whether masks should be required for only high school students or students in both high school and elementary. Some provinces such as Ontario are requiring masks for students in certain grades but not others.

Eighty-four per cent of respondents with kids said teachers and school staff should be required to wear masks while 75 per cent supported temperature checks for children and 71 per cent wanted screening questionnaires.

""People are saying: 'OK, we agree. We support the government's initiative. But at the same time, you should ensure that the rules are respected at school,'"" said Leger.

Parents were more divided over what to do if a student or teacher in their kid's class tested positive for COVID-19.

While 24 per cent reported they would keep their kids home from school indefinitely, 35 per cent said they would keep them home for at least 14 days while 33 per cent indicated they would follow the advice of their school on next steps.

In less than a month, millions of kids will return to school. What do parents need to know?



Join André Picard and Nicole MacIntyre for a live Q&A on Aug. 19

Allison O’Grady decided to send her sons back to school this fall online – an option her family did not want. But with few details available about the measures being taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in her children’s classrooms in Edmonton, Ms. O’Grady felt forced to choose before she was ready.

“I’m frustrated because I’m being asked to make a really big decision, but without all the information that I need,” she said. “I have to decide by Friday which route we’re going. ... If I saw what it will look like in my kids’ school, then maybe I would feel differently.”

Parents are facing tight deadlines to choose between in-person and remote learning as educators and families try to navigate evolving guidelines for school reopenings. Timelines and options to switch learning models vary among boards, with some requiring students to lock in their decisions for as long as early 2021.

Ms. O’Grady and her husband work full time and need flexibility with school schedules to juggle jobs and family responsibilities. To send their children to school in-person – their preferred option – could require them to work from home on short notice if the school had an outbreak or a child at the school fell ill. They hope the online option will cause less disruption in their sons’ education and their work schedules.

Provincial governments have faced mounting criticism on school reopening plans. Crowded classes, poor funding for staff support and confusing policies on mask use have parents, students and teachers feeling uncertain about safety and the quality of education.

Not all students in Canada will have the option to learn online. Remote classes will be offered at all levels in Ontario and by some boards in Alberta. In British Columbia and Manitoba, parents are urging their provincial governments to provide online options.

Parents say the varying rules and deadlines are confusing. They will have some flexibility to change their minds, but some boards say switching will depend on capacity and timing.

At the Calgary Board of Education, students can move from remote to face-to-face learning in February, but are not permitted to go from in-class to online after Sept. 1. Students at Edmonton schools can switch at the beginning of each new quarter period. The board, Edmonton Public Schools, will allow students to leave in-person classrooms to work at home any time they want to, but they would have to wait until the beginning of the next quarter to join an online class. And Edmonton Catholic Schools, where Ms. O’Grady’s children are enrolled, will not allow students to switch options once school begins until the next quarter.

“If a child becomes ill or there’s a medical reason, of course, we’re going to look at that,” said Tim Cusack, deputy superintendent at ECS. “But we’re asking parents to make a firm commitment to one learning stance or the other, and that is because we need to deploy human resources to make it work.”

Parents in Ontario have a similar dilemma. The Peel District School Board – one of the largest school boards in Canada – asked parents to submit their decision by Aug. 17 and said that after the first week of school, secondary students will not have the option to change until the next quarter. Parents of students in the Toronto District School Board received automated calls last week asking them to choose a learning model, and what their decision would be in the case of current class sizes and in reduced class sizes – an option the province is not funding. The chance to switch will depend on space in classes, according to the TDSB website.

The Peel and Toronto boards did not respond to requests for comment.

While the largest school boards in both provinces have released plans for their districts – which range from 100 to 600 schools – those guidelines could be applied differently depending on classroom circumstances. But many school plans will not be available until late August, when principals and administrative staff return to work, weeks after many parents must finalize their decisions.

In many classrooms, students sit at tables in groups facing each other rather than at traditional desks. To space out seating arrangements, boards have advised schools to remove additional furniture and tools, such as shelves of books and toys, and to convert gyms, libraries and other common areas into classrooms.

The loss of educational instruction in common areas and teaching tools in classrooms could negatively affect student learning, said Dena Haber, a parent and teacher in Toronto.

Ms. Haber’s daughter is starting her first year of kindergarten in September, but it may not be at a school in the TDSB. She said the in-person setup is unsafe, with large classes, and a parent would need to be at home and available to facilitate online learning for the four-year-old, she said. With Ms. Haber returning to the classroom in September, she is considering the difficult decision of enrolling her daughter in a private school.

“I can’t put her in a room with 30 kids with poor ventilation,” she said. “And even beyond the safety issues with the pandemic, I fear the environment that I’m putting my child into.”

British Columbia said in early August that most students will return to school for full-time, in-class learning. Since then, parents have demanded remote learning options, with an online petition racking up 35,000 signatures.

Premier John Horgan said in the legislature on Friday that students and parents that are uncomfortable with the plan can opt for distance learning – an existing program that provides the provincial curriculum through online institutions. But the province would not comment on whether students will need to leave their current schools to do that, which in crowded districts could mean losing a spot if they hope to return.

Mr. Horgan added that students in Vancouver and some districts will announce hybrid plans this week that could include a blend of in-person and remote classes. To find out whether a local school will offer online learning, parents should call their district, the Premier said.

The Vancouver School Board said details of its plan will be released later this week.

The province has given B.C. school districts until Aug. 26 to communicate plans to parents.

Edmond Luk, who launched the online petition, said the short runway for decision-making and lack of remote options has his family considering homeschooling for his seven-year-old daughter, who is supposed to start Grade 3 at a French immersion school in Burnaby. But with his two senior parents at home, sending her to school with a cohort that could have as many as 60 children would put his family at risk, he said.

Mr. Luk inquired about distance learning in Burnaby, but all classes were full. Pulling his daughter out of her school would cost her a spot in one of the few institutions of its kind in the area, he said.

“The government has been very ambiguous in stating that there are options for families, but in fact there are not,” Mr. Luk said. “We’re still on the edge waiting. But if they don’t make any changes before school starts, then I would not put my daughter’s and family’s life in danger.”

""They are the foundation and the backstop for all of us,"" she says.

Reducing the numbers of people allowed on site, staggering start times and recess/lunch breaks, keeping groups small and using masks when appropriate are some of the measures that will be used in schools.

""It may be that two or three classes all start at the same time and have recess at the same time. It doesn't mean that all of those children will be intermingling every day. It means they may go for recess at the same time, but they'll be in different areas of the school yard.""

Outside classrooms will also be considered in efforts to increase ventilation and the capacity for physical distancing.

Masks will be used in contexts where physical distancing cannot be maintained, but if data on the transmission of COVID-19 in children and use of masks shows a need to adapt, that could change.

""To think of a young child, 10, 11, 12, sitting all day in a classroom with the mask on is probably not realistic,"" says Dr. Henry. ""There's lots of things that we can do to make those environment safe without requiring somebody to sit with a mask on for long periods of time.""

Grandparents involved in the care of a child, such as those who provide before or after-school care, should remain involved in the child's life following the school restart if the family feels it is safe, advised Dr. Henry.

However, she says although significant work is being done to ensure the safety of children, parents, families and teachers, she acknowledges the fear people may feel about the restart of in-class learning.

""This anxiety, this fear, this not knowing what it's going to look like in the face of a global pandemic, is perfectly normal. We are all feeling that, and I understand that.

""Schools will look different. We have to put aside what classes were like in March or even in June, and we learn from what we know about this virus and about how it spreads and about things that we can do around the world.""",393,0.8397628763550502,lifestyle

The Montreal-based French language teacher, 34, was surfing the internet one day when she came across SOS Sitter, a service that connects groups of six or seven children with a caretaker by Zoom for around an hour. Looking for a way to keep her four-year-old son, Adam, occupied over long days in lockdown, she gave a few lessons a try and quickly becoming hooked.

Tanasyuk now has Adam enrolled in a few hours of virtual care each morning, time she relishes to get her own work done.

""When I'm working, he's busy too,"" Tanasyuk says.

She's one of many young Canadian parents finding solace in creative solutions to the sudden lack of childcare ushered in by COVID-19. Virtual babysitting is one of the solutions for working parents grappling with the double demands of a day job and parenting duties.

Though Tanasyuk's son is not yet old enough for kindergarten, she doesn't plan to send him to daycare any time soon because Quebec's daily coronavirus infection rate remain higher than she'd like. She's grateful to know she has other options that work, and plans to use SOS Sitter to keep her son busy for at least part of each workday.

As an only child, it lets Adam can socialize with other children and adults — which has been a strugle for many kids with no siblings during social isolation.

""He likes to listen to others,"" Tanasyuk says. ""[The lessons offer] a lot of conversation from every kid, and he likes to hear his name. He wants to hear his name, he wants a teacher to call him, ask him if everything is good.""

Everyday, Tanasyuk sits him in front of the computer with materials SOS Sitter childcare providers have instructed her to prep in advance such as books to read, crayons for craft-themed sessions, or comprehension tools for Spanish-language lessons. Adam prefers to take his courses alone, Tanasyuk says, so she lets him enjoy his time independently while she works from another room.

Since pivoting SOS Sitter's services online at the start of the pandemic, company founder Paulina Podgorska says she's heard from a number of parents who are grateful to have pockets of free time.

""For 40 minutes at a time, parents can be free of kids and can organize the time to have that important meeting, call the client, talk to the boss ... whatever they need,"" Podgorska says.

Her company currently offers group sessions at $12 per time-slot, with discounted rates for sessions bought in bulk, but she's working on orchestrating one-on-one sessions at a slightly higher fee.

Virtual care rates are slightly more affordable than traditional in-person babysitting, which typically hovers at around $15 an hour, primarily because the time and travel are cut from the equation, Podgorska says.

To Tanasyuk, the cost is worth it for parents who have the extra budget.

""I would recommend it,"" she says. ""It's an opportunity to continue to learn while being at home.""

Though it's too soon to say whether school reopenings across the country will affect demand for services like SOS Sitter, Podgorska remains hopeful that parents will continue to rely on virtual babysitting to break up evenings, weekends or days off.

""There are so many situations when [school is not necessarily] closed, but the child is at home today,"" Podgorska says. ""This service covers the need.""

Elize Shirdel, founder of Toronto-based virtual daycare platform HELM Life holds a similar views. She sees her service, which offers virtual daycare sessions for $9 each, as ""a component of a rounded childcare strategy.""

A working parent herself, Shirdel admits she was originally skeptical about increasing screen time for her children. But after realizing that time spent learning via computer has a far different effect on young minds than recreational activities, she eagerly recommends remote learning to other millennial parents.

""When I put my kids in front of YouTube, or Netflix ... that gets me back grouchy kids,"" Shirdel says. ""But when they do an online activity it's different. They spend a little while drawing and creating and talking and playing, then we get back happy kids.""

Podgorska, too, believes technology can be an advantageous learning tool; she recalls the early days of the pandemic, when SOS Sitter had just launched its online services. She was surprised to learn quickly that Zoom came intuitively to even young children.

""We were so new to this whole thing: I was new to the virtual babysitting, my teachers were new, parents were new, and kids were new,"" Podgorska says. ""Guess which one took [it] on the best and the quickest? The kids.""

“Previously students would come back into class, usually with their previous year's teachers, and wait a few days for school to be organized for the coming school year,” Fleming said in the legislature. “We can't do that in a pandemic. That would not be in compliance with the BCCDC guidelines.”

Darren Danyluk, president of the BCPVPA, told the Richmond News if students and staff all arrive on Sept. 8, they won’t necessarily have been briefed in COVID-19-related safety protocols.

He added it could prove to be “very challenging” if there is no time before Sept. 8 to plan how to restart school during a pandemic.

“If we don’t get together as a team beforehand, how do (teachers) know their tasks, their roles,” Danyluk said.

The Richmond District Parents Association (RDPA) president Dionne McFie said they’ve heard many families are concerned about sending their kids back on Sept. 8. in groups of 60 or 120 and many have said they’d like to see a hybrid model for learning as an option.

“From what I’ve heard, there’s not a lot of support for going back,” McFie told the News on Monday before the minister’s announcement.

Fleming said the announcement coming in a few days will outline what Sept. 8 will be like for support staff, administration and teachers to make sure students are “organized into the classes where they will be with their peers in a unit that is designed to limit the student interactions.”

But what if the parents are separated or divorced and disagree on whether to send junior back to school or not? What happens then?

To find out more, The Chief caught up with Chantal Cattermole, a senior family lawyer with Vancouver firm Clark Wilson LLP.

What follows is an edited version of that conversation.

Q: If parents have an agreed-upon parenting regime — like a court order or an agreement — but looking at back to school during COVID-19, one parent wants to homeschool and the other wants the kids back in the classroom, what happens then?

A: If they can't negotiate something between them or with a mediator, then it is for the courts to decide. It is always about looking at the best interest of the child. The parents have to evaluate that. Does the child have specific health concerns that would make them compromised if they were going back? If there are, and one parent doesn't want to send him or her back, I think there would have to be third party evidence confirming that the child can't go back. Often, when it is health-related, you would need third party evidence to speak to why or why not the child could go back.

Q: How do you know what is in the best interest of the child? That is likely what both parents think they are doing.

A: Is your child immunocompromised to the point you would weigh that above the educational and social aspects of school or are the social and educational aspects greater or more important than the potential risk?

Maybe the child isn't immunocompromised and maybe it is just a parent who has some recognizable and fair concerns about the child returning to school with the current plan. You have to weigh those concerns with the other concerns, which would be, the child would not be educated [the same] or have access to the same programs. If the parents can't agree, they would have to consider going to the courts, mediation, or arbitration.

If the child is with the parent who doesn't want to send him to school when school starts, and the parent refuses to send him, the other parent may have to get an order compelling the child to attend school or compelling the child to return to their home and attend school with them.

Q: These are decisions that would have to be reached by the courts quickly, though, and the justice system seems to move slowly, so what is the timeline?

A: You would have to make an urgent application to the court. It is not appropriate for your child to miss out on an education, so the parent would have to make immediate arrangements to get some distance learning materials.

If you were the one applying for the child to not go to school, and you were making that application, you are going to need third party evidence with that application that supports your request.

If the courts say the child has to go, then the child has to go back.

If junior is refusing to go, and/or a parent is refusing to send them, then the police will be called, and junior will attend with the police. And it can go further and maybe the Ministry of Children and Family Development is called and the child is removed and taken to the other parent's home. It becomes a horrific mess.

Q: Back to the best interest of the child, at what age do kids have a say in whether they go back to school, or not?

A: I don't think the child really gets to have a say until they are of legal age to do so, which is 16 for schooling.

Q: And of course, there are costs associated with this legal process?

A: Yes. If you don't have a lawyer, you would pay the filing fees associated with bringing an application, if you have an existing claim. If you don't have an existing claim and you are filing a claim right away, you would likely file in provincial court and there would be a filing fee associated with that.

For legal fees, there are pro bono (without charge) programs available. Some law firms have them, as we do. If the firm doesn't then the person could apply for legal aid.

Q: With COVID-19, are you seeing a lot of parents coming to lawyers to change agreements?

A: Not so much, because I think it is still up in the air. I think people are still bumbling along, trying to figure out what is going to happen with COVID. At the early onset, in March and April, we had a lot where parents were trying to not participate in the regular parenting schedule, and saying that the other house was compromised, that kind of thing.

At the early stages, there was a lot of withholding of parenting time between people. But the court held first in Ontario and then in B.C. saying that unless there are specific reasons, they should abide by the parenting schedule and the houses should follow COVID-19 safety plans.

I haven't seen long-term agreements being changed.

“We all have to take a deep breath and be patient and let that planning take time to occur.”

With a month to go before school starts, Mooring said planning is well underway with steering committees and working groups developing plans for back to school.

Mooring was one of the first critics of B.C.’s back-to-school plan in July, calling out the province for lack of consultation on cohort groups of 60 and 120 and seeking a phased in re-start.

But with Wednesday’s announcement that students won’t be back in class until Sept. 10 for orientation with school staff meeting Sept. 8 to firm up plans with their health and safety committees, Mooring is more optimistic about the direction schools, including 70 facilities in School District 43, will be taking.

That’s not to say she doesn’t have concerns.

Large school districts, such as School District 43, B.C.’s third largest, were facing crowded conditions before the pandemic, bringing in portables to stem the overflow.

Now, with COVID-19 requiring two metres of separation, how will classes of 30 students, the legislated maximum for Grades 4-12, keep people apart?

“We see a need for class density to be reduced so physical distancing is able to occur.”

That could mean some creative thinking for spreading out larger classes and Mooring said some districts may have to find available space.

Could that mean holding a class in a school gym?

“Districts will need to look at that,” Mooring said. “It’s not the same everywhere. We need to do our best.”

Within cohort groups of 60 staff and students at elementary and 120 at secondary contact will be avoided but a “a two-metre physical distance does not need to be maintained,” according to detailed information provided by the province.

However, Mooring says she’s looking forward to see what steering and working committees dealing with the plan will come up with on classroom formation.

Another issue is the availability and use of personal protective equipment.

Mooring said the province is making masks and face shields available for teachers and masks for students but it’s not clear when they should be worn, Mooring said, other than in situations where physical distancing can’t be maintained.

“We know they’re required on buses and hallways currently, but we think more needs to be done in that regard.”

With more information coming from the federal government on mask wearing for children, Mooring hopes the protocols can be fine-tuned.

BRITISH COLUMBIA

British Columbia has laid out its plan for studies to resume in ""learning groups"" this fall. School districts are to post final back-to-school details online by Aug. 26.

Back to class: Schools were initially scheduled to welcome students back full time on Sept. 8, but the province announced it is pushing back the restart date by two days to Sept. 10.

Groups: Students will be sorted into learning groups to reduce the number of people they come in contact with. For elementary and middle school students, groups will be no larger than 60 people. Secondary school groups will be capped at 120.

Physical distancing: Students and staff don't need to maintain physical distancing within their learning group, but contact should be minimized. Outside the group, physical distancing is required. Students should be more spaced out in classrooms.

Masks: Students and staff will not be required to wear masks in schools, but the province says it's a ""personal choice that will always be respected."" It says provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry recommends non-medical masks be worn by adults and older students when they are unable to physically distance like in hallways and on buses.

New routines: The province is urging schools to stagger recess, lunch and class transition times and take students outside whenever possible.

Transportation: Middle and high school students are asked to wear masks on buses. Students should be assigned seats, and a transparent barrier may be used to separate the driver.

Back to class: School will be back in session with extra safety measures, but the province says there are programs to support remote and alternative learning.

Groups: Schools should sort students into cohorts by class when possible to minimize contact with others.

Physical distancing: Physical distancing is recommended when possible. Rooms should be rearranged to increase space between desks.

Masks: Masks will be mandatory for staff and many students in some school settings. Students in Grades 4 to 12 must wear masks in all common areas, such as hallways and on buses.

SASKATCHEWAN

Saskatchewan first unveiled a set of back-to-school guidelines in June, but released more details Aug. 4.

Back to class: Students will return to class on Sept. 8 after the province pushed the date back from as early as Sept. 1

Groups: Groups of students and staff members assigned to them should stick together throughout the day and try not to mingle with other groups. Schools should aim to minimize the number of different instructors who interact with students throughout the day.

Physical distancing: Officials say maintaining physical distance is ""less practical"" for younger children, and the focus should be on limiting physical contact. Officials suggest limiting hugs and hand holding and suggest using alternative greetings such as air high fives. Schools are also to have dedicated quarantine areas where symptomatic students can go before they are picked up by parents.

Masks: The province says it's up to school boards to decide whether to make masks mandatory for students and staff. The chief medical health officer advises Grade 4 to 12 students should wear them in busy areas such as hallways and on buses.

MANITOBA

The Manitoba government says students are going back to the classroom on Sept. 8 with new guidelines.

Back to class: All students from kindergarten to Grade 8 are to have in-class instruction five days a week. High school students will also be in class full time, however, there may be some days of remote learning.

Groups: When physical distancing isn't possible, students will have to be organized into cohorts of no more than 75, and minimize contact with others. In these cases, there must be at least one metre between their desks.

Physical distancing: The province says students are required to maintain a two-metre distance to ""the greatest extent possible."" When it isn't possible, physical barriers may be an option. Spaces should be arranged to encourage separation.

Masks: Masks are strongly recommended for students in Grades 5 to 12. They are required when taking the bus.

Transportation: Masks are required for students Grade 5 and up, as well as drivers, on buses. Parents are encouraged to transport their children to school if they can.

New routines: Lunch and recess are to be staggered to minimize congestion, and in many cases teachers will change classrooms instead of students.

ONTARIO

Ontario students will be back in class September, but their schedules and class sizes may vary depending on where they live.

Back to class: Elementary students and many high schoolers will be in school five days a week in standard class sizes. However, secondary students at two dozen boards that are higher risk will only attend class half the time, and will spend the rest of the week working on ""curriculum-linked independent work."" Parents will also have the option to keep their kids out of class, and boards must provide options for remote learning.

Groups: For high schoolers in high-risk districts, class sizes will be capped at 15. Meanwhile, elementary students won't be broken up into smaller groups, but will be grouped into cohorts and their exposure to different teachers will be limited.

Physical distancing: While Education Minister Stephen Lecce said the aim is to keep students one metre apart from each other, a guidance document says only that schools should promote ""as much distancing as possible"" rather than being strictly enforced.

Masks: Masks will be mandatory for students in Grades 4 through 12, and will be strongly encouraged for younger kids when they're in indoor common areas. Staff will be expected to wear masks.

Transportation: Some school boards may have more than one student assigned to a seat. When physical distancing isn't possible, masks will be mandatory for students in Grades 4 to 12, and younger students will be encouraged but not required to do the same.

New routines: Students in some districts will have to pre-register for in-person schooling. Some schools may limit or even ban visitors, including parents. Breaks will be scheduled to allow students to wash their hands.

QUEBEC

All elementary and high school students in Quebec will be required to attend class in September unless they have a doctor's note indicating they're at high risk of COVID-19 complications or they live with someone at risk. Those students will be allowed to study remotely.

Back to class: Class attendance is mandatory for elementary and high school students. For Grades 10 and 11, schools have the option of alternating schedules where students attend one day out of every two — as long as schools cannot maintain stable classroom bubbles. Grade 10 and 11 students are encouraged to attend classes as much as possible.

Groups: Each classroom will be its own bubble and students will not be required to maintain a two-metre distance between classmates.

Physical distancing: Students will need to keep a two-metre distance from all school staff, as well as all other students outside their classroom bubble. There are no physical distancing requirements for children or teachers in pre-school.

Masks: All students in Grade 5 and up — as well as all school staff — must wear a mask inside all common areas of the school except the classroom. Masks can also be removed when students are eating.

Transportation: No more than 48 students will be allowed on a school bus, with no more than two students sitting on the same bench. Preschool and elementary school students are strongly encouraged to wear masks, while older students are required to wear them.

New routines: When schools return in the fall, teachers will move from classroom to classroom, but students will stay put.

Backup plans: In the event of an outbreak in one class, the entire classroom bubble will be sent home to continue studies remotely. Authorities are also putting together an emergency protocol in the event of a second wave to ensure instruction continues online if entire schools are again forced to close. Ideas include quickly distributing tablets or laptops to students needing them and establishing a digital platform to continue courses and maintain communication.

NEW BRUNSWICK

The province has outlined a set of requirements schools must follow in developing their plans for the fall.

Back to class: Students in kindergarten to Grade 8 are to attend school full time, while those in Grades 9 to 12 are to be taught using a combination of in-class and remote instruction. At-home course work can include online learning, guided projects and experiential education.

Groups: For kindergarten through Grade 2, group sizes will be reduced to about 15, wherever possible. Group sizes should also be shrunk for Grades 3 to 5. Grades 6 to 8 will resume at regular class sizes. Students in Grades 9 to 12 will not be grouped because of their schedules and course options.

Physical distance: Grade 9 to 12 classrooms are required to maintain a one-metre distance, while a two-metre distance is recommended in common areas at all grade levels.

Masks: All students will be required to bring a mask to school, but masks will not be mandatory inside the classroom. Students in Grade 6-12 must wear masks on the school bus and in common areas of school buildings, while children in kindergarten to Grade 5 are encouraged to do so. Teachers for kindergarten to Grade 8 can choose whether they want to wear a mask or shield in the classroom while teachers for Grades 9-12 will be required to wear one when they cannot physically distance from students.

Transportation: Curtains will be installed inside school buses to separate drivers from students. If physical distancing is not possible, drivers will be required to wear a mask or face shield. Students must sit in the same seat every day. Students in kindergarten to Grade 5 will sit alone or with a member of their household. Students in Grades 6-12 wearing masks will sit two to a seat, and if they are sitting alone or with a member of their household, they do not have to wear a mask.

New routines: Arrivals, breaks and lunches are to be staggered. Public access to school buildings will be limited, and students, staff and visitors may also be subject to screening. High school students will be expected to have their own laptop or similar device, and some subsidies will be available. Drinking fountains will be replaced with water bottle-filling stations.

PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND

Schools on the Island are preparing to welcome all students back to class, while drafting backup plans for remote studies if required.

Back to class: Schools are to reopen for teachers and staff on Sept. 1 and for students on Sept. 8.

Groups: Students will be organized into cohorts when possible and limit their exposure to others.

Physical distancing: Students will be taught about the importance of physical distancing, and extra teaching and cleaning staff may be hired. Schools are also asked to reduce class sizes as much as possible, reconfigure classrooms and make use of spaces such as libraries and multipurpose rooms.

Masks: The province says all staff and students in Grades 7-12 are ""strongly recommended"" to wear masks when physical distancing cannot be maintained. Students from kindergarten through Grade 6 may wear masks when physical distancing is impossible. Staff interacting with children who have complex medical needs are strongly recommended to wear face shields and gloves.

Transportation: Parents are asked to take their kids to school whenever possible. To reduce the number of riders on buses, schools may add vehicles and routes or implement walk-to-school programs. It is strongly recommended that all students and drivers wear masks on the bus.

New routines: P.E.I. education authorities are revising curricula for this school year to make up for learning gaps caused by lockdown constraints. Schools will stagger schedules to minimize congestion. The provincial school food program will be expanded next year in keeping with public health precautions. Elementary school students will stay in their classrooms for lunch.

NOVA SCOTIA

Education Minister Zach Churchill says the province's objective is for schools to return to 100 per cent capacity in the fall, but its plan includes measures to address the possible onset of a second wave of COVID-19.

Back to class: The province aims to have all elementary and high school students in classrooms by Sept. 8.

Groups: Students will be asked to keep to cohorts.

Physical distancing: Students and staff will be encouraged to maintain a two-metre distance whenever possible. Lecture rooms will be reorganized to increase space between desks.

Masks: All students in grades 4 to 12 will be required to wear a mask inside schools except when seated at desks that are two metres apart and facing the same direction. Masks must be worn in hallways and other common areas if a two-metre distance cannot be maintained. All students and staff will receive two free cloth masks. Disposable masks will be available if a student loses theirs or comes to school without one.

Transportation: Students who take the school bus will be required to wear non-medical masks.

New routines: Only students and staff will be permitted to enter school buildings. When possible, teachers will be asked to move their classes outdoors. Students will be asked to bring their own computers to school, and the province says it has acquired an additional 14,000 devices for those with limited access to technology. The ventilation systems of each school will be assessed to ensure the equipment is operating properly.

Backup plans: If a COVID-19 outbreak occurs during the academic year, schools will move to a blended learning model with smaller class sizes and home learning for older students.

---

NEWFOUNDLAND AND LABRADOR

The province's back-to-school plan aims to maximize in-class attendance with the option of a return to remote learning if the COVID-19 risk increases.

Back to class: The province's plan outlines three scenarios — in-class instruction, remote learning or a combination of both, depending on the COVID-19 risk in a particular community.

Groups: Cohorting by class is recommended when it's feasible, but students' schedules shouldn't be disrupted to support smaller groupings.

Physical distancing: Schools should aim to create a two-metre distance between desks, or as much distance as possible. However, provincial authorities say these precautions should not interfere with the daily school routine, and strict physical distancing should not be ""over-emphasized"" to children, because it is not practical and can cause psychological harm.

Masks: The province does not recommend masks for children, but says their use should not be ""stigmatized"" for those that choose to wear them. Staff will not be required to wear masks if physical distancing is possible.

Transportation: It will be up to school districts to determine their transportation operations, considering precautions such as assigning seats and separating the driver with a physical divider.

New routines: All students must bring their own supplies in keeping with a ""no sharing"" policy.

Backup plans: In the event of moderate-to-widespread transmission of COVID-19, school districts will move to online learning. Classroom attendance should be limited to about 50 per cent when the COVID-19 risk in a community is considered low to moderate. Newfoundland and Labrador says it will spend $20 million to purchase laptops for teachers and students in Grades 7 through 12 to support remote learning.

YUKON

The territorial government says it's making plans for the next school year that include flexibility around the number of students in classes if there's a second wave of COVID-19 or increased risk of transmission. It says each school will determine how it will adjust its operations to meet those guidelines, and school principals and staff are expected to share that information prior to September.

Back to class: Preliminary plans indicate that in rural communities, all students will return to school full time. In Whitehorse, however, kids in kindergarten through Grade 9 will return to full-day in-school instruction, while Grades 10 to 12 will spend half their day in the classroom, and the rest learning remotely.

Groups: Class sizes may be smaller to meet safety restrictions.

Masks: Wearing masks is a personal choice.

Transportation: Bus school and schedules will be posted to the territory's website.

New routines: Schedule shakeups may mean that some students won't have their regular teacher or the same classmates. School meal programs may be adapted with new safety measures and pickup options.

Backup plans: The territory has outlined a spectrum of school options if the risk to the community increases, ranging from rotating schedules to suspension of face-to-face learning.

NORTHWEST TERRITORIES

All N.W.T. schools have submitted plans to reopen their doors this fall. The territory says education authorities are taking a flexible approach in their planning to account for a potential second wave of COVID-19 in the fall.

Back to class: While plans will vary from school to school, the territory will offer in-person instruction whenever possible, while ensuring alternative options are available.

Groups: Students in kindergarten through Grade 6 will be in classroom ""bubbles,"" and won't have to practise physical distancing within these groups.

Physical distancing: For Grades 7 to 9, students are asked to maintain a one-metre distance from each other, and two-metre distance from staff. Grade 10 to 12 students are asked to allow for two metres of distance from their peers and instructors.

Masks: Students of all ages may be required to wear masks in situations where physical distance cannot be practised, such as moving through the hallways.

Transportation: There may be changes to bus schedules, and all riders will be required to wear masks.

New routines: More time will be spent learning outside. School hours and schedules may also look different. Students are asked to label personal items and not share.

Backup plans: The territory says schools are preparing to shift between in-person, distance and blended learning at short notice should there become active COVID-19 cases.

---

NUNAVUT

The territory has released a four-stage plan for reopening schools based on the risk of the novel coronavirus in a community.

Back to class: There are no reported COVID-19 cases in Nunavut, so all schools are set to reopen this fall with enhanced cleaning and safety precautions.

Groups: It is recommended that schools cohort students by class and limit mixing as much as possible.

Physical distancing: Distance requirements will depend on what stage a community is in, and will primarily be achieved by limiting school attendance.

Masks: In most cases, the use of masks is not recommended for children. If there are exceptions, parents will be notified, and masks will be provided.

Transportation: As it stands, bus schedules are set to resume. Students older than 13 may be required to wear masks.

New routines: Group activities will be limited. Students won't be allowed to share food in lunchrooms.

Backup plans: The territory says schools could go part-time if contact tracing were to identify a possible source of COVID-19. All schools would be closed if community transmission were to take place.

Rob Fleming said Wednesday that the gradual restart will give students and staff added time to familiarize themselves with health-and-safety measures aimed at controlling the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Staff will meet with schools’ health-and-safety committees beginning Sept. 8 to give staff the time to adjust to new routines and finalize lesson plans.

“We arrived at the two days after discussions with all the leaders of all the major partner groups in B.C.,” Fleming said on Wednesday. “This is the best scenario, I think, to continue to build the confidence and familiarity with the protocols that are in place.”

He said outdoor education will play a large role in the first two months of classes and emphasized the importance of students returning to schools to continue their education.

“We can’t sacrifice 18 months of education — we have to learn how to do things safely during this pandemic,” Fleming said. “That’s why we’ve developed and evolved the guidelines to maximize the return to in-class instruction.”

He acknowledged that some parents will not feel comfortable sending their kids back to school and the province’s distributed learning centres would help those who have concerns.

School districts will individually set the hours of the first two days back in school, Fleming added.

Premier John Horgan said he understands the concerns some people have about reopening schools.

“I absolutely get that there is anxiety in the community,” he said. “It’s not just about K-12 — for many people it’s extremely difficult and filling them with anxiety to go to the grocery store to get their basic needs filled on a weekly basis.

“We are in a global pandemic, we need to be cautious, we need to be aware. We don’t want to be fearmongers, but we want people to recognize that there is no immunity at this point in time, there is no vaccine at this point in time.”

Measures such as physical-distancing, frequent hand-washing and limiting contacts remain important, Horgan said. “That sounds counter to opening up our K-12 system but we, unlike every other jurisdiction in North America, have the benefit of a month of activity in June that has allowed us to shape what we believe the fall can look like,” he said. “We have taken a pause to allow educators to get into the schools and prepare for the first two days of the school year.”

Going back to school is a memorable occasion each September, Horgan said.

“This is an extraordinary time,” he said of life during the pandemic. “Our children are going to be extraordinary because of this time we’re living in.”

Horgan said adjustments will be made “as required” during the school year, while recognizing that every school and every district are different.

“As I’ve said repeatedly, what’s needed in Salmon Arm is not the same as what’s needed in Saanich or Salmo in the Kootenays.”

Greater Victoria Teachers’ Association president Winona Waldron was pleased with the prospect of more lead time for teachers but said she is disappointed that only two days have been allocated. More time is needed for “walk-through planning” to acclimate teachers to new ways of doing things, she said.

She suggested having more preparation time at elementary schools during the first week, along with a staggered start for the students.

Secondary schools should have their openings delayed for a week, Waldron said. “They’re going to have to rework the whole schedule.”

She said the system that sees secondary students attend four classes per semester won’t work in the current situation because they would come in contact with too many people.

“The teachers need an opportunity see how that looks,” she said.

In-person learning in B.C. was called off March 17 due to COVID-19. Optional, part-time school openings were offered in June, in part to give the province a dry run for restarting classes in September.

The government is spending $45.6 million on safety measures, including increased cleaning of high-contact surfaces, an increased number of hand-hygiene stations and boosting the availability of masks.

A government steering committee, established to help schools plan their restart, will issue operational guidelines next week on issues ranging from health and safety protocols to supporting the mental health of students.

Students will be organized into “cohorts” to reduce the number of people they come in contact with. The learning groups will be made up of about 60 people in elementary and middle schools, and about 120 in secondary schools.

MANITOBA

The Manitoba government says most students are to be back in classrooms on Sept. 8 with new guidelines to reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19.

Back to class: All students from kindergarten to Grade 8 are to have in-class instruction five days a week. High school students will also be in class full time, except in schools where there is inadequate space for physical distancing, in which case there will be some days of remote learning.

Groups: When physical distancing isn't possible, students will have to be organized into cohorts no larger than 75, and minimize contact with others. In these cases, there must be at least one metre between their desks.

Physical distancing: The province says students are required to maintain a two-metre distance to ""the greatest extent possible."" When it isn't possible, physical barriers may be an option. Spaces should be arranged to encourage separation.

Masks: Masks are not required for students or staff.

Transportation: Buses will be running at reduced capacity, and parents will be asked to transport their children to school if they can.

New routines: Lunch and recess are to be staggered to minimize congestion, and in many cases teachers will change classrooms instead of students.

ONTARIO

Ontario students will be back in class September, but their schedules and class sizes may vary depending on where they live.

Back to class: Elementary students and many high schoolers will be in school five days a week in standard class sizes. However, secondary students at two dozen boards that are higher risk will only attend class half the time, and will spend the rest of the week working on ""curriculum-linked independent work."" Parents will also have the option to keep their kids out of class, and boards must provide options for remote learning.

Groups: For high schoolers in high-risk districts, class sizes will be capped at 15. Meanwhile, elementary students won't be broken up into smaller groups, but will be grouped into cohorts and their exposure to different teachers will be limited.

Physical distancing: While Education Minister Stephen Lecce said the aim is to keep students one metre apart from each other, a guidance document says only that schools should promote ""as much distancing as possible"" rather than being strictly enforced.

Masks: Masks will be mandatory for students in Grades 4 through 12, and will be strongly encouraged for younger kids when they're in indoor common areas. Staff will be expected to wear masks.

Transportation: Some school boards may have more than one student assigned to a seat. When physical distancing isn't possible, masks will be mandatory for students in Grades 4 to 12, and younger students will be encouraged but not required to do the same.

New routines: Students in some districts will have to pre-register for in-person schooling. Some schools may limit or even ban visitors, including parents. Breaks will be scheduled to allow students to wash their hands.

QUEBEC

All elementary and high school students in Quebec will be required to attend class in September unless they have a doctor's note indicating they're at high risk of COVID-19 complications or they live with someone at risk. Those students will be allowed to study remotely.

Back to class: Class attendance is mandatory for elementary and high school students. For Grades 10 and 11, schools have the option of alternating schedules where students attend one day out of every two — as long as schools cannot maintain stable classroom bubbles. Grade 10 and 11 students are encouraged to attend classes as much as possible.

Groups: Each classroom will be its own bubble and students will not be required to maintain a two-metre distance between classmates.

Physical distancing: Students will need to keep a two-metre distance from all school staff, as well as all other students outside their classroom bubble. There are no physical distancing requirements for children or teachers in pre-school.

Masks: All students in Grade 5 and up — as well as all school staff — must wear a mask inside all common areas of the school except the classroom. Masks can also be removed when students are eating.

Transportation: No more than 48 students will be allowed on a school bus, with no more than two students sitting on the same bench. Preschool and elementary school students are strongly encouraged to wear masks, while older students are required to wear them.

New routines: When schools return in the fall, teachers will move from classroom to classroom, but students will stay put.

Backup plans: In the event of an outbreak in one class, the entire classroom bubble will be sent home to continue studies remotely. Authorities are also putting together an emergency protocol in the event of a second wave to ensure instruction continues online if entire schools are again forced to close. Ideas include quickly distributing tablets or laptops to students needing them and establishing a digital platform to continue courses and maintain communication.

NEW BRUNSWICK

The province has outlined a set of requirements schools must follow in developing their plans for the fall.

Back to class: Students in kindergarten to Grade 8 are to attend school full time, while those in Grades 9 to 12 are to be taught using a combination of in-class and remote instruction. At-home course work can include online learning, guided projects and experiential education.

Groups: For kindergarten through Grade 2, group sizes will be reduced to about 15, wherever possible. Group sizes should also be shrunk for Grades 3 to 5. Grades 6 to 8 will resume at regular class sizes. Students in Grades 9 to 12 will not be grouped because of their schedules and course options.

Physical distance: Grade 9 to 12 classrooms are required to maintain a one-metre distance, while a two-metre distance is recommended in common areas at all grade levels.

Masks: It's unclear where the province stands on staff and students wearing masks.

Transportation: The province says it's working with school districts to develop plans for transportation. Pickup and drop-off schedules may be staggered.

New routines: Arrivals, breaks and lunches are to be staggered. Public access to school buildings will be limited, and students, staff and visitors may also be subject to screening. High school students will be expected to have their own laptop or similar device, and some subsidies will be available.

PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND

Schools on the Island are preparing to welcome all students back to class, while drafting backup plans for remote studies if required.

Back to class: Schools are to reopen for teachers and staff on Sept. 1 and for students on Sept. 8.

Groups: Students will be organized into cohorts when possible and limit their exposure to others.

Physical distancing: Students will be taught about the importance of physical distancing, and extra teaching and cleaning staff may be hired. Schools are also asked to reduce class sizes as much as possible, reconfigure classrooms and make use of spaces such as libraries and multipurpose rooms.

Masks: The province says all staff and students in Grades 7-12 are ""strongly recommended"" to wear masks when physical distancing cannot be maintained. Students from kindergarten through Grade 6 may wear masks when physical distancing is impossible. Staff interacting with children who have complex medical needs are strongly recommended to wear face shields and gloves.

Transportation: Parents are asked to take their kids to school whenever possible. To reduce the number of riders on buses, schools may add vehicles and routes or implement walk-to-school programs. It is strongly recommended that all students and drivers wear masks on the bus.

New routines: P.E.I. education authorities are revising curricula for this school year to make up for learning gaps caused by lockdown constraints. Schools will stagger schedules to minimize congestion. The provincial school food program will be expanded next year in keeping with public health precautions. Elementary school students will stay in their classrooms for lunch.

NOVA SCOTIA

Education Minister Zach Churchill says the province's objective is for schools to return to 100 per cent capacity in the fall, but its plan includes measures to address the possible onset of a second wave of COVID-19.

Back to class: The province aims to have all elementary and high school students in classrooms by Sept. 8.

Groups: Students will be asked to keep to cohorts.

Physical distancing: Students and staff will be encouraged to maintain a two-metre distance whenever possible. Lecture rooms will be reorganized to increase space between desks.

Masks: Masks are not required in classrooms, but students and staff may choose to wear them. While it's recommended that they bring their own, masks will be provided to those who don't have one. Staff and students in Grades 10 to 12 must wear masks when physical distancing is difficult.

Transportation: Students who take the school bus will be required to wear non-medical masks.

New routines: Only students and staff will be permitted to enter school buildings. When possible, teachers will be asked to move their classes outdoors. Students will be asked to bring their own computers to school, and the province says it has acquired an additional 14,000 devices for those with limited access to technology.

Backup plans: If a COVID-19 outbreak occurs during the academic year, schools will move to a blended learning model with smaller class sizes and home learning for older students.

NEWFOUNDLAND AND LABRADOR

The province's back-to-school plan aims to maximize in-class attendance with the option of a return to remote learning if the COVID-19 risk increases.

Back to class: The province's plan outlines three scenarios — in-class instruction, remote learning or a combination of both, depending on the COVID-19 risk in a particular community.

Groups: Cohorting by class is recommended when it's feasible, but students' schedules shouldn't be disrupted to support smaller groupings.

Physical distancing: Schools should aim to create a two-metre distance between desks, or as much distance as possible. However, provincial authorities say these precautions should not interfere with the daily school routine, and strict physical distancing should not be ""over-emphasized"" to children, because it is not practical and can cause psychological harm.

Masks: The province does not recommend masks for children, but says their use should not be ""stigmatized"" for those that choose to wear them. Staff will not be required to wear masks if physical distancing is possible.

Transportation: It will be up to school districts to determine their transportation operations, considering precautions such as assigning seats and separating the driver with a physical divider.

New routines: All students must bring their own supplies in keeping with a ""no sharing"" policy.

Backup plans: In the event of moderate-to-widespread transmission of COVID-19, school districts will move to online learning. Classroom attendance should be limited to about 50 per cent when the COVID-19 risk in a community is considered low to moderate. Newfoundland and Labrador says it will spend $20 million to purchase laptops for teachers and students in Grades 7 through 12 to support remote learning.

YUKON

The territorial government says it's making plans for the next school year that include flexibility around the number of students in classes if there's a second wave of COVID-19 or increased risk of transmission. It says each school will determine how it will adjust its operations to meet those guidelines, and school principals and staff are expected to share that information prior to September.

Back to class: Preliminary plans indicate that in rural communities, all students will return to school full time. In Whitehorse, however, kids in kindergarten through Grade 9 will return to full-day in-school instruction, while Grades 10 to 12 will spend half their day in the classroom, and the rest learning remotely.

Groups: Class sizes may be smaller to meet safety restrictions.

Masks: Wearing masks is a personal choice.

Transportation: Bus school and schedules will be posted to the territory's website.

New routines: Schedule shakeups may mean that some students won't have their regular teacher or the same classmates. School meal programs may be adapted with new safety measures and pickup options.

Backup plans: The territory has outlined a spectrum of school options if the risk to the community increases, ranging from rotating schedules to suspension of face-to-face learning.

BRITISH COLUMBIA

British Columbia has laid out its plan for studies to resume in ""learning groups"" this fall. School districts are to post final back-to-school details online by Aug. 26.

Back to class: Schools were initially scheduled to welcome students back full time on Sept. 8, but the province announced it is pushing back the restart date by two days to Sept. 10.

Groups: Students will be sorted into learning groups to reduce the number of people they come in contact with. For elementary and middle school students, groups will be no larger than 60 people. Secondary school groups will be capped at 120.

Physical distancing: Students and staff don't need to maintain physical distancing within their learning group, but contact should be minimized. Outside the group, physical distancing is required. Students should be more spaced out in classrooms.

Masks: Staff and students at middle and secondary schools will be required to wear masks on buses and in common areas. The provincial government says masks will also be required whenever students and teachers are outside their learning group and cannot maintain an appropriate physical distance. Students who can't wear masks for medical reasons will be exempt.

New routines: The province is urging schools to stagger recess, lunch and class transition times and take students outside whenever possible.

Transportation: Middle and high school students are asked to wear masks on buses. Students should be assigned seats, and a transparent barrier may be used to separate the driver.

NEWFOUNDLAND AND LABRADOR

The province's back-to-school plan aims to maximize in-class attendance with the option of a return to remote learning if the COVID-19 risk increases.

Back to class: The province's plan outlines three scenarios — in-class instruction, remote learning or a combination of both, depending on the COVID-19 risk in a particular community. The Newfoundland and Labrador English School District said in person classes will resume in September given low case numbers in the province and families can apply to homeschool their children.

Groups: Cohorting by class is recommended when feasible, but students' schedules shouldn't be disrupted to support smaller groupings. In the English School District, high school students will not be grouped by cohorts due to curriculum requirements.

Physical distancing: Schools should aim to create a two-metre distance between desks, or as close to that as possible. The English School District says signage will be placed inside schools reminding people about physical distancing.

Masks: Masks must be worn on school buses and in communal areas of high schools but they are not required inside classrooms. Staff will not be required to wear masks if physical distancing is possible. The province's English School District will provide two masks for each teacher and one for each student.

Transportation: Bus drivers and riders will be required to wear masks. The English School District has said bus ridership will be limited to 46 students per bus and up to 6,000 students may need to make alternate transportation arrangements.

New routines: All students must bring their own supplies in keeping with a ""no sharing"" policy. Students are advised to bring their own water bottles.

Backup plans: In the event of moderate-to-widespread transmission of COVID-19, school districts will move to online learning. Classroom attendance should be limited to about 50 per cent when the COVID-19 risk in a community is considered low to moderate. Newfoundland and Labrador says it will spend $20 million to purchase laptops for teachers and students in Grades 7 through 12 to support remote learning.

""We can't sacrifice 18 months of education,"" said Education Minister Rob Fleming at a press briefing Wednesday morning. ""We have to learn to do things safely during this pandemic.""

On the first day students are back in classrooms, they will be assigned to their class and learning group, practise new routines and how to move safely within the school and school grounds.

On Tuesday, Fleming said there would be a delay for students returning, after several groups, including the BC Teachers’ Federation, balked at a full return on the first day.

“Previously students would come back into class, usually with their previous year's teachers, and wait a few days for school to be organized for the coming school year,” Fleming said in the legislature on Tuesday. “We can't do that in a pandemic. That would not be in compliance with the BCCDC guidelines.”

The BC Principals’ and Vice-Principals’ Association had also asked for a later start date so that staff could learn what their roles were within the school.

Richmond parents had also expressed concerns about sending their kids back on Sept. 8 to the Richmond District Parents Association (RDPA), according to its president Dionne McFie.

“From what I’ve heard, there’s not a lot of support for going back,” McFie told the Richmond News on Monday before the minister’s announcement.

Education Minister Rob Fleming told reporters Tuesday that students wouldn't be expected back on the original date of Sept. 8 to help give administrators and teachers more time to prepare for education amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

On Wednesday, the ministry put out a media release saying staff will meet on Sept. 8, while students will be welcomed in classrooms by Sept. 10.

Fleming said the government and its steering committee are working to finalize how school operations will work. He said he expects operating guidelines for schools to be released next week.

“Having the restart week staged in some kind of manner that would have staff teams together for a couple days before we gradually welcome kids back to make sure that every school — all 1,500 of them in the province — are truly ready to welcome students is a good idea, and that’s the approach that we’ll be taking,” Fleming said.

In the past, students going back to class would return to their previous classrooms before moving to new ones, but he said that isn’t safe now.

“That obviously can’t happen under these pandemic conditions.”

The province said it would add $45.6 million to the B.C. COVID-19 Action Plan to help school districts and independent schools get started on the school year. The funds are for such things as better access to hand hygiene, more cleaning staff and opportunities for remote learning.

Students will be put into cohorts, or learning groups, made up of about 60 people in elementary and middle schools and about 120 in secondary school. People will interact primarily with members of their group while at school.

School administrators are currently looking at, or have started, changing the physical layout of classrooms and common areas to help students ensure social distancing is maintained, Fleming added.

The change in the start date comes after concerns were raised by the B.C. Teachers’ Federation and the B.C. Principals’ and Vice-Principals’ Association last week.

The federation called for more time to work on the return to school plan while the association for school administrators asked the government to consider a flexible classroom start date, depending on the readiness of each school.

Teri Mooring, president of the teachers’ federation, said she’s still looking for more details from the provincial government.

“The plans are still underway but there aren’t enough details and information right now for folks,” she said. “It’s understandable that there’s a high level of concern and stress about what it’ll look like in schools in September.”

Mooring emphasized that the safety of staff and students is the top priority.

Don Peterson, president of the Saanich Teachers’ Association, said that putting the start of the year off is a good step if teachers can get into the schools ahead of students.

“My biggest concern with the [back-to-school] plan is how are teachers going to be properly briefed,” he said.

Greater Victoria Teachers’ Association president Winona Waldron also likes the idea of a later school start in order to be more prepared.

“Clearly, there’s a task ahead for teachers and administrators to figure out how to set up these learning groups and to make sure that health-and-safety protocols are in place and that everybody’s familiar with what needs to be done — basically a walk-through before kids are back at school.”

Saanich School District superintendent Dave Eberwein said Tuesday afternoon that he hadn’t received anything official on the issue from the Ministry of Education.

“We’ll certainly take our direction from the ministry in terms of start-up and what they expect for that,” he said. “So if there is additional time for preparation, that’s always appreciated, and we’ll certainly make the best use of it.”

The announcement of a phased-in approach to returning to classrooms came as Health Minister Adrian Dix and provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said in a joint statement on Tuesday that community transmission of COVID-19 affects schools.

“As we look to fall, what we’ve learned from other jurisdictions is that transmission in a school setting is a reflection of what’s happening in our communities; keeping our community transmission low and slow keeps us all safe.

“And behind the scenes, public health is using contact tracing to mitigate the new growth in cases.”

There were 46 new cases in the province on Tuesday for a total of 4,111.

For years to come, every one of us Canadians will need to help the country regain its equilibrium and recover from a COVID-19 pandemic that has punished our social and economic stability.

Canada needs the bedrock of a well-educated work force if it hopes to stay competitive and innovative, and universities shoulder a big responsibility for this. But as governments try to keep up with postpandemic needs, those universities – critical as they are to our future – will face steep challenges in sustaining progressive institutions that educate Canadians and attract thousands of students and leading thinkers from around the world.

A bigger role in upholding education will fall to all of us: communities, private supporters and the general public.

Supporting universities through planned giving – earmarking a donation in one’s will – is a visionary, unselfish investment that lets just about all of us help build a better future for our communities and our nation. Brock University just witnessed a remarkable example of this, thanks to the generosity of Stephanie Mitchell and her husband, Gerry.

Their lives were the stuff of a Hollywood movie: Gerry was a high-school dropout from St. Catharines, Ont., who became a highly successful global business leader. Stephanie grew up in Toledo, Ohio. With a love of literature, books and the arts, she returned to college in her mid-40s, earning bachelor’s and master’s degrees. Her pursuit of lifelong learning inspired the gift that she generously made at the end of her life.

University wasn’t an option for Gerry, and Stephanie had to wait until mid-life for her university experience, but both have made a sharp statement about the role education must play in shaping Canada and the world.

Both also clearly understood the shrewdness of planned giving.

Growing up in the 1940s, Gerry would walk along railroad tracks picking up pieces of coal to help heat the family home. Though the Second World War pulled Canada’s economy out of the Great Depression, life was hard for the Mitchells. His dad was in poor health, driving a taxi and working factory jobs. In 1943, at 16, Gerry quit school to take a job operating machinery in a local car parts plant.

He couldn’t have known, but that day was the start of an incredible journey.

Story continues below advertisement

Gerry was observant, intuitive. By 1957, he had been made superintendent. He was named plant manager in 1959, then director of manufacturing in 1961. In 1963 he became president of Hayes-Dana – the Canadian subsidiary of Dana Corp.

By 1967 he was executive vice-president at corporate headquarters in Toledo. The next year he was named chairman of the board at Hayes-Dana, then in 1972, president and chief operating officer of the global giant Dana Corp.

In 1980, the former teenaged machine operator became chairman and chief executive officer.

He could be gruff and intimidating, but had an ability to inspire people. When visiting a factory, Gerry refused the usual corporate entourage and insisted on walking the floor by himself. Renowned for remembering names, he would ask workers for suggestions – and listen to what they said.

Gerry had a philosophy of decentralized management, pushing responsibility out to the entire organization. His core principles were integrity and trust, and he used these to drive Dana Corp. to unprecedented growth.

Well into retirement, Gerry died in 2016. Stephanie passed away last December. When their estate was executed, it emerged that the coal-picking child of the Depression was more than a clever business person. He also recognized the importance of the kind of education that his family could never afford.

Story continues below advertisement

Stephanie directed a legacy gift of $2.7-million to Brock University, which had presented Gerry with an honorary doctoral degree 40 years ago, for his leadership in building the Niagara community.

As a result of Stephanie’s gift, Brock will create the Dr. Gerald B. Mitchell Centre of Excellence in Career and Experiential Education. Because of this donation, more students will be able to pair real-world work experience with their in-class education. Under-represented groups will have greater access to work-integrated learning, and our understanding of the best ways to combine work and education will deepen.

The funds will help future students pursue their passions through grants, resources and work opportunities that let them gain experience in their chosen fields.

Gerry Mitchell never attended university, but he seized upon the importance of education, and understood that cultivating knowledge gives a nation the ability to succeed. Stephanie Mitchell deeply understood the importance of education and its transformative power.

As Canada begins to dig itself out of a pandemic, this gift to education will help strengthen our future work force.

Many educators question the value of such instruction for young children, saying it is a poor substitute for direct interaction with a teacher and peers.

In less than a month, millions of kids will return to school. What do parents need to know?



Join André Picard and Nicole MacIntyre for a live Q&A on Aug. 19

With thousands of parents opting not to send their children back to school, the biggest challenges of remote learning will be faced by the smallest students.

When the pandemic hit Canada and in-person classes were cancelled in mid-March, teachers and students of all ages were thrust into a distance learning experiment that many parents consider a failure, with little live teaching, uneven expectations and few standards.

As the first day of school approaches, the Ontario government and many Alberta school boards are allowing families worried about the risk of in-person classes to register children of any age for online learning instead. Depending on where they live, some high-school students will learn from home part of the time.

Explainer: Canada’s back-to-school plans

Ontario government clashes with teachers unions over school reopening plans

Education officials vow remote learning will be better this school year. However, it is not clear how it will work and whether teachers adopting new methods of instruction will be able to overcome the significant challenges of online schooling, especially for elementary students.

Many educators question the value of such instruction for young children, saying it is a poor substitute for direct interaction with a teacher and peers. It also typically means hours of screen time, which child-development experts caution against, does not allow young children to learn through hands-on play nor caters to their short attention spans.

“The younger you go, I think the more you need to look at what can you do offline to learn the skills, knowledge and aptitudes that you’re supposed to cover in that particular grade level,” said Michael Barbour, a professor of instructional design at Touro University California and an expert in distance education.

In order to take part in remote learning, many elementary school children, including those who need help with their work or using a computer, require a parent or caregiver to serve as a learning coach, Prof. Barbour said. As a result, the approach is not an option for many families.

“It’s really home-schooling under the direction of a teacher,” he said. “For all intents and purposes, that’s really what you’re doing.”

The Calgary Board of Education is stressing the role of parents in remote learning, warning in an update this month that the choice “requires a significant commitment from students and parents” and doesn’t “offer the same opportunities or supports as in-person learning.”

In Ontario, which is not mandating smaller class sizes, higher-than-expected numbers of families in some areas are choosing remote learning. While most school boards have not yet provided numbers, the Dufferin-Peel Catholic District School Board said last week that about 30 per cent of elementary students and 25 per cent of secondary students are already signed up for online schooling.

Under requirements that Education Minister Stephen Lecce says will create “Zoom-style classrooms,” Ontario teachers must provide five hours of “learning opportunities” a day, with at least three hours of live, synchronous learning for children in kindergarten and three hours and 45 minutes for Grades 1 through 8. Teachers must be available throughout the school day, and students will have a combination of synchronous and asynchronous activities, guided instruction, large- and small-group learning and independent work.

Michelle McKay, who taught kindergarten last year, said requiring three hours of live remote instruction a day for kindergarteners is inconsistent with the Ministry of Education’s own early years pedagogy, which focuses on play and inquiry-based learning.

“It’s not developmentally appropriate. It does not align with any type of learning that would happen in the classroom,” said Ms. McKay, who taught in the Peel District School Board and is doing her PhD at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education at the University of Toronto. “I don’t know how this is setting anybody up for success or setting young children up to love learning.”

After schools closed last spring, Ms. McKay connected with her students in regular one-on-one phone calls because they were easier for parents with more than one child sharing devices and for those who were shift workers. She also used Google Classroom to post suggestions for activities that children could do with their caregivers, including building forts, discussing the steps involved in cooking dinner and identifying numbers on neighbourhood walks.

But she said not being in the same room as her students meant she missed being involved in the process of their learning. When families sent her photos or videos of their children’s work, she had no idea how much time they had spent on the projects, whether they had struggled or if they had gotten help.

“By not being able to experience it live with a child, you’re missing tons of information,” she said.

Although remote learning is not optimal for young children, Wendy Terro, a centrally assigned principal at the Toronto District School Board, said the board is doing all it can to ensure students get a solid education even if they don’t step inside a classroom.

“We would love schools to be back to what they were at the start of last year, but in the situation we’re in, we want to provide the richest remote learning experience we can for our students,” she said.

Ms. Terro said teachers have learned a great deal since last spring, including through professional development sessions.

“It’s important to remember that when we jumped into this in March, a lot of people were starting from scratch, and there’s been tremendous growth,” she said. “As a system, we’ve learned a lot.”

Josée Beaudoin, director of Remote Network Schools, which helps isolated Quebec schools connect virtually, said the idea of providing distance education for young students was largely uncharted territory for Canadian educators when schools shut down.

“It’s new to do remote schooling at the primary level. It’s not normal,” she said. “You know, with these children so young, it was difficult to imagine how that could be done.”

Teachers assigned to remote classrooms this fall will need to be creative and develop strategies to overcome several challenges, Ms. Beaudoin said.

The first is figuring out which technology to use while setting standards for how the class will work together virtually, she said.

Remote educators also need to do detailed planning, she said, both for the material they will cover and to create a sense of community by encouraging children to interact with each other.

“At the primary level, this issue of interactions between students for learning is extremely important. So you have to plan these moments and to organize your tools to do so,” she said. “Learning is a social activity.”

In addition, teachers need to communicate with parents to share their learning plan, online schedule, expectations for independent work and links to resources.

Above all, Ms. Beaudoin said, teachers should approach remote learning with an open mind – and should not be afraid to make mistakes.

“It’s really new. So for teachers, they don’t have to be experts,” she said. “It’s learning by doing.”

It is not, as Premier John Horgan told reporters Aug. 12, a plan that is without concerns from government, which continues to say restarting in-class instruction is the right thing to do for a child’s social, academic and mental development.

“I’m excited about it,” Horgan said. “Am I apprehensive? Sure, but I think that we can go into this with the best of intentions and have the best outcomes, if we all work together.”

Horgan made those comments the day before Lisa Descary, who teaches math and science at Steveston-London secondary school in Richmond, participated in a small protest outside Health Minister Adrian Dix’s constituency office on Joyce Street in Vancouver.

She was there with other teachers, parents and a student concerned about the plan. Dix, at the time, was in Victoria with Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry releasing more COVID-19 data, announcing 78 new cases.

“It is going against everything that Dr. Bonnie Henry has told us we need to do to flatten the [epidemiological] curve,” said Descary, while holding a sign calling for smaller class sizes. “Instead of less faces in larger spaces, it’s putting more student faces in poorly ventilated, under-funded, crowded indoor spaces, and I’m terrified.”

Stacey Wakelin, who organized the protest with former Vancouver school trustee Carrie Bercic, has a son going into Grade 12 and a daughter about to start Grade 10 at R.E. Mountain secondary in Langley.

Wakelin is a coordinator of the SafeSeptemberBC.com website and Facebook group that have worked as sounding boards for parents around the province concerned about sending their children back to school.

Parents, she said, want changes to the plan, which are being voiced in a letter to Education Minister Rob Fleming. They’re asking for a two-week delay to reopen schools to better understand the guidelines, to make masks mandatory when feasible, to reduce class sizes and offer blended learning options for students.

Wakelin’s husband has contacted the Langley school district about an online option for the couple’s children, or a model similar to the one in June where students returned for a couple of days while the balance of instruction was done online.

“I would really like my kids back in school,” she said. “That’s what I’m hoping to see. My son has gone through his entire school career with a lot of these kids, and I’d like him to be able to finish it.”

The “mixed messaging” from Henry and government is what troubles Wakelin, who emphasized she has had the utmost respect for Henry and Dix until the back-to-school plan was released July 29.

“I can’t go into a store without a mask on, I can’t throw a party with more than 50 people, but we can send our kids back [to school],” she said. “I don’t get it.”

The B.C. government will spend $45.6 million to implement the plan, which includes enhanced cleaning of schools, adding hand-washing stations, providing reusable masks and other safety measures.

In recent weeks, when questions have arisen about the government’s plan, Henry has said she doesn’t “necessarily expect there to be [COVID-19] cases in schools” but that it was “inevitable there probably will be some.”

Current worldwide data on COVID-19 has shown a very low infection rate in people 19 years old and under, and even lower in children under the age of 10, according to government.

Data from Canada’s Public Health Agency shows more than 9,500 people aged 19 or younger out of 119,505 cases reviewed had tested positive for COVID-19 in the country, as of Aug. 17.

That data became available the same day the B.C. government announced that masks will be required for staff, middle and secondary students in high traffic areas such as on buses and in hallways, “or anytime outside of their learning group whenever physical distancing cannot be maintained.”

Masks will not be required in classrooms.

Henry has cautioned masks are “an additional layer on top of the other layers that we use to keep each other safe, and it is the least effective of the many layers that we have.”

Physical distancing and keeping gatherings of people small are more effective measures to prevent transmission of the disease, she said in a July 23 briefing to reporters.

The government’s plan calls for students to be placed in “learning groups” of no more than 60 at elementary and middle schools, and a maximum of 120 at high schools to reduce the number of close, in-person interactions.

It will be up to each of B.C.’s 60 school districts to tailor the plan to meet the ministry’s guidelines. That could prove challenging for districts with large school populations, most of which are in Metro Vancouver.

Sixteen high schools in the province have student populations between 1,500 and 2,000, including Terry Fox secondary in Port Coquitlam.

That’s where Josh Czeto, who lives in Pitt Meadows, is a student and looking to begin his Grade 12 year. Czeto said he doesn’t want to return, saying he would prefer an online option similar to what students transitioned to in March.

Josh Czeto and his mother Florence from Pitt Meadows attended a recent protest outside Health Minister Adrian Dix’s constituency office in Vancouver - Mike Howell



He and his mother Florence attended the rally outside Dix’s office, with Czeto saying his concern about learning in a classroom is shared by friends, who fear a return to school could lead to more transmission of COVID-19.

“One of the bigger worries with my friends is that there are these types of people in schools who don’t care about COVID, who don’t think it’s real,” he said, holding a sign calling for online schooling. “I don’t want to take that chance with the general public, to be honest. I think it’s ridiculous to make people take that chance. Seems like the only people who are not on board with this are the people who have to show up, like the teachers and the students.”

An emailed statement from the Ministry of Education was provided to Glacier Media in place of an interview with Fleming in response to concerns raised by teachers, parents and students.

The statement, which repeated most of what was announced in the back-to-school plan, emphasized that B.C. was the only jurisdiction in Canada that returned students to the classroom in June “and this has given us valuable information that we are using to develop our plans, ensuring health and safety at schools remain paramount.”

Teachers and staff are scheduled to return Sept. 8, before students arrive Sept. 10 and 11 to understand what learning during a pandemic will look like in their schools.

Jenkins said he decided against sending students home after consulting with the St. Joseph County Health Department. Instead, university officials decided steps could be taken short of closing the campus while still protecting students' health and safety.

The university is advising off-campus students not to visit the campus and on-campus students not to venture off-campus and is restricting student gatherings to 10 people or less. The university is allowing graduate student access to research laboratories and libraries. Athletic teams subject to surveillance testing can continue to gather for sanctioned activities, but will be closely monitored.

""The virus is a formidable foe,"" Jenkins said in announcing enhanced testing for students experiencing symptoms and surveillance testing for those without symptoms. ""For the past week, it has been winning. Let us as the Fighting Irish join together to contain it.""

According to Jenkins, the university has traced the spike in COVID-19 cases to off-campus gatherings where neither masks were worn nor physical distancing observed. He said students infected at those gatherings passed it on to others, who in turn passed the virus on to others, resulting in the positive cases, with all but one a student.

Jenkins asked students to help in identifying others who have been flagrantly violating safety protocols.

The action by Notre Dame follows the decision by officials of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to switch to remote learning starting Wednesday, and is making arrangements for students who want to leave campus housing. UNC officials said clusters of COVID-19 were discovered in dorms, a fraternity house and other student housing.

Coronavirus outbreaks earlier this summer at fraternities in Washington state, California and Mississippi provided a glimpse of the challenges school officials face in keeping the virus from spreading on campuses where young people gather in close quarters.

Lam - who's going into Grade 11 at Burnett secondary - said he organized the petition because he has a family member who is immunocompromised and that he is aware of fellow students in a similar position, none of whom want to risk bringing COVID-19 home.

BRITISH COLUMBIA

British Columbia has laid out its plan for studies to resume in ""learning groups"" this fall. School districts are to post final back-to-school details online by Aug. 26.

Back to class: Schools were initially scheduled to welcome students back full time on Sept. 8, but the province announced it is pushing back the restart date by two days to Sept. 10.

Groups: Students will be sorted into learning groups to reduce the number of people they come in contact with. For elementary and middle school students, groups will be no larger than 60 people. Secondary school groups will be capped at 120.

Physical distancing: Students and staff don't need to maintain physical distancing within their learning group, but contact should be minimized. Outside the group, physical distancing is required. Students should be more spaced out in classrooms.

Masks: Students and staff will not be required to wear masks in schools, but the province says it's a ""personal choice that will always be respected."" It says provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry recommends non-medical masks be worn by adults and older students when they are unable to physically distance like in hallways and on buses.

New routines: The province is urging schools to stagger recess, lunch and class transition times and take students outside whenever possible.

Transportation: Middle and high school students are asked to wear masks on buses. Students should be assigned seats, and a transparent barrier may be used to separate the driver.

---

ALBERTA

The province is planning to fully reopen schools from kindergarten to Grade 12 this fall. Measures will be tightened if an outbreak occurs and class sizes could be reduced to 20.

Back to class: School will be back in session with extra safety measures, but the province says there are programs to support remote and alternative learning.

Groups: Schools should sort students into cohorts by class when possible to minimize contact with others.

Physical distancing: Physical distancing is recommended when possible. Rooms should be rearranged to increase space between desks.

Masks: Masks will be mandatory for staff and many students in some school settings. Students in Grades 4 to 12 must wear masks in all common areas, such as hallways and on buses. Staff are required to wear masks whenever physical distancing cannot be maintained. Mask use will be optional for kids in kindergarten through Grade 3. The government says all students and staff will receive two reusable masks as part of the policy.

Transportation: Parents are asked to bring their children to school if they can. Students who take the bus will sit in the same seat every day.

New routines: Schools are advised to consider a ""no sharing policy,"" with each student bringing their own supplies. Class, lunch and recess schedules will be staggered.

SASKATCHEWAN

Saskatchewan first unveiled a set of back-to-school guidelines in June, but released more details Aug. 4.

Back to class: Students will return to class as early as Sept. 1.

Groups: Groups of students and staff members assigned to them should stick together throughout the day and try not to mingle with other groups. Schools should aim to minimize the number of different instructors who interact with students throughout the day.

Physical distancing: Officials say maintaining physical distance is ""less practical"" for younger children, and the focus should be on limiting physical contact. Officials suggest limiting hugs and hand holding and suggest using alternative greetings such as air high fives. Schools are also to have dedicated quarantine areas where symptomatic students can go before they are picked up by parents.

Masks: The province says it's up to school boards to decide whether to make masks mandatory for students and staff. The chief medical health officer advises Grade 4 to 12 students should wear them in busy areas such as hallways and on buses.

Transportation: Parents should take their kids to school when possible, and pickup and drop-offs should happen outside. Students using school transportation should be assigned seats, and a partition may be used to separate the driver.

New routines: Start times, recess, lunch and class transitions may be staggered to allow for more space for physical distancing. Schools should rearrange their classrooms to space out students. Students and staff are asked to bring hand sanitizer.

MANITOBA

The Manitoba government says students are going back to the classroom on Sept. 8 with new guidelines.

Back to class: All students from kindergarten to Grade 8 are to have in-class instruction five days a week. High school students will also be in class full time, however, there may be some days of remote learning.

Groups: When physical distancing isn't possible, students will have to be organized into cohorts of no more than 75, and minimize contact with others. In these cases, there must be at least one metre between their desks.

Physical distancing: The province says students are required to maintain a two-metre distance to ""the greatest extent possible."" When it isn't possible, physical barriers may be an option. Spaces should be arranged to encourage separation.

Masks: Masks are strongly recommended for students in Grades 5 to 12. They are required when taking the bus.

Transportation: Masks are required for students Grade 5 and up, as well as drivers, on buses. Parents are encouraged to transport their children to school if they can.

New routines: Lunch and recess are to be staggered to minimize congestion, and in many cases teachers will change classrooms instead of students.

ONTARIO

Ontario students will be back in class September, but their schedules and class sizes may vary depending on where they live.

Back to class: Elementary students and many high schoolers will be in school five days a week in standard class sizes. However, secondary students at two dozen boards that are higher risk will only attend class half the time, and will spend the rest of the week working on ""curriculum-linked independent work."" Parents will also have the option to keep their kids out of class, and boards must provide options for remote learning.

Groups: For high schoolers in high-risk districts, class sizes will be capped at 15. Meanwhile, elementary students won't be broken up into smaller groups, but will be grouped into cohorts and their exposure to different teachers will be limited.

Physical distancing: While Education Minister Stephen Lecce said the aim is to keep students one metre apart from each other, a guidance document says only that schools should promote ""as much distancing as possible"" rather than being strictly enforced.

Masks: Masks will be mandatory for students in Grades 4 through 12, and will be strongly encouraged for younger kids when they're in indoor common areas. Staff will be expected to wear masks.

Transportation: Some school boards may have more than one student assigned to a seat. When physical distancing isn't possible, masks will be mandatory for students in Grades 4 to 12, and younger students will be encouraged but not required to do the same.

New routines: Students in some districts will have to pre-register for in-person schooling. Some schools may limit or even ban visitors, including parents. Breaks will be scheduled to allow students to wash their hands.

---

QUEBEC

All elementary and high school students in Quebec will be required to attend class in September unless they have a doctor's note indicating they're at high risk of COVID-19 complications or they live with someone at risk. Those students will be allowed to study remotely.

Back to class: Class attendance is mandatory for elementary and high school students. For Grades 10 and 11, schools have the option of alternating schedules where students attend one day out of every two — as long as schools cannot maintain stable classroom bubbles. Grade 10 and 11 students are encouraged to attend classes as much as possible.

Groups: Each classroom will be its own bubble and students will not be required to maintain a two-metre distance between classmates.

Physical distancing: Students will need to keep a two-metre distance from all school staff, as well as all other students outside their classroom bubble. There are no physical distancing requirements for children or teachers in pre-school.

Masks: All students in Grade 5 and up — as well as all school staff — must wear a mask inside all common areas of the school except the classroom. Masks can also be removed when students are eating.

Transportation: No more than 48 students will be allowed on a school bus, with no more than two students sitting on the same bench. Preschool and elementary school students are strongly encouraged to wear masks, while older students are required to wear them.

New routines: When schools return in the fall, teachers will move from classroom to classroom, but students will stay put.

Backup plans: In the event of an outbreak in one class, the entire classroom bubble will be sent home to continue studies remotely. Authorities are also putting together an emergency protocol in the event of a second wave to ensure instruction continues online if entire schools are again forced to close. Ideas include quickly distributing tablets or laptops to students needing them and establishing a digital platform to continue courses and maintain communication.

NEW BRUNSWICK

The province has outlined a set of requirements schools must follow in developing their plans for the fall.

Back to class: Students in kindergarten to Grade 8 are to attend school full time, while those in Grades 9 to 12 are to be taught using a combination of in-class and remote instruction. At-home course work can include online learning, guided projects and experiential education.

Groups: For kindergarten through Grade 2, group sizes will be reduced to about 15, wherever possible. Group sizes should also be shrunk for Grades 3 to 5. Grades 6 to 8 will resume at regular class sizes. Students in Grades 9 to 12 will not be grouped because of their schedules and course options.

Physical distance: Grade 9 to 12 classrooms are required to maintain a one-metre distance, while a two-metre distance is recommended in common areas at all grade levels.

Masks: All students will be required to bring a mask to school, but masks will not be mandatory inside the classroom. Students in Grade 6-12 must wear masks on the school bus and in common areas of school buildings, while children in kindergarten to Grade 5 are encouraged to do so. Teachers for kindergarten to Grade 8 can choose whether they want to wear a mask or shield in the classroom while teachers for Grades 9-12 will be required to wear one when they cannot physically distance from students.

Transportation: Curtains will be installed inside school buses to separate drivers from students. If physical distancing is not possible, drivers will be required to wear a mask or face shield. Students must sit in the same seat every day. Students in kindergarten to Grade 5 will sit alone or with a member of their household. Students in Grades 6-12 wearing masks will sit two to a seat, and if they are sitting alone or with a member of their household, they do not have to wear a mask.

New routines: Arrivals, breaks and lunches are to be staggered. Public access to school buildings will be limited, and students, staff and visitors may also be subject to screening. High school students will be expected to have their own laptop or similar device, and some subsidies will be available. Drinking fountains will be replaced with water bottle-filling stations.

PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND

Schools on the Island are preparing to welcome all students back to class, while drafting backup plans for remote studies if required.

Back to class: Schools are to reopen for teachers and staff on Sept. 1 and for students on Sept. 8.

Groups: Students will be organized into cohorts when possible and limit their exposure to others.

Physical distancing: Students will be taught about the importance of physical distancing, and extra teaching and cleaning staff may be hired. Schools are also asked to reduce class sizes as much as possible, reconfigure classrooms and make use of spaces such as libraries and multipurpose rooms.

Masks: The province says all staff and students in Grades 7-12 are ""strongly recommended"" to wear masks when physical distancing cannot be maintained. Students from kindergarten through Grade 6 may wear masks when physical distancing is impossible. Staff interacting with children who have complex medical needs are strongly recommended to wear face shields and gloves.

Transportation: Parents are asked to take their kids to school whenever possible. To reduce the number of riders on buses, schools may add vehicles and routes or implement walk-to-school programs. It is strongly recommended that all students and drivers wear masks on the bus.

New routines: P.E.I. education authorities are revising curricula for this school year to make up for learning gaps caused by lockdown constraints. Schools will stagger schedules to minimize congestion. The provincial school food program will be expanded next year in keeping with public health precautions. Elementary school students will stay in their classrooms for lunch.

NOVA SCOTIA

Education Minister Zach Churchill says the province's objective is for schools to return to 100 per cent capacity in the fall, but its plan includes measures to address the possible onset of a second wave of COVID-19.

Back to class: The province aims to have all elementary and high school students in classrooms by Sept. 8.

Groups: Students will be asked to keep to cohorts.

Physical distancing: Students and staff will be encouraged to maintain a two-metre distance whenever possible. Lecture rooms will be reorganized to increase space between desks.

Masks: Masks are not required in classrooms, but students and staff may choose to wear them. While it's recommended that they bring their own, masks will be provided to those who don't have one. Staff and students in Grades 10 to 12 must wear masks when physical distancing is difficult.

Transportation: Students who take the school bus will be required to wear non-medical masks.

New routines: Only students and staff will be permitted to enter school buildings. When possible, teachers will be asked to move their classes outdoors. Students will be asked to bring their own computers to school, and the province says it has acquired an additional 14,000 devices for those with limited access to technology.

Backup plans: If a COVID-19 outbreak occurs during the academic year, schools will move to a blended learning model with smaller class sizes and home learning for older students.

NEWFOUNDLAND AND LABRADOR

The province's back-to-school plan aims to maximize in-class attendance with the option of a return to remote learning if the COVID-19 risk increases.

Back to class: The province's plan outlines three scenarios — in-class instruction, remote learning or a combination of both, depending on the COVID-19 risk in a particular community.

Groups: Cohorting by class is recommended when it's feasible, but students' schedules shouldn't be disrupted to support smaller groupings.

Physical distancing: Schools should aim to create a two-metre distance between desks, or as much distance as possible. However, provincial authorities say these precautions should not interfere with the daily school routine, and strict physical distancing should not be ""over-emphasized"" to children, because it is not practical and can cause psychological harm.

Masks: The province does not recommend masks for children, but says their use should not be ""stigmatized"" for those that choose to wear them. Staff will not be required to wear masks if physical distancing is possible.

Transportation: It will be up to school districts to determine their transportation operations, considering precautions such as assigning seats and separating the driver with a physical divider.

New routines: All students must bring their own supplies in keeping with a ""no sharing"" policy.

Backup plans: In the event of moderate-to-widespread transmission of COVID-19, school districts will move to online learning. Classroom attendance should be limited to about 50 per cent when the COVID-19 risk in a community is considered low to moderate. Newfoundland and Labrador says it will spend $20 million to purchase laptops for teachers and students in Grades 7 through 12 to support remote learning.

YUKON

The territorial government says it's making plans for the next school year that include flexibility around the number of students in classes if there's a second wave of COVID-19 or increased risk of transmission. It says each school will determine how it will adjust its operations to meet those guidelines, and school principals and staff are expected to share that information prior to September.

Back to class: Preliminary plans indicate that in rural communities, all students will return to school full time. In Whitehorse, however, kids in kindergarten through Grade 9 will return to full-day in-school instruction, while Grades 10 to 12 will spend half their day in the classroom, and the rest learning remotely.

Groups: Class sizes may be smaller to meet safety restrictions.

Masks: Wearing masks is a personal choice.

Transportation: Bus school and schedules will be posted to the territory's website.

New routines: Schedule shakeups may mean that some students won't have their regular teacher or the same classmates. School meal programs may be adapted with new safety measures and pickup options.

Backup plans: The territory has outlined a spectrum of school options if the risk to the community increases, ranging from rotating schedules to suspension of face-to-face learning.

NORTHWEST TERRITORIES

All N.W.T. schools have submitted plans to reopen their doors this fall. The territory says education authorities are taking a flexible approach in their planning to account for a potential second wave of COVID-19 in the fall.

Back to class: While plans will vary from school to school, the territory will offer in-person instruction whenever possible, while ensuring alternative options are available.

Groups: Students in kindergarten through Grade 6 will be in classroom ""bubbles,"" and won't have to practise physical distancing within these groups.

Physical distancing: For Grades 7 to 9, students are asked to maintain a one-metre distance from each other, and two-metre distance from staff. Grade 10 to 12 students are asked to allow for two metres of distance from their peers and instructors.

Masks: Students of all ages may be required to wear masks in situations where physical distance cannot be practised, such as moving through the hallways.

Transportation: There may be changes to bus schedules, and all riders will be required to wear masks.

New routines: More time will be spent learning outside. School hours and schedules may also look different. Students are asked to label personal items and not share.

Backup plans: The territory says schools are preparing to shift between in-person, distance and blended learning at short notice should there become active COVID-19 cases.

---

NUNAVUT

The territory has released a four-stage plan for reopening schools based on the risk of the novel coronavirus in a community.

Back to class: There are no reported COVID-19 cases in Nunavut, so all schools are set to reopen this fall with enhanced cleaning and safety precautions.

Groups: It is recommended that schools cohort students by class and limit mixing as much as possible.

Physical distancing: Distance requirements will depend on what stage a community is in, and will primarily be achieved by limiting school attendance.

Masks: In most cases, the use of masks is not recommended for children. If there are exceptions, parents will be notified, and masks will be provided.

Transportation: As it stands, bus schedules are set to resume. Students older than 13 may be required to wear masks.

New routines: Group activities will be limited. Students won't be allowed to share food in lunchrooms.

Backup plans: The territory says schools could go part-time if contact tracing were to identify a possible source of COVID-19. All schools would be closed if community transmission were to take place.

I never thought I’d look at that text again, but with all the talk about COVID-19 learning loss I was curious.

article continues below

Was anything lost over a lifetime gone forever?

Of course, 60 years later ,the Latin text is online now so I had to take a look.

“Sic fatur lacrimans, classique immittit habenas, et tandem Euboicis Cumarum adlabitur oris.”

Sixty years later, with not a word of Latin during that time, it was, more or less, somehow familiar. I took a stab at it and, with some help from online Google translate, I still had a good sense of Virgil’s narrative, if not anywhere near an exact translation.

“Thus he spoke, tears in his eyes, gives reins for the fleet

and finally Euboian shores”

No doubt scholars of the classics will be all over me, but you get the general idea.

No, the story came back like a wonderful movie I’d never really forgotten; the Trojan fleet arrives on the shores of Italy, Aeneas makes for the Temple of Apollo, where the Sibyl, a priestess, meets him — a wonderful story and an ancient language which had survived in the dark corners of my ageing hippocampus — vague and short on detail, but still in there somewhere.

Thanks to the exponential advances in information technology over the past 60 years, I could find what my age and curiosity thought I had lost forever, but now could find again.

Some years ago, I was supervising and enthusiastic young teacher trainee as she taught algebra — a subject I remember disliking intensely in Grade 12.

She was explaining simultaneous equations and how (a+b)2 = a2 + 2ab + b2 and why.

Probably because I knew I would not be facing a test, I found it fascinating — “how did I miss out on this stuff — I sort of remember it now.”

So I looked up “simultaneous equations.” Again, there it all was, in an instant.

The point of all this nostalgia is that what we learned once we probably never forget altogether and, despite time away from the classroom, and with access to the technology to retrieve it, should we so choose, it is still at the tips of our fingers on a computer keyboard.

That being so, I have to wonder if all the dire predictions about kids “losing their education” because of COVID school shutdowns is missing the point. Information learnt in a classroom is not lost because of a pause in school attendance.

In fact, every September teachers retrieve, revisit and refresh previous learning in the first week or so back at school before moving on to the new stuff.

In the age of home-based curricular centred learning technology the particulars of even an obscure Latin text — even algebra can be retrieved and relearned easily enough — if needed for some reason.

What might be lost unless we come up with alternatives such as a safe and workable “Plan B” for getting kids back into schools at least part time is more profound and possibly more damaging to our society than that.

What might be lost is the experience of socio-cultural equity that schools create.

As our schools are moving online during the COVID shutdown, some suburban groups of parent are already considering employing tutors and creating mini-schools at home.

Other parents will buy upgraded home computers or send their kids to independent schools if they have the financial wherewithal to do that .

But if cultural equity through educational opportunity is something we had challenges with before COVID, a reprise of shutdowns of public schools as a “Plan B” will further magnify existing social inequities and cultural class divisions.

So what do we do? One alternative might be shortening the hours of instruction and running the schools on morning and afternoon shifts, which would reduce the school building’s population on any given day and reduce virus risks.

That way kids still experience public school with other kids not from families like their own. That’s how kids learn about living in a diverse community, learn about living in a diverse Canada. That’s something we really don’t want to lose.

And kids who have special individual learning needs? Most learning specialists suggests that when schools do reopen, it is those kids who should be prioritized for as much time as possible in classrooms with specially trained teachers.

Let’s get this “class composition” thing right for those kids this time around.

Finally, let’s face the fact that starting classrooms safely, with reduced class sizes, reduced hours of instruction, specialist teachers, upgraded air-circulation systems, insistence on wearing masks, sanitizing hands and maintaining social distancing if it is all done properly, will be more difficult and more expensive than anybody thought.

But as as Joni Mitchell so succinctly put it: “You don’t know what you’ve lost ’til it’s gone.”

So let’s not save dollars in the short term by allowing COVID to cost public education more than anybody can afford in the long term.

""Find out more about what your school district is doing, and then adjust according to that.","TORONTO — Vonny Sweetland has yet to decide if he will be sending his 12-year-old sister Josephine back to class in September, but just in case he does, he's been stocking up on supplies for months.

He picks up hand sanitizer when he sees it in stores, grabbed new masks last month, bought a fresh uniform and has been testing out Josephine's muscle power with some new lunch containers.

The new additions to her backpack and are all part of a wave of changes families — and their wallets — are being confronted with as they prepare for back to school, whether it's sourcing protective equipment or choosing a thermos their child can open unassisted.

""In a COVID-era, all of these things we take for granted or think are minuscule are actually really important,"" said Sweetland, who is his sister's guardian.

""These are things as simple as a teacher helping you unpack your lunch or zipping a zipper. To prevent potential spread, I don't think teachers are really going to be doing these things.""

The cost of so many new supplies can easily add up.

A Deloitte survey of 1,200 parents who have at least one child attending school in grades K-12 this fall found the average family will spend $102 on school supplies, $216 on clothing and accessories, $395 on computers and hardware, $316 on electronic gadgets and digital subscriptions.

The survey, which was conducted between May and July, found those families will allocate $61 on a new category: home or health supplies.

Even so, back-to-school shopping doesn't have to be more expensive than any other year, said Seung Hwan (Mark) Lee, an associate professor of retail management at Ryerson University.

He recommends shoppers compare prices and take advantage of sales.

Anne Marie Taber said she's noticed plenty of sales, though she hasn't sought them out when shopping with seven-year-old daughter Avery because she tries to minimize her time in stores and instead use online options with delivery to lessen her exposure to the virus.

She stocked up as soon as she could on Old Navy's uniform-style clothing because several sizes were out of stock and also grabbed Avery a new backpack.

On top of masks and hand sanitizers, they bought a wide-mouth water bottle without a straw to make cleaning easy, plastic Duo-Tangs that can be wiped down and a set of art supplies that Avery has been reminded not to share.

""This is extra stuff we haven't had to buy in the past but it's a small dollar to pay to make sure that that is just hers exclusively,"" Taber said.

Parents may also want to consider disposable cutlery, if they have children that bring lunches to school and are worried about germs spreading through anything reuseable, Lee said.

If your child is doing virtual classes, he suggests ensuring you have a reliable laptop or tablet with a webcam.

Those who want to go all out or are older and have specific needs for programs they are enrolled in, may need to think about microphones and speakers too.

Those supplies don't come cheap. However, the cost of those high-ticket items could be partially offset by a change he sees happening across universities and colleges during the pandemic.

""It's no longer really about carrying around the heavy textbooks,"" he said.

""Many professors aren't holding lengthy exams because the exams are becoming very difficult to monitor and you can't really get a proctor to look at how students are conducting their exams... so using test banks or textbooks no longer apply.""

If you're feeling anxious or stressed about back to school shopping and advertisements are making you feel you better get to a store soon, Lee says not worry.

""I would advise parents right now not to rush into getting supplies,"" he said.

""Find out more about what your school district is doing, and then adjust according to that. A deal can always be had.""

Cause and effect?

Re Coming To A Head (Letters, Aug. 12): A letter-writer relates his positive view of Julie Payette, after attending an awards ceremony at Rideau Hall for his cousin. Let’s put this into context.

Ms. Payette had a history of not showing up at such ceremonies, including at my wife’s being awarded the Governor-General’s medal for volunteering. Instead, other local dignitaries, such as the mayor of Ottawa, stepped in to do her duties. I believe the ceremony attended by the letter-writer only happened because of her previous dereliction of duty, as she tried to make amends by putting on a good show.

Bruce Hutchison Ottawa

I suspect that Julie Payette’s personality is not ideally suited to the role envisioned by traditionalists, but perhaps it’s appreciated by many average Canadians. I, for one, think having an accomplished woman from outside the circle of diplomacy was a very cool idea and one that civil servants assigned to the Governor-General’s staff may need to accommodate.

School crunch

Re Class-size Plan Puts Students At Risk: Toronto Public Health (Aug. 8): Toronto Public Health and other public-health units are on the mark that maintaining current elementary class sizes would be a risk for the spread of COVID-19.

Story continues below advertisement

Studies are still inconclusive regarding children and COVID-19. Outbreaks have occurred involving young children in elementary schools in Jaffa, Israel and Trois-Rivières, Que. Outbreaks at two child-care centres in Toronto and Montreal led to temporary closings in late spring. That is why the government and school boards should take the precautionary principle and only reopen schools with smaller classes.

The Ontario government should rethink its return-to-school plan and put the necessary funding in place to ensure the safety and health of students, educators and staff. It should also include improved building ventilation to comply with recommended standards, additional classroom space if needed and the hiring of more educators.

Doug Ford has said he “won’t spare a penny” to keep kids safe. He should put his sentiment into action.

Sam Hammond President, Elementary Teachers’ Federation of Ontario; Toronto

Re How Your Kids Can Safely Go Back To School (Editorial, Aug. 12): As an Ontario educator of 30-plus years, I could analyze whether we ought to continue to pause provincial language assessments in addition to math testing to save approximately $20-million. Or, using available global data, I could discern that smaller class sizes come September is a necessity. Instead, though, I would like to talk about soap – and while we’re at it, warm running water and hand dryers, too.

Supplies such as soap are supposed to be furnished by school boards, but it needs to be managed by custodial staff, who have been cut to the point that soap may never reach the precious hands that need to be washed. If I had a dollar for every millilitre of soap I purchased for students in four schools over 20 years, I would be independently wealthy, spending my days counting swallowtail butterflies at the cottage.

Simply put, a safe September requires supplies: soap in every school washroom, all day long. Is it a 21st-century innovation? Nope. Groundbreaking? Hardly. But everyone deserves a safe start to the school year.

June Starkey OCT, PhD; Toronto

It is clear that opening our schools will be essential to any return to normalcy in Canada, and The Globe’s editorial finds credible evidence to suggest it can be done safely. I suppose the big question is: Will it be done safely?

In Ontario, we are set to have kindergarten classes with up to 29 students who would not wear masks. Physical distancing would be next to impossible. It’s clear to me that returning students in this manner is more of an experiment than a controlled action.

We should cross our fingers that the experiment works, but I can’t help but believe we will be relying more on luck than science.

I asked a friend and her 15-year-old son how they felt about going back to school in September. She was all for sending him back.

His response? “I’ll go if my friends are going and not go if they’re not. And if there’s no lunch, what’s the point?”

I submit this in case it was thought that people were making back-to-school decisions based on science and expert public-health advice!

Re How Can Canada’s Performing Arts Ecosystem Change Amid COVID-19? (Arts & Pursuits, Aug. 8): Christopher Deacon, who holds a secure position at one of Canada’s most prestigious and well-funded institutions, has had decades to lift up more diverse artists as he climbed and to affect change within the National Arts Centre. That he has been oblivious to the lack of opportunities for marginalized artists, and that the light is only dawning now, reveals that he may not be the right person for the job he currently holds.

I would like to see The Globe and Mail give voice to an artist directly affected by the current arts crisis and the systemic racism within arts organizations.

Story continues below advertisement

Anne Driscoll St. Albert, Ont.

Christopher Deacon states that “Canada is awakening to long-ignored realities – the systemic racism of our institutions.” But it seems he is the one “awakening,” and my response is: What took so long?

Canada’s arts community needs concrete plans for systematic change, not generalizations and platitudes. As head of one of the most powerfully funded venues in Canada, where is the inspired leadership?

Many Canadian arts organizations have been addressing issues of racism and social injustice for years. Mr. Deacon and the National Arts Centre could learn from those already walking the walk. With all of his power and resources, Mr. Deacon should step up with action and commitment.

Parent representative Rich Fleming said there has been a “strong commitment from the city” to try to use bylaws to solve the problem.

“They’re pushing the resources they can toward it,” he said.

For now, Fleming said, there could be a committee of parents formed to “sweep” the grounds each morning for things like needles. “Obviously, that’s not the desired solution at all.”

Like many others, people in the South Park community have a “deep desire” to see a more overarching solution to homelessness issues, beyond what they see near the school, Fleming said.

“Obviously, we don’t want [tents] near a school and [to] put the kids at risk,” said Fleming, who has a child entering Grade 2 at the school as well as two younger children.

He said there have been up to 20 tents visible from South Park.

Greater Victoria School Board chairwoman Jordan Watters said that safety is “the No. 1 priority.”

“We’re watching the situation,” she said.

Overnight sheltering is allowed in several city parks, including Beacon Hill, and council has opted not to enforce rules requiring people to pack up during the day while there is a pandemic. The city received an injunction allowing it to remove people from sensitive areas of the park, but there are still dozens of tents in the area.

Helps said she believes it is appropriate to amend the parks bylaw to prohibit sheltering close to the school.

“I understand that staff are working on a series of bylaw amendments to propose to council in September that will address this and other issues around the city,” she said.

She noted that provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry has advised that students returning to school should spend as much time as possible outdoors, something that unsafe grounds would prevent.

Victoria Coun. Marianne Alto said she agrees with Helps about the tents needing to move.

“I think there’s no doubt at all that having tents … that close to a school isn’t the most optimal situation,” she said. “We’re very well aware that there are better ways to deal with the reality of that site.”

Alto said Victoria’s committee of the whole meets next on Sept. 3, so she doesn’t expect measures to be in place by the time students return to school on Sept. 10.

“I’m really hoping that we’ll be able to get a handle on this very soon.”

The considerations they can weigh and prioritize would seem both limitless and relentlessly shifting.

As a parent, an educator, and member of the B.C. Legislative Assembly, I have some concerns about the province’s current back-to-school plan because it gives parents, students, and teachers a stark choice: Be willing to be in the classroom in person, or forfeit your connection to your school community.

article continues below

Fourteen-year-old Grace articulated what this choice means for her: “I have underlying health issues, and so I can’t be in the classroom in the fall, and I’m devastated that this means that I lose my connection to my school, my friends, and my teachers.”

Telling students who can’t or won’t go back into their classrooms in September – whether it’s due to their own health issues or the health issues of a family member – to sign up for online learning through a distributed-learning program is an insufficient response to the many different realities people are experiencing right now.

Students who don’t feel they can go back into the classroom also don’t want to lose the connection to their school community.

For the teachers who feel too much at risk to consider in-person teaching, they also face being disconnected from their school communities, and from the students with whom they have connections.

As this plan is still coming together, and as we see rising rates of COVID-19, there is still the time and opportunity to take into account the concerns of students, teachers, and parents to determine how we can better establish and maintain the strong community connection that schools deliver for everyone.

A hybrid approach that creates a widened school community moves us towards the two outcomes we should be striving for: Preventing transmission and keeping school communities intact.

Teachers would teach either in-class or online, not both.

This would also help to ensure that classroom teachers are not laid off in September, due to lower numbers of students returning for in-class learning.

The teachers could coordinate their efforts to ensure that grade-level delivery is consistent for the mixed in-class and online cohorts – and even find ways occasionally to bring all of the students into the classrooms via online communication tools, allowing for connection between peers to happen, even if it can’t happen in person.

Having dedicated in-class and online teachers would address the challenges that teachers had in June, as they tried to juggle both at the same time. It would also provide the option for teachers who are in high-risk groups to be able to continue teaching within their established school communities.

Coordination between the two teaching cohorts can be built into the plan: The creation of teacher pods, with some in-school and some online, would further enhance connection and consistency of learning experiences for students.

By having the online cohorts, the pressure on the in-class groups diminishes. This will help to make social distancing much easier to achieve for the in-class students and teachers, by likely reducing the number of individuals in a classroom.

Students who are attending in-person would have the ability to join the online group if they have to stay home because of illness – thereby encouraging students not to come to school if they are unwell, and providing them with uninterrupted instruction while they are home.

Students who are in the online cohort may be able to reconsider between terms of the school year about attending in-person. The teacher cohorts would allow for more ability for mid-year adjustments between the two realms.

The COVID-19 pandemic is unpredictable. We need to be flexible and adaptable, keeping in mind the importance of what our long-term goals are: Prevention of transmission and strengthening of community.

The world is ever-changing and, for businesses, keeping pace is a matter of survival. The same can be said of business education.

But as costs soar for a traditional Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree, some are questioning the return on investment (ROI) and relevance of this mainstay of business education.

Edward Snyder, the former dean of the Yale School of Management, has criticized the trajectory of traditional MBAs.

Story continues below advertisement

“Many of the schools have collectively marched off the cliff with these tuition increases,” Mr. Snyder says in Forbes magazine. “That has reduced some of the ROI on the degree… [M]any schools have found themselves in a tuition trap in which they cannot find a market for their programs… .”

Luminaries like technology billionaire Mark Cuban and Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg have also publicly questioned the value of the traditional MBA, long considered the key to the C-suite.

The high cost and often outdated content of many MBA programs have many people looking for alternatives.

“Traditional MBAs have been almost the same for the last 30 years and the world has changed and continues to change so fast,” says Rafael Gozalo, co-founder and co-CEO of ThePowerMBA, an online business education platform from Europe that recently launched in Canada.

Open this photo in gallery Rafael Gozalo, co-founder and co-CEO of ThePowerMBA, says his online program is not only a lower-cost alternative to traditional MBAs but also more efficient and real-world relevant. SUPPLIED

Business education is ripe for disruption, Mr. Gozalo says.

Here are five reasons why the MBA needs a revamp — and some solutions:

1. Does an MBA have to cost so much?

Story continues below advertisement

The degree from one of the top 10 business schools in the U.S. costs upwards of US$100,000. In Canada, the fees at many schools can be much lower but still substantial, ranging from about $10,000 to around $100,000, with the average being roughly in the middle. Those fees are inaccessible to a lot of people.

“Very few people have the opportunity to make the decision to attend a traditional MBA,” Mr. Gozalo says.

While the cost of a traditional MBA is a barrier for many people, ThePowerMBA is offered for around $1,400 (Canadian).

2. Do you really have to stop your life for it?

Another big challenge is finding the time to pursue a traditional MBA. Full-time studies mean stepping out of your career path for a year or more, and even part-time studies add at least an extra 15-to-20 hours to your already busy week.

“There is value in an MBA, just in terms of the skills that an MBA can provide,” says Mike Shekhtman, regional vice-president for B.C. and Manitoba at Robert Half International, a human resources consulting firm and corporate recruitment agency. “But it is a tremendous investment, not just monetary but also in time. It’s a tough decision for people to weigh, to just exit their current opportunity to complete a full-time MBA program.”

Mr. Gozalo notes that ThePowerMBA offers micro-learning classes in a video format that can be consumed anytime, anywhere.

“You don’t have to stop your life for this. That’s extremely important,” Mr. Gozalo says.

Instead, the program can be completed in as little as 10 months while working.

3. Traditional MBAs can't keep up with the real world

The traditional model for an MBA relies on detailed case studies that take time to develop and incorporate into the curriculum.

“If you go to a traditional MBA program, the problem is you’re going to see cases that teach you about things that happened 15, 20 or 25 years ago,” Mr. Gozalo says.

Story continues below advertisement

“In business, things are changing extremely quickly. Things that were working even three years ago aren’t working any more… Our approach is to move as fast as the market, the knowledge, and the consumer are moving.”

ThePowerMBA’s online format lends itself to quick updates from real-life global business leaders like Marc Randolph, the co-founder and first CEO of Netflix, Daniel Lamarre, CEO of Cirque du Soleil and Sugarfina co-founder Rose O’Neill, to name just a few.

4. Should expertise be limited by lines on a map?

Most traditional business schools are limited by geography, and so are their students. Classes end up being taught by the professors who live within driving distance.

“But is that the way to learn from the best?” Mr. Gozalo asks. “Are those professors who are teaching in the thousands of business schools around the world the best teachers for that area or topic?”

ThePowerMBA looks around the world to bring the most compelling instructors and business minds to everyone, such as Eric Ries, creator of The Lean Startup Methodology, which has brought a lot of value to startups and businesses around the world.

Story continues below advertisement

The accessibility of global insights has attracted students worldwide to the program. To date, ThePowerMBA has signed up students from more than 60 countries.

5. Classroom learning is outdated, but nobody does anything about it.

In today’s busy and digital world, traditional classroom learning — listening to a lecture for hours at a time — is neither effective nor easily compatible with the lives of working professionals. ThePowerMBA offers lessons in tightly focused, 15-minute classes instead.

It’s not only more efficient, it’s also a better way to learn, Mr. Gozalo argues.

“Your brain is going to be focused,” he says. “If you spend one hour in front of a teacher, you’re only ever going to remember so much. But if you spend 10-to-15 minutes on highly curated content, talking about one topic each time with very specific examples, it’s proven that you’re not going to forget that.”

What’s next in business education?

Story continues below advertisement

Some professionals are looking to accelerate their career trajectory with part-time, rather than full-time MBA programs. While this does spread out the time commitment, it doesn’t remove barriers of cost or global accessibility.

Mr. Gonzalo says ThePowerMBA isn’t in competition with traditional MBA programs. Instead, it provides students with the relevant credentials they need to pursue or build their careers at home or in other parts of the world.

“Traditional MBAs will have always have their customers and they’re always going to have value for some people,” Mr. Gozalo says. “Our mission is democratizing top knowledge and bringing the main benefits of a traditional business school to anyone who wants to improve their business career and achieve their goals.”

More than 40,000 people worldwide have enrolled in or completed ThePowerMBA program to date. The global program has just launched with classes for the first cohort starting in September – and about 250 students in Canada have already signed up.

The provincial government said Monday that masks will also be required whenever students and teachers are outside their learning groups and cannot maintain an appropriate physical distance because of COVID-19.

Students who can’t wear masks for medical reasons will be exempt from the updated health and safety guidelines.

Even when wearing masks, staff and students will still have to maintain a physical distance from people outside of their learning groups, the province said.

Learning groups are made up of students and staff who remain together through a school quarter, semester or year. They were established on the advice of the provincial health officer to help prevent the transmission of COVID-19 and could be made up of a single class of students or multiple classes.

Réka Gustafson, B.C.’s deputy provincial health officer, said masks are “quite low are the hierachy” of protections for COVID-19.

“That’s why they are limited to brief periods of time when other control methods cannot be used.”

She said the most effective way to prevent transmission of the virus is for people to stay home when they are sick. “We know we can add an important additional layer of protection by keeping our groups small, which is what the learning groups are about.”

The use of masks will be evaluated to make sure students and children are able to use them safely and determine whether they prove beneficial, Gustafson said.

The government said would provide additional funding to schools to help pay for the purchase of up to 1.5 million non-medical masks. It said the funding would provide for at least two masks for every staff member and student at the province’s public schools.

The mask requirement was part of updated guidelines for schools released by the province on Monday.

In addition to the updated guidelines on the use of masks, the government said it is increasing the cleaning of such things as doorknobs, keyboards, desks and chairs.

As well, students, staff and visitors will be required to clean their hands before boarding school buses or entering schools. Hands will also have to be cleaned before and after eating, when using washrooms and using playground equipment.

Sooke superintendent Scott Stinson said the school district welcomes the additional direction.

“As a district, we are appreciative that the ministry is responding to and reflecting the concerns of the community,” he said. “Having greater clarity on when and where masks will be most beneficial is helpful for our planning and work.”

Students are scheduled to return to class on Sept. 10.

School districts have until Friday to submit their restart plans to the ministry for approval. They will be reviewed before the districts share the details with families on Aug. 26.

The Cowichan Valley school district said it has made progress in preparing for the return of students and will have its teachers in place Sept. 8 for a series of planning days.

The planning days will allow staff to meet with their school-based health and safety teams, finalize planning for the year, and adjust to the enhanced health and safety procedures before students return, the district said.

“We are carefully and thoughtfully working our way toward a localized return-to-school plan that will help all students and staff have a safe and productive school year,” said Candace Spilsbury, chair of the board of education for the school district.

“Schools are safe places — by following the updated health and safety guidelines from the Ministry of Education and provincial health officer, we can ensure they will stay that way.”",596,0.6835945733965815,lifestyle

“An above average home inspection and a separate entrance to a fully finished basement helped to draw great interest, as the potential for rental income was attractive to the majority of buyers,” Ms. Lelli said.

“This home, situated on a quiet cul-de-sac, is ideal for young families. Schools, parks and shopping are also within walking distance, as is the local community/recreation centre.”

The sale of this semi-detached house could not be postponed by the sellers, so their agents moved forward with their marketing plans in late May, staging the space themselves and providing video and 3-D tours. More staff were brought on to facilitate more than 60 in-person visits, with increased cleaning measures, and to oversee a bidding war on the presentation date in early June.

“The market had started to pick up – we were seeing offer dates and houses selling within a week – so we felt confident this was going to sell, but we were not expecting 15 offers,” agent Lisa-Marie Doorey said.

“And it sold for a record price much higher than pre-COVID-19 prices for the neighbourhood.”

This three-bedroom house was built more than 100 years ago across from East Lynn Park, but has been extensively improved in recent years, complete with an updated bachelor suite in the basement.

The living and dining rooms are completely open to each other, and the rear kitchen was extended and refashioned with a pantry, long quartz counters, glass tile back plashes and double glass doors to the terrace.

A fenced backyard and parking on a mutual driveway round out the 19-foot-by-121-foot lot.

“What this house has – that a lot don’t have – is a finished basement that could be great for teenagers or in-laws with a separate entrance and kitchenette,” Ms. Doorey said.

“[Plus, the sellers] really worked on the curb appeal of the house, adding a new front porch … and they opened up the back of the house, so you got the ‘wow’ factor when you walked in because you could see the garden.”

The sellers had owned the property for a few years and used it as a pied-à-terre for their university-age children, as well as a rental property. The deal was completed on Aug. 4.

After the pandemic struck in March, a few residents of the Norris Crescent Co-op lost their jobs and found themselves facing a world of financial uncertainty.

The co-op board snapped into action, offering up No Frills gift cards, a payment plan for missed rent cheques, and, perhaps most importantly, reassurance.

“We said no one would get evicted,” says board president Sharon Power, who has lived on Norris Crescent, in south Etobicoke, for about 15 years.

Sitting on a lawn chair outside her apartment, she watches cyclists ride by and casts an indulgent eye over the little community – 56 apartments ranging in size from one bedroom to four bedrooms, arrayed across ten two-storey post-war dwellings on a Mimico cul-de-sac abutting a lakefront park. There are about 200 residents, some of them very long-term, with a mix of incomes and ethnicities. In exchange for amazingly affordable rents ($1,600 is the highest), all are expected to participate somehow, from volunteering on the board to picking up stray mail.

Co-op living “is not without its challenges, I’m going to be honest,” Ms. Power says with a smile, allowing that everyone knows everyone else’s business. But, she adds, “[it] can be very rich. You have to have the intentionality of being an engaged member.”

In the past few years, engagement has also meant confronting the declining state of the buildings, which need new roofs, foundation repairs and building envelope upgrades. The co-op board, however, is also looking at redeveloping part of its landholdings – in effect replacing two of the houses closest to Lakeshore Road with a six-to-eight storey accessible mid-rise, with 35 to 50 units.

The board has hired a planning consultant to guide the members through the maze of zoning approvals and potential funding sources. Ms. Power points out that the plan also means that rents will have to rise by about 5 per cent to make the math work.

It’s a slow process, with plenty of risk for the co-op. As she says, “There’s got to be an easier way to assist co-ops with working through development plans.”

In spite of the speed bumps, Norris’ story offers a glimpse at what seems to be a bit of a renaissance in co-op housing development in Canada, especially in British Columbia and Quebec (see sidebar), where creative land and financing deals are bringing new projects online.

Tim Ross, executive director of the Co-op Housing Federation of Canada, says about 250,000 Canadians now live in affordable co-ops ranging in size from single apartment buildings to collections of low-rise dwellings. He knows from his members that demand, especially for family-suitable units, far exceeds supply.

The bulk of Canada’s co-ops date to the 1970s and 1980s, when the federal government pumped rent supplements and mortgage subsidies into these projects as an alternative to both private multi-unit residential slab towers and social housing complexes. At the time, they were seen as a progressive form of mixed-income urban housing.

Yet, with the subsequent surge of condo development, plus government decisions from the mid-1990s onward to phase out co-op subsidies, there’s been scant co-op development in the past 20 years. Mr. Ross says some co-op boards want to expand their portfolios or intensify, as in the case of Norris, but are held back by soaring real estate prices and forbidding development costs.

In B.C., however, affordable housing grants from the provincial NDP government and the City of Vancouver’s 2012 decision to transfer real estate at effectively no cost to community land trusts has meant that about 2,000 new affordable units will be built by 2023, about 70 per cent of them co-ops.

The first 350 are under construction, with one co-op in Vancouver’s River District set to open in August, according to Thom Armstrong, CEO of the Co-op Housing Federation of B.C. (CHFBC). Key to the plan has been low-cost loans from CMHC and a $2-million investment by VanCity, the credit union, to establish a properly capitalized development group to acquire assets and manage the process.

Open this photo in gallery Providence Ridge, a non-profit housing development in Kelowna, B.C., 54 townhomes acquired by the CLT in 2001. Co-operative Housing Federation of B.C.

Mr. Armstrong adds that CHFBC has been able to snap up derelict and virtually insolvent co-ops in places such as Port Moody and Port Coquitlam, invest in significant upgrades, and then transfer the ownership to a community land trust that is a subsidiary of the federation.

The last step means the property is not only removed from the private market in perpetuity, but becomes an asset that can be leveraged to acquire other parcels. (The Cooperative Housing Federation of Toronto also controls five land trusts that provide housing for 10,000 people living in 32 co-ops across the city.)

Decades of municipal land-banking can provide a steady source of real estate that co-ops can develop, Mr. Armstrong says. “There’s an enormous opportunity going forward.”

It appears that similar opportunities are cropping up in Toronto, as well.

Earlier this month, Toronto city council approved a deal with Streetcar Developments to upgrade an old house at 685 Queen St. E., near Broadview Avenue, which belongs to the Riverdale Co-op and has nine apartments. Located next to a Toyota dealership slated for redevelopment by Streetcar, the building will be expanded to 26 units, including complete upgrades of the original nine apartments.

Riverdale’s manager Adene Kuchera says the co-op owns 28 properties in the east end, with 124 units – mostly duplexes, triples and walk-ups. It was founded in 1974 and expanded until the 1980s, but the board hasn’t acquired new units since then. About half of its properties are mortgage free, Ms. Kuchera says.

While earlier proposals envisioned up to 80 units and 12 storeys, the scale was unrealistic. The project will be constructed by Streetcar, which is contributing $5.2-million in Section 37 grants, with another $11.2-million coming from waivers on city fees and taxes. Construction is expected to begin next year.

The number of proposed units was reduced shortly before the project landed at council so Streetcar wouldn’t risk neighbourhood objections or re-zoning appeals – a decision that brought criticism from some affordable housing watchers. But Councillor Paula Fletcher defended the compromise, saying it provides Riverdale’s board with financial certainty. “This has not been the easiest application.”

She points out that new-build co-ops are also envisioned for other development sites in the area, including a large mixed-income Toronto Community Housing complex being intensified by RioCan.

With evidence of deal flow in Canada’s two most expensive cities, co-op advocates are hoping that some of funding pledged under the Liberal government’s much touted National Housing Strategy will stoke the development of more co-op projects. But Tim Ross says the program remains “difficult to access.”

Adds Jon Harstone, a veteran affordable housing consultant who has managed the development or expansion several Toronto co-op projects, “Unless the feds put money into non-profits, this will all be one-offs.”

Montreal’s Student Co-op Housing Renaissance

Open this photo in gallery Rendering of Utile Papineau. Rayside Labossière

Laurent Levesque founded Utile, a student housing co-op development non-profit, in 2012 when he was still a planning undergrad at the Université du Quèbec à Montreal (UQAM), largely out of a desire to put his learning to good use.

Seven years later, the group’s first co-op venture, The Woodnote, at Concordia University, is set to open in September. The $18-million, 90-unit project, designed by Rayside Labossière, is backed by the Concordia student union and a pair of provincial student organizations, among other investors.

The units range in size from studios to four-bedroom suites, all fully fitted out with modern amenities instead of the dorm-style housing that’s far more common on and around Canadian campuses. Woodnote will accommodate up to 140 students. A second and larger Montreal project from Utile will open in 2022.

Unusually for co-ops, Utile’s ventures involve no provincial funding. What Utile has done is forge financial partnerships involving several credit unions, which tend to have social responsibility investment mandates, and student organizations that can provide a steady stream of revenues through a dedicated levy.

The City of Montreal offered a $1.6-million grant, and Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. supplied a $3-million loan. The financing allowed Utile to buy land for both projects. Woodnote, in fact, is located in Montreal’s desirable Plateau area.

The organization operates as the developer, providing the expertise that has been lacking in the student co-op housing world for years, says Mr. Levesque. “You need a development organization to make projects like these work.”

Open this photo in gallery Rendering of Note des bois interior. Rayside Labossière

He sees both projects as “proof of concept” developments that offer an alternative vehicle for delivering higher-density student housing complexes, which are typically contracted out to private developers by university administrators.

Mr. Levesque points out that Utile is working on several student housing co-op projects outside Quebec, all of which are still in the early stages. “There’s no secret recipe. Our model is completely scalable and replicable across the country.”

“The house was brand new and renovated, so my clients decided to forgo the inspection to make their offer stronger.”

This 2½-storey house has 1,500 square feet of living space and ample privacy outdoors. It has a rooftop deck off the largest of four bedrooms and a south-facing backyard on a 20-foot-by-125-foot lot.

The interior design and decor were recently modernized, from quartz countertops and backsplashes in the kitchen to sleek fireplaces in the open living room and an upper bedroom.

There’s a laundry room on the second floor and bathrooms on each level, including the basement.

This stylish bachelor suite at the Atlantis building was only visited by a few parties over two months, which coincided with mandated lockdowns at the height of the pandemic this spring. To drum up more interest, its $475,000 list price was slashed in May.

“When we dropped it by $10,000 to about $465,000, that, along with the timing of things opening up and people starting to relax a bit, was a magical combination,” agent Amit Dhawan said.

“The crazy thing is there were larger bachelors available in this Fort York complex asking a much lower price. Yet we got an amazing price for our bachelor, which may have something to do with its view and exposure.

Last summer, agent Alex Moloney easily sold a two-bedroom-plus-den corner suite without parking for $1.62-million. But when this similar unit directly two floors above opened to the public mid-March, building management wanted to shut buyers out due to pandemic concerns. They eventually relented and a buyer was found.

“The unit was vacant, so it wasn’t like someone was living there, which would have been a different situation,” Mr. Moloney said. “So it was easy to show.”

“It wasn’t a panic sale. There was a lot of uncertainly at the time, but we sold it for a fair price because of the rarity of the plan and view.”

The action

This side-split residence was originally priced at $615,000 to reflect recent improvements done throughout. But it had a small, two-piece, master ensuite. That, added to stiff competition from three other homes for sale nearby, meant it managed only six home tours between late February and mid March.

The price was dropped to $588,000 and a bid followed in late April.

“Because this is an older, established neighbourhood, there’s generally never too many listings on at the same time, especially renovated homes,” said agent Robert Vanovermeire.

“It’s possible if COVID-19 hadn’t hit, they might have gotten a little more money. So the timing was crazy, but … it goes to show that in any market condition, there are still people buying houses.”

What they got

This four-level structure was built in 1961 on a 50-foot-by-100-foot lot. It has been updated numerous times and has a new roof and furnace and three renovated bathrooms with heated floors and porcelain finishes.

The main floor was remodelled to create open living and dining areas with exposed mahogany beams in the vaulted ceilings. The kitchen has Brazilian granite counters and upscale, stainless steel appliances.

The main staircase leads up to three bedrooms and down to family, guest and laundry rooms.

Extra space is provided in the finished basement and detached, double garage.

“Very few have the four-level split floorplan … most in that area are bungalows,” Mr. Vanovermeire said.

“The finishings in this four-level split home are spectacular. Keeping within the mid-century modern theme, they were able to open up the space of the main living room and keep the natural beams above.”

""Sales activity was extremely strong for the first full month of summer. Normally we would see sales dip in July relative to June as more households take vacation, especially with children out of school,"" said Lisa Patel, president of the Toronto Regional Real Estate Board.

article continues below

The board said 11,081 existing homes changed hands during July, 29.5 per cent more sales than July 2019 and a new record high for the month.

Average home prices are also up 16.9 per cent from a year ago, at $943,710, the board said.

Patel said there is evidence the home market is tightening — with buyers competing as homes are being sold faster than new listings are added to the market.

""Competition between buyers continued to increase in many segments of the GTA ownership housing market in July, which fuelled a further acceleration in year-over-year price growth in July compared to June,"" said the board's chief market analyst, Jason Mercer.

Patel suggested that homebuyers and sellers have put off summer travel and are playing catch-up on their housing plans, after the City of Toronto entered Stage 3 of reopening from COVID-19 restrictions.

Davelle Morrison, broker at Bosley Real Estate Ltd., agreed that months in lockdown have given buyers time to think about exactly what they want in a home. Research done, buyers are coming to the market ready to sign on the dotted line, she said.

""People have had three months to sit and observe what they want for their living space,"" said Morrison. ""People are starting to recognize that the Toronto real estate market holds value. They thought there would be a crash, and they were waiting for one. The time period to get a deal was March and April, and it is over . . . so people aren't on the sidelines anymore.""

Nasma Ali, founder of One Group Toronto Real Estate, said sellers often spend winter months prepping their house to sell in spring, when the greenery will improve their curb appeal. The listings that usually crowd the market in March and April came all at once this year — in June.

Last summer, buyers would have been fatigued by the stressful process of making offers. Listings that hit the market in spring usually pile up a bit more by summer, she added.

But this year, that process has sped up, she said.

""Spring never came, and when June came ... I could feel the difference in demand. The demand was just on fire,"" said Ali.

That raises the question of how long the pent-up demand will fuel the market, Ali says.

""People are always waiting for a crash, and now people are waiting for a crash in fall,"" Ali says. ""(Unlike in June,) houses are not selling with 10 to 20 offers. . . . . August is historically slow, people want to enjoy the last few weeks of summer and look again after Labour Day. ""

Morrison said that even among pessimists, she’s seeing a strong urge to move, with one client looking for a backyard in case schools close again in the future.

""People are saying, ‘We realized we won't be able to travel for the next couple of years, we need a getaway that’s local,’"" says Morrison.

But both Ali and Morrison noted that the market for detached houses is different from the condo or rental markets.

TRREB said low-rise homes, especially outside the downtown core, led the upward trend, with overall prices jumping most in Durham, Orangeville and South Simcoe county. The bulk of sales for July were detached homes (5,633 sold) and condo apartments (2,423 sold).

""Condo sales downtown are slower and there are so many factors. The obvious factor is Airbnbs, which have flooded the rental market as more of those investors chose a one-year rental rather than selling,"" said Ali.

""A lot of people are saying they are done with condo living. There is no immigration and that was a huge driving force of urban living.""

Morrison also said landlords are having a harder time filling rental spaces amid a greater supply of condos for rent, alongside unemployment among tenants. While mortgage deferral programs will end in the autumn, Morrison said she’s not sure how many houses will hit the market as a result.

As prices rose again in July, TRREB said it supports housing affordability measures that increase the supply of housing.

The real estate board reiterated support for building more ""missing middle"" housing, such as low-rise apartments and townhouses, as well as a provincial push for transit-oriented communities.

On the other hand, the board did decry any policy suggestion that capital gains tax should be applied to the sale of a principal residence, saying a tax would not help bridge the wealth-creation gap between renters and owners.

""The long-term solution to housing affordability in Canada, for both ownership and rental, is to ensure that there are adequate and appropriate types and tenures of housing available in the market,"" said TRREB chief executive John DiMichele.

July’s average price for a single-family house moved to $1.033 million from the previous record of $1.014 million in June, said the Victoria Real Estate Board.

Multiple bids are coming in for desirable properties despite worldwide uncertainty about the implications of the pandemic.

Justin Cownden, real estate agent with Pemberton Holmes Real Estate, said a client decided not to make an offer on a Shawnigan Lake house last month because 10 offers had already been submitted. The successful bid came in above asking price with no conditions.

Cownden is seeing a “lot of activity,” in all levels of the market as it rebounds after cooling during the first months of the pandemic.

Similar to last month, sales of $2-million-plus properties in the capital region climbed. High-end sales skew the average price.

In July a total of 30 single-family-homes sold for more than $2 million and of those, four went for more than $4 million. In July of last year, there were nine single-family sales of more than $2 million, the board said Wednesday.

As well, five condominiums sold for more than $1 million.

In June, 23 single-family houses sold for more than $2 million.

Developer Stan Sipos earlier sold 80 per cent of the 57 units in his Customs House luxury condominium project overlooking Victoria Harbour and expects to release the remaining units for sale in the fall. Those will probably be priced at $1.8 million to $6 million. The penthouse sold for $11 million.

“We are getting lots of calls. Lots of interest from all over the place,” including the U.S., Sipos said.

Victoria is appealing because it is quiet, offers a good lifestyle and has fared well during the global crisis, he said.

Sipos has heard of multiple offers for Oak Bay properties and of two sales which took place over video applications without the buyer being present.

Real estate board president Sandi-Jo Ayers said sales numbers in the capital region were unusually high for June and July.

“But we are not in a typical season. We cannot derive an ongoing trend nor forecast by looking at activity because we know the market is subjected to unusual factors amidst a health crisis.”

It is likely that spring demand moved into the summer, she said.

“Time will tell if these factors are resulting in a very compressed cycle of activity or if this trend will persist in the fall.”

The benchmark value for a single-family house in the core area was $910,400 last month, up from $861,100 in the same month a year ago.

A benchmark represents changes in value for a typical home in a specific area, a measure which real estate boards say is more representative than an average price. The core area is made up of Victoria, Saanich, Esquimalt, Oak Bay, and View Royal.

A long-term, low supply of properties for sale is continuing in this area, Ayers said.

“Though we had a good number of new listings come to market this month, many of those listings were snapped up by buyers.

By the end of July, there were 2,653 active listings — 10 per cent fewer properties than in July 2019.

“Right now we have a lot of demand for single-family homes without the numbers to meet demand — prospective buyers are often entering into multiple offer, competitive situations or are unable to find appropriate properties,” Ayers said.

For the area north of the Malahat, Vancouver Island Real Estate Board president Kevin Reid also noted interest in single-family homes.

“An interesting development we’re noting is that there seems to be more demand for single-family homes and less interest in condominiums and townhouses at the moment.

“It makes us wonder whether quarantine and lockdown have instilled a desire for more space among buyers.”

A total of 892 units sold last month, a four per cent decline from July of last year.

The benchmark price of a single-family home board-wide was $545,700 in July, an increase of six per cent from the previous year.

1. Saanich: $18,000,000

This huge property in North Saanich is subdividable and has 1,500 feet of ocean frontage. Listing agent: Logan E. Wilson. Image via Realtor.com

The existing house on this property is very modest, considering this is Vancouver Island’s most expensive listing on the MLS right now. It’s a 1983-built, four-bedroom house that is nice but not high end. But the spectacular waterfront lot in desirable North Saanich, ripe for development, is what that price is all about. It is 24.57 acres of non-ALR land spread over two legal titles with 1,500 feet of ocean frontage including a foreshore lease, deepwater moorage and private dock. The local community plan supports sub-division development with density between 48 single and 74 clustered lots. The listing describes it as the “largest sub-dividable waterfront property on Pacific Northwest coast within 10 min of an international airport.” So it’s highly unlikely that house will stay standing under new ownership.

The views from this North Saanich property, the Island's most expensive MLS listing, are priceless. Listing agent: Logan E. Wilson. Image via Realtor.com",1532,0.8958237915277806,business

The back story

Open this photo in gallery There is a massive stone fireplace into the main living space. Denis St. Jean/Denis St. Jean

The street address for Bryan Osborn’s Lac Tremblant home is misleading: It says the house is on Chemain Desmarais, but in fact it’s about 600 metres further down a private road marked as Impasse des Cascades on the map. There are only five or six other homes on this lane.

“There’s a long meandering drive through the forest following a cascading creek,” said Mr. Osborn. “You go over a post-and-beam bridge and come to our entrance Down the driveway and past the tennis court is the house, perched on the lakefront next to a private bay. The family calls the land Deer Point.

“When we built here, a couple guys who were happy to have the work told me, ‘This is our favourite place to hunt deer,’ Back then, you could hunt around the lake. But you can’t anymore.” The was once bare land, part of a larger lot belonging to the family of a friend from his youth. “When we had our first place on the lake, many years later, we rekindled our old relationship. I told him, if ever you want to chop off some of your property ... Many years later, he called me. ‘We’ve decided to sell the point... we know you we’d like to have you as the neighbour,’” Mr. Osborn said. The result was a 4.2 acre lot, much of it flat, with 750 feet of lake frontage.

Mr. Osborn knew what he wanted on the land: a post and beam home done to his specifications. He worked with a crew who had trained in British Columbia, making use of the massive fir forests for materials, before returning home to Quebec to set up a construction business. “Originally, we built it as a country home,” he said. “The kids spent summers and weekends here.” About 20 years ago, he sold his industrial packaging business and made Deer Point his home base, but he has kept busy with his passion for post and beam homes.

Among his post-retirement projects was a run as a custom-home developer. On nearby Lac Ouimet, he acquired land and worked out an arts-and-craft style template that allowed for some customization, building three homes to demonstrate his approach. Eventually he built and sold 22 homes at the Belvedere Estates, the last one in 2008, leaning heavily on locally-sourced artisans just as he had with Deer Point.

“Anybody that has the means wants to be on Lac Tremblant,” says Steven Lafave, listing agent and managing director of the Engel & Völkers Tremblant business (who also lives on an island in the 14 km long lake). “Lac Tremblant owners are full-timers or every weekenders; we’ve got a mix of sports figures and celebrities ... the usual suspects, some of the most affluent families from eastern Canada. Other families have owned properties for a long time. There’s the odd one, the über top of the food chain families like the Stroll family flying in on helicopters.” (Lawrence Stroll, Quebec billionaire investor (an early backer in Michael Kors) owns the Circuit Mont-Tremblant raceway and the F1 team Racing Point (to be renamed Aston Martin in 2021) which also employs his son Lance Stroll as a driver.

Some of the newer homes on the lake are palaces, 15,000- to 25,000- square feet, which is a little more than Mr. Osborn’s 6,500 square foot, four-bed and five-bath house. “We’ve had people come and want to buy the house and say it’s “big ‚and small,” he said. “‘If it only had five bedrooms instead of four.’” He’s in no rush to sell though (the house has been on the market since 2018). He said he’s looking for the discerning buyer.

The house today

Open this photo in gallery There are four bedrooms. Denis St. Jean/Denis St. Jean

The house is laid out on a centre-hall plan, with A-shaped frame that’s as big and open as a barn with wings on both sides. The front door sits at the middle of that central hall, a generous foyer looks into that hall, through the massive stone fireplace into the main living space. Just through the foyer is a landing that runs between the wings. On the right are the stairs to the basement, and a wing that contains two bedrooms. On the left is the wing that leads to the main bedroom and attached living quarters.

Step around the fireplace, down into a great room with a vaulting 20 foot-high ceiling. If it wasn’t already clear from the outside, this house is all about wood and the openness and light that is achieved by post and beam construction.

“We researched the wood, it came from Maine ... we wanted a particular white pine and we needed specific trees to make 12 by 12 square beams that were 40 feet long,” said Mr. Osborn. “We didn’t waste any other materials that were cut [some ended up in flooring or other trim finishings].”

Open this photo in gallery Showings typically involve a boat ride. Denis St. Jean/Denis St. Jean

Everywhere is pine, which has mellowed to a deep golden, it frames doors and windows, some walls and ceilings are panelled in it, everywhere the beams can be exposed they are. The craftsmanship is exceptional.

“And all of the interior finishings were made in various woodworking shops in the Laurentians. All our cabinetry, designed by a designer but fabricated in these artisan wood shops,” said Mr. Osborn. “Case in point, the doors are all two inches thick. You can’t put spindly little doors in a house with structural beams. The floors are made with same white pine, wide-plank, also two inches thick.”

Everything radiates out from central great room, the lake-side wall is practically all glass with three sets of glass double doors and with four massive triangular window panes above them that accentuate the A-shaped framing. The dining space sits just next to those windows, a sitting area sits between that the fireplace. A breakfast bar on the left runs along the raised counter that separates the room from the kitchen.

Favourite space

“We sit on our dock and watch the sunrise, most people on our side of the lake have to wait until 10 or 11 because the mountain is behind us and the sun comes up over the mountain,” said Mr. Osborn. But because the point extends into the small bay you can have unobstructed views of that morning light.

That’s part of the reason Mr. Lafave’s showings typically involve a boat ride, often picking the interested party up at the lakeside Hotel Quintessence. “If we don’t bring them in by boat we’ll end up on boat. It’s part of the process,” Mr. Lafave said, in part to show them how Deer Point’s land and location compares to the other lots on the lake. “We’ve got examples of people paying $4-million for a much lesser lot, going to build 15-20,000 square foot homes without flat land or bay or private road. In year’s past there were a few homes that were still available [to buy and tear down] now they are gone ... on that side of the lake with a road there are two options left; and they are both $10-million.”

Jason Bykewich/Jason Bykewich

In the dining room of Jason Bykewich’s childhood home, his parents had a black-and-red candelabra with a fiddlehead shape. As a baby, he was drawn to this fixture. When his father carried him past it, he’d grasp at it. “I wanted to touch it and see it up close,” he says. He was similarly transfixed by the ornate balusters beneath the armrests of the living-room couch. He’s disinclined to read too much into these childhood fascinations. Clearly, even then, he liked irregular shapes. Perhaps it was their distinctiveness that appealed to him. Or their resemblances to natural forms – snail shells, tendrils, Aloe plants.

As an adult, Mr. Bykewich developed an interest in Art Nouveau – the decorative-arts craze that flourished in Europe and the British Isles from 1890 to 1910. The Nouveau movement – with its sinuous, elongated and asymmetrical forms – took inspiration from wild nature. It was a folksy alternative to the neoclassical style, which was all about symmetry and grandeur and had dominated for much of the previous two centuries.

When Mr. Bykewich and his wife, Geneviève, a journalist, acquired a $405,000 property in Edmonton’s Old Strathcona neighbourhood, he saw a chance not only to build a forever home for his family (the couple has two young boys) but also to experiment with curvilinear shapes, the kind you don’t often see on the Prairies. As the principal of Ethos Engineering, a local consulting firm, Mr. Bykewich possessed the expertise necessary to pull such a project off. And while the house is by no means an exemplar of Art Nouveau design – it feels, with its heavy timber, rough finishes and rugged masonry, very much like a Prairie home – it nevertheless draws loosely on Nouveau principles. It is an assemblage of irregular, curvy forms in a city where such things are rare.

If, in Edmonton and elsewhere, homebuilders tend to prefer angular over curved structures, it’s partly because these are the easiest forms to create. Lumber comes in planks. Bricks and cinderblocks are rectangular. To arrange or stack these materials in the most sensible way is to build a house that looks, well, like a house – a boxy structure, perhaps with a gabled or hipped roof. Sure, you’re free to bend the walls or sculpt the rooms if you want to, but this takes effort, time and engineering savvy.

On the other hand, when else was Mr. Bykewich going to get such a chance? “This was the first project in my career where I had a blank page,” he says. “I thought, ‘If I want to realize some of the crazy ideas that have been floating around in my head, what would that look like?’ It’s not very often that you get an opportunity to build something from scratch.”

Using Autodesk Revit, a 3-D-modelling application, he designed a two-storey, 1,950-square-foot home with a rounded front façade, a terraced second-floor balcony, and two main spaces – a kitchen-dining area with concrete floors on the ground level and a living room with maple floors above – both with irregular shapes. (The more conventionally shaped master bedroom is tucked behind the upstairs living room, and the children’s bedrooms are in the basement, overlooking a lightwell.)

To produce curved walls, a builder must find ways to make rounded forms out of rectangular materials. Using a jigsaw, Mr. Bykewich cut sinuous, parabolic strips of plywood. These pieces served as the bottom plates for the walls. He mounted vertical studs on top of them and then wrapped the drywall, which had been watered down to increase malleability, around the studs so that it mimicked the curvilinear shapes of the underlying plates.

The walls aren’t the only distinctive feature in the home. Mr. Bykewich had all of the front-facing windows custom fabricated; like the rooms, they are more pond-shaped than circular. The exposed beams on the ground floor are arranged in a tree-like pattern. Thick spans of Douglas-fir glulam, an engineered wood product, extrude diagonally from a central concrete column. These pieces then bifurcate and give way to lighter beams, just as a bough gives way to branches and twigs.

The best element in the house is the first one you see. In the foyer, a few feet past the entrance, Mr. Bykewich set a five-foot-high trombe wall – a masonry structure that absorbs solar energy streaming in through the windows, thereby cooling the interiors by day. It is clad in a mixture of found stones and salvaged bricks, all set in a “free lay” pattern: the rows bend and turn randomly, as if drawn by hand. “The wall looks geological,” Mr. Bykewich says, “like a natural deposition.”

These unique flourishes belie the technical sophistication of the home, which is outfitted with thick exterior walls, an energy-recovery ventilator and a hydronic heating system, whereby water is pumped though a network of tubes beneath the floors. Unlike a conventional radiator, which blasts heat from a fixed point, this system runs everywhere and therefore heats the home with minimal energy inputs. To get a room up to a comfortable 20 C, you must heat the water to a mere 22 C. Because he put in much of his own labour, Mr. Bykewich kept construction-and-material costs down to $475,000, and he expects to save on energy expenditures as the years go by.

For such an experimental project, there’s a strong element of Prairie pragmatism at play. The house has little of the delicacy one associates with Art Nouveau. But that’s not the point. Imagine an alternative universe in which elements of Nouveau had somehow migrated to the Prairies and become enmeshed, however vaguely, in the local building vernacular. Mr. Bykewich’s house exists in such a world. When discussing his stylistic choices, he speaks not in the manner of an effete craftsman but rather like a pioneer homesteader. “This is our piece of land,” he says. “We can do whatever we want with it.”

The action

Open this photo in gallery This 1960s home with an attached garage was extensively renovated with new roofing, windows and operating systems. Royal LePage West Realty Group Ltd.

Agent Nutan Brown’s clients were on the hunt for a turnkey bungalow and spotted a “Coming Soon” sign outside this updated, three-bedroom bungalow in May. It was being staged, but they were granted a tour, and decided to lodge their bid before others could see it.

“We were able to arrange a visit and viewing,” Ms. Brown said. But she said the sign had also grabbed the attention of another potential buyer. “Another agent also called, so it wasn’t a slam dunk. We ended up competing - before it’d gone to market,” Ms. Brown said.

“We had been looking for two years,” Ms. Brown said. “This home checked all the boxes, and sometimes when you let that slip, it can take another two years to come along. So they really wanted this home badly.”

Story continues below advertisement

What they got

Over the past 15 years, this 1960s home with an attached garage was extensively renovated with new roofing, windows and operating systems, as well as a remodelled kitchen with a granite-topped island and heated floors.

The flooring is also heated in the basement suite, where there is a galley kitchen, bathroom and separate entry.

Wood burning and gas fireplaces are featured in entertaining areas on the main and lower levels.

The agent’s take

“It feels like it has been loved and beautifully maintained. There’s pride of ownership throughout, there was nothing of concern, so we didn’t even do a home inspection,” Ms. Brown said.

The action

For the first week of exposure in April, this two-storey house was completely vacant, but not a single buyer requested to step inside. An online virtual tour with computer-generated staging was posted and some bargain hunters made low-ball verbal offers, which were rejected. More serious shoppers trickled through the house in person in the first half of May.

“The fear was so high, but then it picked up like crazy because people realized new listings are not coming out every week right now, and for how long?” agent Robert Nelson said.

“In that area, we happened to be only one of four properties and we happened to be the lowest priced property, so all those things came together for us.”

“It’s a four-bedroom home, but the footprint of the house from front to back is not very deep,” Mr. Nelson said.

“That style in the 60s was all about having a driveway and nice set back from the street, and a good-sized yard.”

Like many realtors working Canada’s recreational markets, David Jurek says he’s seen properties move unusually quickly since the start of COVID-19.

The Re/Max real estate agent in 100 Mile House, B.C., recently listed a $140,000 home in an off-the-grid region where he’s had difficulty in the past: “The last and only sale that we had there took about three years to sell,” Mr. Jurek says. “I listed this property thinking, ‘Okay, well, this year maybe we’ll get more action.‘”

But shortly after listing, Mr. Jurek started receiving daily inquiries on the house. Before long, he had three offers on it.

“Some of the stuff that normally would sit, that wasn’t as choice of a property necessarily in the past is now selling very quickly,” Mr. Jurek says.

He attributes the quick heat-up in the B.C. recreational property market to COVID-19 lockdown orders, part of a growing trend in which Canadians are looking to vacation property in search of space, an alternative place from which to work remotely or a driveable vacation destination while travel is not an option.

“People who maybe weren’t in the second home and recreational market before are now saying, ‘Hey, we need to do that. If we can make it happen let’s make it happen,’” Mr. Jurek says.

He’s seen month-over-month sales increase by an estimated 30 per cent in his region since the start of the pandemic. And while demand has risen across the market, he says prices have yet to climb to match, so those looking to buy should explore their options quickly.

The same has occurred in the greater Vancouver region, home to the Sunshine Coast and Whistler, according to Colette Gerber, realtor at Sutton West Coast Realty and chair of the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver. “Last month we saw a 21-per-cent increase in sales,” Ms. Gerber says. “So, yes, it looks like vacation homes are now becoming a hot commodity.”

The Muskoka region and other parts of Ontario’s cottage country have seen similar upticks in demand, according to David Reid, sales representative at Enjoy Muskoka Realty in Gravenhurst, Ont., and former president of the Ontario Real Estate Association. “One of the big drivers really is high speed internet,” he says. “You’ve got such great quality internet now and the paradigms have changed.”

Not every cottage comes with strong cell or web service, of course, and for many this is a non-starter. Those unfamiliar with the area in which they’re shopping should look for a realtor who knows the region well, all three agents suggest.

While this rule typically goes without saying, it’s especially important when searching for lakefront, rural and two- or three-season properties, which come with their own quirks. In B.C., for example, it’s important to understand the underground system from which a property sources its water, Ms. Gerber says. “You need local knowledge to know what the ramifications are, how to deal with a well, how to deal with septic fields,” she says.

And in lake country, buyers should understand the permitting rules and nuances of the specific piece of water they’re looking at. A good realtor with hyperlocal knowledge can help with this.

“We do have a lot of waterfront, but it can be very different from one lake to the next,” Mr. Jurek says of 100 Mile House. “Are you wanting to buy that second property and be able to water ski or are you just wanting to be able to fish? What lake you back on to determines what you can expect that you can do there.”

Recreational properties also come with their own specific maintenance requirements. While year-round homes have owners’ constant attention, summer spots need an extra set of eyes (and hands, in the event of snowfall) during colder months.

Mr. Reid suggests finding a helpful neighbour or enlisting the services of a local road maintenance or cottage sitter program, such as Muskoka Cottage Sitters, which typically comes with fees of a few hundred dollars a month but offers owners peace of mind and protection from accidents.

In addition to maintenance fees, prospective buyers should budget for repairs and winter-proofing expenses – such as replacing windows, adding insulation and updating utilities – which can run in the thousands depending on what a home needs. Ensuring that a house is protected from winter weather will “keep insurance happy,” Mr. Jurek says. “If you don’t follow the proper procedures and you have a problem, you don’t want to be denied the claim.”

While the costs of owning vacation property go far beyond a home’s sale price, first-time buyers shouldn’t be intimidated. Go into the process with eyes wide open, do your research, spend a few days in the area and ask your realtor as many questions as possible. The more you know about a home, the better.

“The best way to find a vacation home is start driving,” Ms. Gerber says. “Go to these areas. Look around.”

The backstory

Open this photo in gallery The side of the living room that creates a passage to the back patio has the original brick and beam. Andrea Simone/Andrea Simone

In 1999, Merike Bauer’s parents, Ants and Laurel Reigo, searched for a building that had both a space to work and a place to call home. The couple were also looking for a large space, something they were already used to after living and working in a small converted warehouse at Lansdowne Avenue and Dupont Street that had an art studio, a residence and commercial space.

“It was like an early loft conversion from the 80s,” Ms. Bauer says.

Her parents found what they were looking for at 1205 Bathurst St. They bought the 8,730-square-foot property soon after seeing a “For Sale” sign outside the building. The couple knew immediately that it was a place where they could have the same sort of lifestyle as in their previous home, while still maintaining their business.

“They just drove by and saw it,” Ms. Bauer says. “We’ve always felt lucky to have found it when we did.”

Since then, the building has been shared among three generations of Ms. Bauer’s family. “It was myself, my parents and my grandmother who all lived in the building,” she says. The ground floor was originally occupied by Ms. Bauer’s parents’ working space, the Studio 8 Graphics Fine Art Printing Studio.

The former Studio 8 Graphics shop is now the offices of Ms. Bauer’s architecture firm, Reigo & Bauer, run by Meriko and Stephen Bauer. There are two more commercial rental units on the ground floor; one, with tall ceilings and glass block clerestory, is currently used by a Pilates studio. The other unit, located at the front of the building, is used as a private office. The ground floor also has a large undeveloped studio space where Mr. Reigo spends time painting.

“The ‘raw’ studio space is the part of the printing shop my dad retained and still had set up for printing and with his risers for printing,” Ms. Bauer says.

The second floor has two apartments; Meriko, her husband and their children, as well as Ms. Bauer’s parents, live on this floor. It also features a 2,000-square-foot rooftop garden that sits between the two apartments. Bauer’s apartment is located in front of the building, her parents at the back of the building.

Over the years, and especially since her parents retired from their printing business, Ms. Bauer and her husband have made changes to the building. “My husband and I started a design practice, so we converted some of the building over to a studio space for our business,” Ms. Bauer says.

Most of the units in the building have been rejuvenated and modernized, including some elements that date from the 1930s such as the gumwood doors with etched glass panels. The building now includes built-in cabinetry, a modern kitchen with marble counters and hardwood flooring throughout. A scissor lift was also installed to help bring large-scale plants to the rooftop garden and assist Ms. Bauer’s mother with mobility issues. The side of the living room that creates a passage to the back patio has the original brick and beam and all the windows have been replaced with high efficiency glazing that has a solar reflective element. Ms. Bauer says the redesign has been gradual as the building’s attributes have been slowly revealed. “Architectural qualities are seen and brought back to life. There’s different approaches that have been taken in different spaces,” Ms. Bauer says.

Ms. Bauer and her family love the flexibility a large and varied space has given them. “[It has] allowed us over the years to have a lot of different solutions to our living and working conditions,” she says.

Real estate agent Susan Delean says the building offers a timely live/work solution for a potential buyer. “We’re living in a time where you have to work from home. … It provides almost like a textbook COVID response … in terms of your living environment and your working environment, this property is like tailored made for that,” Ms. Delean says.

Ms. Bauer says living and working in the same space is also family friendly, making it easier to take care of the kids after school, or when they are sick at home. And raising their children in a multi-generational building has helped create a closer bond between them and their grandparents. “We’ve found [that] our kids are getting to grow up with a second set of parents… which has been a very lovely thing,” Ms. Bauer says.

She says the area blends the best parts of a residential neighbourhood and commercial life. “It’s a neighbourhood that is a very desirable place for families and businesses alike,” Ms. Bauer says.

Ms. Bauer says the rooftop garden is one of her favourite spaces, and one the family has spent more than two decades working on. Ms. Delean says the spot is breathtaking. “You cannot walk onto that rooftop and not have your jaw drop,” she says.

But Ms. Bauer, her greatest joy was to see the multiple generations of her family grow in the building over years and the memories created from the time she lived with here with her family while in university, to the time of renovations and the creating of different spaces. “The fact that we started here with my grandmother, my parents and me… we’ve been able to adapt the building to suit our needs.”

Medical waivers. Masks. Virtual showings. Seven-figure purchases, sight unseen.

Home buying and selling has seen a head-snapping shift during the COVID-19 era, as both parties deal with the demands of physical distancing, virtual showings and previously unheard-of safety considerations.

One thing that hasn’t changed is the competition: Most major Canadian markets are as buoyant as ever after a brief slump and in defiance of gloomy forecasts about the impact the pandemic could have on real estate activity.

But the nuts and bolts of the process – how buyers and sellers interact and how realtors work with both – looks dramatically different than it did a few months ago, forcing years’ worth of sales innovation into just a few months.

Here are a few of the biggest changes:

Say goodbye to open houses

So much for perusing open houses as a weekend pastime. Physical distancing brought group showings to an abrupt halt this spring. As restrictions eased nationwide, open houses slowly started up again. In Ontario, for example, the province lifted its prohibition in most areas on July 17 as part of its Stage 3 reopening.

Still, open houses are nowhere near as common as they once were. Sellers remain wary of inviting large groups of people to traipse through their homes and some renters’ groups have spoken out against them as well.

“Before you could have upwards of two or three different agents with groups, at any given time, showing the same property,” says Darren Josephs, a Toronto Re/Max agent. “Now, the windows are 15-to-30 minutes and no overlap.”

Also, each client goes through individually, following sanitizing protocols before and after each visit. And there’s no such thing as dropping in with a moment’s notice, Mr. Josephs says.

“I think a lot of people were never entirely comfortable with open houses, especially sellers,” he says. “I think we’ll see a real long-term effect from this and more qualified showings, which tend to weed out people who aren’t serious.”

Story continues below advertisement

Vancouver-based independent realtor Chris Strand says there’s a “split in the realtor community” on the issue. He points out that realtors can often pick up new clients at open houses. However, he agrees that a decline in open houses – at least as we once knew them – may be one of the biggest long-term changes to emerge from the pandemic.

Better digital sales tools

The era of out-of-focus photos and sparse online listings is over, according to Patti Ross, a Royal LePage realtor in Halifax.

“You’ve always seen listings and asked, ‘Why are the photos so bad?’” she says. “We were proactive in my brokerage years ago in stepping up online marketing and building a photography and video department and it’s really paying off now.”

Open this photo in gallery Mr. Strand says a rise in virtual house touring may be due to the current bull market in housing. DARRYL DYCK/The Globe and Mail

Realtors have also long been limited in the number of photographs they can use on listings but, from coast-to-coast, those limits have been bumped up, allowing potential buyers to get a better sense of a property before arranging a viewing.

“Our real estate board just upped our photo count from 20 to 40,” Mr. Strand says, “and we’re seeing more people hiring professional videographers and using virtual walk-through tools.”

Sometimes that means 360-degree photos tours and, for high-end properties, it can mean full-blown immersive 3D renders of a property’s interior. That can help drive more selective, qualified showings, and fewer potential buyers arranging a viewing out of curiosity, only to show up and quickly realize the property isn’t right for them.

More safety protocols

When in-person viewings do take place, safety has become a top priority. In most cases, realtors will go into homes in advance, opening every door, cabinet and cupboard for clients.

“We ask that visitors treat the house like a museum,” Mr. Josephs says. “No touching.”

Potential buyers sign waivers attesting to their lack of COVID-19 symptoms and international travel. And everyone – buyers, sellers and agents – wear masks and keep the mandated two-metre distance.

Even Ms. Ross’ photographers and videographers make sure their gear is sanitized before it enters a property and they clean it thoroughly once they leave.

Some realtors hope that better safety protocols can instill more confidence in sellers to list their homes.

Major markets nationwide are currently grappling with a serious imbalance between supply and demand, as buyers return to the market in droves, but sellers remain shy. ""

Story continues below advertisement

You definitely see people waiting or holding off on listing,” Ms. Ross says. “But once you talk to people and tell them about process, they feel better.”

More risk-taking

That imbalance between buyers and sellers has also made markets more competitive. In Halifax, Ms. Ross recently sold one suburban property listed at $229,000 for $55,000 over asking, after entertaining more than 30 offers. In Vancouver, Mr. Strand is seeing similar activity, as is Mr. Josephs in Toronto, where he recently sold one home for $350,000 over asking, after 26 offers.

More buyers are also signing off on purchases remotely. In June, Nanos Research conducted a poll for the Ontario Real Estate Association that revealed 42 per cent of buyers were open to buying a home even if they could only see it online beforehand.

Ms. Ross says she’s noticed more buyers willing to purchase places sight unseen. (Atlantic Canada’s current self-isolation restrictions for out-of-region travellers mean visiting the region to house-hunt is especially impractical).

“We’re doing virtual tours that allow people to shop from Ontario or Vancouver,” she says, “and walk through the house remotely.”

She’s also begun doing walk-through video tours of neighbourhoods. A video tour showcasing sports facilities and outdoor trails near one property recently helped seal the deal with one out-of-province family.

Story continues below advertisement

Mr. Strand is seeing the same kind of activity in Vancouver.

“We’re using FaceTime, and I’ve had potential buyers from Ontario, Alberta, and several from Hong Kong,” he says.

Mr. Strand says some of that activity may be due to the current bull market in housing. But most industry watchers, including major banks and the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation, are still forecasting at least a modest decline in home prices over the coming year. As sellers re-enter the market, spiralling prices may well simmer down – good news for buyers already struggling with deteriorating affordability.

But even if markets re-balance, there seems little doubt that COVID-19 will result in lasting changes to the way Canadians buy and sell homes.

“Anything could happen in the next few months,” Mr. Strand says. “We’re all just waiting to see what sticks as we keep going through this and what goes back to the way it was before.”",1162,0.8943713938325776,business

Josie Kao/The Globe and Mail

A new five-storey laneway apartment building in Vancouver’s Commercial Drive neighbourhood offers a glimpse into the future of density in the city, while also raising questions about who exactly density is for in Vancouver.

The development, designed by Cornerstone Architecture, is around a month from completion and soon to go on the rental market. Its uniqueness lies in its height and location at the backend of a larger property, much like a laneway house, which architect Scott Kennedy quipped about on Twitter.

This is our 5 storey version of a laneway house on a 33’ corner lot. 8 suites. Heritage building in front preserved. Unfortunately not a passive house pic.twitter.com/Ycxb3mtVad — Scott Kennedy (@ScottMKennedy) May 12, 2020

The infill development has four one-bedroom units and four two-bedroom units spread over four floors, in addition to a ground floor serving as a lobby area. The building was also developed under heritage requirements, which necessitated preserving the heritage building at the front end of the property. Cornerstone architect Luke Han, who worked closely on the project, says he had to get creative with the tight property lines in order to fit all eight units on the 9,560-square-foot site, although they were able to receive a slight exemption to the height limit.

From the city’s perspective, the compromises were worth it because of the large incentive to secure market rentals along Commercial Drive, a highly sought-after neighbourhood in Vancouver. City of Vancouver director of development services Andrea Law believes this type of development is indicative of the direction that the city hopes to pursue.

However, while the building, which is located at 1102 Commercial Drive, does increase the number of rental units available in a competitive part of the city, there are concerns as to who the target renter is.

“It’s unclear to me who the units are for,” says Lisa Moffatt, an urban planner and owner of the consulting firm Resilience Planning who lives in the neighbourhood. While she appreciates that the development activates an underutilized laneway, she points out that the units are market rentals, meaning that a large segment of Vancouver will be unable to afford them, an exclusion that particularly affects marginalized groups.

While the units are not available yet, Mr. Kennedy estimates that the one-bedroom units should go anywhere from $1,700-$1,800 a month, while the two-bedroom units would cost between $2,200-$2,500 a month.

Vancouver’s 10-year housing plan, approved in 2017, set out a goal of having 50 per cent of new homes being affordable for family households earning under $80,000. Affordability in Vancouver is defined as spending less than 30 per cent of one’s income before taxes on rent, meaning that a household earning $80,000 a year would pay at most $2,000 a month.

However, Vancouver’s 2020 progress report on its housing plan shows that the city is far behind its affordability goals. In 2019, Vancouver built just 61 below-market rental units, short of its goal of 400. In the three years since the plan was approved, only 34 per cent of approved homes have been affordable to incomes below $80,000.

Story continues below advertisement

The units being sold at market price is one reason Ms. Moffatt is critical of the development, but she believes the conversation should be more focused around challenging what planners mean when they talk about density.

“I think we keep asking the wrong question in the density-slash-affordability conversations,” she says. “What is the problem we’re trying to address with density? It’s unclear. Is it to provide more housing or affordable housing? Providing more density is like a Band Aid; it doesn’t get to the root causes of what made housing unaffordable.”

She says that rather than just saturating the market to address affordability, it would be more effective to take an intersectional approach to planning. Current mainstream discussions around density ignore social determinants of health, income, race and disability, which effectively exclude large segments of Vancouver’s population and heighten the housing crisis, Ms. Moffatt says.

For instance, Vancouver’s housing report recognizes that Indigenous peoples in the city are disproportionately affected by the housing crisis and includes pledges to rectify the issue. However, Ms. Moffatt says she has yet to see any tangible progress.

“Vancouver made a commitment to reconciliation several years ago,” she says. “That needs to be taken into consideration where housing is concerned and recognizing that we are all operating on stolen land.”

Vancouver’s 2019 housing report also found that the number of unsheltered homeless people in the city increased in the year prior by 122 people, with 40 per cent of the population identifying as Indigenous. Indigenous peoples only account for 2.2 per cent of Vancouver’s wider population.

“When we talk about density, what I wonder is, what does a decolonial approach to density look like, and why are we not asking that question?” Ms. Moffatt says.

Like Ms. Moffatt, Mr. Kennedy also has concerns around discussions of density, as he cautions against approaching it as the solution to rising house prices.

“Is more density going to make it more affordable? Not necessarily, because the price of land goes up when the density goes up. So you have to somehow control the price of land as you get density.”

He is particularly concerned about densification’s effects on Vancouver’s more unique neighbourhoods. It isn’t only that small businesses tend to get pushed out when commercials streets are targeted for densification, he says, but that commercials streets are more likely to be targeted in the first place.

A better future for density could look like gentler developments or densifications in the lanes behind commercials streets, Mr. Kennedy says. In either case, his firm’s new development could act as a model for future developments.

These pressures around densification are not lost on the city, Ms. Law says, and discussions around it are always evolving at the municipal level around how to better support communities and neighbourhoods experiencing change.

At the end of it all, any conversation around housing in Vancouver must be about listening to the needs of the community and looking at how those needs can best be met.

“It’s really about balancing the tradeoffs,” she says.

While this new development is a fairly simple project and in fact is under the maximum allowable density, it is notable because of the role it plays in Vancouver’s larger plans for increasing density.

As Vancouver moves forward with its plan to dramatically increase the number of units available to residents of all incomes, its laneways may soon be seeing more of these types of developments accompanied by more questions around what density means.

The listing agents had prepared a walkthrough video and 3-D dollhouse tour for this four-bedroom house less than 500 metres from Runnymede subway station and High Park. But in early June, upward of 70 potential buyers wanted a closer look, even if it meant travel and health disclosures, viewing restrictions and long wait times.

“There were times I couldn’t show my own listing,” agent Mark Oulahen said. “There were no overlapping appointments and 30-minute appointments max, so they just filled in.” In the end, he received 16 offers.

“In the previous week, there were some sales that posted for decent numbers, so it gave us confidence the market was there.”

As a concession to the COVID-19 pandemic, masks and hand sanitizer were provided to visitors of this newly renovated corner penthouse. But the seller – an interior designer – resisted suggestions that she accept a deep discount on the price, holding fast to her asking price for two months. After about 40 interested buyers had inspected the space, she finally agreed to an offer $55,500 below asking.

“Because of COVID, there were a lot of people who thought to make a low-ball [offer],” agent Robin Pope said. “But there was no market data to support that, nor was there any market data to support that it was a buyers’ market.

Brought to you by At Home is a five-part series that asks Canadians to share what home ownership means to them from the perspective of the head and the heart. Contemplating making upgrades to your home? Advice from an HSBC mortgage specialist can help make it happen.

Julian Compton and Amber Kueneman were ready to start the next chapter of their lives with a home big enough for a family.

After living in a condo for three lively years full of parties, travel and work events, they decided it was time to slow down and start a family on a quiet little street in a kid-friendly neighbourhood.

They found their dream home in Toronto’s Don Mills area, Julian’s old stomping grounds, where he spent part of his childhood.

Story continues below advertisement

For Julian, 34, who, with his mother, sells real estate, moving into his old neighbourhood meant reacquainting himself with his community and childhood friends. For Amber, the trees, parks and friendly vibe reminded her of her childhood growing up in Kitchener, Ont.

Their three-bedroom, three-level, 1950s-style townhouse needed some work, but at $720,000, the price was right and the financial transition relatively easy because, unlike many young couples, they had skipped the renting stage and had been able to buy their condo, which had appreciated in value and built up equity that they could put to use.

“It gave us an opportunity to buy down the road,” says Amber, 36, a shopping marketing manager in the food and beverage industry.

The couple took ownership in the fall of 2018. In February of this year, their daughter Lucia was born.

“For all of Lucia’s life, we’ve been in lockdown,” says Amber. “Our home is like a sacred temple, away from the battleground outside.”

Although she can’t do the things she was looking forward to as a new mother — Mommy Mondays, swimming together, overnight stays with her parents in Kitchener — Amber says the extra bonding time they have had together as a family unit has been a blessing.

“Julian is my village,” she says. “He’s working from home, so he is able to help out with the baby. We’ve established a really nice, relaxed routine that would have been hard to do [otherwise].”

Story continues below advertisement

Part of the routine includes lots of cooking in the newly opened-up kitchen, as well as reading and gardening. They also renovated the basement and set up a gym soon after the pandemic restrictions came in.

“We have renovated a lot of the house since we moved in,” she says of the projects that total approximately $50,000 to date. “Every corner feels good because we put our blood, sweat and tears into it.”

Julian and Amber embarked on the buying process by enlisting a bank and a mortgage specialist. They’re grateful that their bank helped them to see the full picture.

“[The bank] was proactive and upfront about mortgage rates, taxes and lawyers’ fees,” Julian says.

Amber agrees. “That conversation is important to understand your debts and that you have to have enough for a down payment plus other expenses.”

Unfortunately, not all banks are created equal. Take the time to find a bank you’re comfortable with and that wants to do what’s best for you.

“That’s one of the advantages of working with HSBC,” says Matt Mercer, Head of the Mortgage Centre at HSBC Bank Canada in Toronto. “We are a bank with mortgage specialists that can help homeowners understand their financial situation and provide a mortgage that best suits their needs.”

For some, it’s a fixed rate. For others it’s variable, depending on how comfortable people are with where interest rates may go and the amount of flexibility they want with their mortgage, Matt says.

“When looking for a mortgage, it’s always a good idea to find someone who talks to you about your lifestyle and your future plans,” he says. “Mortgage specialists help you assess your situation and find the mortgage that is right for you.”

By having a full discussion, Matt says they can help you identify and account for lifestyle factors that you may not even have considered.

“Everyone’s situation is unique and that’s why it’s important to work with a mortgage specialist to understand your individual situation and a bank you know and trust.”

We’re loving [our home] now and updating it as we go. And one day, we can use the equity to buy a bigger place — as our family grows. JULIAN COMPTON

What advice do the couple have for new homeowners?

Story continues below advertisement

“It may sound basic,” Amber says, “but if you’re buying a house with someone, you need to figure out where you want to be. What if one wants to live in the east end and the other wants to be in the west? You have to agree on location from the start and get to know the market. And also figure out how you are going to pay bills. Who is responsible for what, like hydro, groceries, insurance?”

Next, seek out someone who is an expert in mortgages. “You might think you can afford a two-bedroom house, but in reality, it could be a one-bedroom condo, or conversely, you may be able to afford more than you think,” Julian says.

Finally, keep your goals in mind — including long-term.

The couple plan to use their townhome as a stepping-stone to a semi-detached when their five-year mortgage is over.

“We’re loving it now and updating it as we go,” Julian says. “And one day, we can use the equity to buy a bigger place — as our family grows.”

In the meantime, they are enjoying their new lives and community and strengthening their relationship as a new family.

“The two things that make it different is it’s a very small condominium with two homes, and it’s a modern semi,” Mr. Johnston said.

“Instead of being divided along the length of the lot, they’re more or less divided by the width of the lot, so … it’s a clever way of building because you get the benefit of a wide home with lots of windows and nice room sizes.”

“All the framing was done in a factory, so all the walls fit perfectly, arrived preinsulated and presheathed, and over the course of five days it was put up, so the benefit was the speed of construction, accuracy and nothing gets exposed to the elements,” Mr. Johnston said.

“These are really well designed, but they’re also environmentally sensitive homes.”

While the economy has been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, realtors have been seeing activity return and say the real estate market might rebound much faster than anticipated

The real estate market in the Greater Toronto Area was red-hot at the start of the year, with a low interest rate environment and strong employment growth.

Then, of course, COVID-19 came along and shattered those prospects.

Story continues below advertisement

With mandated business closures and a loss of consumer confidence, The Conference Board of Canada expects to see an 8.2 per cent contraction of the Canadian economy this year – the worst annual contraction on record – according to its Canadian Outlook Summary: Summer 2020.

The think tank also forecasts a decline of 11 per cent in the average home price between the first and third quarters of this year.

But it’s not all bad news: The Conference Board expects the economy will rebound by 6.7 per cent in 2021 and 4.8 per cent in 2022, depending on how well the post-COVID recovery is managed and if there’s a second wave severe enough to shut down the economy again.

“There are a lot of unknowns floating around out there,” says Robin Wiebe, the board’s chief economist. “The question is how is employment going to recover, because employment is critical to the housing market.”

Another factor is the desirability of living downtown, after this period of residents being cooped up in condos with lack of green space. It’s the “topic du jour,” Wiebe says, because several companies have decided to permanently scrap the office, so employees might now consider moving to a larger property outside of the GTA.

But Toronto has experienced rapid population growth in recent years, so there’s also pent-up demand.

“Once COVID-19 is past and hopefully most people are back to work, the underlying demographics are favourable,” Wiebe says. “Toronto is not overbuilt by any stretch.”

This is also what realtors are seeing on the ground. “We’ve already seen a dramatic uptick in national activity in May and June, and we expect this trend to continue through the summer,” says Christopher Alexander, executive vice-president and regional director with RE/MAX of Ontario-Atlantic Canada.

“We credit this to the pre-existing pent-up demand for homes in hot markets such as Vancouver, Toronto and Ottawa, which helped mitigate the decline in transactions that were paused due to the pandemic.”

The Canadian market saw a steep year-over-year decline in the volume of transactions during the peak of COVID-19, according to data from RE/MAX Canada.

However, exceptionally low inventory in much of Canada has been a key factor in price stability throughout the pandemic, Alexander says, and will likely result in continued upward price pressure as restrictions ease and demand increases further.

“We’re already seeing a return to pre-pandemic activity – and then some – with multiple-offer scenarios in markets like Toronto, Ottawa and Vancouver. This indicates to us that markets could improve much faster than we initially anticipated at the beginning of COVID-19,” Alexander says.

According to a Leger survey conducted on behalf of RE/MAX Canada, 56 per cent of Canadians planning to engage in the real estate market expect to do so in less than a year.

While sales volumes have declined, prices have held, says Jared Menkes, executive vice-president of high-rise residential with Menkes Developments. “We are seeing signs of pent-up demand and positive sentiments among buyers, with the number of inquiries and people resuming their housing research growing every week.”

Although COVID-19 has put a pause on peoples’ lives, “their changing housing needs don’t just go away,” Menkes says.

“People are still getting engaged, having babies or wanting to move out from their family homes. If anything, being at home during COVID has caused many households to re-evaluate their space needs and made them realize that they do need to upsize or upgrade their existing home.”

Indeed, more people are looking for “vacation-like properties,” he says, and there has been a surge in demand for homes that have active areas and green spaces. That has been a key focus for Menkes for some time now – certainly before the pandemic.

“Sugar Wharf is a perfect example of a project that was developed with a resort-like theme, aimed at offering future residents a wide range of outdoor amenities, plus the development includes a new two-acre community park,” Menkes says.

The developer has continued this focus with its Mobilio project located in Vaughan. Aside from the outdoor spaces it’s creating within the development, the site will also be anchored by a linear park, part of Vaughan’s Black Creek renewal project. Once completed, it will establish a series of promenades and parks that span more than 30 acres.

“While we aim to incorporate these aspects into the development and design of our projects, we also look at what the surrounding area will offer,” Menkes says. For example, with a project like Sugar Wharf, residents will also have easy access to the Toronto waterfront and islands.

Shane Baghai, president of Baghai Developments, is also seeing the market start to pick up, after delays related to shipping and new construction protocols.

“COVID really did a number on builders,” he says. “Now things are starting to move and I see vibrancy in the city.”

Indeed, as far as the market is concerned, “it’s almost as buoyant and active as before, in some cases even more so.”

With first-time buyers, “condo sales have probably dropped marginally,” Baghai says, but there’s demand for two- and three-bedroom condos, particularly if those condo units have large balconies or terraces. Leaside Manor, for example, is well-suited to meet this demand with spacious two- and three-bedroom suites plus den.

“We’ve been pleasantly surprised – we’ve got a ton of interest,” says Bill Gairdner, founder and president of Gairloch Developments, which launched its eight-storey development at 1414 Bayview at the start of June. “We’re at 35 per cent sold, so that was really positive considering there was no launch event or flashy festivities.”

Like other Menkes developments, Festival offers residents essential connection to nature. Homes that offer green space have been a focus for Menkes even before the era of COVID-19. COURTESY OF MENKES DEVELOPMENTS

Launching in June was “somewhat of a risky move,” Gairdner says. “The vast majority of developers I know have all deferred to the fall with the idea that the fall will be a new world order.”

But he says there’s not a lot of product like 1414 Bayview in the Leaside neighbourhood, “so there’s pent-up demand,” he says.

“So it’s not reflective of the whole market. I don’t think it’s indicative of how condos are doing industry-wide. Our business model is well aligned with COVID or post-COVID.”

The condominium has only 44 units, many with generous private terraces and fewer communal spaces or shared amenities that tenants may be reluctant to use, especially if there’s a second wave of COVID-19 in the fall. At the same time, buyers want to make sure they have access to outdoor spaces.

“The neighbourhood itself is the amenity: the Don Valley trails, the Mount Pleasant Cemetery, the retail strip up and down Bayview,” Gairdner says.

“None of our projects have been too focused on saunas or spas or pools. It’s all very understated, more boutique style.”

RE/MAX expects to see relative price stability by the end of 2020, with a possible price correction in the single digits.

“That said, due to the high degree of uncertainty around the pandemic and a possible second wave in the fall, it’s difficult to predict beyond 2020 at this time,” Alexander says.

“If the first wave of COVID-19 has taught us anything, it’s to expect the unexpected and be prepared to pivot.”

This large heritage home came to market just as the full brunt of the COVID-19 pandemic was being felt, so the fact the owners were not in residence helped ensure social distancing between guests and made the extra cleaning measures a bit easier.

“In April, everyone was still very concerned [about COVID-19], so selling a vacant home was an advantage,” agent Michael O’Brien said.

“We put it on the market and ended up having two offers in two days.”

This 2½-storey house was one of six built in 1885 for the physicians and managers employed at the hospital nearby, now known as Bridgepoint. Much of the interior has been painstakingly preserved. There are fireplaces in the living and dining rooms and in the second-floor family room.

The furnace and roofing have been recently replaced and the eat-in kitchen has new ceramic floors. A walkout gives access to the south-facing deck and 25-foot-by-113-foot lot.

“This was a special house. It was large and detached, and in original condition, which people like,” Mr. O’Brien said.

“There are three original fireplaces, and all the original trims, mouldings and ceiling medallions.”

“Simpson Avenue is a great location because it’s in prime Riverdale, but it’s at the south end so you can get downtown quickly,” Mr. O’Brien said.

“And it has a nice south lot and two-car legal parking in the front, which is rare.”

“It was a side entrance, centre-hall home with a private drive and a detached, double garage, which is a great asset.”

This 10-year-old semi-detached house has been on the market for over a year, listed with several agents. To offset its location next to commercial businesses and high inventory levels in the neighbourhood, agent Kelsey Jones gave the house a stylish makeover and priced it under $500,000.

Complicating matters, COVID-19 kept buyers away, despite the sellers moving out and strict showing protocols.

“We came to market on March 10, the same week the Alberta government started to impose restrictions and just days before the City of Calgary declared its state of local emergency,” Ms. Jones said.

“The sense of fear in the marketplace had already begun, so we knew we had to really get competitive on pricing if we hoped to have a chance of selling at all. We did end up implementing one price reduction to $489,800 to keep some action on the property and encourage showings.”

What they got

The 1,625-square-foot house has three-bedrooms and an additional 775 square feet of living space in the finished basement. There’s also a double garage on the 25-foot-by-125-foot lot.

Interior finishes have been upgraded, with granite kitchen counters, new hardwood flooring and a gas fireplace in the living and dining area.

There’s an office, four bathrooms and a laundry room upstairs.

The agent’s take

“How buyers viewed spaces during this time quickly changed,” Ms. Jones said.

“All of the sudden you needed a property where you had space for an office, a place to roll out a yoga mat or complete an at-home workout with gyms and yoga studios shut, and of course a yard so that you could step out and get some fresh air and maybe grow a few vegetables with a lot of the parks being shut down. This home offered the space to do it all.”

The back story

Jeanmarie and Chris Hulaj didn’t see themselves as retired. Instead, their new job was renovating their Victorian home – a process that hasn’t truly stopped as they are constantly tinkering with small upgrades.

Purchased five years ago, the house at 14576 Old Simcoe Rd. originally caught the couple’s eyes with its grand details. Despite the ceilings being dropped multiple times, they said they could tell then how high the original ceiling heights were: 11 feet in the lower level and 10 feet in the upper level. Meanwhile, the second floor boasts pine flooring over 140 years old. There is also a curved wall staircase.

“It was a beautiful Victorian house,” said Ms. Hulaj, a retired fashion designer and art teacher.

But it also had plenty of problems, as they would find out after attempting some initial redesign work.

“We were doing a lot of demolition and kept finding out more and more problems with the old house,” said Mr. Hulaj, who used to work in technology, including a stint at The Globe and Mail.

When the interior drywall and those dropped ceilings were removed, it was found that some of the exterior framing was already disintegrating, and there was no real insulation. The house’s galvanized piping and aged wiring also presented a problem with getting insurance. At the same time, the entire upstairs needed new framing because it “was open like a barn with no interior walls at all,” Ms. Hulaj recalled.

As a result, the couple had to replace all the wiring, plumbing, heating, venting and framing, before putting back the drywall and repainting the entire interior of the house.

Open this photo in gallery The extensive renovation involved reframing the home and repainting the entire interior. Lissa Veilleux/Lissa Veilleux (MAC Media)

“We were advised by different people just to sort of patch it up and sell it off as quickly as we could,” Mr. Hulaj said. “We just in good conscience couldn’t do a poor job of that. And we were planning to live here.”

They also couldn’t bear the thought of demolishing the house to build a new one.

“We couldn’t see the math in that one,” Ms. Hulaj said. “Like, why knock down such a beautiful house that has so much potential?”

Instead, they pressed on with their intensive renovation plan. It ultimately took four years, with breaks in between.

The house today

Inside the original Victorian shell, the now-revamped house offers plenty of space for living and entertaining.

There are four bedrooms on the second level, all with their own ensuite bathrooms. On the main floor, the fifth bathroom is attached to a sauna. There is also a spacious formal dining room that can entertain 15 people. Attached to it is a parlour, “a really sweet spot” where the couple likes to spend their evenings playing board games.

But with the couple both being enthusiastic cooks, even dearer to their hearts is the kitchen.

In the 17-by-14-foot room with a hardwood floor, a large granite-top island takes centre stage. The custom cabinetry with solid cherry doors surrounding the space were built by Mr. Hulaj himself.

“We cook in our kitchen almost every night,” Ms. Hulaj said. “We cook a lot of different foods and things that are really time-consuming, so you need a lot of space.”

Besides the main living spaces, there is a loft at the very top of the house and a big workshop space at the back of the detached garage.

The large lot spans 108-by-257 feet and includes an in-ground pool.

“It’s actually quite nice to go and sit around the pool,” Ms. Hulaj said.

“We try to knock off work about three o’clock – the work we’re still doing on the house and everything – and then we’ll just go on the zero-gravity chairs and we’re on vacation.”

But the couple said all the space was too much for just the two of them, so they decided to profit from their love of cooking and open a bed and breakfast.

They started Century House 1879 B & B last summer by placing their bedrooms on Airbnb. With more than 100 bookings since, Ms. Hulaj said they have received mainly compliments about the house from guests – a sentiment reflected in their Airbnb reviews.

“People love the house. They love the character of the house and the one thing a lot of people say about my house is it has a really inviting feel and a very calming feel,” she said.

However, with the COVID-19 pandemic, the couple have had to close down their bed and breakfast. And even though the province has started to reopen, they said physical-distancing measures would have disrupted the social atmosphere they like to foster between guests.

“We’d have to keep our guests separated, where we used to encourage them to socialize,” she said. “It would be running it in different way than we would normally run it and we didn’t feel comfortable with that.”

And with no immediate end in sight for the pandemic to restart the bed and breakfast, the couple said it’s time for them to move on and let others experience all that the house has to offer.

“We have two children, so it’s almost like when your children are growing up and you get to the point where you’ve done everything you can for them and it’s time for them to have other experiences,” Ms. Hulaj said. “And in this case, it’s time for someone else to experience this beautiful house.”

When they first came here from Edmonton five years ago, Barbara Girard and Axel Meisen bought a three-storey house in the Oak Bay enclave.

“We had wanted a bungalow, but our choice was very slim at that time,” said Barbara, adding the house was far too big. “I soon learned that everything I wanted was always on another floor.”

So they were delighted when the realtor who’d sold it to them called to say he had another buyer who’d seen the place when it was up for sale and desperately wanted it. Were they interested in selling?

“But we’ve just unpacked,” Barbara cried when she heard the news. The determined realtor swiftly rephrased the question: “How much will it take?”

A deal was struck and the couple set about finding the home they really wanted.

They found it five doors down — a 1953 rancher with almost 3,000 square feet on one level.

They took it down to the studs and created a home with much larger windows, fewer walls, a 900-square-foot deck and a totally reimagined garden.

It was designed by architect Shauna Makin and built by contractor Nick Kerridge of Re-design Services.

“They are very, very efficient,” said Barbara, noting the company only does one project at a time, giving it complete focus.

The rebuild ended up costing at least 25 per cent less than building new, said the owners, who have lived and worked in three countries and five provinces, and previously built a home from the ground up.

They both delight in the light that suffuses their new home.

It’s one of the things they love most, thanks to the massive windows that replaced the 1950s-style hip-height ones and the east-facing back of the house, now drenched in light every morning.

“It was a major transformation,” said Axel. “And it was very gratifying that we were able to transform not just a house, but a house from the 1950s, into a house for the 21st century.

It also meets their requirements for “very active aging in place,” said the chemical engineer, a former dean of Applied Sciences at UBC, which included the schools of engineering and architecture.

He and Barbara spent time looking at everything from task lighting to walk-in curb-less showers, non-slip tiles, eliminating tripping hazards and creating extra-wide doorways.

“We know our trajectory here,” said Barbara with a smile. “We know where we’re going.”

Interior demolition and renovation began in 2017 and took five months, after which the owners moved back in while the exterior was updated. Landscaping with more than 500 new trees and shrubs came last, all conceived by Barbara.

They installed a high-efficiency HVAC system that provides both heat and air conditioning. Eco-conscious elements in the home include finishes with low off-gassing, natural materials, water-sparing faucets, low-flush toilets, LED lights and on-demand hot water.

The interior design was inspired by a Ted Godwin painting that hangs on a feature wall between the kitchen and living room.

Waterscapes by Godwin, who was known to paint as if he were standing mid-river, are seen throughout the home. His liquid artworks led to their choice of soft blues, greys, pale yellow and a few splashes of red.

“We wanted a peaceful, harmonious, tranquil environment with flexible living space, lots of big window and natural materials,” said Barbara.

All the wood is Canadian, with cherry cabinets, blond maple flooring and many furniture pieces made in the Scandinavian style by an artist in Newfoundland.

The rooms are larger than normal, especially since the couple combined three bedrooms and a hallway at the rear of the house to make one long living room edged in windows opening onto the vast deck.

The former living room is now their master bedroom, and it’s so large that they created a huge storage closet on one side to hold things like luggage, in addition to an ensuite and generous closets.

Two rooms at the back of the garage were transformed into offices. Each has a Murphy bed and loads of storage, and the two are connected by pocket doors, to create either two guest rooms or one large one.

The roomy kitchen was previously four smaller rooms, including a galley kitchen, bathroom, laundry and pantry.

The couple lived in Vancouver for 30 years while Axel, who was born in Hamburg, was at UBC. He was then asked to take over as president and vice-chancellor of Memorial University in Newfoundland, and was later invited to become chair of foresight with the Alberta Research Council. The Order of Canada holder has continued to be a strategic advisor to numerous groups, including the Universidad de Piura in Peru, which recently gave him a second of his honorary doctorates.

Montreal-born Barbara, who was project manager for their home rebuild, is a strategic planner and change-management expert who created her own company. She works in both private and public sectors, loves music and joined the board of the Victoria Children’s Choir after moving here. She previously was vice-chair of the Shallaway Youth choir in Newfoundland, which now has 450 choristers.

Axel calls the new home their “condo in a garden,” and the two say they are enjoying the environment here immensely.

They see Victoria today as the way Vancouver was 40 years ago.

“But I’m not too happy when I predict that Victoria will be a lot like Vancouver in 20 years,” said Axel.

“We have an opportunity to do something different here, to maintain the special quality of Victoria and Vancouver Island,” said Barbara, adding they love Vancouver and spend quite a bit of time there.

“But we chose to be here because it’s smaller, easier to get around, more eco-friendly and there is a better quality of life.”",953,0.9200970297189434,business

The elderly seller had moved out of the house and downsized. Her parents had bought the house in the 1950s, so it was a major decision to sell, listing agent Scott Thompson says. The property sold at the end of April, after two weeks on the market.

“There were a number of interested parties, but only one group came to the table and made an offer,” Mr. Thompson says.

The buyers are a family looking at renovating or building new and then living in the house. The sale completed on July 30.

The agent’s take

“Right now the market appears to be very strong. There are more buyers and more sellers right now than there were in the spring when COVID-19 was intensifying. July will have more sales than any other month so far this year in Greater Vancouver.”

The Associated Press

It’s been six years since the Raptors reimagined what sports culture could be in Toronto.

Up until April, 2014, the local rooting tradition was based in quiet misery. The teams were awful. The players were anonymous. The fans were distinguished by their hopeless resilience. There was a shabby nobility in being able to bear so much mediocrity.

Then the Raptors played the Brooklyn Nets.

Story continues below advertisement

The magical moment in that series was first-year general manager Masai Ujiri’s Game 1 pep rally. Ujiri workshopped a last-minute addition with his lieutenants, got up on the podium at the fan site and baited the opposition with a geo-sexual impossibility.

The Nets were staffed by NBA old-money types such as Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett. They had NYC pedigree, bold-face owners and still had a bit of that new-car smell.

The Raptors were a bunch of losers who’d spent a lot of that season trying (and failing) to tank. The most famous story people told about that team was how their ostensible star, Rudy Gay, banned the distribution of stats sheets to players in the postgame locker room. He didn’t like being confronted in print by all the shots he’d missed.

With Gay gone, the Raptors were a team of nobodies led by a guy whose biggest accomplishment was trading Carmelo Anthony.

But the Raptors were the ones making threats. The first time you saw Ujiri in the midst of his profane outburst, you probably felt a thrill. It was knowing that for the first time in your life, you got to root for the villains.

Garnett tried shooting back – “I don’t know if you can say, ‘Eff Brooklyn’ and then come into Brooklyn.” To which Raptors assistant coach Jamaal Magloire responded with cannon fire – “He’s a talker who can’t back it up. And you can print that.”

When it got to the point where the Nets felt they had to respond to tabloid front pages (“Raptors vs. Dinosaurs”), you knew they’d lost the plot. Somehow, Brooklyn and Toronto had traded imaginary cities.

Story continues below advertisement

The Raptors didn’t win that series, but the team had already changed the civic tone.

You can trace a straight line between Ujiri’s new brand of boldness and then-Blue Jays GM Alex Anthopoulos’s decision to go all-in on trades the next summer. Ujiri also created the environment in which it was possible for the Maple Leafs to give up and start over.

Ujiri gave Toronto permission to be its authentic self. Wisely, Toronto decided to be someone cooler and began importing talent.

All those moments – Brooklyn/Raptors, Leafs teardown, the Bat Flip, Auston Matthews picked No. 1, the NBA title – are connected.

What connects them isn’t winning. That’s a small part of it. The current that runs underneath all those moments – every one of which was remarkable, if not always successful – is outsiderism.

“Eff Brooklyn” finally informed foreign athletes working in this country what Canadians wanted from them. They wanted them to absorb the national tendency toward feeling unrecognized and underappreciated. They wanted to feel chosen by people of estimation. They wanted something benign and largely meaningless to fight against.

In the United States, people signal their displeasure by tearing down institutions that keep the body politic together. Up here, we take a longer view. If we’re annoyed, we yell about things that don’t matter. It’s working so far.

For instance, the scheduling of this year’s NBA playoffs.

The NBA postseason starts Monday. Working off the tipoff times, the defending champion Toronto Raptors are the least interesting team in it.

The Raptors play the Nets on Monday at 4 p.m. ET, on Wednesday at 1:30 p.m. and again on Friday at 1:30 p.m.

That works really well for me because a) deadlines and b) watching sports for a living is not a real job, so if they schedule the games at 4 a.m. I just have to remember to stop drinking before dinner.

But I am going to presume that you have responsibilities that preclude you from taking a three-hour basketball break in the middle of the day.

Story continues below advertisement

Now on the one hand, this makes sense. The Nets aren’t any good. The Raptors will beat the snot out of them. The Eastern Conference series getting the evening slot – Boston/Philadelphia – is tighter on paper and therefore more interesting.

But you cannot be properly Toronto if you are not complaining about being ignored. More reliably than winning games, this sense of grievance is what juices local fans.

No Toronto-based athlete has understood that better than Kyle Lowry. Fred VanVleet has been taking pointers.

(If the Leafs’ current stars want to understand anything about how to talk to their customers, they should spend the next two months living inside the Raptors’ bubble.)

Now that the Raptors are champions, they don’t need to vocalize their complaints. It’s a tone of voice or a tilt of the head – “Yeah, they hate us. You know it and I know it. The only people we can trust are ourselves.”

To hear Toronto tell it, Toronto is badly underestimated (truth: its Vegas odds to win just shot up to 9 to 1).

Story continues below advertisement

Nobody likes the Raptors (truth: the team is the Sonic Youth of every U.S.-based NBA writer – the indie band they like to think no one else has ever heard of).

They don’t care what you think of them (actually, that part is probably true).

At this point, winning is no longer the issue for the Raptors. They proved they could.

They are the team that doesn’t want your approval, never mind need it. They have reached a sort of basketball nirvana. No noise can penetrate their self-contained world. At least, none has yet.

Just before this story flips back into the dreary world of wins and losses, it’s fun to reflect on how much this one team – a born loser for almost the entirety of its existence – has changed the conversation.

The Raptors have done something greater than win. Lots of teams win. But only a very few have ascended from a sports franchise to a state of mind.",1044,0.9410466496774862,sports

Dale Hawerchuk, a hockey phenom who became the face of the Winnipeg Jets en route to the Hall of Fame, has died at the age of 57 after a battle with stomach cancer.

The Jets and Ontario Hockey League’s Barrie Colts, a team Hawerchuk coached, confirmed the death on Twitter on Tuesday.

“After an incredibly brave and difficult battle with cancer, our dad has passed away. My family is so proud of him and the way he fought. #HawerchukStrong,” Eric Hawerchuk, one of Dale and wife Crystal’s three children, wrote on Twitter.

Story continues below advertisement

A teenage star, Hawerchuk was drafted first over all by the Jets in 1981. He went on to play nine seasons in Winnipeg and five in Buffalo before finishing up his distinguished 16-year NHL career with stints in St. Louis and Philadelphia.

Hawerchuk recorded 518 goals and 1,409 points in 1,188 regular-season games (he added 30 more goals and 99 assists in 97 playoff games).

“A low-maintenance superstar,” said Craig Heisinger, Winnipeg’s senior vice-president and director of hockey operations.

At 5 foot 11 and 190 pounds, Hawerchuk wasn’t blessed with size or blistering speed. But the five-time all-star had a knack for getting to loose pucks and then creating something out of nothing. Hawerchuk could breeze past opponents and knew what to do when he neared the goal.

“Dale Hawerchuk put Winnipeg and the Jets on the map the day he arrived in our city in 1981, and his love for our community and Hall of Fame career will keep it there for many generations to come,” the Jets said in a statement. “Dale had a relationship with our fans unlike any player in the history of our franchise.

“Whether at home or on the world stage, ‘Ducky’ was embraced by so many, so often because of his humility and the grace by which he always carried himself.”

Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister added: “All Jets fans mourn the loss of one of the NHL’s all time greatest players.”

Former Jets star Teemu Selanne said he had a chance to talk to Hawerchuk on Monday and say goodbye.

“What an incredible human being,” Selanne tweeted.

NHL commissioner Gary Bettman called Hawerchuk “one of the most decorated players in our game’s history.”

In September, 2019, Hawerchuk took a leave of absence from coaching the Colts to undergo chemotherapy treatment.

“For some reason the Lord put me in this kind of fight and I’m ready to fight it,” he told TSN in October, 2019. “I want to live to tell the story.”

Eric Hawerchuk said in July on Twitter that the cancer had returned after his dad completed chemotherapy in April.

Dale Hawerchuk, the longest-serving coach in Colts history, was going into his 10th season behind Barrie’s bench. He had led the Colts to the playoffs in six of his nine previous seasons.

At Barrie, Hawerchuk coached the likes of Aaron Ekblad, Mark Scheifele, Tanner Pearson and Ryan Suzuki.

Calgary Flames defenceman Rasmus Andersson, a former Colt, paid tribute to Hawerchuk hours before his team’s playoff game against the Dallas Stars in Edmonton.

“Rest In Peace Dale, was an honour to play for you,” Andersson said.

The NHL held a moment of silence for Hawerchuk before Tuesday’s opening playoff game between the Montreal Canadiens and Philadelphia Flyers in Toronto.

Born April 4, 1963, in Toronto, Hawerchuk grew up in nearby Oshawa, getting his first pair of skates at the age of 2 and playing competitively at four. As a peewee, he broke Guy Lafleur’s record by scoring all eight goals in an 8-1 victory in the final of a tournament in Montreal.

Story continues below advertisement

At 15, he was offered a tryout by the Oshawa Generals. He ended up playing instead for the Oshawa Legionaires in the Metro Jr. B Hockey League in 1978-79.

Some 23 years later, he remembered his Oshawa days during his 2001 induction speech at the Hockey Hall of Fame.

“I started my career just down the road in Oshawa here, maybe a 45-minute drive – well maybe a little further now with the traffic,” he said. “I had many dreams and aspirations to make the National Hockey League. And I was very fortunate I got to live those dreams for 16 years in the National Hockey League.”

“I enjoyed every city and organization I played in,” he added.

Hawerchuk was highly touted coming into junior and was drafted sixth over all by the Cornwall Royals, who then played in the Quebec league but took part in the Ontario draft.

Hawerchuk led the Royals to back-to-back Memorial Cups in 1980 and ’81 with teammates who included Scott Arniel, Marc Crawford, Dan Daoust and Doug Gilmour.

Hawerchuk was named Memorial Cup MVP in 1981 when he set a tournament record with eight goals and tied another with 13 points.

He collected 103 points in being named the QMJHL’s top rookie. The next season, as a 17-year-old, he led the Quebec league in goals (81), assists (102) and points (183) when he was named Canadian major junior player of the year.

A grateful John Ferguson drafted Hawerchuk in 1981. Hawerchuk went to Winnipeg as an 18-year-old and spent nine years there, saying he felt as if he grew up in the Manitoba capital.

The Jets had finished last in the league prior to drafting Hawerchuk, who signed his first pro contract before a bevy of Manitoba notables, including the mayor, at the corner of Portage and Main after arriving in a Brinks truck.

He did not disappoint. The teenager scored 45 goals and collected 103 points, was named rookie of the year – the youngest recipient at the time – and led Winnipeg to a 48-point improvement, the largest single-season turnaround in the NHL.

He was the youngest player in NHL history to reach 100 points, a record broken by Sidney Crosby in 2006. No wonder his early career came with comparisons to Wayne Gretzky.

Story continues below advertisement

“He has the same instincts, that puck sense, of Gretzky,” said Mike Doran, Winnipeg’s director of player personnel in 1981.

In 1987, Hawerchuk made history with Gretzky at the Canada Cup in Hamilton. He won the face-off in his own end that led to a Gretzky-Mario Lemieux rush and Lemieux’s famous winning goal in a 6-5 victory that decided the tightly contested three-game series.

“It turned out fantastic,” said Hawerchuk, who often answered Canada’s call.

When he was inducted into the Hall of Fame, the Jets were no more (the team was revived in Winnipeg in 2011). But he said the Jets “are etched in my mind every day that I live.”

The franchise moved to Phoenix in 1996 and became the Coyotes. Eleven years later, Hawerchuk joined Bobby Hull and Thomas Steen on the Coyotes’ ring of honour.

Hawerchuk rewrote the Jets record book before being traded to Buffalo during the 1990 NHL draft. As an unrestricted free agent, Hawerchuk signed with the St. Louis Blues in 1995 before being dealt to Philadelphia, which he helped to the Stanley Cup final in 96-97 season, his final season.

Slowed down by a hip issue, he retired at the age of 34.

Hawerchuk was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2001 along with Viacheslav Fetisov, Mike Gartner and Jari Kurri in the player category.

“It’s like going back down memory lane,” he said in his induction speech.

“All the experiences have been fantastic,” he added. “I mean, sometimes they didn’t feel so great. You had your highs and lows. But when I look back on it, I wouldn’t change a thing. ... Even though I didn’t win a Stanley Cup, I still wouldn’t change a thing. I think to ask for more would be greedy.”

Known as Ducky by his teammates, Hawerchuk was inducted into the Jets’ Hall of Fame prior to their game against the visiting Arizona Coyotes in November, 2017.

“Tonight we fly Ducky’s number high,” said a tribute video, to the sounds of Motley Crue’s Home Sweet Home, before his No. 10 was raised to the rafters.

“Please welcome home perhaps the greatest Jet of all time,” the PA announcer said.

Hawerchuk played 713 games as a Jet, recording 379 goals and 929 points. He also served five seasons as captain.

“I’ve been to every part of [Manitoba], either golfing or playing [softball],” Hawerchuk said. “I’ve gotten to see Manitobans, seen their passion not only for their province and the game of hockey, but their passion for the Jets. I’m honoured and I’m very humbled.”

After retiring, he became part of the ownership group of the Tier II junior Orangeville Crushers, stepping behind the bench in 2007 prior to joining Barrie.",1433,0.9300096282138554,sports

The Raptors toyed with the Nets, getting them off their feet and down on the ground at the first bell. This wasn’t punching-bag stuff. This was like watching a guy work a speed bag. At one point, Toronto was up by 33 points.

When it got near the break, the Raptors laid off for a bit. They splashed some water on Brooklyn’s face. Lit them a cigarette. The Nets briefly regained consciousness.

Then when it got “close” Toronto resumed the pummelling. It finished 134-110.

The Raptors are here on their defensive reputation, and they have just posted a franchise-record for points scored in a playoff game.

By the end, the Nets had to make an emergency transition to their “B” team (which is every other playoff qualifier’s “C” team). It had suddenly dawned on the Brooklyn players that they will face this punishment again on Wednesday afternoon.

After it was over, the Raptors dealt the cruellest blow of all – they were nice about it.

“Those guys, the Nets, they played extremely hard. That was a battle,” Kyle Lowry said.

A battle? There have been more even-sided sneak attacks. If that’s a battle, I’d hate to be the guy who has to clean up after a romp.

“I knew they were capable,” head coach Nick Nurse said. “It didn’t totally surprise me they got going for a stretch.”

For a stretch.

Maybe Brooklyn can use quotes like that as motivation. To give up. This may be the first seven-game series in NBA history that lasts three games.

This is not exactly Brooklyn’s fault. It is a young, inexperienced team and all of its best players decided to turn an injury season off into a COVID-19 year off. Functionally, the Raptors are playing a G-League team.

But this much separation in terms of quality is not playoff basketball. It’s mercy-rule basketball.

What occurred to you in watching this is that, for the first time ever, this year’s Raptors are not just good. They are imperious. They lord it over other people.

The Kawhi-era Raptors were not that sort of club. They were resilient, but they didn’t dominate anyone. They dumped their first game of the 2019 postseason campaign to Orlando. Then they let Philadelphia beat them up. They lost the first two to Milwaukee. And they closed it out with a slapping contest against Golden State that would most likely have ended differently if Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson hadn’t both blown a tire.

That championship was a victory of the will. That doesn’t lessen it in the least. Rather, it ennobles it.

But there was no point during that run when you thought, “These guys have it in the bag.”

This year’s first game presages a very different sort of team. One that enjoys mind games. One that doesn’t care that you haven’t been here before and that that’s a little scary for you. They are going to biff you around like a red-headed stepchild until you have the good sense to run away. This Raptors team – easily the most likeable in recent history – is also the meanest.

Going into this, the Nets appeared to genuinely believe they had a puncher’s chance. They have been a lot of fun to watch in the bubble. Guard Caris LeVert had become something of a discovery.

When teams backed up in front of them, the fresh-legged Nets had fun running at them. But the seeding games aren’t the postseason. Nobody’s backing up any more.

“We know they’re the defending champs,” LeVert said a day ago. “But we’re going in there knowing that we like our chances against anybody, really.”

That second sentence now makes more sense if you change the punctuation from a period to three or four consecutive question marks. Because, really???

This is where you say something like, “It’s too soon to look ahead to …”

It’s not too soon. The Raptors should assign every coach but Nurse to scout the Philadelphia/Boston series. They don’t need them here.

This in the end may be the only drawback for the Raptors. That 3 vs. 6 Eastern Conference headliner could turn into a seven-game war. Which may very well leave the Raptors cooling their heels for most of a week. It might be in their interest to lay down for a game to Brooklyn, and draw out this torture for a while.

But it is clear this Toronto team is in a hellacious groove. There were some concerns coming in that offensive focal point Pascal Siakam had not rediscovered regular regular-season form. On Monday, he scored 18 points and was dive-bombing the rim like a spitfire. He’s fine.

Fred VanVleet is technically the other point guard. He scored 30 on 8-for-10 three-point shooting. At a certain point, in order to keep himself interested, Lowry appeared to devote himself entirely to drawing charges. The man, who never looks like he’s having fun out there, was very clearly having fun out there.

Man by man, the Raptors looked preposterously strong, while also breezy and at ease. It’s a rare combo.

The doubts about them will continue until they have eliminated a team of estimation. Giving the Nets a two-and-a-half-hour noogie for four days in a row isn’t going to change any minds. Nor you would imagine is beating either of Boston or Philadelphia.

The Raptors will not have a true reckoning until they meet Milwaukee. That’s a month from now. That’s a long time to stay mean. That’s going to be the real challenge.

Is talking this way tempting fate? Sure, it is. But some teams can do that and get away with it. It’s only one game, but however long you have been watching the Raptors, you have never seen them come out of the gate looking more like that sort of team.",1019,0.8995180770985557,sports

“He’s not feeling right, and so that’s why he’s going to get it looked at,” coach Craig Berube said. “It’s concerning, but we don’t know a lot yet, so I’m not going to jump to conclusions on anything.”

The 28-year-old Russian winger missed the majority of the season after having his dislocated shoulder operated on in October. He returned to the ice for training camp but had zero points and 10 shots in goal in four games since the NHL restarted and clearly didn’t look like himself.

“For sure he wasn’t full out, but in saying that, I didn’t think there was anything wrong,” Berube said. “I understood why, coming back from surgery and nine months off. ... It’s not easy being off that long and coming back and just jumping right into it and being full out. I knew he’d come back and probably ease his way in a little bit.”

The defending Stanley Cup champions played the majority of the season without Tarasenko and were first in the Western Conference when the season was halted in March.

“The way we play, too, is pretty simple and everybody play for each other and we work hard,” said winger Jacob de la Rose, who took Tarasenko’s spot in the lineup. “Blues hockey is get pucks deep, play hard, play good defensively and that’s what we’ve been doing here and I feel like that’s what we did all year, too, during the regular season, so even if we lose guys, it’s easy for a guy like me here coming into the series, too. You know what they expect of you.”

Tarasenko had 11 goals and six assists during the Blues’ title run last year. He had 10 points in 10 games this season before being injured.

Berube isn’t worried about not having Tarasenko for at least the next two games.

“We’re a team,” he said. “We play without players at times because you have to with injuries and different situations that come up. Our team is what makes us a good team.

When schools were closed this spring and my partner and I were working from home, our children had such a difficult time entertaining themselves while we worked. Do you have any tips for helping kids play by themselves?

I’ve been asked this question a lot over the past few months. A few things to consider before I dive in to offer solutions: What are your child’s age, temperament and experience level? Generally, children get better at playing alone as they get older and have more experience finding things to do on their own. Some children are just born better at entertaining themselves. Other children, even if you try all the suggestions below, have a much harder time. Try not to think of it as something you or they have done wrong and keep working on it.

Start with connection Children are always more willing to play alone when their connection needs are met. Start the day playing with your child: “I’m all yours for the next 30 minutes before I start working. What would you like to play?”

Story continues below advertisement

Keep them near Generally children will be happier to play alone if they can be physically near you. They might have a play area in the kitchen while you are doing food prep, or you can set up your home office and a play area in your living room.

Use a visual timer Start with small chunks of time, like 15 or 30 minutes, and use a visual timer so they can see how much time is left.

Don’t interrupt If your children are playing independently, let them stay in the flow. Don’t ask questions, get involved or interrupt unless you absolutely have to.

Provide an environment conducive to play Get rid of everything your children don’t play with. Put some toys in rotation so that when they make an appearance after a few weeks away, they feel new again. Have labelled bins and shelves to make it easy to find something to play with and put it away. You might spend more time tidying up, but you will be rewarded with more uninterrupted time.

Play audiobooks, podcasts or music to keep them company My daughter would play for hours with her toys if she had a good audiobook to listen to. Most libraries have apps for borrowing audiobooks.

Put together some special “play alone” materials Assemble some lidded bins with different activities in them. One parent in my community shared that she enjoyed quiet time every day by employing this strategy. She changed out the contents of the bins daily with things like “rocks, shells, washable markers, playdough, picture books, old magazines, puzzles, spoons with containers for scooping pom pom.” Stickers, small notebooks, tape and pipe cleaners would also be great additions.

Add water A bath in the middle of the day (unsupervised is safe for kids age 6 and up) or a sink full of water with bubbles, scoops and funnels will keep kids busy for a long time.

Story continues below advertisement

Try some sensory play activities Playdough is an old favourite that never goes out of style. Modern takes on playdough are goop or slime that can be made with household ingredients. Think indoor sandbox.

It takes some effort and advance planning on your part and you might need to call on your reserves of patience, but if you start small, support them and keep insisting, most kids can learn to love their independent time.

Pablo Piatti opened his Major League Soccer scoring account with a 25-foot rocket, then added another in the second half as Toronto FC handily defeated the Vancouver Whitecaps 3-0 on Tuesday.

Piatti, playing his first game at BMO Field, made his presence known all night, giving the Vancouver (2-4-0) defence fits as Toronto (3-0-3) kept the Whitecaps hemmed in their own end for most of the game.

The Argentine midfielder opened the scoring in the 27th minute as he hammered the ball into the top left corner of the Whitecaps goal, leaving goalkeeper Thomas Hasal with no chance.

Piatti made it 2-0 in the 55th minute after getting a nice feed in the box from Jonathan Osorio and cooly sending the ball past Hasal.

Nick DeLeon put the game out of reach in the 83rd minute when he converted a nice pass from Alejandro Pozuelo.

Tuesday’s contest was the first of nine games between the three Canadian MLS teams. TFC, the Whitecaps and the Montreal Impact are staying in Canada for this phase of the season because of border restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Results during the all-Canadian stretch count in the MLS regular-season standings, and the top team through the nine games earns a spot in the Canadian Championship final.

TFC and the Whitecaps will face off again Friday at BMO Field.

Tuesday’s match was the first MLS game in Canada since March 7, when TFC beat New York City FC 1-0 in front of a crowd of 26,171.

Stands normally filled with raucous fans, chanting and stamping their feet to create a daunting atmosphere for opposing teams, sat empty due to COVID-19 safety measures. The Toronto FC starting lineup was belted out over the BMO sound system, each name being met with silence.

But the club’s most ardent supporters, normally found in BMO Field’s animated south end, did their best to inject some energy into the atmosphere. A number of fans congregated across the road from the north end of the stadium, chanting, waving flags, banging drums and lighting flares from the opening kickoff to the final whistle.

The Whitecaps were fortunate to come out of a Toronto-dominated first half down just a goal. Toronto had nine shots on goal (four on target) to Vancouver’s one, and the Reds had six corners, to just one for the Whitecaps.

Piatti had another chance in the 35th minute after a nice set up from Pozuelo, but his shot was deflected over the Whitecaps goal. Jozy Altidore, in the starting lineup for the first time since March 7, had a chance blocked a minute later.

The second half was more of the same, with Toronto continuing to press and Vancouver unable to muster an effective counterattack. Final shots were 24 (eight on target) for Toronto to four (one on target) for Vancouver.

Quentin Westberg picked up the clean sheet for Toronto. He didn’t have to deal with much, making saves. Defender Ali Adnan had one of Vancouver’s rare chances in the 73rd minute, but his shot sailed over the Toronto goal.

For the second year in a row, the Calgary Flames have gotten exceptional goaltending in the postseason. As in 2019, it still may not be enough for them to advance to the second round of the Stanley Cup playoffs.

Calgary’s high-flying offence remained grounded on Tuesday night in a 2-1 loss to the Dallas Stars, and now the Albertans face an elimination game two days hence. The loss came after a heartbreaking defeat in overtime on Sunday, and the Flames now trail in the best-of-seven series 3-2.

After having the second-best record in the NHL in 2018-19, they were eliminated in five games by the Colorado Avalanche. Calgary’s goalie in that series, Mike Smith, was by far the team’s best player but he didn’t get much help from anyone else.

Story continues below advertisement

The same is true of Cam Talbot, who turned away 30 of 32 shots in another tight game. He has faced 30 or more in four of the five games, and was deluged with 62 on Sunday.

John Klingberg, the Stars defenceman, scored the winning goal on a long wrist shot 72 seconds into the third period. Anton Khudobin had 28 saves in the win for Dallas. The game ended with Talbot on the bench and Calgary on a two-man advantage for the final 21 seconds.

Flames coach Geoff Ward felt that his players had the jitters at the start for the first time in this series. They gave up a shorthanded goal by Jamie Benn midway through the first period and were pinned in their end and outshot 14-7 over the first 20 minutes.

“Our team has not been in a 2-2 situation going into a Game 5 yet,” Ward said. “We don’t have many players with more than 20 games of playoff experience. When you know that the team that loses is going to be going into an elimination game, it’s tough to handle.

“It’s the first time I have seen us have a case of the nerves and it is understandable.”

Calgary didn’t get any production out of its first line, which went silent in last year’s defeat by Colorado. That series was a romp; this one has been tightly played but the Flames are still on the wrong end.

“We didn’t have the fight last year that this team has,” Ward said. “This team is going to battle back. I know comparison’s will be made, but to me these are two totally different situations.

Story continues below advertisement

The Flames were 12 seconds from taking a 3-1 series lead on Sunday when they surrendered the tying goal and then gave up the winner late in the first extra period. They were badly outshot and were similarly outplayed again at the start on Tuesday.

By the time Benn put Dallas ahead 1-0 midway through the first period, the Stars had already outshot Calgary, 9-2. Benn’s goal came from in close off a crisp cross-ice pass from Tyler Seguin.

The Flames coughed up the puck to the Stars’ tenacious defence 12 times in the first 20 minutes.

Despite being outplayed, Calgary went into the intermission tied at 1-1 behind a hard wrist shot from Mikael Backlund that beat Khudobin with just 46 seconds left in the period.

Talbot, who made 57 saves on Sunday and faced 159 shots in the first four games of the series, was sharp again. He stopped 13 of Dallas’ 14 shots in the first 20 minutes.

Before the game started, a ceremony was held to honour Dale Hawerchuk, whose family announced on Tuesday that he had died from stomach cancer. The 57-year-old member of the Hockey Hall of Fame scored 100 points six times and is best associated with his tenure with the Winnipeg Jets.

Story continues below advertisement

Dallas coach Rick Bowness, who coached Hawerchuk in Winnipeg during the 1980s, was visibly moved by the presentation. The Flames’ Rasmus Andersson and Andrew Mangiapane, both of whom played for Hawerchuk in the Ontario Hockey League, expressed regrets about his death after the game.

“Dale was just a great man,” Mangiapane said. “I don’t know where I would be without him. This was very sad news today.”

Calgary was much better in the second period, but Talbot still had to make a handful of brilliant stops to keep the score tied. After another giveaway, he denied Benn on a wrist shot from 25 feet away seven minutes into the period. He stopped Benn again and Corey Perry twice on dangerous chances during a flurry of shots in the last eight minutes of the period.

The Flames’ best chance came on a wraparound attempt by Sam Bennett that was knocked away by Khudobin less than two minutes before the second intermission.

Klingberg put the Stars up at the start of the third period and they simply held on for dear life the rest of the way. Calgary put tremendous pressure on Dallas late in the game but could never score the equalizer.

“I still think we have more than what we have showed here,” Mangiapane said.

Milan Lucic, the veteran forward, said the Flames were too passive at the start.

“The lesson there is that we have to be ready at the get-go,” Lucic said. “Right now, frustration is a waste of emotion. We have to look at what we can do to give us our best chance to win on Thursday.”

The Flames have played better than last year, but find themselves in a tough spot again.

“It’s time for us to come back and win a series when we are down,” Backlund said. “It is time for us to show we can have success in the playoffs.”",967,0.8094705557520824,sports

It will forever be one of the iconic images of last year’s NBA championship run – Fred VanVleet on his back, arms outstretched, with his eyes looking up at the Oracle Arena ceiling while blood streamed from a gash under his eye.

It was nothing new to Anthony (Doc) Cornell.

VanVleet played for Cornell’s AAU team Pryme Time in his hometown of Rockford, Ill., and the coach said even as a seventh grader the Toronto Raptors guard had nerves of steel.

Story continues below advertisement

There was the tournament, Cornell recalled, where VanVleet reached in for a steal and took a headbutt to the eye.

“His eye literally is swollen shut, he looks like Rocky,” Cornell said. “So the physician at the tournament was like ‘Doc, this boy can’t play, he’s gotta go get stitches.’

“Fred looked at me and said ‘I’m playing.’ The doctor was like ‘Fred, you can’t see.’ Not only does Fred play, he leads us in scoring and assists with one eye in the championship game. People were like, ‘Man, Fred has one eye, and he’s killing y’all,’” Cornell said with a loud laugh.

“Those type of moments were always like ‘man, he’s just on a different level.’”

The undrafted star out of Wichita State was cut under the eye and chipped a front tooth in Game 4 of the Finals against Golden State. His battered face lent another layer to the already rich story when he poured in 22 points, including a huge three-pointer, late in the Raptors’ title-clinching Game 6 win over the Warriors.

The 26-year-old has picked up where he left off last postseason, erupting for 30 points in Monday’s Game 1 win over Brooklyn in the opening round of the playoffs in Florida. VanVleet knocked down eight three-pointers and assisted on another seven.

On one late three-pointer, VanVleet pulled up to leave his defender, skidding by him like a puppy on linoleum.

Story continues below advertisement

VanVleet said he’s been working on shooting from longer distances, sparked by conversations with coach Nick Nurse during last year’s playoffs. The six-foot guard was getting blocked too often, and the Raptors needed him scoring.

“So I started putting it in my game and I’ve just been working on it more and more since then,” VanVleet said Tuesday. “Obviously with the playoffs, it’s a little bit harder to get your shot off, and guys are flying around a little bit more. If you can knock it down from distance, it just makes it that much harder for the defence to run out to you. Sometimes you catch ‘em off guard or you just avoid that extra couple inches of hand to contest.”

Mr. Bet on Yourself has always loved a good challenge.

Cornell’s Pryme Time roster, which VanVleet helped transform into the most successful in Rockford AAU history, was unconventional. Where other AAU teams would load up with four or five bigs, Cornell preferred guards and shooters. They were the smaller team in any game. They usually played up an age group, often against powerhouse teams boasting shoe deals.

Other teams tried to woo him away.

“But he was always loyal, he’d say ‘Why would I leave? I’m the captain of the ship. These are my soldiers. I’m staying with my group,’” Cornell said. “As it turned out, he was the type of floor general and leader to help us get past all these bigger, higher-ranked so-called AAU giants.”

Cornell has loads of stories of VanVleet’s heroics from the five years he played for Pryme Time.

There was a memorable Friday night game of a major AAU tournament. Pryme Time, which was short-handed, needed to beat the Wisconsin state champions to get to the bracket round. With about 10 seconds left, one of VanVleet’s teammates tried to set a pick to get him the ball.

“Fred yells ‘give me the damn ball!’ then Fred takes one dribble from outside the three-point line and shoots it right down the middle,” Cornell said. “Nothing beyond net. Walks off and says, ‘I told you we wasn’t going home.’”

“I think I was 10 times more excited than him, I got on the phone and called his mom, I said ‘Sue, I know people say this all the time about different players, but this boy is going to the league.’ I said, ‘You should have seen what he just did. He shot it like ice water in his veins, like it was nothing.’”

VanVleet was the kid who only needed a foot in the door, Cornell said.

“His mindset going to tournaments was his bag was his briefcase, and this was a business trip to get him to where he intended to go in the future,” the coach said.

VanVleet committed to Wichita State ahead of his Grade 12 year, so Shockers coach Gregg Marshall caught most of his final two AAU seasons.

“Pryme Time was this little team out of Rockford, just a bunch of dudes, a ragtag group. But they were beating all of the great shoe-company, elite AAU programs and Fred was just orchestrating the whole thing,” Marshall said. “I’m sitting there going, ‘wow.’ I mean, he’s literally taking this group and winning.”

He did the same thing at Wichita State, taking the Shockers to the Final Four in 2013.

“No matter what the stage, he believes he’s put in the work, and he’s got the mindset and the calmness, and he’s precocious if you will,” Marshall said. “And he just seems to will his team to be … the sum is better than the individual parts, right?”

VanVleet was just a freshman when he led the Shockers to an upset of Gonzaga at the 2013 NCAA tournament. With a little less than two minutes to play, Wichita was up by a couple of points, and VanVleet fumbled the ball toward his team’s bench. He managed to retrieve it but not in time to fully turn to face the net.

“He didn’t hesitate, he just shot it, and as a freshman, to take a shot like that,” the coach marvelled. “And as it was going through the net, he just looked at me like, ‘Oh, that was good the whole way’ and gave me this little shrug.

“It reminded me so much of some shots that he hit in the clinching game for the title last year.”

VanVleet, who’s earning just more than US$9-million this season, will be a hot commodity in free agency come October, and re-signing him should be a top priority for Toronto.

Rockford Mayor Tom McNamara said he believes there’s no putting a pricetag on VanVleet’s efforts off the court as well, and the guard’s commitment to his hometown.

“Kind of weird to say about someone with such star power as Fred, but he’s a better person off the court than he is a basketball player on the court,” said the 37-year-old McNamara, whose dad, John, was Rockford’s mayor in the 1980s.

The city of 150,000 is infamous for being listed among the most dangerous cities in the United States in past years, with a violent crime rate ranking worse than nearby Chicago.

VanVleet’s roots there still run deep. He sells his “Bet on Yourself” sportswear line out of his downtown shop. The city held viewing parties – “our own mini-Jurassic Parks,” McNamara said – during last year’s Raptors playoff run. He was presented with a key to the city. McNamara joked the city’s nickname would forever be “Fredford.”

“He’s made a lifelong Bulls fan into a Raptors fan,” McNamara said.

VanVleet organizes annual backpack giveaways for Rockford kids. He posted a message to Rockfordians at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic urging them to stay safe. When McNamara implemented the Mayor’s Office on Domestic Violence and Human Trafficking Prevention, he reached out to VanVleet for support.

“Obviously with his schedule, he can’t go into every high school with me. But he did videos for us. I’ve never once called and asked him for anything where he’s said no to, that benefits the community,” McNamara said.

VanVleet’s father – also named Fred – was shot to death in 1999 in what’s been reported as a drug deal that went bad. VanVleet was 5 at the time, and was raised by his mom Sue and stepfather Joe Danforth, a police officer who introduced him to basketball at a young age to steer him away from trouble.

Kids in Rockford look up to VanVleet, McNamara said, but the appreciation goes beyond what he’s able to do on the court.

“It’s different with Fred, it’s different because he is just such a class act. He is quietly, steadily showing how to just be a good human, not just an exceptional basketball player but someone who cares, and doesn’t forget about where he came from,” he said.

His story of perseverance, McNamara said, mirrors so many people of Rockford.

“He’s kind of the model of what we would call ‘the Rockford grit and toughness,’” the mayor said. “A lot of wonderful people just working exceptionally hard to excel.”",1523,0.8624570772373226,sports

It’s more of a gleeful taunt: MAPLE LEAFS POUTINE NOW HALF PRICE.

What, pray tell, is Maple Leafs poutine? The pub’s menu describes it thusly: “In usual Leafs fashion, a cold overpriced dish served with underperforming gravy, ice-cold fries and side of disappointment.”

article continues below

The usual price for this gastronomic disaster is $67, a nod to 1967, the last year the Toronto Maple Leafs won the Stanley Cup.

But because managing partner Ken Whitaker is feeling good these days — his Montreal Canadiens remain in the playoffs while the Leafs have been chased to the golf course, just as God, or at least Guy Lafleur, intended — you can order this appropriately overpriced mess for half the usual cost.

Not that the pub will actually sell it to you. Server Marina McLean takes pity on those who ask for the dish.

“I always refuse them,” she says. “I tell them ‘You really don’t want it.’ ”

Likewise, when her father defiantly dons his Toronto gear and plants himself under the No Leafs Fans sign mounted on the pub’s wall, she refuses to stick him with the two-per-cent surcharge that normally gets added to the bill of anyone sporting a Leafs sweater or hat.

For real, they do that at the 17 Mile, at least if the patron looks like a good sport. Some customers show up dressed that way just to see the surcharge printed on their bill, which they wave like a medal, something to proudly photograph and text to fellow Leafs supporters.

Yes, hockey fans, it might be August, but in this strangest of years that just means another opportunity to continue the pub’s history of cheerfully bashing the Toronto Maple Leafs.

It began when Montreal-raised Whitaker bought into the business in 2005. The No Leafs sign went up soon after. Then came the surcharge and the poutine, the latter jointly created by Whitaker and chef/Canucks fan Paul Snoljanovic. At one point they even resorted to using urinal pucks bearing the Leafs crest, though some Toronto fans felt that was hitting below the belt. There are limits.

In recent years, Sooke Road commuters have been treated to an assortment of messages on that back-lit sign outside the pub.

“Free beer during all Leafs games during the playoffs,” it promised after Toronto failed to make the post-season.

“Leafs make the playoffs/Watch out for flying pigs” it advised after a more successful campaign.

But then came “Leafs miss playoffs/universe is back to normal.”

It’s all in a spirit of fun, Whitaker says. “We have lots of Leafs fans and lots of non-Leafs fans.” Most of the former take the teasing in the spirit in which it is intended, though one man scrawled an unprintable message in angry red letters on a paper napkin before flashing his middle finger as he peeled out of the parking lot.

Sports fans (OK, I) do tend to get wrapped up in their loyalties beyond reason. As a boy, I gazed in slack-jawed wonder as a man scaled the glass at a junior hockey game and hurled his spectacles at the referee, shouting, “You need these more than I do,” which made me see him in a different light when he delivered his sermon from the pulpit the next Sunday. (True story.)

Occasionally, a fight breaks out in the stands. Occasionally, Vancouver is set on fire. If the Canucks end up losing to St. Louis this week you will see people who have stayed solid as the Rock of Gibraltar throughout the pandemic suddenly crumble like Trump at a spelling bee.

The over-reactions can be on a broad scale. Every once in awhile a bout of belly-bumping bellicosity breaks out after ESPN catches a handful of drunken Canadian fans booing The Star Spangled Banner, which results in Americans chanting “U.S.A! U.S.A!” to drown out our anthem at the next game, to which we respond by singing it REALLY LOUDLY, even dragging out our sketchy knowledge of the French lyrics (“O Canada, terre de nos aieux, Sidney Crosby, deux minutes pour tripping”) to show how worldly we are.

That’s relatively harmless, but team tribalism can get seriously ugly when festering historical resentments, if not outright xenophobia, are stirred in (or up).

In 1969, cross-border grievances fuelled the fire when Honduras and El Salvador dropped the gloves (sorry, hockey analogy) in the so-called Football War within days of their World Cup qualifier. In some places, innocently wearing the wrong jersey into the wrong bar can get you killed.

Which is what makes the 17 Mile House’s Leaf-bashing a refreshing contrast. Only in a country in which differences are tolerated, even encouraged, could it be safe to celebrate a rivalry without it turning into a riot.

Jayson Tatum scored a playoff-career-high 32 points, Jaylen Brown added 29 and the Boston Celtics beat the Philadelphia 76ers 109-101 in the opener of their first-round playoff series Monday night near Orlando.

Brown had 15 points in the fourth, as the Celtics outscored the 76ers 34-22 in the final quarter to take Game 1 of the best-of-seven series. Tatum finished with 13 rebounds, and Kemba Walker chipped in 19 points.

Joel Embiid led Philadelphia with 26 points and 16 rebounds, and Josh Richardson and Alec Burks each scored 18. The 76ers played without All-Star guard Ben Simmons (knee surgery).

Game 2 of the series will take place Wednesday night. Of note, Gordon Hayward exited in the fourth for the Celtics with a right ankle sprain and did not return.

Brown, who missed time in the third quarter with a right thigh contusion, tied the score at 86 on a 3-pointer with 8:34 to go in the fourth. He hit four free throws in a 3-second span for a 92-86 margin.

Philadelphia got within three before Brown was at it again, nailing a 3-pointer to increase the Celtics’ lead to 99-91 with 4:29 remaining. Walker gave Boston a 10-point edge, 101-91, with 3:16 left, but the 76ers got within 103-100 on a Richardson 3 with 59 ticks to go.

Tatum hit a pair of free throws with 41 seconds left as the Celtics pulled away for the win.

Tatum had 21 points and eight rebounds as the Celtics had a six-point lead at halftime. He took control with 15 points in the second, and the Celtics followed suit, grabbing their first double-digit lead, 53-43, on a Brown layup with 1:33 left.

Philadelphia entered halftime down 55-49 after committing 13 turnovers in the half. Embiid had 13 points and nine rebounds.

Shaw was at second base in the 10th when Cole Sulser (1-2) walked Vladimir Guerrero Jr., and both runners advanced on a bunt. Lourdes Gurriel Jr. followed with a sharp grounder to first that Chris Davis stabbed with a dive, then threw home from a sitting position.

The ball took one hop and went through the hands of catcher Pedro Severino an instant before Shaw crossed the plate.

""For me, that was just a great play getting to the ball. He was trying to make a game-saving play,"" Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said. ""It kind of skipped up on Seve when he threw it from his rear end there. I give credit to CD for getting to the ball.""

Anthony Bass (1-0) entered in the ninth and got the final out of the game.

In the last of the 10th, Dwight Smith Jr. got caught in a rundown after sprinting too far past third base on a one-out single by Cedric Mullins.

""Disappointed that we didn’t score in the bottom half,"" Hyde said. ""Had an opportunity and made a mistake. Tough loss.""

The Blue Jays had no complaints after improving to 2-3 in extra innings.

""We played well enough to win this game,"" manager Charlie Montoyo noted,

Randal Grichuk extended his torrid hitting surge for Toronto, homering and driving in four runs. He connected with a man on against Wade LeBlanc in the third inning and greeted reliever Travis Lakins with a bases-loaded double to ignite a five-run fifth that made it 7-3.

Grichuk is on a seven-game hitting streak — including four straight multi-hit games — to raise his batting average 75 points to .333. In addition, over the last five games he has four homers and 11 RBIs.

Shaw also homered for the Blue Jays, who can complete a three-game sweep Wednesday.

Anthony Santander hit a pair of two-run homers for the Orioles, giving him nine for the season along with 26 RBIs. But Baltimore dropped its third straight and has lost four of five since a six-game winning streak.

Grichuk's offensive show put Toronto starter Nate Pearson in position to earn his first big league win. But the highly touted prospect was yanked in the fifth after allowing his third homer, a two-run shot by Chance Sisco that got Baltimore to 7-5.

Pearson now has a 6.61 ERA after four starts.

""He's got the stuff to pitch in the big leagues, but he's pitching from behind,"" Montoyo said. ""He hasn't been able to locate all his pitches.""

TOP GUNS

Toronto pulled off a rare feat Monday night when Grichuk had four RBIs and leadoff man Cavan Biggio added three. According to Elias, it was only the seventh time since 1920 (when the RBI became a stat) that all seven of a team's runs were driven in by the top two batters in the lineup.

TRAINER'S ROOM

Blue Jays: SS Bo Bichette received a second opinion on his ailing right knee, which was confirmed to be a sprain, Montoyo said. There is no timetable for his return. ... 1B Rowdy Tellez was given the day off after getting hit in the head during a collision at first base Monday.

Orioles: SS José Iglesias (left quadriceps strain) was placed on the 10-day injured list. He has been playing through the injury for weeks, and Hyde decided it was time to take action. ""We just felt like giving him some extra days would be beneficial to him and us the rest of the season,"" Hyde said. Iglesias is batting .400 but has been serving mostly as the designated hitter, starting only two games at SS in August. ... Reliever Hunter Harvey (right forearm strain) should be back by the end of the month, Hyde said.

UP NEXT

Blue Jays: Tanner Roark (1-1, 6.00 ERA) makes his fourth start of year Wednesday afternoon in the series finale. He's 0-3 with a 6.88 ERA lifetime against the Orioles, but hasn't faced them since 2016.

Orioles: Tommy Milone (1-2, 4.00) last pitched against the Jays in 2014 for Oakland.

The Capitals started playing better right after, turning the tide with a big penalty kill and some big saves.

Alex Ovechkin scored twice, including the go-ahead goal early in the third period, as Washington rallied from two goals down to beat the New York Islanders 3-2 Tuesday night and avoid a sweep in their first-round series.

""I started to see it in the second half of the first period,"" Rierden said. :""We started to impose our will a little bit and tilt the ice in our favour by getting some offensive zone shifts. That’s mandatory for us to have success as a team.""

Evgeny Kuznetsov also scored for the Capitals and Braden Holtby stopped 24 shots. Washington won for the second time in seven post-season games, going 1-1-1 in round-robin play in the qualifying round to fall to the No. 3 seed in the Eastern Conference, and then losing the first three games against the Islanders.

""Any comeback is exciting but I think it’s more the way we played in the second and third periods,"" Holtby said. ""I think that’s the key to our ability to come back and win the series. If we play every period like that its going to be really, really hard to beat us. ... Our job now is to make sure that filters over in the next game.""

Mathew Barzal and Jean-Gabriel Pageau scored in the first period to give New York a 2-0 lead. Semyon Varlamov finished with 26 saves.

""We got away from our game a little bit and they put on a press,"" Islanders captain Anders Lee said. ""Our start was obviously really nice tonight and we just didn't sustain that the way we needed to keep that momentum we earned in that first part of the period.""

The Islanders, who won three of four against Florida in the qualifying round, lost for the second time in eight games this post-season.

Game 5 is Thursday.

Ovechkin's second of the night 3:40 into the third period gave the Capitals their first lead. On a 2-on-1 with Tom Wilson, Ovechkin kept the puck and fired it past Varlamov for his fourth of the series. It was also the first goal Washington scored after the second period in this series.

New York pulled Varlamov for an extra skater with a little more than 1 1/2 minutes remaining, but couldn't tie it.

Washington controlled the play in the second period, keeping the puck in the offensive zone for much of the time. The Capitals outshot the Islanders 15-7 in the period and scored twice to tie it.

Kuznetsov got the Capitals on the scoreboard during 4-on-4 play as he brought the puck up the right side, cut across the front of the net and put it past Varlamov at 3:35.

""Big goal obviously by Kuzy gave us momentum,"" Ovechkin said. ""Holts was unbelievable today, PK blocking shots, do their job. We got rewarded. If we play like that we got pretty good chance to come back. But we’re going to take a game at a time.""

With Washington on the power play, Ovechkin fired a slap shot from the top of the left circle off a pass from John Carlson to tie it at 2-2 1:54 later.

The Isles were swarming in the offensive zone from the start of the game and had an 8-1 advantage on shots on goal over the first nearly 10 minutes, scoring twice.

Pageau put the Islanders ahead 1-0 as he deflected Scott Mayfield's point shot past Holtby at 3:50.

Barzal, who had the overtime winner in Game 3 on Sunday, made it 2-0 less than 5 1/2 minutes later. He brought the puck up the middle, passed to Nick Leddy to his left, and as he was streaking to the net, tipped the return pass from Leddy past Holtby.

Reirden called a timeout immediately after the goal, and Washington picked up its intensity after.

John Klingberg and Jamie Benn scored for Dallas while Anton Khudobin stopped 28 shots in net for his second win of the series.

It was a game that fit the profile for Dallas in the regular season: tight defence and opportunistic offence for a squad that allowed just 2.52 goals against a game (2nd in NHL) but scored just 2.58 a game (26th).

The winner came early in the third period. Klingberg fired a wrist shot from the blue line through traffic that beat goaltender Cam Talbot high on the short side.

It was his first goal of the post-season, to go with six assists. Klingberg credited winger Mattias Janmark, who bounced back from taking a wicked Noah Hanifin slapshot on the ankle in the first period to set up the winner.

""Janmark did a great job picking up the puck on the boards on his backhand, holding on to it and finding me on the weak side,"" said Klingberg.

""That's something we've been talking a lot about as a team, trying to get more O-zone (time).

""He took control of the puck, had a guy on his back, and still made a play so I could just walk down and wrist that shot through, and luckily it went in.""

Benn scored the first goal of the game the hard way, barrelling down the ice on a 2-on-1 with Tyler Seguin.

Seguin backhanded a pass to Benn that he redirected at top speed in the blue paint as he freight-trained into the crossbar, knocking the net off its pegs.

It was ruled a short-handed goal but the teams were just coming off 4-on-4 play at the time. Seguin said he thought about shooting but then saw Benn.

""It was an instinctive play,"" said Seguin.

""Jamie was going hard to the back post. I think the crossbar got the best of him there. It was a big hit but good goal.""

It was Benn's second goal of the series, to go with two assists.

Mikael Backlund, with his fourth goal of the post-season, replied for Calgary. Talbot stopped 30 shots in his ninth consecutive post-season start.

Flames winger Andrew Mangiapane said they need to narrow their field of vision for Game 6.

""I still think we've got more than what we're kind of showing here,"" he said.

""I think we've just got to go out and play our game and I think we'll be OK.""

Defenceman Rasmus Andersson said it will be a trench battle: ""I still think we can put more pucks to the net and just try to work them more down low.""

Prior to Tuesday, it had been Calgary winning the low-scoring games (3-2 and 2-0) while Dallas had triumphed in a pair of 5-4 shootouts.

It was a game the Stars dominated through the first two periods, with Talbot keeping the Flames in it by turning aside numerous high-percentage chances off the rush and from the slot.

Calgary was outshot 14-7 in the first period, but showed signs of life as the game wore on when Tobias Rieder joined Johnny Gaudreau and Sean Monahan on the top line, with Elias Lindholm bumped down to play alongside Mangiapane and Backlund on the second trio.

Rieder has three goals in the post-season — all shorthanded — and has been elevated to the top six in place of Matthew Tkachuk.

Tkachuk, the notorious agitator and Flames top scorer in the regular season, hasn't played since he was knocked woozy on a hit late in Game 2.

Ben Bishop, the Stars' regular season No. 1 goalie, did not dress for a second consecutive game. The NHL is not releasing injury information.

It was an emotional day for interim Dallas coach Rick Bowness. He could be seen blinking back tears as he watched a pre-game video tribute to former teammate and friend Dale Hawerchuk, who died Tuesday after a battle with stomach cancer at 57.

Bowness both played with and coached Hawerchuk in the 1980s with the Winnipeg Jets.

""One thing I remember with Dale, when he bought his first house, I think he emptied the pool and painted a Winnipeg Jet logo on the bottom of the pool right away.

""He was very proud to be a Winnipeg Jet.""

All Western Conference games are being played at Rogers Place, with players isolating in a so-called bubble in between to prevent contracting COVID-19.

The Flyers lead the series 3-1. The Canadian Press

The Montreal Canadiens could seemingly do no wrong Friday night.

They scored early and often in a 5-0 demolition of the Flyers that saw star goalie Carter Hart chased from Philadelphia’s crease in a mercy pull.

That was then. And for Canadiens fans, it probably feels like a lifetime ago.

Now after two anemic offensive performances, Montreal is on the cusp of having its playoff bubble burst.

Hart made 29 saves for his second straight shutout as the Flyers smothered the Canadiens for the second time in less than 48 hours to pick up a 2-0 victory Tuesday and grab a 3-1 stranglehold on their first-round series.

Montreal — which played that near-perfect Game 2 to even the matchup 1-1 — was bested by Hart’s 23 saves, 24 blocked shots, three posts and two crossbars in Sunday’s 1-0 loss. It was more of the same Tuesday for a team that has now been blanked for 129 minutes 25 seconds dating back to Jesperi Kotkaniemi’s goal midway through Friday’s third period.

“Our backs are against the wall,” said Canadiens captain Shea Weber, whose team will look to avoid elimination in Wednesday’s Game 5. “We’ve got to take our lumps here and correct a few things.

“[We’ve] definitely got to come with our best effort.”

That effort wasn’t there at times Tuesday as the Flyers once again scored early and then locked things down. A bad goal on Carey Price, who finished with 20 saves, late in the second period forged a lead that felt insurmountable.

“We just have to put this behind us,” Montreal winger Tomas Tatar said. “It’s not pretty when you don’t score for two games.”

Michael Raffl and Philippe Myers provided the offence for Philadelphia, the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference.

“Everybody’s just committed to winning right now, and battling hard,” said Hart, a netminder of few words.

Searching for any type of spark in what would be another fruitless third period, Canadiens interim head coach Kirk Muller put his lines in a blender, benching Brendan Gallagher and Jonathan Drouin for long stretches.

Montreal’s leading scorer the past three years, Gallagher has failed to find the net in the postseason despite coming in with a league-high 31 shots.

“[The frustration’s] there. You just have to do your best to fight that urge,” he said. “You play for one reason — you play for teammates. Regardless of what’s happened, I’ve got to find a way here, and whenever you’re out on the ice just take advantage of it. I guess if the coach feels other guys are going to do the job better than you, that’s his job.

“It doesn’t mean I sit there and accept it, but my job is to play.”

The 24th of 24 teams included in the NHL’s resumption to its pandemic-delayed season, the Canadiens haven’t helped themselves much over the last two games.

And Price, who’s been mostly brilliant in this series and in Montreal’s stunning upset of the Pittsburgh Penguins in the qualifying round, wore the goat horns with his team behind and struggling to create Tuesday.

Up 1-0 after the opening 20 minutes, the Flyers doubled their lead with 2:56 left in the second when Myers’ shot from the sideboards clipped the stick of Montreal defenceman Brett Kulak, skipped off the ice and handcuffed Price.

“That was the break that we needed,” Muller said. “You’ve got to score some goals to win hockey games.

“But that was unfortunate.”

The Flyers continued the trend of stifling the Canadiens earlier in the period, allowing next to no room through the neutral zone. Montreal did have an opportunity when Joel Armia couldn’t connect on Hart’s doorstep before Kulak pinched down for another chance.

Jeff Petry then blasted a point shot that the Philadelphia netminder just got a piece of before it chimed off the post inside an empty Scotiabank Arena.

Montreal got a power play with 6:42 left in regulation, but Hart, who has made 52 straight saves after allowing four goals on 26 shots in Game 2, stopped Nick Suzuki and flopped onto rebound.

The Canadiens then got an unlucky delay-of-game penalty, and the Flyers coasted from there, improving to 35-0-2 in 2019-20 when leading after two periods.

“We’re not playing perfect hockey,” Philadelphia head coach Alain Vigneault said. “When we do make mistakes, (Hart’s) been able to get that big save.”

The Canadiens, who were 18 points behind the Flyers in the standings when the NHL halted its season in March because of COVID-19, have allowed just five goals in the series, but now find themselves pushed to the brink.

“We’ve seen exceptional goaltending in these playoffs,” Muller said. “The one thing you can’t do is get let a goalie get into your head. It doesn’t always take a perfect shot to score.”

As in Game 3, Philadelphia again pushed ahead early in the first when Raffl worked a nifty give-and-go with Sean Couturier following a Montreal turnover before roofing his second at 6:32 on Price, who looked slightly out of position.

“These are all tight games,” said Raffl, who returned to the lineup Sunday after getting hurt Aug. 2. “To get the lead, it boosts everyone’s confidence. Then we were just committed to finishing it off.”

Couturier had a great chance to put his team up by two on a power play later in the period, but flubbed his shot at a wide-open net. Byron then saw a similar opportunity go over Hart’s goal after Flyers defenceman Ivan Provorov got a stick on his effort.

Montreal nearly got an unlikely equalizer from its fourth line, but Alex Belzile fired high on a 2-on-1.

“I feel like once we get one, it’ll just started rolling,” Tatar said. “Just be a little more hungrier on the net. It’s not over until it’s over.

“We will regroup.”

Game 5 goes Wednesday.

Captain Alex Pietrangelo scored once and added an assist while veteran forward David Perron picked up two assists for the defending Stanley Cup champions.

""It was nice to get on the board tonight,"" said O'Reilly.

""I haven't been creating much offensively, so it was nice to put the puck in the back of the net, but it's just one game. I've got to be consistent with it.""

The teams were playing on a quick 24-hour turnaround. The Blues beat the Canucks 3-2 late Sunday night in overtime.

They outshot the Canucks 37-23, scored two goals with the man advantage to turn around what had been an abysmal 2-for-11 power play going into Game 4.

Most importantly, they shut down a Canuck power play that had torched them for six goals in the first three games, but went 0 for 7 on this night.

""When we take care of the puck it's effective and it's hard on them,"" said O'Reilly.

""I think it was nice with an obviously emotional win last night. (We were) feeling good coming back into the rink again today and going right to our game again. I think that was a big factor. Obviously a lot of work left. We've got to stick to our structure.""

Pietrangelo said they've been working on fixing the penalty kill.

""We've been making adjustments as we go, just based on what they do,"" he said.

""Big thing for us is clearing the puck when he have an opportunity, so we were much better at that tonight.""

Jake Allen made 22 saves in net for the win and Jacob Markstrom stopped 34 for the loss.

J.T. Miller had the lone Canucks marker, his fourth of the post-season.

He said the Blues are adapting to their power play,

""They're blocking a lot of shots, they're studying us. They kind of know what we're doing,"" said Miller.

He said they'll make adjustments but aren't going to go back to square one.

""We were a shot away from going up 3-0 (in the series). Tonight it was 1-1 five on five,"" he said.

""It's not like we're getting our butts whupped up and down the rink. They're a good team. We're a good team. It's going to be a hard, long series. We signed up for that.""

The Canucks have not been in the playoffs since 2015 and many on the roster, including key players Elias Pettersson, Markstrom, Brock Boeser and Quinn Hughes, are getting their first taste of the rigours of the NHL post-season.

O'Reilly, last year's Conn Smythe Trophy winner in the cup run, scored late in the first period on the power play — the first time the Blues have opened the scoring in the series.

Pietrangelo whistled a slapshot that missed the net, but the puck caromed straight back off the backboards to O'Reilly, who put it under the crossbar.

Vancouver tied it just 40 seconds into the second period. Alex Edler wristed the puck from the blue line and Miller redirected it in.

St. Louis then took control, outshooting the Canucks 17-5 in the period.

O'Reilly took a pass out of the corner from Perron, walked out in front of the net and flicked a backhander into the top corner. The Blues then caught a break on a two-man advantage. Pietrangelo zipped the puck through traffic in the crease. The puck hit Edler's stick and in.

O'Reilly has three goals in the series. Perron recorded two assists and has registered a point in every game this series (two goals, four assists).

Allen started for the second consecutive game for St. Louis, replacing Jordan Binnington. Markstrom has played every minute for the Canucks through eight post-season games.

Vancouver captain Bo Horvat was kept off the scoresheet for a second consecutive game after lighting up the Blues for two goals in each of the first two contests.

Hughes also saw his streak snapped. The Calder candidate was going for a point in his seventh consecutive post-season game. The 20-year-old has one goal and eight assists.

All Western Conference games are being played in front of no fans at Rogers Place. The players are being kept isolated in a so-called bubble between games to prevent contracting COVID-19.

Ryu (2-1) struck out three and walked none. The left-hander permitted only one runner past second base and yielded just one extra-base hit to a team that came in ranked second in the majors with a .467 slugging percentage.

Rather than vie for strikeouts, Ryu said he was focused more on getting the Orioles to hit the ball weakly.

""I was able to keep them off balance,"" he said through an interpreter.

Signed in December to an $80 million, four-year contract, Ryu got off to a shaky start with Toronto in July before showing the form he displayed as a star with the Dodgers. He's given up a total of two runs in his last three starts after allowing eight runs over nine innings in his first two outings.

""That was vintage Ryu,"" Blue Jays manager Charlie Montoyo said. ""Ryu was outstanding. That's the reason we won the game.""

The two home runs were a factor, but mostly Ryu was the difference-maker.

""They didn’t give Ryu that big contract for nothing,"" Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said. ""You just never know what he’s going to throw. You don’t know what side of the plate he’s going to throw to. He’s really tough on right-handers because he can locate it in. You saw a lot of us get jammed.""

The Blue Jays took control with a four-run third against Alex Cobb (1-2). Three infield hits produced a run before Grichuk delivered a three-run drive over the centre-field wall. It was his third home run of the season, all in the last four games.

""Obviously, the pitch to Grichuk was middle middle and it was a poorly executed pitch,"" Cobb said. ""But most of the pitches that I had, I felt like I executed. I got the results.""

Cobb gave up five runs and eight hits in 6 2/3 innings. He’s winless in his last four starts.

After hitting 31 homers last year, Grichuk was batting fifth, sixth or seventh in the order this season before Montoyo decided to move him into the No. 2 spot Sunday to replace injured Bo Bichette. Over the past two games, Grichuk has two homers, four hits and six RBIs.

Pedro Severino and Renato Núñez had RBIs for the Orioles, who have dropped two straight after winning seven of eight.

TRAINER'S ROOM

Blue Jays: Bichette (right knee sprain) had an MRI and will receive a second opinion on his injury, Montoyo said. Bichette leads Toronto with a .361 batting average.

Orioles: RH Dillon Tate (elbow contusion) came off the injured list and RH Evan Phillips was optioned to the team's alternate site.

UP NEXT

Blue Jays: RH Nate Pearson (0-0, 5.11 ERA) makes his fourth start in his first big league season Tuesday night. Drafted 28th overall in 2017, the 23-year-old is looking to rebound after giving up four runs to Miami last week in 2 1/3 innings. ""I'm developing at the highest level,"" Pearson said Monday. ""When I don't have my best stuff, I'm going to struggle.""

Orioles: LH Wade LeBlanc (1-0, 7.13) has allowed a combined 10 runs over 12 innings in his last three starts.

Marchand and Connor Clifton also scored in the third, helping Boston erase a 2-0 deficit entering the period. It was a stunning turnaround – complete with the Bruins taking a 16-2 edge in shots on goal in those final 20 minutes – that now has Boston within a win of advancing in a series that looked headed for a 2-2 tie.

""We always say it’s a process and we continue to build every shift,"" Marchand said. ""That’s what we did. We just continued to impose our will and play our game. And when we play like that, we’re a tough team to play.""

Game 5 is Wednesday, with the Bruins having the chance to eliminate the Hurricanes from the Stanley Cup playoffs again after sweeping Carolina in last year’s Eastern Conference finals.

""We weren’t ready to continue to do that dig in that we needed to do — little battles,"" Carolina coach Rod Brind'Amour said. ""They threw everything at us, and we didn’t have an answer.""

The Bruins entered the post-season as the President's Trophy winner with a league-best 100 regular-season points, but they went 0-3 in the round-robin series to determine the top four seeds in the Eastern Conference playoffs. Then came the surprise news that goaltender Tuukka Rask was opting out of the playoff run to be with his family shortly before Game 3.

But Boston has won two straight, first by dominating Game 3 from the second period on and then by turning in an even more impressive showing in the third period of Game 4.

It started with DeBrusk's first goal, when he saw James Reimer coming out to play the puck and dove to push it past the netminder to get Boston on the board. Minutes later came Charlie McAvoy's hard hit on Jordan Staal that knocked Carolina's captain from the game, followed by Clifton zipping the puck past Reimer and just inside the top left corner of the goal to tie it.

Boston went ahead for good when Torey Krug passed ahead off the boards to Marchand, who got free to bury a 1-on-1 chance against Reimer for the 3-2 lead at 11:40. And DeBrusk added one more, getting an easy putaway from just outside the crease off a feed from Ondrej Kase at 14:17.

DeBrusk had managed one goal and no assists in Boston's first six post-season games.

""There's other ways he can contribute, especially in the playoffs,"" Bruins coach Bruce Cassidy said. ""But we need some goals. ... Sometimes he gets streaky so hopefully this sets him off.""

Justin Williams and Jordan Martinook scored to give Carolina the 2-0 lead before the Bruins ran off four straight goals, while Teuvo Teravainen added a goal at 18:33 of the third to bring Carolina within one.

Reimer made his second start of the series in net for the Hurricanes after Petr Mrazek had started Games 1 and 3, shutting out the Bruins for two period before faltering as Boston took over by relentlessly keeping the puck in the offensive zone. He finished with 29 saves.

Jaroslav Halak finished with 16 saves, though the Bruins made it easy on him in the third by not surrendering a shot until Teravainen's late goal.

""That third period was certainly not what we’re accustomed to,"" Williams said. ""We got it handed to us.""

NOTES: David Pastrnak had a goal and an assist in Boston’s double-overtime win in Game 1, but hasn’t played since. He had 48 regular-season goals to tie Washington’s Alex Ovechkin for the league lead. … Carolina played without 20-year-old Andrei Svechnikov, who was injured when his leg twisted awkwardly beneath him late in the third period of Saturday's loss. ... DeBrusk scored his 12th and 13th playoff goals since his 2018 post-season debut. … The Hurricanes were also without D Joel Edmundson for the third straight game. … Jake Gardiner assisted on Williams’ first-period goal for his first post-season point with Carolina.

It was nothing new to Anthony (Doc) Cornell.

article continues below

VanVleet played for Cornell's AAU team Pryme Time in his hometown of Rockford, Ill., and the coach said even as a seventh grader the Toronto Raptors guard had nerves of steel.

There was the tournament, Cornell recalled, where VanVleet reached in for a steal and took a headbutt to the eye.

""His eye literally is swollen shut, he looks like Rocky,"" Cornell said. ""So the physician at the tournament was like 'Doc, this boy can't play, he's gotta go get stitches.'

""Fred looked at me and said 'I'm playing.' The doctor was like 'Fred, you can't see.' Not only does Fred play, he leads us in scoring and assists with one eye in the championship game. People were like, 'Man, Fred has one eye, and he's killing y'all,'"" Cornell said with a loud laugh.

""Those type of moments were always like 'man, he's just on a different level.'""

The undrafted star out of Wichita State was cut under the eye and chipped a front tooth in Game 4 of the Finals against Golden State. His battered face lent another layer to the already rich story when he poured in 22 points, including a huge three-pointer, late in the Raptors' title-clinching Game 6 win over the Warriors.

The 26-year-old has picked up where he left off last post-season, erupting for 30 points in Monday's Game 1 win over Brooklyn in the opening round of the playoffs in Florida. VanVleet knocked down eight three-pointers and assisted on another seven.

On one late three-pointer, VanVleet pulled up to leave his defender, skidding by him like a puppy on linoleum.

VanVleet said he's been working on shooting from longer distance, sparked by conversations with coach Nick Nurse during last year's playoffs. The six-foot guard was getting blocked too often, and the Raptors needed him scoring.

""So I started putting it in my game and I've just been working on it more and more since then,"" VanVleet said Tuesday. ""Obviously with the playoffs, it's a little bit harder to get your shot off, and guys are flying around a little bit more. If you can knock it down from distance, it just makes it that much harder for the defence to run out to you. Sometimes you catch 'em off guard or you just avoid that extra couple inches of hand to contest.""

Mr. Bet on Yourself has always loved a good challenge.

Cornell's Pryme Time roster, which VanVleet helped transform into the most successful in Rockford AAU history, was unconventional. Where other AAU teams would load up with four or five bigs, Cornell preferred guards and shooters. They were the smaller team in any game. They usually played up an age group, often against powerhouse teams boasting shoe deals.

Other teams tried to woo him away.

""But he was always loyal, he'd say 'Why would I leave? I'm the captain of the ship. These are my soldiers. I'm staying with my group,'"" Cornell said. ""As it turned out, he was the type of floor general and leader to help us get past all these bigger, higher-ranked so-called AAU giants.""

Cornell has loads of stories of VanVleet's heroics from the five years he played for Pryme Time.

There was a memorable Friday night game of a major AAU tournament. Pryme Time, which was short-handed, needed to beat the Wisconsin state champions to get to the bracket round. With about 10 seconds left, one of VanVleet's teammates tried to set a pick to get him the ball.

""Fred yells 'give me the damn ball!' then Fred takes one dribble from outside the three-point line and shoots it right down the middle,"" Cornell said. ""Nothing beyond net. Walks off and says, 'I told you we wasn't going home.'""

""I think I was 10 times more excited than him, I got on the phone and called his mom, I said 'Sue, I know people say this all the time about different players, but this boy is going to the league.' I said 'You should have seen what he just did.' He shot it like ice water in his veins, like it was nothing.'""

VanVleet was the kid who only needed a foot in the door, Cornell said.

""His mindset going to tournaments was his bag was his briefcase, and this was a business trip to get him to where he intended to go in the future,"" the coach said.

VanVleet committed to Wichita State ahead of his Grade 12 year, so Shockers coach Gregg Marshall caught most of his final two AAU seasons.

""Pryme Time was this little team out of Rockford, just a bunch of dudes, a ragtag group. But they were beating all of the great shoe-company, elite AAU programs and Fred was just orchestrating the whole thing,"" Marshall said. ""I'm sitting there going, 'wow.' I mean, he's literally taking this group and winning.""

He did the same thing at Wichita State, taking the Shockers to the Final Four in 2013.

""No matter what the stage, he believes he's put in the work, and he's got the mindset and the calmness, and he's precocious if you will,"" Marshall said. ""And he just seems to will his team to be . . . the sum is better than the individual parts, right?""

VanVleet was just a freshman when he led the Shockers to an upset of Gonzaga at the 2013 NCAA tournament. With just under two minutes to play, Wichita was up by a couple of points, and VanVleet fumbled the ball toward his team's bench. He managed to retrieve it but not in time to fully turn to face the net.

""He didn't hesitate, he just shot it, and as a freshman, to take a shot like that,"" the coach marvelled. ""And as it was going through the net, he just looked at me like, 'Oh, that was good the whole way' and gave me this little shrug.

""It reminded me so much of some shots that he hit in the clinching game for the title last year.""

VanVleet, who's earning just over US$9 million this season, will be a hot commodity in free agency come October, and re-signing him should be a top priority for Toronto.

Rockford Mayor Tom McNamara believes there's no putting a pricetag on VanVleet's efforts off the court as well, and the guard's commitment to his hometown.

""Kind of weird to say about someone with such star power as Fred, but he's a better person off the court than he is a basketball player on the court,"" said the 37-year-old McNamara, whose dad John was Rockford's mayor in the '80s.

The city of 150,000 is infamous for being listed among America's most dangerous cities in past years, with a violent crime rate ranking worse than nearby Chicago.

VanVleet's roots there still run deep. He sells his 'Bet on Yourself' sportswear line out of his downtown shop. The city held viewing parties — ""our own mini-Jurassic Parks,"" said McNamara — during last year's Raptors playoff run. He was presented with a key to the city. McNamara joked the city's nickname would forever be ""Fredford.""

""He's made a lifelong Bulls fan into a Raptors fan,"" McNamara said.

VanVleet organizes annual backpack giveaways for Rockford kids. He posted a message to Rockfordians at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic urging them to stay safe. When McNamara implemented the Mayor's Office on Domestic Violence and Human Trafficking Prevention, he reached out to VanVleet for support.

""Obviously with his schedule, he can't go into every high school with me. But he did videos for us. I've never once called and asked him for anything where he's said no to, that benefits the community,"" McNamara said.

VanVleet's father — also named Fred — was shot to death in 1999 in what's been reported as a drug deal that went bad. VanVleet was five at the time, and was raised by his mom Sue and stepfather Joe Danforth, a police officer who introduced him to basketball at a young age to steer him away from trouble.

Kids in Rockford look up to VanVleet, McNamara said, but the appreciation goes beyond what he's able to do on the court.

""It's different with Fred, it's different because he is just such a class act. He is quietly, steadily showing how to just be a good human, not just an exceptional basketball player but someone who cares, and doesn't forget about where he came from,"" he said.

His story of perseverance, McNamara said, mirrors so many people of Rockford.

""He's kind of the model of what we would call 'the Rockford grit and toughness,'"" said the mayor. ""A lot of wonderful people just working exceptionally hard to excel.""

Jake DeBrusk, Brad Marchand and the Boston Bruins quickly went from trailing by two goals to overwhelming the Carolina Hurricanes with a dominating third period.

DeBrusk scored twice while the Bruins scored four straight goals to rally and beat the Hurricanes 4-3 on Monday to take a 3-1 lead in their first-round playoff series.

Marchand and Connor Clifton also scored in the third, helping Boston erase a 2-0 deficit entering the period. It was a stunning turnaround – complete with the Bruins taking a 16-2 edge in shots on goal in those final 20 minutes – that now has Boston within a win of advancing in a series that looked headed for a 2-2 tie.

“We always say it’s a process and we continue to build every shift,” Marchand said. “That’s what we did. We just continued to impose our will and play our game. And when we play like that, we’re a tough team to play.”

Game 5 is Wednesday, with the Bruins having the chance to eliminate the Hurricanes from the Stanley Cup playoffs again after sweeping Carolina in last year’s Eastern Conference finals.

“We weren’t ready to continue to do that dig in that we needed to do – little battles,” Carolina coach Rod Brind’Amour said. “They threw everything at us, and we didn’t have an answer.”

The Bruins entered the post-season as the President’s Trophy winner with a league-best 100 regular-season points, but they went 0-3 in the round-robin series to determine the top four seeds in the Eastern Conference playoffs. Then came the surprise news that goaltender Tuukka Rask was opting out of the playoff run to be with his family shortly before Game 3.

But Boston has won two straight, first by dominating Game 3 from the second period on and then by turning in an even more impressive showing in the third period of Game 4.

It started with DeBrusk’s first goal, when he saw James Reimer coming out to play the puck and dove to push it past the netminder to get Boston on the board. Minutes later came Charlie McAvoy’s hard hit on Jordan Staal that knocked Carolina’s captain from the game, followed by Clifton zipping the puck past Reimer and just inside the top left corner of the goal to tie it.

Boston went ahead for good when Torey Krug passed ahead off the boards to Marchand, who got free to bury a 1-on-1 chance against Reimer for the 3-2 lead at 11:40. And DeBrusk added one more, getting an easy put away from just outside the crease off a feed from Ondrej Kase at 14:17.

Story continues below advertisement

DeBrusk had managed one goal and no assists in Boston’s first six post-season games.

“There’s other ways he can contribute, especially in the playoffs,” Bruins coach Bruce Cassidy said. “But we need some goals. ... Sometimes he gets streaky so hopefully this sets him off.”

Justin Williams and Jordan Martinook scored to give Carolina the 2-0 lead before the Bruins ran off four straight goals, while Teuvo Teravainen added a goal at 18:33 of the third to bring Carolina within one.

Reimer made his second start of the series in net for the Hurricanes after Petr Mrazek had started Games 1 and 3, shutting out the Bruins for two period before faltering as Boston took over by relentlessly keeping the puck in the offensive zone. He finished with 29 saves.

Jaroslav Halak finished with 16 saves, though the Bruins made it easy on him in the third by not surrendering a shot until Teravainen’s late goal.

“That third period was certainly not what we’re accustomed to,” Williams said. “We got it handed to us.”

Tarasenko missed Games 3 and 4, which the Blues won to tie the series. Game 5 is Wednesday.

""He’s not feeling right, and so that’s why he’s going to get it looked at,"" coach Craig Berube said. ""It’s concerning, but we don’t know a lot yet, so I’m not going to jump to conclusions on anything.""

The 28-year-old Russian winger missed the majority of the season after having his dislocated shoulder operated on in October. He returned to the ice for training camp but had zero points and 10 shots in goal in four games since the NHL restarted and clearly didn't look like himself.

""For sure he wasn’t full out, but in saying that, I didn’t think there was anything wrong,"" Berube said. ""I understood why, coming back from surgery and nine months off. ... It’s not easy being off that long and coming back and just jumping right into it and being full out. I knew he’d come back and probably ease his way in a little bit.""

The defending Stanley Cup champions played the majority of the season without Tarasenko and were first in the Western Conference when the season was halted in March.

""The way we play, too, is pretty simple and everybody play for each other and we work hard,"" said winger Jacob de la Rose, who took Tarasenko's spot in the lineup. ""Blues hockey is get pucks deep, play hard, play good defensively and that’s what we’ve been doing here and I feel like that’s what we did all year too during the regular season, so even if we lose guys, it’s easy for a guy like me here coming into the series, too. You know what they expect of you.""

Tarasenko had 11 goals and six assists during the Blues' title run last year. He had 10 points in 10 games this season before being injured.

Berube isn't worried about not having Tarasenko for at least the next two games.

""We’re a team,"" he said. ""We play without players at times because you have to with injuries and different situations that come up. Our team is what makes us a good team. We just rely on each other and different people can come in and take people’s spots and just do the job.""

HFX WANDERERS 2

The flow was a bit rusty, as to be expected following a delay of four months, but also entertaining as Pacific FC and HFX Wanderers opened their Canadian Premier League accounts with an eventful 2-2 draw in Charlottetown, P.E.I.

article continues below

Both teams will rue not winning Saturday’s contest, in which posts were hit and balls cleared off the line by both sides. It looked to be the Nova Scotia-based Wanderers’ game to lose for two-thirds of it with a 1-0 lead. Then Island-based PFC scored twice, before a late penalty kick by HFX tied it 2-2.

“I thought we created the most but were not effective enough to punish them,” said PFC head coach Pa-Modou Kah.

Both HFX goals came on book-end penalty kicks through Brazilian and former Middlesbrough player Joao Neto Morelli at 12 minutes and Ibrahima Sanoh at 86 minutes.

“People were a bit rusty and not used to those situations [defensively],” said Kah.

“That causes it. But that is a part of football. Football is about mistakes. Unfortunately, we made them today and it cost us three points.”

Overall, however, the PFC bench boss was pleased, considering the circumstances of the pandemic delaying the start of the season.

“We have not played in 200-odd days, and to perform like that, is incredible,” said Kah.

""Our team performed brilliantly but was just unlucky. The game is about momentum and the early [HFX] penalty goal took a little of that away from us. We stuck together and had the fight to take the lead. Unfortunately, we allowed the late penalty. We will take a lesson out of it.”

Goals by sophomore Zach Verhoven at 67 minutes and six-times Canada-capped Marco Bustos at 75 minutes had given PFC the lead.

“It was a great feeling to play an actual game,” said Bustos, who scored seven goals last season for Valour FC of Winnipeg.

“We want to create chances as a team, which we did, in scoring two goals from open play. And we will only get better as time goes on.”

All games are being played on the University of Prince Edward Island’s FIFA-standard Alumni Field turf facility sans fans amid the CPL’s “bubble” after Charlottetown beat out Langford and Moncton, N.B., to host the CPL season tournament.

""We showed good character the way we clawed back,” said HFX head coach Stephen Hart.

“We showed good mental spirit. The game was fairly balanced. We would have loved to have gotten the three points, but so would they [PFC].”

Hart said his team’s two goals from the spot were earned.

“You only get penalty kicks for attacking,” said the former Canadian national team head coach.

Each of the eight teams will play the other once in the round-robin portion of the made-for-TV tournament. PFC’s other games are against York9 on Tuesday at 10 a.m., Forge FC of Hamilton next Saturday at 1 p.m., Valour FC of Winnipeg on Aug. 25 at 11 a.m., Cavalry FC of Calgary on Aug. 30 at 9 a.m., Atletico Ottawa on Sept. 2 at 5 p.m. and FC Edmonton on Sept. 6 at noon. All times are PDT.

The top-four teams will advance to a playoff-round robin. The top team from that will go directly into the league championship game while the second- and third-place teams will meet in a semifinal with the winner advancing to the championship final.

“The hotel is great and they have given us lots to do, so we are not bored,” said de Jong.","Pacific FC captain Marcel de Jong says it’s all a matter of perspective. He prefers to look at pandemic soccer “as much as an adventure as a challenge.”

De Jong has played in the Bundesliga, Dutch Premiership, MLS and has been capped 56 times for Canada. He has been through a lot on fields across the world, but no one has been through anything like this before. His attitude is: It’s here, it’s a fact, so you might as well get used to it.

“I’ve seen a lot of football in my career, but this is a first,” he said.

“But we are still doing what we love to do most, which is play football. And in the end, that’s all that matters.”

De Jong leads Island-based Pacific FC into its opening 2020 Canadian Premier League game today against the HFX Wanderers of Halifax (noon PDT on CBC).

All games will be played on the University of Prince Edward Island’s FIFA-standard Alumni Field turf facility sans fans amid the league’s “bubble” after Charlottetown beat out Langford and Moncton, N.B., to host the CPL season tournament.

“We haven’t seen anybody play except [2019 CPL finalists Forge FC of Hamilton and Cavalry FC of Calgary who opened the tournament Thursday], so basically, every opposition team is a mystery,” said de Jong.

“We are just in the mindset of playing our game and concentrating on ourselves and our play.”

De Jong will anchor a solid PFC backline. But the team’s strength appears to be a forward-thinking, pressing and attacking midfield likely to consist of Victor Blasco, Marco Bustos, Jamar Dixon, Noah Verhoeven and Zach Verhoven.

“We have a dynamic team that will be looking to control the play with high pressure and getting the ball back as soon as we lose it,” said de Jong. “You will not see any long balls, but only good and attractive football from us. I believe we have the performers who can play that way.”

That type of approach takes energy.

“There are a lot of games over a short period of time,” de Jong said. “So the allowing of more subs [five per game compared with the usual three] will very much help in that regard. Everybody is going to get their chance through this tournament.”

Each of the eight teams will play the other once in the round-robin portion of the made-for-TV tournament. PFC’s other games are against York9 on Tuesday at 10 a.m., Forge FC on Aug. 22 at 1 p.m., Valour FC of Winnipeg on Aug. 25 at 11 a.m., Cavalry FC on Aug. 30 at 9 a.m., Atletico Ottawa on Sept. 2 at 5 p.m. and FC Edmonton on Sept. 6 at noon. All times are PDT.

The top-four teams will advance to a playoff-round robin. The top team from that will go directly into the league championship game while the second- and third-place teams will meet in a semifinal with the winner advancing to the championship final.

All games will be broadcast live over the web on OneSoccer while CBC will broadcast doubleheaders nationally on Saturdays.

All eight CPL teams quarantined for 14 days before leaving their cities and quarantined an additional five days in Charlottetown, where each club is occupying a separate floor in the city’s waterfront Delta hotel.

Each player was tested for COVID in their home communities and again upon landing in Charlottetown. All tests among CPL players, coaches and staff have been negative.

This is the second year for the long-awaited Canadian domestic pro soccer league, mandated by FIFA, as part of Canada hosting the 2026 World Cup with the U.S. and Mexico. No one could have anticipated the sophomore CPL being played in this abbreviated fashion amid a pandemic.

“The hotel is great and they have given us lots to do, so we are not bored,” said de Jong.

He certainly won’t be bored today.

Pacific FC head coach Pa-Modou Kah expressed unreserved confidence in goalkeeper Nolan Wirth of Comox heading into today’s Canadian Premier League soccer game against York9 in Charlottetown, P.E.I. (5 p.m. PDT on OneSoccer).

Kah has his choice of Wirth, the second-year PFC keeper who played in the NCAA Pac-12 for the Oregon State Beavers, or Canada-capped Callum Irving, dressed in reserve Saturday.

The PFC bench boss said Wirth’s early ball-dribbling error, which led to Wirth fouling former Victoria Highlanders forward Corey Bent of the HFX Wanderers in the box at 12 minutes Saturday, will not be held against him. That led to a penalty-kick goal for the Halifax club, through Brazilian and former Middlesbrough-signed Joao Neto Morelli, which changed the complexion over the first two thirds of the game in the eventual 2-2 tie.

“Mistakes are part of the game,” said Ka h.

“It was a learning moment. Nolan did everything we asked of him. He showed resilience and commitment in coming back after that. We are 100 percent behind Nolan. There is no doubt about that. There was a reason he earned the role [as the season-opener starter].”

Kah, meanwhile, expressed satisfaction about the new rule allowing five subs per game during the abbreviated pandemic season instead of the normal three. All coaches used their subs mostly to the max over the opening weekend.

“The games are thick and fast and there will be some roster rotation for sure [off the bench],” said Kah.

“All our [five] subs did great work and were impactful,” said Kah.

That included Zach Verhoven, who scored the first goal of the season for PFC, to tie the game 1-1 against HFX.

“It shows the depth of our roster, and the fact our quality does not change when we go to our bench,” said Kah.

“We have players who can switch positions, so our versatility [multiplies the bench’s potential].”

Saturday’s opener was Kah’s first as a pro head coach.

“It is different from being an assistant coach to being a head coach,” he said.

“I will never forget my first game in charge [as head coach]. It will be in my mind the rest of my life. I want to grow with these guys as human beings and players.”

York9, from the Greater Toronto Area, opened its pandemic season account also with a 2-2 draw against Atletico Ottawa.

The opening-weekend flow was a bit rusty, as is to be expected following such a delay, but the games were also entertaining and e ventful.

“The last game for PFC was Oct. 19 last season against Valour FC,” noted Kah.

“The boys are getting their legs back. I took a lot of positives out of the first game. I loved our resiliency in coming back to tie and then take the lead [before a late HFX penalty kick tied it 2-2]. There was some sloppiness and a lack of rhythm until the guys settled down and showed their quality. The guys showed they really care for one another. ”

Sophomore Verhoven at 67 minutes and six-times Canada-capped Marco Bustos at 75 minutes scored for PFC in the opener.

“It was a great feeling to play an actual game,” said Bustos, who scored seven goals last season for Valour FC of Winnipeg.

The Jets and Ontario Hockey League's Barrie Colts, a team Hawerchuk coached, confirmed the death on Twitter on Tuesday.

""After an incredibly brave and difficult battle with cancer, our dad has passed away. My family is so proud of him and the way he fought. #HawerchukStrong,"" Eric Hawerchuk, one of Dale and wife Crystal's three children, wrote on Twitter.

A teenage star, Hawerchuk was drafted first overall by the Jets in 1981. He went on to play nine seasons in Winnipeg and five in Buffalo before finishing up his distinguished 16-year NHL career with stints in St. Louis and Philadelphia.

Hawerchuk recorded 518 goals and 1,409 points in 1,188 regular-season games (he added 30 more goals and 99 assists in 97 playoff games).

""A low-maintenance superstar,"" said Craig Heisinger, Winnipeg's senior vice-president and director of hockey operations.

At five foot 11 and 190 pounds, Hawerchuk wasn't blessed with size or blistering speed. But the five-time all-star had a knack of getting to loose pucks and then creating something out of nothing. Hawerchuk could breeze past opponents and knew what to do when he neared the goal.

""I was fortunate to see Dale come into the league,"" Jets chairman Mark Chipman said Tuesday. ""I think we were all still very much in awe of the fact the Winnipeg Jets had joined the National Hockey League. I think it was Dale's arrival that really cemented the future of the franchise and I think we all have recollections of that first year, that Calder (Trophy) year and then everything that would follow.

""He was truly a superstar as a hockey player, but I think why he was so loved here was not just that but largely the fact that he made this his home and became one of us. I think everybody shared that sense of pride in Dale's career as a player.""

Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister added: ""All Jets fans mourn the loss of one of the NHL's all time greatest players.""

Former Jets star Teemu Selanne said he had a chance to talk to Hawerchuk on Monday and say goodbye.

""What an incredible human being,"" Selanne tweeted.

Montreal Canadiens associate coach Kirk Muller also had a chance to speak with Hawerchuk in recent days.

""I talked to Dale a few days ago, and we had a good chance to chat. A good friend, had a real good opportunity to play against one of the all-time best players. As a hockey player, we all know how great he was, but he was a good friend and just a really special person, did a lot for charities. It's a real loss for us in the hockey world.""

NHL commissioner Gary Bettman called Hawerchuk ""one of the most decorated players in our game's history.""

In September 2019, Hawerchuk took a leave of absence from coaching the Colts to undergo chemotherapy treatment.

""For some reason the Lord put me in this kind of fight and I'm ready to fight it,"" he told TSN in October 2019. ""I want to live to tell the story.""

Eric Hawerchuk said in July on Twitter that the cancer had returned after his dad completed chemotherapy in April.

Dale Hawerchuk, the longest-serving coach in Colts history, was going into his 10th season behind Barrie's bench. He had led the Colts to the playoffs in six of his nine previous seasons.

At Barrie, Hawerchuk coached the likes of Aaron Ekblad, Mark Scheifele, Tanner Pearson and Ryan Suzuki.

Calgary Flames players Andrew Mangiapane and Rasmus Andersson remembered playing for Hawerchuk in Barrie.

""I don't know where I'd be without him,"" said Mangiapane. ""Very sad news today. I owe my career basically to him and the whole Barrie organization.""

Andersson, from Sweden, said ""Dale was a fantastic human being. Such a great person. My first week in Barrie he invited us over to his house and really just welcomed me to Canada. I cannot say enough good things about him as a person. Obviously a real good coach, too.""

""It's awful news.""

The NHL held a moment of silence for Hawerchuk before Tuesday's opening playoff game between the Montreal Canadiens and Philadelphia Flyers in Toronto.

Born April 4, 1963, in Toronto, Hawerchuk grew up in nearby Oshawa, getting his first pair of skates at age two and playing competitively at four. As a peewee, he broke Guy Lafleur's record by scoring all eight goals in an 8-1 victory in the final of a tournament in Montreal.

At 15, he was offered a tryout by the Oshawa Generals. He ended up playing instead for the Oshawa Legionaires in the Metro Jr. B Hockey League in 1978-79.

Some 23 years later, he remembered his Oshawa days during his 2001 induction speech at the Hockey Hall of Fame.

""I started my career just down the road in Oshawa here, maybe a 45-minute drive — well maybe a little further now with the traffic,"" he said. ""I had many dreams and aspirations to make the National Hockey League. And I was very fortunate I got to live those dreams for 16 years in the National Hockey League.""

""I enjoyed every city and organization I played in,"" he added.

Hawerchuk was highly touted coming into junior and was drafted sixth overall by the Cornwall Royals, who then played in the Quebec league but took part in the Ontario draft.

Hawerchuk led the Royals to back-to-back Memorial Cups in 1980 and '81 with teammates that included Scott Arniel, Marc Crawford, Dan Daoust and Doug Gilmour.

Hawerchuk was named Memorial Cup MVP in 1981 when he set a tournament record with eight goals and tied another with 13 points.

He collected 103 points in being named the QMJHL's top rookie. The next season, as a 17-year-old, he led the Quebec league in goals (81), assists (102) and points (183) when he was named Canadian major junior player of the year.

A grateful John Ferguson drafted Hawerchuk in 1981. Hawerchuk went to Winnipeg as an 18-year-old and spent nine years there, saying he felt like he grew up in the Manitoba capital.

The Jets had finished last in the league prior to drafting Hawerchuk, who signed his first pro contract before a bevy of Manitoba notables, including the mayor, at the corner of Portage and Main after arriving in a Brinks truck.

He did not disappoint. The teenager scored 45 goals and collected 103 points, was named rookie of the year — the youngest recipient at the time — and led Winnipeg to a 48-point improvement, the largest single-season turnaround in the NHL.

""Just one of the greatest. You could tell from day one. We knew from when he was 18 years old as a player that he would turn the (Jets) franchise around. Certainly one of the best I’ve ever played with and coached,"" said Dallas Stars coach Rick Bowness, who played with and coached Hawerchuk in the '80s.

He was the youngest player in NHL history to reach 100 points, a record broken by Sidney Crosby in 2006. No wonder his early career came with comparisons to Wayne Gretzky.

""He has the same instincts, that puck sense, of Gretzky,"" said Mike Doran, Winnipeg's director of player personnel in 1981.

In 1987, Hawerchuk made history with Gretzky at the Canada Cup in Hamilton. He won the faceoff in his own end that led to a Gretzky-Mario Lemieux rush and Lemieux's famous winning goal in a 6-5 victory that decided the tightly contested three-game series.

""It turned out fantastic,"" said Hawerchuk, who often answered Canada's call.

When he was inducted into the Hall of Fame, the Jets were no more (the team was revived in Winnipeg in 2011). But he said the Jets ""are etched in my mind every day that I live.""

The franchise moved to Phoenix in 1996 and became the Coyotes. Eleven years later, Hawerchuk joined Bobby Hull and Thomas Steen on the Coyotes' ring of honour.

Hawerchuk re-wrote the Jets record book before being traded to Buffalo during the 1990 NHL draft. As an unrestricted free agent, Hawerchuk signed with the St. Louis Blues in 1995 before being dealt to Philadelphia whom he helped to the Stanley Cup final in 96-97 season, his final season.

Slowed down by a hip issue, he retired at the age of 34.

Hawerchuk was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2001 along with Viacheslav Fetisov, Mike Gartner and Jari Kurri in the player category.

""It's like going back down memory lane,"" he said in his induction speech.

""All the experiences have been fantastic,"" he added. ""I mean, sometimes they didn't feel so great. You had your highs and lows. But when I look back on it, I wouldn't change a thing ... Even though I didn't win a Stanley Cup, I still wouldn't change a thing. I think to ask for more would be greedy.""

Known as Ducky by his teammates, Hawerchuk was inducted into the Jets' Hall of Fame prior to their game against the visiting Arizona Coyotes in November 2017.

""Tonight we fly Ducky's number high,"" said a tribute video, to the sounds of Motley Crue's ""Home Sweet Home,"" before his No. 10 was raised to the rafters.

""Please welcome home perhaps the greatest Jet of all time,"" said the PA announcer.

Hawerchuk played 713 games as a Jet, recording 379 goals and 929 points. He also served five seasons as captain.

""I've been to every part of (Manitoba), either golfing or playing (softball),"" Hawerchuk said. ""I've gotten to see Manitobans, seen their passion not only for their province and the game of hockey, but their passion for the Jets. I'm honoured and I'm very humbled.""

After retiring, he became part of the ownership group of the Tier II junior Orangeville Crushers, stepping behind the bench in 2007 prior to joining Barrie.

Corey Crawford made 48 saves in a stellar performance, and Chicago beat the Vegas Golden Knights 3-1 on Sunday night to stay alive in their first-round playoff series.

Drake Caggiula and Matthew Highmore scored first-period goals for Chicago, and Alex DeBrincat added an empty-netter with 10 seconds left. Chicago handed Robin Lehner his first loss in a Golden Knights uniform since the goaltender was acquired in a trade with Chicago in February.

Shea Theodore scored his fourth playoff goal for Vegas in the first period when his shot from the point slipped through traffic in front of the net. But it was the only time the Golden Knights managed to beat Crawford on a night when the playoff-tested veteran was the best player on the ice.

Crawford, who was in net when Chicago won the Stanley Cup in 2013 and 2015, set a playoff career high for a regulation game.

Playing less than 24 hours after a 2-1 loss in Game 3, Crawford was under attack from the outset, especially after Chicago took a 2-0 lead on Highmore’s unexpected goal. Highmore threw a shot on net from below the goal-line and got a fortunate deflection when Lehner attempted to redirect the puck with his head, but instead sent it into his net.

Theodore’s shot slipped through, but nothing else did. Crawford was up to every challenge, especially as the Golden Knights continued to test him with high shots to the glove side. Crawford made a diving save on Max Pacioretty and stuffed William Karlsson on a breakaway in the second period.

But Crawford’s best sequence may have come midway through the third period when he stopped Karlsson’s attempt with his mask, and then gloved Zach Whitecloud’s wrist shot from inside the right circle.

Chicago’s penalty killers also had a solid night. Vegas went 0 for 3 with the man advantage and has not scored a power-play goal in the series. Chicago has killed off the past 14 power plays dating to its qualifying round matchup with Edmonton.

Lehner had won all seven of his starts since arriving in Vegas – three in the regular season and four in Edmonton. Lehner made 22 saves.

The Montreal Canadiens didn’t play poorly Sunday.

Carter Hart just played better – and got some help from his friends.

The Philadelphia goalie made 23 saves to record the first playoff shutout of his career as the Flyers defeated the Canadiens 1-0 to take a 2-1 lead in their opening-round series.

Montreal, which chased Hart from Friday’s emphatic 5-0 victory with four goals on 26 shots, hit two crossbars and three posts in a grinding, low-event encounter.

“That was style of game we expected,” Canadiens winger Brendan Gallagher said. “They find a way to put one in our net and we were unable to beat their goaltender.

“You give up one goal, you should be able to win.”

Jakub Voracek scored for Philadelphia, the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference as part of the NHL’s restart to its pandemic-hit season.

“It was a greasy hockey game,” Flyers head coach Alain Vigneault said. “Both teams worked extremely hard. It was hard to make offensive plays. Both teams were not giving a lot of room.”

Carey Price stopped 19 shots to take the loss for Montreal inside an empty Scotiabank Arena.

Game 4 of the best-of-seven matchup goes Tuesday afternoon.

After the Flyers opened the scoring early in the first period, Montreal centre Jesperi Kotkaniemi hit the crossbar 30 seconds into the third – the fifth time the Canadiens found iron in just over 40 minutes.

Hart then took an Artturi Lehkonen shot off the mask on a short-handed 2-on-1 with under eight minutes to go in regulation.

“Just got to do my job,” said 22-year-old Hart, who grew up idolizing Price. “That’s what it comes down to at the end of the day.”

Kotkaniemi shovelled a shot towards the Flyers’ net with Price on the bench for an extra attacker with 50 seconds left, but Hart was there again as Philadelphia, which blocked 24 shots on the night, improved to 34-0-2 this season when leading after two periods.

“Their goaltender played well,” Price said. “Sometimes you gotta tip your hat to a hot goaltender. We did all the right things to win.”

The Canadiens were coming off that Game 2 where they dominated the Flyers, who sat 18 points ahead of them in the standings when the NHL suspended its season because of COVID-19 in March, from start to finish minus head coach Claude Julien after he was rushed to hospital with chest pains Wednesday night.

Resting at home and expected to make a full recovery, the 60-year-old had a stent installed in one of his coronary arteries.

Perhaps looking to draw attention away from his team’s embarrassing performance Friday, Vigneault criticized Montreal associate coach Kirk Muller, who is running the bench in Julien’s absence, for putting his No. 1 power-play unit out in the dying minutes of a blowout.

The Flyers had a much better start Sunday against the speedy Canadiens after failing to register a shot until there was 3:36 left in the opening period of Game 2. Philadelphia nudged in front at 5:21 of the first following an offensive zone faceoff when Voracek redirected the puck up off himself and in past Price after Claude Giroux took the initial shot.

Montreal came close later in the period, with Kotkaniemi, who has four goals during the restart, whipping a shot off the post before Brett Kulak blasted his effort off the crossbar seconds later.

“It was a tight game,” Kotkaniemi said. “We had the chances we needed. Just need to bury them.”

The Canadiens then had to kill off a four-minute penalty to Kotkaniemi for high-sticking on former Montreal teammate Nate Thompson, and got some good fortune of their own when Travis Konecny found iron on a shot through a screen.

Ranked 24th of the 24 teams included in the resumption of play, the Canadiens didn’t have the same jump as in Game 2, but still had a number of chances in the second to get even.

“We didn’t get the same flow through the middle as the last game,” Muller said. “We got caught more into the boards. There’s some corrections that we can make, but we didn’t you utilize our speed as much.”

Gallagher, who has yet to find the back of the net in the post-season tournament despite a league-high 31 shots, hit the outside of the post and then forced a good save out of Hart off a turnover.

“No sense in feeling sorry for yourself,” Gallagher said of his dry spell after scoring 22 times in 2019-20. “Gotta find a way to battle through that. You gotta try and fight the urge to be frustrated.

“It’s a waste of emotion.”

The Flyers netminder then stopped Nick Suzuki with his glove on a Canadiens power play before the Montreal rookie hit another post on a short-handed 2-on-1.

Jonathan Drouin then jumped on a Scott Laughton giveaway, but Hart was there again to shut the door on a night where Montreal probably deserved a better fate.

“Our guys didn’t quit,” Muller said. “It was great effort.”

The Colorado Avalanche scored three early goals, revved up their power play and hit Arizona with a barrage of odd-man rushes.

Their defence closed in around goalie Philipp Grubauer, shut down the Coyotes’ shooting lanes.

Dominating in all aspects, the Avalanche are now within one win of advancing in the Stanley Cup playoffs.

Nazem Kadri had two goals and an assist, Philipp Grubauer stopped 14 shots and the Avalanche overwhelmed the Coyotes 7-1 Monday to take a 3-1 lead their first-round playoff series.

“We had a real good night tonight,” Avalanche coach Jared Bednar said. “We had some real good individual efforts and guys capitalized on their chances.”

The Avalanche jumped on Arizona after losing 4-2 in Game 3, scoring three first-period goals, two by Kadri on the power play.

Matt Calvert, Cale Makar and Mikko Rantanen each had a goal and an assist. Matt Nieto and Joonas Donskoi also scored. Grubauer was sharp after Pavel Francouz started Game 3.

A complete all-around game in the Edmonton bubble puts Colorado, the No. 2 seed in the Western Conference, in position to clinch the series in Game 5 on Wednesday.

“We had so many chances in Game 3 and obviously couldn’t get the puck in the net,” said Colorado forward Nathan MacKinnon, who had two assists. “It was nice to see us get that early one and we just kept going from there.”

The Coyotes had numerous defensive breakdowns and took three penalties while falling into the early hole, leaving goalie Darcy Kuemper defenceless.

Kuemper gave up four goals on 22 shots before being replaced by Antti Raanta in the third period and Jakob Chychrun scored for the Coyotes, who were held to 15 shots.

Coming off a big win in Game 3, the Coyotes are now one game from having their playoff bubble popped.

“I can’t tell you one player who played well today. We were embarrassed,” Coyotes coach Rick Tocchet said. “It was men against boys today.”

Arizona played its rope-a-Yote style to near perfection to win Game 3, absorbing Colorado’s near-constant pressure and counterattacking when the opportunities arose.

Kuemper made it work, stopping 49 shots for the second time this post-season, and the Coyotes blocked 27 shots in front of him.

Arizona wanted to be more aggressive offensively, as it was in Game 2, but Colorado had the game’s first six shots and scored late in the first period when a Coyotes turnover led to an odd-man rush. Nieto scored it by angling his skate to knock the puck past Kuemper on a feed from Calvert.

Colorado kept up the pressure, leading to Arizona’s third penalty in the opening period. The Avalanche converted on the power play, going up 2-0 on Kadri’s rebound two minutes after Nieto’s goal.

Kadri scored again on a power play in the closing seconds of the first period, punching in a rebound after the Coyotes allowed MacKinnon an open rush at Kuemper.

“It’s not good enough to come out like that when it’s a 2-1 series,” Coyotes captain Oliver Ekman-Larsson said.

Donskoi made it 4-0 midway through the second period on another odd-man rush, one-timing a pass from Andre Burakovsky past Kuemper’s glove side.

Arizona finally showed some signs of offensive life, scoring its first power-play goal of the series on a wrist shot by Chychrun from the right circle.

Raanta, who had been out since Game 2 against Nashville, replaced Kuemper to start the third period and gave up a goal 19 seconds in. Makar, a Calder Trophy finalist, shook defenceman Alex Goligoski with a nifty move and beat Raanta stick side to make it 5-1.

“That was an amazing and what made it more amazing was how easy he made it look,” Nieto said.

The same thing could be said about Colorado’s entire roster in Game 4.

The St. Louis Blues battled-tested vets gave the Vancouver Canucks a lesson on playoff resiliency Monday, shutting down the Canuck power play and fixing their own to draw even in their NHL playoff series.

Ryan O’Reilly scored twice and added an assist for the Blues in a 3-1 win at Rogers Place to give them their second consecutive win and tie the best-of-seven series at two games each.

Game 5 goes Wednesday.

Captain Alex Pietrangelo scored once and added an assist while veteran forward David Perron picked up two assists for the defending Stanley Cup champions.

“It was nice to get on the board tonight,” said O’Reilly.

“I haven’t been creating much offensively, so it was nice to put the puck in the back of the net, but it’s just one game. I’ve got to be consistent with it.”

The teams were playing on a quick 24-hour turnaround. The Blues beat the Canucks 3-2 late Sunday night in overtime.

They outshot the Canucks 37-23, scored two goals with the man advantage to turn around what had been an abysmal 2-for-11 power play going into Game 4.

Most importantly, they shut down a Canuck power play that had torched them for six goals in the first three games, but went 0 for 7 on this night.

“When we take care of the puck it’s effective and it’s hard on them,” said O’Reilly.

“I think it was nice with an obviously emotional win last night. (We were) feeling good coming back into the rink again today and going right to our game again. I think that was a big factor. Obviously a lot of work left. We’ve got to stick to our structure.”

Pietrangelo said they’ve been working on fixing the penalty kill.

“We’ve been making adjustments as we go, just based on what they do,” he said.

“Big thing for us is clearing the puck when he have an opportunity, so we were much better at that tonight.”

Jake Allen made 22 saves in net for the win and Jacob Markstrom stopped 34 for the loss.

J.T. Miller had the lone Canucks marker, his fourth of the post-season.

He said the Blues are adapting to their power play,

“They’re blocking a lot of shots, they’re studying us. They kind of know what we’re doing,” said Miller.

He said they’ll make adjustments but aren’t going to go back to square one.

“We were a shot away from going up 3-0 (in the series). Tonight it was 1-1 five on five,” he said.

“It’s not like we’re getting our butts whupped up and down the rink. They’re a good team. We’re a good team. It’s going to be a hard, long series. We signed up for that.”

The Canucks have not been in the playoffs since 2015 and many on the roster, including key players Elias Pettersson, Markstrom, Brock Boeser and Quinn Hughes, are getting their first taste of the rigours of the NHL post-season.

O’Reilly, last year’s Conn Smythe Trophy winner in the cup run, scored late in the first period on the power play – the first time the Blues have opened the scoring in the series.

Pietrangelo whistled a slapshot that missed the net, but the puck caromed straight back off the backboards to O’Reilly, who put it under the crossbar.

Vancouver tied it just 40 seconds into the second period. Alex Edler wristed the puck from the blue line and Miller redirected it in.

St. Louis then took control, outshooting the Canucks 17-5 in the period.

O’Reilly took a pass out of the corner from Perron, walked out in front of the net and flicked a backhander into the top corner. The Blues then caught a break on a two-man advantage. Pietrangelo zipped the puck through traffic in the crease. The puck hit Edler’s stick and in.

O’Reilly has three goals in the series. Perron recorded two assists and has registered a point in every game this series (two goals, four assists).

Allen started for the second consecutive game for St. Louis, replacing Jordan Binnington. Markstrom has played every minute for the Canucks through eight post-season games.

Vancouver captain Bo Horvat was kept off the scoresheet for a second consecutive game after lighting up the Blues for two goals in each of the first two contests.

Hughes also saw his streak snapped. The Calder candidate was going for a point in his seventh consecutive post-season game. The 20-year-old has one goal and eight assists.

""Our number of new cases is climbing, and it's climbing to levels that we haven't seen in a number of months,"" said B.C. Health Minister Adrian Dix. ""The number of people now in self-isolation is disturbing. Though some increase was expected, each of us knows our numbers are too high.""

He urged people to stop going to private parties, as most of the new cases are related to large gatherings.

""We need to say 'enough' to private parties, where alcohol is being used and where physical distancing isn't possible,"" Dix said.

There have been two new outbreaks at long-term care homes – George Derby Centre and the New Vista Care Centre. That brings the number of long-term care homes with active cases – once whittled down to just three – to seven.

But there have been no deaths from COVID-19 for 10 consecutive days in B.C., and the number of people in hospital with the virus is down.

On a positive note, Henry said the province is having good success with contract tracing. Many of those who tested positive for the virus were notified because they were on a contract tracing list.

""The vast majority of the people who tested positive over the past three days were people who were on our contact list,"" Henry said. ""That means that, as they developed their illness, they were isolated and they no longer exposed others, breaking those chains of transmission.""

However, she added: ""We need to do better collectively to stop these exposure events from happening.""

With the resumption of school in the fall looming, Henry's office is under increasing pressure to require students to wear masks in class, when school resumes.

But Henry said it would be impractical to require students, especially younger children, to wear masks in class all day, and reiterated that it is the least effective of the measures that reduce the risk of spreading the virus.

""We know that there is a place for masks,"" she said. ""They are the end of our hierarchy of controls...the least effective of the layers that we need.""

While students will be allowed to wear masks if they choose to, it won't generally being a requirement in public schools.

“This is bread and butter work for public health,” said Dr. Henry, adding, the new positions will “make sure that we’re prepared if there’s a surge in the coming weeks.”

The announcement comes a day after the province reported more active COVID-19 cases than at any time in the last three months. The additional new 46 cases announced yesterday surpassed that of Ontario for the first time in months, an ominous reversal even as fatalities caused by COVID-19 have not been recorded for over a week.

Dr. Henry said public health officials are using social network analysis to track social contacts with overlapping social circles in multiple parties. That kind of tool has helped track people attending multiple parties as well as the second generation spillover into other places in the province.

Premier John Horgan had stern words for those in the province that aren’t taking public health’s COVID-19 guidelines seriously.

“The good behaviour, the common sense of British Columbians is not consistent across the board,” said Horgan. “We’re going to be looking hard at enforcement.”

Horgan said if private house parties continue to contribute to the growing caseload in the province, enforcement will follow suit, with warnings escalating into more severe penalties.

“If people continue to work around, or try and disregard the rules that he rest of British Columbians are following, then we will of course take action,” he said.

On a lighter note, Horgan also called on such Vancouver-raised actors as Ryan Reynolds and Seth Rogen to help communicate health and safety guidelines to young people via social media.

There are already some positive signs that the message is getting through. Dr. Henry said the number of people going in for testing has increased across the province, and among younger people, the percentage of positive cases is increasing.

“That to me tells us that it is working,” she said. “We’re holding on.”

We also need to factor in mental health, stress and anxiety levels.","Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry has mentioned, hundreds of times, the importance of maintaining mental health during the pandemic. I asked her if she’d help me with my column on the topic and she graciously agreed.

Before I begin, I really want to acknowledge what a humble treasure Henry is to our province. She has inspired shoes, paintings, award nominations and gained international fame for her devotion to our health as British Columbians. She has been featured in the New York Times and still finds time to talk to columnists such as me.

I asked Henry how we can find balance in our lives by staying safe from COVID-19 and ensuring we keep joy, happiness, and fulfilment in our lives.

When my daughter returned to day camps mid-May, she came home telling me that some kids were playing a game of tag outside. I told her I didn’t want her playing tag and she should find a different activity. I’ve re-evaluated this situation many times in my mind.

What were the risks versus the rewards from a game a tag? Ultimately, I think I made a mistake when I told her she couldn’t play.

I shared this scenario with Henry and she agreed that children playing tag outside with minimal contact is OK.

“When the pandemic hit, we were all scared and we didn’t know everything we know now,” said Henry. “Now, we need to pull back a little, but kids need to know that they still can’t kiss and hug, and they still have to wash their hands.”

As a parent, I want my daughter to be cautious, but not to live in a perpetual state of fear.

“Parents should limit media coverage for children. What children see and hear, especially from the United States, is inundating and can be quite frightening,” said Henry.

Henry explained that children pick up on fear, stress and anxiety of their parents and everyone around them. This means we don’t know everything they are absorbing and internalizing.

“I have heard from a lot of parents about how children’s mental health has been affected by the pandemic,” said Henry. “Some children act out, some regress, some have anxiety and some have trouble sleeping.”

We may be more vigilant on identifying a cough, sniffle, or sore throat, but I think we should also be adding the same vigilance on the mental health of ourselves and those around us.

“Children have vivid imaginations and if they don’t know something, they can imagine an answer that is way beyond the truth,” said Henry. “For example, a kid could think: ‘The virus is everywhere, and if don’t wash my hands my mom will die.’ ”

Henry suggests starting the conversation by asking children what they know, and follow up by comforting young children and researching answers with older children.

Henry said she often hears the term “immune compromised” being used incorrectly and she explained what it truly means.

“A child with asthma isn’t immune compromised. Healthy people with asthma or diabetes aren’t immune compromised. People who are immune compromised have uncontrolled asthma that required hospitalization, or uncontrolled diabetes.”

As we talked about mental health in children, Henry reminded me that home isn’t always a safe place for all children. It’s sad and something that we need to acknowledge. Schools opening in the fall can help address this.

Mental health affects us all and we need to make sure we are addressing our own needs, so we are able to support others. We all have a social responsibility to check on our friends and colleagues during this time. Even a quick text message can be helpful.

Henry said there has been a rise in overdoses and many have occurred from people who are working from home. Henry suggests workplaces implement buddy systems or regular check-ins with team members working from home.

“This helps people feel connected,” Henry said.

By now we all know that we need to wash our hands, limit close contact, and stay home if we are feeling unwell. We also need to factor in mental health, stress and anxiety levels.

Henry reminded me that we can be both cautious and optimistic at the same time.

“This has been a crazy summer, and one different from all the rest,” said Henry. “We need to remind ourselves and children that we can still have fun and do things that make this summer special.”",716,0.9591539597682948,covid-19

Premier John Horgan announced Wednesday that 500 more health-care workers are being hired to do contact-tracing after patients test positive for the virus.

Dr. Bonnie Henry and others have warned for months that pandemics often come in at least two surges. The scale of hiring for the contact- tracing effort and the timing suggest it is more than just a precautionary move.

It would hike the number of staff now available to do that work by 70 per cent. The move was announced just two hours before the latest daily count showed 85 new cases, the highest tally since March 23. There are now 531 active cases in B.C., up from 160 on July 1.

Last month, Health Minister Adrian Dix outlined the resources in that field. He said there were 697 staff in the health authorities around B.C. who were considered available to do such work if needed and 264 were engaged in doing so as of mid-July. He advised at the time that the $30 million in extra costs could go higher if more are needed.

Now the Provincial Health Authority is hiring 500 more temporary staff.

Horgan said they are expected to be retired health-care professionals who can be deployed around the province in teams, starting in September.

Henry, B.C.’s provincial health officer, said contact tracing is “exceedingly important” in the COVID-19 pandemic. There’s no way yet to cure victims, and the only way to control the spread is to limit exposure and track people who have been exposed to get them isolated. Self-isolation is mandatory under a health order and about 1,700 people are currently undergoing it. The B.C. Centre for Disease Control states 3,300 people have done so since the coronavirus arrived.

The process has been underway since the first case in January. So far, on average, it identifies an estimated 98 per cent of individual carriers’ contacts. Henry said they track all contacts confidentially and monitor people continuously over the two-week incubation period to check their symptoms and also their adherence to the self-isolation requirement.

Henry said the mass hiring will ensure B.C. is prepared “if there is a surge of cases in the coming months.”

“We need to keep going for the next few months, maybe even years until there is an effective vaccine.”

The workload increased significantly in recent months. B.C.’s daily cases ebbed through May and June then started increasing in July and has stayed higher through August. The restart of the economy involved relaxing some restrictions that allowed social circles to broaden. So contact tracers are chasing more cases, and the cases have more contacts than previously.

The higher summer caseload might also suggest a surge in the fall. In early spring, officials, including Henry, discussed expectations that the virus might subside during the hot summer months. But it rampaged through some hot southern American states over that time and also increased in B.C., although hospitalization and fatality rates remain low.

Officials are still congratulating British Columbians for their efforts to curtail the virus, but there was renewed emphasis on condemning poor practices that could spread it.

Horgan said: “The good behaviour, the common sense of British Columbians, is not consistent across the board.” He said in cases where people are flaunting restrictions, “We’re going to be looking hard at enforcement when it comes to situations like that.”

There was also a suggestion that the new mass hiring is related to more stringent monitoring and enforcement of social distancing.

Horgan said the government needs to get the message out to the audience that’s not hearing it. “Taking pressure off contract tracers will allow us to redeploy resources to get to that objective.”

Wednesday’s case count of 85 is just short of the record daily total of 91 on March 25. If it firms up into a trend, that fall surge will have begun sooner than expected and the crackdown will be coming sooner rather than later.

Rogen joins fellow Vancouverite turned Hollywood star Ryan Reynolds in encouraging young British Columbians to stop partying amid the pandemic.

Reynolds, star and producer of the Deadpool franchise, responded to Horgan's plea in a Tweet Friday, stating, ""I got your message about the thing. Look, I'm not sure it's a great idea, frankly. People don't want medical advice from guys like me.""

Following his joke, Reynolds underscored that many young people may not realize how many young people are getting sick from COVID-19 and that many of them are dying.

Reynolds continued to inject levity into the serious message by saying that his mom would also like to be out having fun on Kitsilano Beach, and that he hoped that young people in the province would keep both her and Canadian icon David Suzuki safe during the health crisis.

""I hope that young people in B.C. don't kill my mom, frankly, or David Suzuki,"" said Reynolds.

With active COVID-19 cases at their highest in three months, earlier this week Horgan hinted at a carrot and stick approach to British Columbians — and especially younger people — to heed health and safety guidelines.

Provincial health officials announced 85 new cases Wednesday, Aug. 12, the highest one-day total for the province since late April. By Friday, B.C. had recorded its highest three-day total since the pandemic began.

This week, Horgan said if private house parties continue to contribute to the growing caseload in the province, enforcement will follow suit, with warnings escalating into more severe penalties.

In total, 1,878 people are self-isolating, including those who have been told to self-isolate as a result of potential exposure to the disease.

No new deaths were reported on August 13, leaving the province's death toll from the virus that has caused a global pandemic at 196.

Henry said 78 new cases of the coronavirus had been identified in the past 24 hours, and that younger people are increasingly those infected.

""We have to be a little bit careful about demonizing [others],"" Henry said. ""Most young people are doing the right thing and they are socially responsible. They care a tremendous amount about their communities and their families.""

The median age of the 550 people who have so far been hospitalized with the virus remains in the high 60s, Henry pointed out.

""Hospitalizations are very rare in young people and even in young adults,"" she said. ""We have had very few people who required ICU care and we've had no deaths in anybody under the age of 40. The deaths unfortunately are heavily skewed to the older population, particularly people over the age of 80.""

The breakdown of the province's 4,274 COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,306 in Vancouver Coastal Health (up 33);

• 2,242 in Fraser Health (up 39);

• 150 in Island Health (no change);

• 398 in Interior Health (up four);

• 106 in Northern Health (up two); and

• 72 people who reside outside Canada (no change).

There are 3,500 people who have fully recovered from COVID-19 in B.C.

No new seniors' homes have reported outbreaks. That leaves seven seniors' homes with active outbreaks:

•Holy Family Hospital in Vancouver;

•Richmond Lions Manor in Richmond;

•Dania Home in Burnaby;

•Maple Ridge Seniors Village in Maple Ridge;

•Derby Manor in Burnaby;

•George Derby Centre in Burnaby; and

•New Vista Care Home in Burnaby.

An outbreak is also active at the Joseph and Rosalie Segal Health Family Health Centre.

One new community outbreak is at the Okanagan Correctional Centre, Henry said. That centre earlier this year had an outbreak that had been considered extinguished.

B.C. Health Minister Adrian Dix provided an update on scheduled surgeries, which were disrupted when efforts were made to clear hospital beds in case there was a spike in COVID-19 hospitalizations. Those surgeries started to resume on May 18.

""The number of patients contacted about their surgery has increased to 80,278,"" Dix said.

""Between May 18 and August 9, we've completed 71,512 surgeries. 54,568 were scheduled surgeries. 19,944 were unscheduled, or emergency, surgeries.""

“We cannot let a few wreck it for everybody else, and that is the reason why action is being taken,” said Dix, speaking from Vancouver Monday afternoon during the latest COVID-19 update.

While he didn’t provide details, Dix said the government will be “taking further steps to impose stricter penalties,” and the plan will “optimize” the use of enforcement officers outside of public health, for example, municipalities, police departments and WorkSafe BC.

Dix said the plan will come into effect later this week, once it’s announced by B.C. Solicitor General Mike Farnworth.

B.C. recorded 236 new COVID-19 cases between Friday and Monday, including 100 cases on Saturday – the largest single-day jump so far. There are now 743 active cases in the province.

Since late June, the majority of new cases have been driven by young people in their 20s and 30s.

A string of public exposure alerts has been issued recently for restaurants, bars, night clubs and stores across the Lower Mainland.

And over the weekend, videos emerged of large gatherings – with little social distancing – including drum circles and a late-night street party in Vancouver.

However, Dix said that the “greatest danger” remains private, indoor parties.

“We are continuing to review what can be done about those, and continuing to engage with people and discourage people from hosting such gatherings,” he said.

Dix said that while 50 is the maximum number of people permitted at a gathering in B.C., however, depending on the event and the location, the number of guests that is safe could be “considerably” lower.",295,0.8702901906339383,covid-19

Private parties “have been a significant source of problems,” he said at a news conference Thursday. “I have to say this: If you’re thinking of organizing a party, especially one involving alcohol, where there’s no specific limits on distancing that you’re putting in place, you should not do so.”

He said environmental health and bylaw officers would be out checking banquet halls and other places that hold events to ensure the 50-person capacity limit is being respected.

His comments come as B.C. reported 78 new cases of COVID-19, bringing the province’s total to 4,274. No new deaths were reported Thursday, leaving the total at 196.

No new confirmed cases were reported in the Island Health region, which has had a total of 150. Of those, three are active and 142 people have recovered. Five deaths have been linked to the virus.

The region has had six reported cases in the past two weeks, according to numbers from the B.C. Centre for Disease Control: one in the north Island region, which includes part of the mainland, four in the central Island, and one on the south Island.

The north Island has been hardest hit, data show, with 60 confirmed cases between Jan. 1 and Aug. 13. The central Island has had 39 cases and the south Island has had 51.

People between the ages of 20 to 29 now make up the group seeing the largest increase of infections, provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said.

Those infections have been seen after exposure events, such as parties where young adults have been gathering, she added.

Henry said those in that age range as well as people between the ages of 30 to 39 make up a disproportionate number of the province’s infections.

But she cautioned against criticizing the behaviour of all people in that age group.

“I think we have to be a little bit careful about demonizing. Most young people are doing the right things and they are socially responsible, and they care a tremendous amount about their communities and their families.” she said.

Henry also revealed some of the responses to the COVID-19 Population Healthy Survey, laying out the toll the pandemic has had on people of different ethnic and racial backgrounds.

About 390,000 British Columbians completed the survey, which asked questions about the financial and societal impact the pandemic had taken on them.

Those who identified as West Asian, Latin American and South Asian respondents were the most likely to report difficulties in meeting financial needs. West Asian, Latin American and Black respondents were the most likely to report job losses caused by the pandemic.

Caucasian respondents reported fewer financial difficulties, but increased alcohol consumption. Those with lower incomes also reported issues with food security as well as trouble meeting their financial needs.

I’ll start with what we know for almost certain. (“Almost”, because every day brings a new revelation that casts doubt on prior assumptions.)

article continues below

First, those Canadians most vulnerable to serious illness and in some instances death, are elderly. In B.C., the average age of death from COVID-19 is 85. There have been virtually no fatalities among people under 40.

Second, by far the majority of fatalities, countrywide, have occurred in nursing homes. As of May 25, 81 per cent of deaths were recorded in these facilities. Five nursing homes have lost more than 40 per cent of their residents to the virus (all were in Ontario and Quebec.)

After that, things grow progressively less certain. Does shutting down various sectors of the economy and imposing social distancing work?

With near certainty yes, if you mean does it reduce the number of infections. But if you mean does it reduce the death rate, that is less clear.

Let’s start with B.C. and work outward. Initially, when the disease first appeared, the number of infections in our province climbed rapidly from a handful in February, to between 65 and 90 per day between mid-March and late April.

At that point the shutdown took effect, and over the following two months, the daily rate subsided, rarely exceeding 20, and usually fewer. Is that evidence the policy worked?

I believe so, because as soon as the shutdown was eased, the infection rate began to creep back up again, reaching about 40 a day in late July and the mid-80s in August.

This would seem to suggest the hard shutdown did indeed flatten the infection curve. That was important early on, because it was feared a flood of infections would swamp our hospital system.

But now the death rate. From a height of six per day in early April, fatalities declined in a more or less straight line thereafter, with scarcely any recorded in the last days of July and early August (the most recent data I have).

That is to say, the death rate did not rise as the shutdown was lifted. Instead, it fell. The same is true of hospitalizations. (The number of COVID patients currently in hospital, as of Aug. 6, was 13.)

There are several conceivable explanations.

Maybe those most vulnerable to the disease died early in its onset. Certainly that happened in nursing homes.

Or instead, perhaps our modes of treatment have improved. That seems likely.

But there’s a different possibility to consider. Perhaps, all along, death rates were not particularly sensitive to blunt measures such as shutdowns. Maybe, these are not so effective as we thought.

So far, these are B.C. numbers only. Some other jurisdictions, notably the U.S., are seeing different results.

Nevertheless we can bolster this suggestion. A study published in the British medical journal The Lancet on July 21 examined the experience of the top 50 countries ranked by their number of COVID-19 cases.

It found that high numbers of deaths were associated with increased obesity and large disparities in income. This might explain, in part, why fatality rates in the U.S. are higher. That country leads most developed nations in obesity and income inequality.

On the other hand, the study found that rapid border closures and full lockdowns did not affect death rates. At a minimum, that should be food for thought.

Where does all of this leave us? Clearly, nursing homes should remain our immediate centre of attention. Everything possible must be done to make them virus-proof.

And elderly Canadians should be advised to take extra care.

After that, though, the uncertainties mount. If fatalities remain low, but the infection rate rises, even to pre-shutdown levels as it is now doing, are we willing to inflict further economic and social turmoil to deal with this?

At some point, we’re going to have to normalize a disease that might be with us for years. That might mean stratifying the population, with more comprehensive protections for those at serious risk, and less-intrusive measures for those who are not.

And don’t pin your hopes on a vaccine. Canada’s chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, has warned that if one is found, it’s unlikely to represent a silver bullet.

Personally, I would want to see much stronger evidence that large-scale shut-ins will suppress fatalities in jurisdictions such as B.C., before going this way again.

Easily said, of course. As someone who ran B.C.’s health ministry once upon a time, I know how much more complex things look from the inside than they do from outside.

I’m also aware how little room to manoeuvre public health officials such as Dr. Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix have in a climate of fear and near panic.

All the more reason to keep the debate focused, as much as possible, on what the data are telling us.",809,0.9170662160288393,covid-19

Alberta, which is struggling to pinpoint sources for hundreds of new coronavirus infections, intends to beef up its contact-tracing team, according to the provincial health authority.

Alberta Health Services (AHS) plans to hire 140 contact tracers over the next several weeks, spokesman Kerry Williamson said. This is on top of the 560 people AHS expects to be on the team by the end of the week. In April, when the first wave of the pandemic hit the province, about 440 people were assigned to investigate infections.

AHS has been slow to identify the roots of a burst of new COVID-19 cases in the Edmonton zone, 405 between Aug. 11 and Aug. 17. While the number of new daily cases is now lower than it was in April, AHS is expanding its detective unit because investigations have become more complex. People widened their social circles after public-health restrictions eased and pandemic fatigue set in. They are also travelling more. This means it takes contact tracers longer to determine who may have been exposed to someone with COVID-19, giving the virus more time to spread.

“It is taking longer than we would like right now,” Deena Hinshaw, Alberta’s Chief Medical Officer, told reporters on Tuesday. “We’re working on resolving that.”

Dr. Hinshaw wants people who test positive for COVID-19 to be notified within 12 hours. Sometimes, to get the results out as soon as possible, AHS splits notification calls from contact-tracing calls, she said.

Now, 78 per cent of people who test positive are notified by contact tracers within 24 hours, AHS said. The rest receive word within 48 hours. Contact-tracing investigations start within 48 hours of test results in 43 per cent of cases, AHS said, and the rest generally begin within 72 hours. A contact-tracing investigation currently takes about six hours, AHS said.

British Columbia last week said it was hiring 500 contact tracers.

Alberta has 1,169 active COVID-19 cases, and the Edmonton region accounts for 636 of those. Mayor Don Iveson on Tuesday said he was “concerned and disappointed” with the rising case count.

“We’re reaching out to [AHS] to get more details on this rise in cases so we can help protect communities most at risk,” he said in a tweet.

Dr. Hinshaw last week said investigators needed more time to identify the sources. On Tuesday, she pointed to several social events.

Alberta has linked 15 cases to a prayer gathering dubbed It Is Time Canada on the August long weekend near Deadwood, a hamlet in the northwestern part of the province. B.C. has tied 17 COVID-19 cases to the event. Dr. Hinshaw said about 200 to 300 people attended, and she expects more related cases.

Edmonton’s Bible Pentecostal Church is the source of a separate outbreak, with 15 confirmed cases, she said. About 150 people worship at the church, Dr. Hinshaw said. Further, Alberta has traced 26 cases to a private gathering and 17 to another.

“It is a stark reminder that coming together in large gatherings risks sharing more than fellowship,” she said. “It risks sharing the COVID-19 virus.”

In central Alberta, a meat-processing plant sent more than a dozen employees home after a worker tested positive for the virus last week.

The employee at the Olymel facility in Red Deer was sent home and told to get tested after showing symptoms of COVID-19 on Aug. 11, a company spokesman said. Richard Vigneault said the positive result came in two days later, and 13 other employees were tested. Mr. Vigneault said the company expects the results soon.

British Columbia and Alberta racked up hundreds of new coronavirus infections over the weekend, a surge among young adults that set a new pandemic record in B.C. and has made Edmonton a national hot spot for COVID-19.

B.C., in an effort to stamp out community spread, on Monday said it is examining the legal tools it has to crack down on people partying on private property, a break from the government’s light-handed approach. It counted 236 new cases of COVID-19 over the weekend, bringing active cases to 743, a new high for the Western province. Alberta added 359 new cases on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, bringing the provincial total to 1,132 active cases. The Edmonton region counted 593 active cases as of Sunday, with the number of cases in the capital surpassing those in Montreal by a factor of four, when adjusted for population.

As the number of new cases in Ontario and Quebec, the two hardest-hit provinces in the country, hold steady, the surges among young adults in the West have prompted officials to beg people under 40 to stick to the public-health guidelines. But COVID-19 statistics show they are resisting the recommendations.

B.C. looks to fight surges of COVID-19 in younger people

“Young people are getting out more,” Donna Wilson, a nursing professor at the University of Alberta, said. “Young adults tend to have confidence that they have the health so even if they catch it, it won’t be serious.”

In British Columbia, Health Minister Adrian Dix told reporters on Monday that while it can be maddening to see beaches and sidewalks of Vancouver’s Granville Strip nightlife area very crowded as they were this past weekend, smaller groups partying indoors pose a much greater public-health risk.

B.C. Health Minister Adrian Dix says the province will announce stricter penalties this week for those who flout public-health rules as COVID-19 cases climb in the region. The Canadian Press

Half of the Vancouver area’s eight public spaces linked to outbreaks currently listed by the local health authority happened at high-end lounges and nightclubs. Three of those, Pierre’s Champagne Lounge, West Oak and the IVY Lounge in Trump International Hotel and Tower have been ordered closed, Mr. Dix said.

The province has already put in new rules limiting guests at Airbnb and other short-term rentals, but is having a harder time stopping people from welcoming groups of friends into their homes at night, Mr. Dix said.

""The places where there's greatest danger is private parties where alcohol is involved and it's inside,"" he said.

The provincial government has been reticent to crack down on indoor events given the importance of respecting a person’s privacy in their own home, which Mr. Dix said “dates back to the Magna Carta.” But these parties are now a driving force in new infections and the Solicitor-General is studying new ways to enforce physical distancing inside private properties, Mr. Dix said.

“Don’t hold private parties,” he said. “Twenty to 40 may be seen as young ... but it’s not young, and the people I’ve met over this weekend understand that and understand their obligation to one another, and to their parents and to their grandparents.”

Deena Hinshaw, Alberta’s Chief Medical Officer of Health, last week said her province has not yet determined what is driving the wave of new cases in Edmonton, save for exposure at home. People under the age of 40 accounted for 77 per cent of cases in northeast Edmonton and the median age for infected Edmontonians is 30, she said in her update last Wednesday.

“We have seen in Edmonton, many of our recent cases, have been spread within households,” she said last week. The Edmonton zone added 407 new cases between Aug. 10 and Aug. 16.

There are roughly 52 active cases of COVID-19 per 100,000 in the city of Edmonton, according to Alberta’s data. By way of comparison, the rate of cases on the Island of Montreal clocked in at 13 per 100,000 last week.

The number of people actively fighting COVID-19 infections in B.C. hit an all-time high for the second day in a row on August 18, thanks to the B.C. government announcing that 775 people are battling the disease that spawned the ongoing global pandemic.

Before yesterday, when 743 people were actively fighting infections, the highest number of people with active infections in the province had been 717, on April 28.

article continues below

The rise in people fighting the disease comes thanks to a disproportionate number of people newly getting infected.

Health Minister Adrian Dix and deputy provincial health officer Reka Gustafson said 83 people have been infected with COVID-19 in the past 24 hours, while 51 people officially recovered from the disease during that same 24-hour period.

A total of 3,704 people have recovered from COVID-19 in B.C. Since January 28, when the first case of COVID-19 was discovered in the province, there have been a total of 4,677 cases.

The breakdown of the infections by health region is:

• 1,447 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 2,473 in Fraser Health;

• 156 in Island Health;

• 407 in Interior Health;

• 120 in Northern Health; and

• 74 people who reside outside Canada.

The good news is that hospitalizations and intensive care unit admissions remain comparatively low.

The province now has six people in hospital with COVID-19 (up two from yesterday) while three people are in intensive care units, which is the same number as yesterday. The other patients – the vast majority – are self isolating at home.

B.C.'s intensive care units have recently been comparatively empty in recent weeks, compared with April 6, when a record 72 people were receiving special care in those units. The first British Columbian with COVID-19 who needed the ICU entered that ward on March 4, more than five weeks after the first case was identified in the province. That lag time, and the comparative bump in new daily cases in August may set the stage for an increase in the number of ICU patients in future weeks.

No new people have died from the virus in the past 24 hours, so that leaves the death toll so far in B.C. at 198.

While a higher percentage of coronavirus-infected people die in B.C. than in some other jurisdictions, or more than 4.2%, the province has done well to limit new deaths in recent weeks. The province took 88 days after recording its first COVID-19 case to register its 100th virus-related death. It has since gone 115 days and has yet to reach the 200-death threshold.

In the U.S., which has the world's highest number of infections, 171,516 people have died out of 5,474,630 people who have caught the virus, for a death rate of 3.1%, according to Johns Hopkins University. In Brazil, the globe's second highest source for infections, 108,536 people have died out of 3,359,570 people infected, for a 3.2% death rate, also according to Johns Hopkins University data.

There is one health facility that has an outbreak: New Westminster's Queen's Park Care Centre.

Nine seniors' care homes or assisted-living facilities have active outbreaks:

•Holy Family Hospital in Vancouver;

•Arbutus Care Centre in Vancouver;

•Richmond Lions Manor in Richmond;

•Czorny Alzheimer Centre in Surrey;

•Dania Home in Burnaby;

•Derby Manor in Burnaby;

•George Derby Centre in Burnaby;

•New Vista Care Home in Burnaby; and

•Maple Ridge Seniors Village in Maple Ridge;

Aside from releasing new data, the B.C. government today also formally extended the provincial state of emergency. That allows Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General Mike Farnworth to continue to use extraordinary powers under the province's Emergency Program Act to support its pandemic response

Across Canada, the pollster found only Manitobans (40%) felt more needed to be done to tamp down the virus.

Residents of Quebec and Alberta, on the other hand, were the most likely to say their provinces’ restrictions were too harsh.

Men over 55 were more likely to disagree with strict public health measures.

When asked about their opinion on the performance of their premier, British Columbia (74%), Quebec (74%) and Ontario (75%) had the most favourable view of their leaders.

B.C. premier John Horgan’s favourability rating has dropped eight points from a high of 85% in mid-April, but still remains significantly higher than most provincial leaders.

Active cases of COVID-19 have surged in B.C. in recent weeks to levels not seen since April.

Many of those cases have been attributed to younger British Columbians attending private parties, a trend that prompted Horgan to threaten stricter enforcement for those not adhering to provincial health and safety guidelines.

“The majority of new infections in B.C. at this time are among young adults,” people who may have relatively mild infections but who can inadvertently spread it to more vulnerable populations, Gustafson said. “It is very important to remember that for our elders and those with underlying health conditions, the potential for severe disease remains. This may not apply to you, but you could easily spread the virus to someone who is vulnerable through your work or when spending time with friends and family.”

In B.C., 2,286 people are under public health monitoring for symptoms.

“Today we have a number of active outbreaks and community clusters and our public health teams on the ground are very proactively managing and following up these outbreaks, notifying close contacts, and doing all they can to break the chain of infection, but for us to be successful we actually need everybody to help,”Gustafson said.

From Friday to Monday the province announced 100 new cases — the second highest recorded number of single-day cases since the pandemic began, said B.C. Health Minister Adrian Dix. There were 88 cases from Saturday to Sunday, and 48 cases Sunday to Monday, for a total of 236 people who have tested positive for COVID-19 in B.C.

Of the 4,594 cases in the province to date, there have been 1,419 cases in Vancouver Coastal Health, 2,425 cases in the Fraser Health Authority, 154 cases on Vancouver Island, 405 in the Interior Health Authority, and 117 in Northern Health Authority. Of those cases, 3,653 people have recovered.

On Monday, four people with COVID-19 were in hospital. Two new deaths, both in the Fraser Health region, were reported on for a total of 198 to date.

“I wanted to start on behalf of the premier, of the government, I think, all people in B.C., to send out our condolences to the families of the two people who died from Saturday to Sunday of COVID-19 in B.C., and to the 198 families in total, the 196 other families who’ve lost loved ones during the pandemic,” said Dix. “It is an extraordinarily difficult time right now to grieve.”

Dix said he spent the weekend engaged with young people, encouraging them to influence one another to do their part in not spreading COVID-19 “because this pandemic is not ending soon.

“This pandemic that we are all tired of, so very tired of, will be going on now, we would expect, will through 2021, into 2022,” said Dix.

“This new normal’s going to be in place for a long time and the way that we address that, the way we deal with that … has to be by choice and by engagement and by talking to each other and by encouraging one another and when we fall, helping one another up,” said Dix.

There are two new outbreaks in the health care system, in the Czorny Alzheimer Centre in the Fraser Health region, and the Arbutus Care Centre in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, for a total of 10 — nine in long-term care facilities and assisted living and one in acute care. There are no outbreaks in long-term care facilities on Vancouver Island.

On Friday, 7-Eleven announced an employee at its store on 1327 Douglas St., on the corner of Douglas and Johnson streets. Patrons in the store between Aug. 10 and Aug. 14 were asked to self monitor and call HealthLink BC at 811 for information.

The case of the7-Eleven employee was not addressed in the public update by the deputy provincial health officer on Monday and the Health Ministry could not be contacted for comment. Island Health has not issued an advisory. The store was open on Monday.

This weekend, Northern Health issued a community exposure alert for anyone who may have attended the It Is Time Canada event in Deadwood, Alta., from July 30 to Aug. 2. Attendees are asked to self-isolate for 14 days and monitor for symptoms.

The initial campaign to suppress the spread was so successful it left the impression the pandemic could be beaten.

It can’t.

It’s a highly-contagious virus that spread all over the world in a few short weeks. It’s persistent, sneaky and relentless. Without a vaccine, the idea of eradicating such a virulent plague is a lost cause.

The best to be hoped for is that the infection rate can be managed to stay below the limits of health resources. That was the thrust from the beginning of the message to bend the curve.

No one ever promised to drive the curve down to zero. But it flat-lined for so long it looks like people started assuming the crisis was over and B.C. could carry on indefinitely with a paltry handful of new cases a day.

So there’s consternation since the case count started escalating in July, to the point where it bounced back to near record highs this week. There were 84 new cases Friday, the third day in a row that has matched the sky-high levels in March.

The saving grace is that the profile of the pandemic seems to have changed. Far greater numbers of younger people are testing positive comparatively, and they don’t get as sick.

So the hospitalization rate — 12 patients as of Friday — remains far below the level that would send the health care system to condition red.

Twenty-somethings are getting it at twice the rate they were in the spring and that age group now has the largest number of cases. The renewed concern about the case count has prompted some calls to restore the restrictions that were imposed in the spring and relaxed in two phases through May and June.

But the increase in cases was expected when the re-start of the economy began. It’s literally the cost of doing business.

“No surprise,” provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said this week. “As we knew, as we started to increase and open up and move into our restart phases, we were going to see more cases.”

The modeling shows that slamming more restrictions back in place would curb the caseload. But the government intends to resist any thought of renewing restrictions, unless it becomes unavoidable. The economic destruction and resulting job loss looks to have reached the point where government sees returning to more stringent restrictions as a last-ditch option.

Another reason lies in the new analyses this week confirming the obvious: Lower socio-economic groups are having a harder time coping.

While Henry manages the epidemiology, politicians are dealing with demands for hundreds of millions of dollars more in aid and reports of thousands of businesses closing.

Premier John Horgan spent Friday in a sometimes-testy debate with Opposition Leader Andrew Wilkinson on the government’s economic response.

Wilkinson highlighted unemployment statistics, business closures and the upcoming deadlines to pay billions in taxes that were deferred earlier in the year. Horgan said the official economic response plan — worth $1.5 billion — is due to be released in early September. The government plans to be as flexible as possible with companies that can’t pay taxes at the end of September, he said.

The reluctance to clamp down again and the determination to open schools suggests B.C. is nearing the limits of assistance. The emphasis will be on reacting to new cases under current protocols, with tactics like 500 new contract tracers soon to be hired.

Henry said that will “ensure that we can continue with our restart.” They’ll do so in the face of modeling that predicts “the number of new cases may continue to increase this summer.”

The escalation stems from something that’s always been a given, but never been made clearer. It’s the innate human need to socialize. People can close themselves off from contact for a brief period of time, but then they have to go out and mingle with others. The pandemic has revealed the strength of that drive, even when it’s foolhardy and potentially lethal to do so. It’s another reason why going back to stricter limits is being resisted.

What if people just ignore them?

He says it drew a crowd, but officers were able to break it up.

Video of the party was shared on social media, and appeared to show a crowd of people dancing in close quarters.

Chow says groups of people have been congregating around music or buskers outside because there aren't many indoor options available during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The trend has prompted celebrities to respond to a plea from Premier John Horgan for help with messaging to younger residents about partying during the pandemic.

Vancouver-born actor and comedian Seth Rogen tweeted on Saturday that the ""people of British Columbia"" should forego parties, barbecues and other gatherings in favour of more low-key activities.

British Columbia has seen a rise in cases over the past week, reporting 85, 78 and 84 new cases on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday respectively.

Previously, actor Ryan Reynolds lent his voice to the cause.

On Friday he posted a voice recording on Twitter, framed as a voicemail left for Horgan, warning B.C.'s younger residents of the dangers of COVID-19.

""Young folks in B.C., they're partying, which is of course dangerous,"" he said in the recording. ""They probably don't know that thousands of young people aren't just getting sick of coronavirus, they're dying of it too.""

He urged them not to kill some of B.C.'s coolest residents — including David Suzuki and Reynold's mom.

""Let's not kill anyone,"" he said. ""I think that's reasonable.""

Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said Thursday that people between the ages of 20 and 29 now make up the group seeing the largest increase of infections.

As of Friday, 4,358 people in British Columbia had tested positive for the virus, the majority of whom have recovered. Public health officials have recorded 196 deaths linked to the virus.

Each long-term care home in Quebec will have a single person responsible and accountable for its response to COVID-19, Health Minister Christian Dube said Tuesday as he moved to shore up the vulnerable sector ahead of a potential second wave of the novel coronavirus.

Health-care staff will also be prevented from working in more than one seniors centre and unknowingly carrying the virus into multiple facilities, the health minister said.

Speaking to reporters in Quebec City, Dube said the government was giving itself six weeks to execute the multi-pronged action plan he announced Tuesday that he said will ensure a swifter, more nimble response if cases rise again.

Many of the measures to be put in place by the end of September are aimed at avoiding a second disaster in the long-term care sector, which accounted for the bulk of the province’s 5,727 deaths attributed the virus.

A key component of the plan is to name a manager who will lead each of the province’s roughly 400 long-term care homes. Quebec Premier Francois Legault has said that at the beginning of the pandemic, one person was often responsible for multiple long-term care facilities, creating confusion and diffusing accountability.

The new managers, who will each be assisted by an infection-control specialist, will be responsible for ensuring government directives are followed. “I don’t want any more excuses that it’s not clear,” Dube said.

He promised that managers who do not follow directions would face consequences, although he did not say what they would be.

Dube stressed that the existing managers of long-term care homes were not responsible for the failures of the first wave, which exposed the weaknesses of a system he described as fragile and under-resourced.

Rather, he said, many managers were unable to respond to the pandemic due to a combination of staff shortages, lack of training and infection control, and directives that were unevenly applied, all of which he expects the new plan to address.

“The elected officials as well as the managers will be accountable,” he said. “But what we want to do with the action plan, with the amounts we’re talking about, is to have managers and elected officials to work with the right tools.”

Dube’s strategy also includes rapid mass testing, maintaining access to surgeries, and ensuring the province has enough medical equipment to cover a potential second wave.

“With the virus, our best weapon is agility and speed,” he said.

Dube also announced an additional $106 million for public health, which will allow regional health establishments to hire some 1,000 full-time workers to help with contact tracing, infection control and administering an eventual vaccine.

The government has already hired 10,000 orderlies, who are expected to enter the work force in the next few weeks.

Seniors Minister Marguerite Blais said Tuesday many of the elements of the action plan will have a lasting positive effect on the long-term care sector. She said the government will present a longer-term policy on the seniors facilities this fall.

Meanwhile, Quebec reported on Tuesday 46 new COVID-19 cases and six additional deaths linked to the novel coronavirus.

The number of hospitalizations remained unchanged at 145 while the number of people in intensive care increased by two to 27.

Quebec has been by far the hardest-hit Canadian province, with 61,252 COVID-19 infections since the beginning of the pandemic.

While new cases have been declining in recent weeks, Dube warned the virus is still circulating in the province.

He said the current “period of calm” was not a sign the virus was gone, but rather a chance to prepare for a likely rise in infections in the fall.

Dube said Quebec has successfully contained recent outbreaks, suggesting the province is better prepared to move quickly if a second wave comes.

The World Health Organization has said it is concerned that the coronavirus spread is being driven by people in their 20s, 30s and 40s, many of whom are unaware they have been infected, posing a danger to vulnerable groups. Reuters

This latest extension will end on Sept. 1 and allows the government to manage immediate concerns, such as recent outbreaks in some areas of the province.

Premier John Horgan says B.C. residents have made sacrifices to keep transmission rates down, but now unsafe gatherings are eroding that progress.

The province announced 83 new cases on Tuesday for a total of 4,677 cases since the pandemic began.

No new deaths were reported, leaving the total number of fatalities at 198.

There are 775 active cases in B.C. and 2,326 people under monitoring because they have been exposed to someone who has been infected with COVID-19.

In a statement, Horgan says the government is committed to getting back on track and it will announce new enforcement measures against those who put others at risk.

""The vast majority of British Columbians are following Dr. Henry's orders of seeing fewer faces in bigger spaces, but we all have to remain committed to flattening the curve,"" he said.

Whereas between 40 and 45% of Latin Americans, West (including Arab) and South Asians reported having difficulty seeing their financial needs, only 29% of the category listed as ""Caucasians"" said they had experienced such difficulty.

“We’re starting to see the first families who have an active member with COVID,” said Byron Cruz, head of the group Sanctuary Health which has been supporting Latin American families struggling to pay rent and buy groceries throughout the pandemic.

“It’s definitely getting closer.”

Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry reported the results of the province-wide survey Thursday, Aug. 13, in a rebuke of the notion that COVID-19 is ""a great leveler"" and on a day where another 78 new cases brought the total number of active cases in the province to 578, the most since the first week of May.

The survey found that respondents with the lowest income reported suffering the most, whether because they couldn’t meet their financial needs, had trouble accessing food or missed out on work. Those identifying themselves as Latin American, West Asian and Black were most likely to report not working due to COVID-19.

British Columbians surviving on lower incomes were also found to have an increased concern for health, were less likely to have the ability to stay home from work when sick, and more likely to have difficulty in accessing health care.

“The number of calls I’ve been getting is more than usual,” said Cruz.

Sanctuary Health works with migrants with precarious immigration status who are often ineligible for government supports. Lately, Cruz said he has been getting more requests for food deliveries from families his group never had contact with in the past, and requests for some kind of housing has seen an uptick as people are unable to pay their rent.

As many British Columbians can attest, the pandemic has wreaked havoc on people's anxieties as much as their finances.

While the survey found Latin Americans were the most likely to report an increased connection to family throughout the pandemic, children of those families were more likely to report increased levels of stress.

“Families are our main emotional support,” said Cruz “But we know that our families back home are in worse situations than we are here.”

That means sending home remittances at sometimes unsustainable levels, a heavy burden that is taxing on both bank accounts and stress levels.

Cruz said many of the 150-plus families his organization supports have had family members die from COVID-19 in places like Mexico and Guatemala, and his Nicaraguan neighbours have lost both parents back home as the virus rages across Latin America.

But even Cruz, who has a regular job and pay, said he’s feeling the pressure. He supports both his parents who have been shut in for three months in the highlands of Guatemala. Added to that, Cruz said he’s had to support his sister, who was forced to close her restaurant, and his brother, whose sandal factory has slowed to a crawl.

“That is a similar situation to so many people,” he said.

When he looks closer to home, Cruz and his organization worry that a spike in cases in the fall could decimate the non-profit's resources when people need it most. On Thursday, modelling from the province suggests the number of new daily COVID-19 cases could soar to over 100 cases per day, levels higher than their peak in April.

“This Saturday we’re planning our last massive distribution of food,” he said. “We need to reserve, we need to save.”

National modelling projections released Friday show an expected peak in cases this fall, followed by ongoing ups and downs, which chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam says could overwhelm health systems in different parts of the country.

That's why health officials across Canada are now getting ready for outbreaks that could surpass the highest spikes of the virus experienced in March and April, to ensure they're ready for the worst.

""It's preparing for — something could happen to this virus, who knows? Something could change,"" Tam told reporters Friday in Ottawa.

""We don't know the seasonality of this virus, it's continued throughout the summer, that's for sure, but what if it demonstrates a certain type of acceleration under certain conditions?""

Canada is better prepared than it was when the pandemic first hit the country this spring, she said, but officials are now planning for the likelihood of concurrent outbreaks of seasonal influenza, other respiratory illnesses and COVID-19 this fall and winter.

""We are over-planning beyond what we had for the previous wave and I think that's the prudent thing to do,"" Tam said.

""This planning scenario is to get all of our partners up and down the health system to over-plan.""

Increases in infection rates of COVID-19 are expected as economic and social activities resume, even with appropriate controls in place, according to the projection models.

The data released Friday suggests the number of cases by Aug. 23 could be as high as 127,740 and the number of deaths could reach as high as 9,115.

It also shows ""peaks and valleys"" of outbreaks are expected to continue in Canada until January 2022.

Continuing to build up capacity within the health system, while encouraging people to follow best public health practices, will give Canada the best chance of keeping the epidemic on a ""slow burn,"" Tam said, while also preparing for a need to quickly ramp up response measures if case numbers spike.

The lesson learned from other countries and cities that suffered devastating impacts during their initial wave of COVID-19 is that ""if you exceeded that capacity, the mortality goes up really, really high,"" Tam said.

""That's why you want to keep it below that capacity threshold in terms of activity.""

One method to stop large outbreaks is to ensure people who are infected can be identified and quarantined as soon as possible, Tam said.

That's why officials believe the COVID-19 exposure mobile application will be an important tool.

The pilot launch of the COVID Alert app in Ontario has seen two million people, out of a provincial population of 14 million, download the app to date. Tam says she finds that encouraging.

Meanwhile, provinces bracing for outbreaks of flu and other seasonal illnesses in addition to a second wave of the novel coronavirus are stocking up on this year's influenza vaccine and on personal protective equipment, she added.

Deputy chief health officer Dr. Howard Njoo said Friday he believes Canada has enough materials to also ramp up testing for COVID-19 in the event of a fall peak, thanks to ongoing bulk purchases by the federal government.

Based on the assumption that the trends in current caseloads continue, the province could see caseloads upwards of 100 per day come September.

Yet, as Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry has noted, models aren’t forecasts and new cases depend on a collection of individual behaviours and no small dose of chance encounters.

On Wednesday, the province announced it would be hiring another 500 contact tracers across B.C. Their role in tracking down new cases and severing transmission chains has proved to be a key buffer against the renewed growth in cases, said Dr. Henry.

“We are at the point right now that we not only find everybody but that we do it in a timely way,” she said.

Still, Dr. Henry announced another 78 cases Thursday, Aug. 13, bringing the total active cases in the province up to 578, the highest total since May 8. Since July 30, the number of active COVID-19 cases has increased with every update from health officials.

The solid line represents the mean, whereas the shaded bands show 50% and 90% credible intervals. Open circles show reported cases. Note that the cases used for model fitting exclude outbreak clusters. - BCCDC

The bulk of those cases are now in Metro Vancouver, including at least two recent links to Coquitlam bars. But as the bulk of transmissions shifts to a younger demographic, deaths have plummeted, with only one fatality attributed to COVID-19 in August so far.

In the lab, Dr. Henry said the province is continuing to build up its testing capacity as we move into the fall. Turnaround time now sits at about a day, and over the last 24 hours, the province has completed roughly 3,800 tests.

As the province moves closer to a Sept. 10 school start date, the BC Centre for Disease Control’s COVID-19 modelling appeared to back the message that children are less susceptible to falling ill from the virus.

Of the roughly 468,000 children under 10-year-old in B.C., 78 have tested positive for the coronavirus. That represents only 2% of all COVID-19 cases, even though the group represents 9% of all people in the province.

Another 162 young people aged 10 to 19 have reportedly fallen ill with the virus. In a population of about 507,000 people, representing 10% of B.C.’s population, that accounts for only 4% of all cases.

“The percentage of children who get ill and who get this virus is still much less than their respective proportion in the population,” said Dr. Henry in response to a reporter’s question Thursday regarding reports of a 40% increase in the number of cases among children in the U.S.

“It does not surprise me. It concerns me immensely,” she said, adding that transmission in school settings is a reflection of caseloads in a community.

If active cases remain high, exposure to the virus is likely to occur at some point in B.C. schools, and under the worst-case scenario, a learning group of 60 or 120 will have to self-isolate.

Another sign that the province is heading toward wider proliferation of the virus that has caused a global pandemic is that there are now 629 people actively fighting infections. That is more than any time since May 7.

Comparatively few people have severe infections, as 12 people are in hospital, with only four of those being in intensive care units. The others are self-isolating at home.

The breakdown of the province's 4,358 COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,354 in Vancouver Coastal Health (up 48);

• 2,276 in Fraser Health (up 34);

• 150 in Island Health (no change);

• 399 in Interior Health (up one);

• 107 in Northern Health (up one); and

• 72 people who reside outside Canada (no change).

No new deaths were recorded, leaving the province's death toll from the coronavirus at 196. There were 33 people who have newly recovered from the virus, bringing the total number of recoveries to 3,533.

One new health facility has an outbreak: New Westminster's Queen's Park Care Centre. Another health-facility outbreak is active at Vancouver's Joseph and Rosalie Segal Health Family Health Centre.

Seven seniors' care homes or assisted-living facilities have active outbreaks:

• Holy Family Hospital in Vancouver;

• Richmond Lions Manor in Richmond;

• Dania Home in Burnaby;

• Maple Ridge Seniors Village in Maple Ridge;

• Derby Manor in Burnaby;

• George Derby Centre in Burnaby; and

• New Vista Care Home in Burnaby.

""There are no new community outbreaks. However, there continue to be community exposure events around the province and on flights into and out of B.C.,"" said provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix in a joint statement.

""This weekend, we urge everyone to stay strong and hold the line. We have it within our ability to make the changes we need to bend our pandemic curve back down and continue in our B.C. restart, but it takes the combined efforts of everyone, not just a few.""

They both urged residents to stay a safe distance from strangers and to keep the number of contacts as low as possible.

""Remember that each new interaction outside your bubble holds a risk that you then bring back to your family and friends,"" they said. ""In these circumstances, we must stand together by staying apart.""

A string of public exposure alerts has been issued recently for private parties, bars, restaurants, night clubs and stores across the Lower Mainland. Health officials also continue to flag flights through Vancouver for exposure to the virus.

Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix said in a joint statement Friday that several bars, restaurants and nightclubs in the Vancouver Coastal Health region have been closed following transmission events, “some by public health order and others voluntarily.”

More than 70 new cases have been reported in B.C. over each of the past three days. On Friday, B.C.’s new cases totalled 84, and total active cases numbered 629.

Since late June, the majority of new cases have been driven by young people, particularly the 20 to 29 age group, as well as people in their 30s.

Henry has also cautioned that young people aren’t immune to long-lasting effects of COVID-19 – such as extreme fatigue and breathing difficulties – even if they were never hospitalized and their illness was relatively mild.

Meanwhile, the latest modelling by B.C.’s health agency, presented Thursday, suggests that the number of COVID-19 cases could soar to levels higher than was seen in April.

If the current rate of social contacts – which is sitting at 70 per cent of pre-pandemic levels – continues, B.C. could see over 100 cases a day by September. The province has recommended people keep their contacts to 60 per cent or lower in order to avoid a surge in cases.

However, Henry has noted that models aren’t firm predictions – rather, they suggest what can happen.

Henry and Dix urged British Columbians Friday to “stay strong and hold the line” this weekend.

“We have it within our ability to make the changes we need to bend our pandemic curve back down and continue in our B.C. restart, but it takes the combined efforts of everyone, not just a few.”

Earlier this week, the province announced it would be hiring 500 more contact tracers in preparation for a potential surge of the virus in the fall. The contact tracers should be in place by September.",382,0.7554991275227333,covid-19

Adrian Dix says parties may not be immediately shut down but there would be consequences for those found flouting the rules.

""(Private parties) have been a significant source of problems,"" he said at a press conference on Thursday.

""I have to say this, if you're thinking of organizing a party — especially one involving alcohol, where there's so specific limits on distancing that you're putting in place — you should not do so.""

He warned that environmental health and bylaw officers would be out checking banquet halls and other places that hold events to ensure the 50-person capacity limit is being respected.

""They can expect to be visited,"" he said of those hosting private events. ""The rules will be enforced and that will have consequences.""

Dix's comments come as B.C. reported 78 new cases of COVID-19, bringing the province's total to 4,274.

No new deaths were reported Thursday, leaving the province's total at 196.

People between the ages of 20 to 29 now make up the group seeing the largest increase of infections, provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said.

Those infections have been seen after exposure events, such as parties where young adults have been gathering, she added.

Henry said those in that age range as well as people between the ages of 30 to 39 make up a disproportionate number of the province's infections.

But she cautioned against criticizing the behaviour of all younger people.

""I think we have to be a little bit careful about demonizing. Most young people are doing the right things and they are socially responsible and they care a tremendous amount about their communities and their families. We have to be a little bit careful about tarring everybody with the same brush,"" she said.

Henry also revealed some of the responses to the B.C. COVID-19 Population Healthy Survey, laying out the toll the pandemic has had on people of different ethnic and racial backgrounds.

One in 10 adult British Columbians completed the survey, which asked questions regarding the financial and societal impact the pandemic had taken.

Those who identified as West Asian, Latin American and South Asian respondents were the most likely to report difficulties in meeting financial needs. West Asian, Latin American and Black respondents were the most likely to report job losses caused by the pandemic.

Caucasian respondents reported less financial difficulties and faced less job losses.

Those with lower incomes also reported issues with food security as well as a difficulty in meeting their financial needs.

For months, there were fewer than 1,000 people in isolation at any one time. In the space of a week, that number more than doubled.

About three-quarters of these people are in isolation because someone in their family or social or work circles exposed them to the virus. That means there is a growing number of people off work and/or cut off from friends and their community – often through no fault of their own.

Last week’s column was about how our pandemic’s demographics had shifted and that younger people were now picking up the virus in greater numbers than older people.

The sudden explosion in the number of people in isolation is also likely the result of younger people who have the virus exposing more people to it than an older segment of the population because they are generally more socially active and have more personal contacts.

Just when it appeared that B.C. had successfully “bent the curve” when it came to containing the spread of COVID-19, the statistics during the past two weeks have been discouraging.

After averaging about 10 cases a day about a month ago, the daily average as of this column’s writing has been more than 80. And those in isolation continue to climb in number.

However, in a glass-half-full sort of way, three other key statistics continue to offer hope. Thankfully, we have not seen a spike in hospitalizations, critical care cases or deaths.

Since the pandemic was declared, we have had fewer than 600 people in hospital so far. And fewer than 200 people were placed in the ICU.

At our worst point, there were 149 people in the hospital and 72 of them were in the ICU. We have come a long way from those grim days, but we can easily go backwards if we do not do more when it comes to following public health rules and guidelines.

Stop the partying everyone. We do not need more and more people put into isolation, cut off from their everyday world.

The “modelling” of B.C.’s COVID-19 situation that was presented by Dr. Bonnie Henry last week included some of the results of that huge survey of the plight of individuals and families in this pandemic and they were eye opening.

Almost 400,000 British Columbians participated in it. the results showed people with lower incomes and those in some ethnic communities have had the worst experiences when it came to job loss, food scarcity and stress on their children.

Will that situation change in the months ahead? It seems unlikely, since our most vulnerable always seem to pay a heavier price in times of trouble.

Hospitalizations decreased from 12 cases to four.

Deputy provincial health officer Dr. Reka Gustafson said most of those testing positive are young, which suggests the province has done a relatively good job of protecting the most vulnerable.

However, she said young people are more likely to have mild infections and may not realize they have COVID-19 before they spread it to others, adding that severe infections can occur at any age.

Anyone with even a slight symptom should stay home from work and gatherings, and anyone who has been advised that they've been in contact with a case should isolate for 14 days, even if no symptoms develop, she said.

""You could easily spread the virus to someone who is vulnerable.""

The new infections bring the total active cases to 743. There have been 4,594 confirmed cases since the pandemic began.

Two more people have died from the virus for a total of 198 deaths.

While there are no new community outbreaks, the health authority in northern B.C. issued an alert after confirming 17 cases linked to a religious gathering held between July 30 and Aug. 2.

Anyone who attended the It Is Time event in Deadwood, Alta., is asked to monitor themselves, self-isolate and seek testing if any COVID-19 symptoms develop.

""This pandemic is not ending soon, this pandemic that we're all tired of,"" Dix said.

Officials now expect it to continue ""well through 2021 into 2022,"" he added.

""This new normal is going to be in place for a long time and the way that we address that, the way that we deal with that as a society, inevitably, has to be by choice and by engagement.""

Solicitor General Mike Farnworth will announce stricter penalties later this week for those who break public health rules designed to reduce transmission of the novel coronavirus, said Dix.

Officials are most concerned about private parties and Dix urged people to act responsibly.

""The places where there's the greatest danger are private parties where alcohol is involved and it's inside,"" he said.

Dix said surveillance and enforcement also have a role. Several bars, clubs and restaurants have closed both voluntarily and involuntarily following exposures to the virus.

A weekend review of 100 banquet halls on the Lower Mainland also identified six as subjects of concern, he said.

I have a neighbour who cancelled his insurance during COVID-19 but has started driving without it. I imagine there are more people like this out there. So what happens if my car gets hit by one of these idiots without insurance? Am I still covered? Are there limits on the coverage? – Suresh, Hamilton

As long as you have insurance, you have some coverage if an uninsured driver hits your car – but there could be limits.

“If you can identify the vehicle and the driver confirms they have no insurance, then the provincial policies give you some coverage,” says Pete Karageorgos, director of consumer and industry relations at the Insurance Bureau of Canada (IBC). “You’ll need to notify the authorities as soon as possible because they need to conduct an investigation.”

Everywhere in Canada, car insurance is mandatory – you have to be insured.

But because people break the law, all insurance policies in provinces with private insurance include uninsured automobile coverage.

It doesn’t mean you have unlimited coverage in a crash with an uninsured motorist; it will depend on what coverage you purchased.

""The Ontario Automobile Insurance Policy outlines that uninsured automobile coverage will respond for up to $25,000 for accidental damage to the vehicle and/or its contents, subject to a $300 deductible,"" said Hans Reidl, senior vice-president, claims with Economical Insurance, in an e-mail. ""If you have optional collision or upset coverage, your policy will respond over and above this up to the liability limit.""

So, if your Tesla is worth $70,000 and it was totalled by an uninsured driver, you would pay the deductible and be covered for $24,700 under the policy.

If you had purchased collision coverage, then most companies would cover the remaining $45,000 – even though collision coverage normally only covers damage to your car when you're the one at fault.

If you make a collision claim after being hit by an uninsured driver, you would also see a hike to your rates, even though you weren't at fault.

Story continues below advertisement

What if you don't have collision insurance? Then you would have to sue for that $35,000.

""You must seek recovery from the uninsured driver by way of civil action,"" Reidl says.

If it's a hit and run where you don't know who hit you, then it would be treated like a normal insurance claim and you'd be covered, Reidl says.

Insurance rules vary by province, but in most provinces, your collision insurance would cover the vehicle damage if you're hit by an uninsured driver.

Rest assured?

But what if you're badly hurt in a crash with an uninsured driver?

Here's where it gets even more complicated. In Ontario, you would be covered by the accident benefits in your policy in any crash, whether you hit someone, someone hits you or a boulder landed on your car.

Story continues below advertisement

For catastrophic injuries, such as paralysis or serious brain injury, you can sue an at-fault driver for wage losses and additional medical treatments.

If that driver doesn't have insurance, then you would draw from the uninsured automobile coverage in your policy, up to a limit of $200,000.

If damages to your vehicle and your injuries total more than $200,000, 95 per cent will go to injuries and 5 per cent will go to the loss of the car.

For instance, if your $20,000 car is destroyed in a crash and you and your spouse need $350,000 in accident benefits, your insurance company would pay $190,000 for your injuries (95 per cent of the total) and $10,000 for the loss of your car.

That’s true even if you have $1-million in liability on your policy – unless you purchased optional family protection coverage, which is typically under $50 a year. In Ontario, it’s called OPCF 44R.

That would cover you for the amount of liability coverage on your policy.

Story continues below advertisement

Insurance rules vary by province, but in most provinces, your collision insurance would cover damage to your car if you're hit by an uninsured driver.

The rules on compensation for injuries in crashes caused by uninsured drivers vary in the other provinces. In Alberta, for instance, your insurance provides up to $50,000 in benefits for two years after the crash. If you use up that coverage, or if you don't have insurance, you can access the Motor Vehicle Accident Claims (MVAC) program.

“The MVAC program then provides medical benefits up to a limit of $95,000 per individual,”said Jerrica Goodwin, spokeswoman for Alberta’s Treasury Board, in an e-mail.

Two years is a long time for any vehicle to sit unattended. Seizing brakes, cracked belts and hoses and fluids that have become laden with moisture are just some problems universal to any car that sits. With the vehicle in question being a hybrid, the chances of there being problems is elevated.

The battery minder will slow down the sulfation of your smaller 12-volt battery but not stop it completely. However, this is not a big issue. I’d be concerned about the high-voltage hybrid-battery system, as it will likely become depleted over that extended period. Ideally, if you can contact a friendly neighbour and ask them to drive it for a week or two every six months, this will alleviate most concerns. If this is not possible, then I think you definitely need to get the dealer you mentioned involved, preferably at the midway point.

My VVT-i 2000 BEAMS engine has made a knock sound since the mechanic replaced the timing belt. When I asked him why the sound was happening, he said the head requires shimming. Please help me.

Thank you,

Godfrey

Breakthrough Engine with Advanced Mechanism System (BEAMS) was available in Lexus and Toyota products in Japan and some European markets. I’m not familiar with any of these 2000-cc engines because I don’t believe any made their way to North America, so I am going to assume this reader is on another continent.

Story continues below advertisement

Regardless of this, some things are just universal and don’t require specific product knowledge. I believe that with the statement “knock sound,” you are referring to pre-ignition or ping. The fact that this started after the timing belt was replaced suggests to me that the timing belt was likely installed incorrectly and is now sitting one tooth off.

I have never shimmed a head, nor would I recommend that it ever be done, other than in a racing engine application where a compression ratio needs to be addressed. Go back to your mechanic and insist he revisit his work. If he resists, then you will have to seek a second opinion from another repair facility. Good luck, Godfrey.

What’s on my radar

As internal combustion engines become more complicated, your vehicle’s Malfunction Indicator Lamp (MIL) can illuminate for an ever-increasing amount of reasons. One such item is a newer technology feature commonly known as Variable Valve Timing (VVT), which made its first production-car appearance in the 1990s. Outside of the enthusiast crowd, not many understand this technology, so here is the Lou-lowdown of what it is. That way, if faced with a VVT repair, you’ll at least have a basic idea of what is going on.

For those of you old enough to remember the golden age of muscle cars, one of the most common and easiest engine modifications was to upgrade the exhaust and carburetor. However, serious car enthusiasts often didn’t didn’t stop there and also replaced the stock engine camshaft with a high-lift performance camshaft.

Everyone on the street knew which car had the performance camshaft installed, because sitting behind that car at a set of traffic lights would make your eyes water from the raw fuel smell spewing from their exhaust. The point of the performance camshaft was to make engine valves open further and longer. Enthusiasts liked it because the engine was more powerful when needed, but a downside was that when the engine was idling, it struggled to stay running because it now had too much fuel, hence the reason for the strong odour.

Enter VVT. Some smart engineers started designing engines with camshafts and timing systems that could offer the best of both worlds. They designed a camshaft that had both a normal camshaft profile and a performance profile built into one device. The result was a fuel-efficient car that idled perfectly and also benefited from the extra power provided by a performance camshaft. Every manufacturer now has their own version of it, and just about every newer car on the road makes use of it.

Engine oil performs double duty in VVT engines. It lubricates and is also used to hydraulically drive the various components that make VVT systems work. Because of that, most problems related to VVT usually have something to do with the oil system and lack of proper maintenance. Extended oil-change intervals don’t help either. Be forewarned, as the importance of being on time with your next oil change is of utmost importance on these engines.

If you keep a vehicle in the family in Ontario, you don't have to pay the sales tax – but only if that vehicle was a gift.

If money is exchanged, you have to pay a 13-per-cent retail sales tax (RST).

“A specified vehicle may be transferred exempt from RST to a person from a member of his or her family provided no consideration was given in respect of the vehicle,” says the Ministry of Finance website.

Normally, if you're buying a car in Ontario from a private seller, whether it's from within Ontario or from any other province, you have to pay a provincial sales tax on vehicles.

It’s the buyer, not the seller who pays the tax. It’s paid to Service Ontario when you transfer ownership.

There are a few exceptions, including if you are left a vehicle after a death or if you get it as a gift from an immediate family member. That includes spouses, children, siblings, parents, in-laws, grandparents and great grandparents. It won’t work for cousins, uncles or aunts.

Family value?

If it is a family gift, both members have to sign a sworn statement saying that no money was exchanged.

Would taking over a loan count as exchanging money? Probably, but Ontario’s Ministry of Finance didn’t answer the question and said it can’t comment on individual situations.

""All situations have different variables, and for that reason, I will have to direct you back to the bulletin which clearly sets out the tax rules with regards to motor vehicles,"" an Ontario Finance spokesman said in an e-mail.

While rules vary between provinces, most others don't require taxes on gifts between family members. But some, including Quebec and Nova Scotia, only allow the exemption if both the giver and receiver live in the province.

In Nova Scotia, taking over a loan means that it's not a gift.

""In order for the transfer to be exempt from sales tax, the item being gifted would have to be free and clear of any loans [or] debt,"" Krista Higdon, a Nova Scotia government spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. ""Taking over a loan on a vehicle is not a gift transaction as the outstanding loan amount is the declared purchase price.""

A gift that keeps on taking?

The tax is based on whichever is greater – the sales price or the Canadian Red Book wholesale value. For instance, if the tax was based on a $20,000 loan, it would be $2,600.

If it was based on the wholesale value?

Canadian Red Book says the wholesale value of a 2015 Toyota RAV4 XLE with 60,000 kilometres of mileage would be $12,900, which seems low. So that would mean $1,677 in sales tax.

If you're bringing a vehicle into Ontario from another province, you also need a Safety Standards Certificate from an authorized garage. The cost is usually under $100, plus the cost of any required repairs.

Also, make sure that the bank will allow the loan to be transferred.

""This in itself may be an issue,"" said Warren N. Barnard, executive director of the Used Car Dealers Association of Ontario, in an e-mail.

It might be easier if you take out a fresh loan or put the vehicle on your line of credit, adds Viraf Baliwalla of the Automall Network, a Toronto-based car broker.

“This would be a cleaner transaction,” Baliwalla says.

Gentile: Alisha, I don’t blame your husband for not wanting to drive your Fiat. He definitely is too big for its smaller dimensions. I know it must be difficult to get rid of two cars, which you clearly both like, but in today’s reality, I think It’s a smart idea.

Richardson: I’m guessing that Alisha and her hubby are doing this to save some money, since the ideal solution is just to keep the Mustang as a Sunday driver. That’s an expensive luxury, though. Factor in insurance and maintenance, and those few kilometres on a Sunday get really costly.

Gentile: Exactly. And Alisha might not like driving the Mustang. It’s way bigger than her little Fiat. She’ll be driving the most, so they’re better off getting a vehicle she’s comfortable in, too.

Richardson: Actually, the seats on a Mustang have a long range of movement, so it would probably fit them both well. I just drove one and loved it. My wife, however, thought it was stupid. She hated that I kept leaving the exhaust sound on Track, which is pretty loud. She told me I was compensating for something.

Gentile: And she would know. But this is a done deal, Mark – both the Mustang and the Fiat are being sold.

Richardson: So their new car probably doesn’t have to be big, but it does have to accommodate both tall and not-so-tall drivers. And it should probably be peppy. Both the ‘Stang and the 500 are fun to drive, so how about a larger Fiat, like the 500L?

Gentile: I like the idea of a larger hatchback like the 500L; it’s spacious with plenty of head- and legroom for taller drivers and passengers. But I’m not a big fan of the ride and handling. It’s a bit choppy and rough over bumps and other degradations on the road. It’s definitely not as fun to drive as a Mustang.

Richardson: The advantage is that Alisha already has a relationship with her Fiat dealer, and the 500L keeps the style of the 500 she says she loves. But maybe she doesn’t like her dealer. What else gives a bit of Euro style with some size and agility?

Gentile: The Mini Countryman might fit the bill for both hubby and wife. It’s stylish, spacious and fun to drive – like a go-Kart! Her hubby would really love it.

Richardson: He probably would. I drove the Countryman a few years ago with my buddy Wade, and he’s a tall guy, so I’m sure Alisha’s hubby would fit. He can try it for size at any dealership, of course, and there’s a new edition for 2021, so he may get a good deal on this year’s models. But Mustang to Mini … those are very different images, and as a guy, that could be quite the jump for the husband to accept.

Gentile: I disagree. I see a lot of guys driving Minis. I think he’ll like its ride and handling - it’s definitely way more fun to drive than a Fiat. So what do you think would be a better “image” for her husband?

Richardson: I’m sure he’d enjoy the larger Mini too. It’s got plenty of rally and performance cred. But if he’s a Mustang guy, he might prefer the looks of a Toyota Camry XSE. Now that’s a surprisingly sporty-looking car that starts around $35,000 and would be practical enough for both of them.

Gentile: Camry? Really? Granted, it’s no ordinary-looking Camry, but it’s still a Toyota. I don’t think he’ll want to go from a Mustang to a Camry. That’ll do nothing for his image. I’m thinking maybe a Subaru WRX?

Richardson: Hmm - I’d forgotten about the WRX. It does get pushed to the side sometimes, but owners love them for their sportiness without being niche. And Subaru’s a bit of an underdog, which would probably satisfy any image concerns of selling out to the mainstream.

Gentile: It would. My pick is the WRX. They’ll both enjoy it!

Richardson: The WRX is right on the money at about $32,000 to start. It’s not so cute like the Mini nor so parental like the Camry. It’s kind of plain on the inside, though, and nowhere near as stylish as either the 500 or the Mustang. These guys might find its looks boring. They also don’t need its all-wheel drive.

Gentile: They don’t need it, but it’s a nice bonus to have in the wintertime. Alisha will appreciate it. And her hubby will enjoy the drive – more sporty than a Mini, Camry or Fiat, for that matter.

When the 80th annual Sturgis Motorcycle Rally opens Aug. 7 in South Dakota, it will probably be the largest gathering of humanity anywhere in the world this year. Organizers expect a quarter of a million people to attend over its 10 days. This is about half the number of last year’s attendees, but it still promises to be a raucous blend of loud bikes, louder bars and loudest-of-all rock bands, with daily races and nightly concerts throughout the week.

“The City of Sturgis Motorcycle Rally is an icon of American Freedom and Independence,” said the City Council in a June press release that confirmed the rally would go ahead, despite daily increases in recorded cases of the COVID-19 virus.

American Free-dumb, more like. The Black Hills will be a petri dish of contagion, spreading back through the United States after the partying rally-goers return home in mid-August. Contact tracing will be near-impossible and pointless. When American death rates surge in September among bikers and the countless people with whom they’ve come into contact, the blame will fall on the change of seasons, just as President Trump predicted months ago.

The City of Sturgis didn’t enter into this lightly. It spent several months surveying rally exhibitors, merchants and potential participants before making a commitment. It sent out a postal survey to the 7,000 residents of the small city, about an hour west of Rapid City and north of Mount Rushmore, and 62 per cent of the responses called for the rally to be either postponed or cancelled. But then, according to the local Sioux Falls Argus Leader, the city received a letter from a Rapid City merchandiser reminding it that a federal judge had ruled that no single entity “owns, produces or operates” the rally. If the city tried to shut things down, it would be “subject to claims of liability.”

In a good year, the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally can earn close to US$800-million for the region. Money talks. The city voted to go ahead with it, residents be damned.

Besides, the rally is so huge that its participants spread themselves at least a hundred kilometres in all directions into the region’s restaurants, bars, hotels and campgrounds. Even if the town closed shop and barricaded its borders, riders would still come to western South Dakota to celebrate their American freedom. Before the city announced its decision, the massive Buffalo Chip Campground just past the edge of town announced it would be open for business, with BBQ pits, bike shows and concerts featuring more than 20 bands, including Smash Mouth, Buckcherry and even The Guess Who. It’s not quite business as usual, though – there’ll be hand-washing stations throughout the grounds.

So far, South Dakota has fared much better than most in the fight against COVID-19. The state is large, rural and lightly populated. It’s one of only two states, along with neighbouring Iowa, that does not have a mandatory requirement to wear a mask in public places. When President Trump came to Mount Rushmore on July 3 to celebrate the eve of Independence Day, the state’s Republican governor, Kristi Noem, told Fox News there would be no physical distancing and masks would be optional. Apparently, there was no outbreak of COVID-19 afterward among the 7,500 attendees, reinforcing the governor’s convictions.

The Sturgis rally organizers are being a little more cautious. They’ve cancelled the opening parade and the B1 bomber flypast that each draw huge, pressing crowds, and groups of people will be asked to stand at least six feet apart. They’re encouraging vendors to wear masks. There will be hand-washing stations at every street corner, and only half the maximum number of people allowed by the fire marshal to enter a building will be permitted inside.

Besides, “there have been many huge rodeos and parades and just a lot of stuff all summer long,” a rally spokesperson told South Dakota’s KTTC News. “We’ve had many large gatherings already this summer with minimal impact, if any.”

But those rodeos and parades don’t attract the hundreds of thousands of bikers who’ll be riding in from hotspot states like Texas, Florida and California. And COVID-19 counts have been steadily rising since May: on the Monday before the rally, the Department of Health reported 65 new cases of COVID-19 in South Dakota, for a total of 946 active cases and just over 9,000 cases recorded so far in the pandemic. There were no new deaths reported to add to the total of just over 130 across the state.

Story continues below advertisement

This will all change when hundreds of thousands of visitors arrive from the rest of the infected country, where there are 60,000 new cases and 1,000 deaths reported each day. The virus’s incubation period of up to two weeks means it won’t really be seen until after the last of the rally-goers fire up their V-twins on August 16 and leave town, most of them riding helmetless as they fan back home across the United States in their celebration of freedom.

After all, Sturgis is a biker rally, one of the biggest. There’ll be burgers and beer and Jack Daniels in hundreds of makeshift bars and around thousands of campfires as the leather-clad, leather-skinned Warriors of the Road stick it to The Man. They’ll be fearless in their defiance of the scourge of the virus, especially if there’s alcohol involved. Which means good luck telling them to stand six feet apart and wash their hands.

This will be their declaration of free-dumb, and all we can do in Canada is shake our heads and keep the border closed.

If this car had a first name, it’d be Darth. Black paint. Black bumpers. No badges out back, just a pair of tail lights like red lightsabers. This is a 1987 Grand National, and it’s one of the most thrilling cars ever made by Buick.

Wait, that can’t be right. Surely a Buick is the sort of car your grandmother drove before she gave up her licence, some beige-coloured sedan with styling like a used bar of soap and a suspension made of butterscotch pudding. Buicks aren’t cool, surely?

They used to be. Buick once built cars like the commanding and chrome-laden Roadmaster, or the gorgeous 1960s Riviera. There was the Wildcat, the Electra, the GSX with its massive V8. Buicks had performance and prestige, and in 1987, you could stroll down to your local Buick dealership to buy an all-black Buick that could blow the scissor doors off a Lamborghini Countach.

That’s not hyperbole. In 1987, a Grand National was tested by Car and Driver and accelerated from zero to 60 miles an hour in 4.9 seconds. It was a tenth or two of a second faster than the results for either the Countach or the Ferrari Testarossa, two of the greatest cars to ever grace a poster.

The pride of Italy was stomped all over by a General Motors product with cushy seats and an automatic transmission, those screaming V12s humbled by a growly pushrod V6 from Michigan. Suddenly, kids in the late 1980s started putting different posters up on their walls.

This particular example is a 1987 Grand National, which in its day was rated at 245 horsepower and 355 lb.-ft. of torque. It has belonged to Winston Lui since 1991, and he’s kept it carefully preserved, with a few very rare options. He drives and enjoys it regularly, however, having put more than 100,000 kilometres under its wheels over the years. A member of the local Buick Grand National Racing Association Car Club, he usually brings his car out on cruises and meets.

“I really love seeing them all together,” Lui says. “You roll up, and people just stop and stare.”

As we stand next to his car at the bottom of the hill, a hot-rodded Chevy pickup drives past and flashes a thumbs-up. People who know their cars know what a Grand National is, even with its very discreet badging.

The Buick Grand National takes its name from NASCAR, where the “Grand National” was the name of the racing championship before the tobacco sponsors arrived and it became the Winston Cup. It’s since been named the Cup Series. In 1981 and 1982, Darrell Waltrip raced Mountain Dew-liveried Buick Regals to series victory, and Buick’s marketing department saw an opportunity.

Open this photo in gallery The Grand National took its name and inspiration from stock-car racing. Brendan McAleer/The Globe and Mail

Happily, so did Buick’s engineers. One, named Ken Baker, had already hit on turbocharging as an experimental way to boost the power of smaller V6 engines to match V8 outputs. He got the go-ahead to build a pace car for the 1976 Indy 500. American racing legend Dan Gurney, who’d won at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, drove it so quickly around the track that the tires were worn out in just four laps.

Story continues below advertisement

Baker’s vision and the timing of Waltrip’s victories were a perfect match for Buick. By 1984, Buick was selling an all-black two-door sedan with performance that was just a hair or two behind the Corvette. By 1987, the last year of production, a Grand National owner might grin cheekily over at a Corvette at the dragstrip, knowing that the Buick was actually the fastest car GM currently produced.

Thank turbocharging for the boost. Exhaust gases drive a turbine connected by a shaft to a compressor. That compressor spins, ramming air into the Grand National’s 3.8-litre V6 engine, the air first passing through an intercooler to scrub off some of the power-sapping heat. Under hard acceleration, Lui’s Grand National whistles like a kettle, scorching off down the road.

Open this photo in gallery A turbocharged 3.8-litre engine gives the Grand National its power. Brendan McAleer/The Globe and Mail

Factory performance was fierce, but the Grand National really came alive when the hot-rodders got their hands on the blacked-out Buicks. Some of the local club members have doubled the car’s power by increasing the boost pressure, improving exhaust flow and fitting it with larger turbochargers.

In this way, the Grand National forms a sort of bridge between different car cultures. On one hand, it’s a true muscle car, one of the last of the breed. Its steering and handling are rooted firmly in the 1970s, with its aging G-body General Motors architecture. The braking is also not quite as stout as the performance. The Grand National is all about straight-line speed.

On the other hand, it’s a forward-looking car. Turbocharged V6s are found in countless performance sedans these days. The Grand National is a link between domestic hot-rodders and the turbo-obsessed import-enthusiast crowd. It’s a Buick that appeals to anyone with a need for speed.

Open this photo in gallery The Grand National was all about straight-line speed, in the tradition of American muscle cars. Brendan McAleer/The Globe and Mail

Further, the Grand National is still very much part of popular culture. You can see one owned by “Killer” Mike Render, one half of the rap duo Run The Jewels. It’s featured in the music video for their just-released song Ooh La La. Render unlocks the trunk to reveal cases of champagne. It’s a Buick worth celebrating.

As a last hurrah, just before production ended, Buick took 547 Grand Nationals off the line and handed them to ASC/McLaren, a specialist builder. The result was the GNX, the fastest and best handling of the Grand Nationals. A GNX is highly collectible today, with a low-mileage version worth as much as $200,000 at auction.

Interesting, yes, but not quite as cool as the Grand Nationals of Lui and his fellow club members. These are the cars that you’ll see out there on sunny summer evenings or bright weekend morning runs. They’re the rumble and whistle of GM’s past. They’re a living reminder that Buick used to be cool. It used to have a dark side.

Pickup trucks used to be simple and utilitarian: a bare-bones cab and a big empty box behind it. And while theyʼve kept the utility, they’re by no means simple any more. With pickups now the top-selling vehicles in North America, automakers have taken great strides to make their offerings more advanced – and not just under the hood or behind the wheel.

In the past few years, manufacturers have been adding features to the bed and tailgate to appeal to those on the job site, making their trucks more useful than ever before.

Letʼs see how their offerings compare.

Ford

With the recent release of the 14th generation of its best-selling F-150, Ford is the latest manufacturer to put more thought into what used to be just a place to haul your stuff. The Detroit automaker introduced an aluminum bed a few years ago, the first for any pickup, but with the new 2021 F-150, they’ve added more features aimed directly at tradespeople and those who enjoy the outdoors.

New is the Pro Power Onboard feature, basically a power generator with 120-volt plugs at the back of the bed. Normal gas-engine F-150s can generate 2.0 kilowatts, good for power saws and such. But opt for the hybrid pickup, and you would have a standard 2.4-kW output or an optional 7.2-kW system, which adds a 240-volt, 30-amp outlet suitable for welding, running a large camp trailer or other high-energy applications. What’s more, you can control all of this with an app on your phone.

Ford has also added the Tailgate Work Surface, a relatively flat top on the dropped tailgate that includes indentations to hold pencils, cups and even a tablet, which are somewhat superfluous. But what is really handy are the cleats on the sides of the gate to hold down longer items, as well as pockets to attach clamps for when you might want to cut wood off the gate. It also retains the retractable step and grab bar from the last generation, which are becoming necessary for climbing into the back as today’s trucks get higher and higher.

GMC

Making its debut on the 2019 GMC Sierra Denali, the Multipro Gate has six different positions, making it one of the most versatile tailgates on the market.

An inner gate can fold down to make a smaller, 48-inch workspace, which could be used while standing to use a computer. That same small gate can fold up when the larger gate is down to act as a stop for longer materials. With the larger gate folded down, the inner gate can fold down again to be used as a step. You can also opt for integrated speakers for the ultimate tailgate party.

The gate isn’t the GMC’s utility space’s only trick, as you can also order the whole bed in carbon fibre, a first for pickups, which reduces the overall weight of the Sierra by more than 27 kilograms.

Ram

Anyone needing more lockable storage space could look at optional RamBox lockers, found on either side of the Ram’s bed. While they do cut into the cargo area, the truck can still haul the ubiquitous 4-foot-by-8-foot sheet of plywood. The boxes are locked with the key fob, and have interior lighting and even a drain plug, so you can fill them with ice and beverages and be more popular than the Sierra at that tailgate party.

Ram also offers the Multifunction tailgate. While it swings down, as on a traditional truck, it also swings open to the sides in a 60/40 split to give easier access to the bed.

Honda

Honda’s Ridgeline is a medium-sized pickup, more for personal use than for heavy-duty work. But it also has clever ways to make it more useful. Under the bed at the very back is a lockable trunk with 206 litres of space, enough for a load of groceries or some luggage. And to make access to that trunk easier, the tailgate, which swings down traditionally, also swings out to the left.

Nissan

While every truck comes with fixed tie-down points to hook your straps or bungee cords, Nissan’s full-sized Titan and Titan XD, as well as its medium-sized Frontier, have a unique five-track rail system called Utili-track. Two rails in the bed floor, and rails in the sides and front of the bed allow tie-down cleats to be positioned wherever they’re needed. Also, those side rails accommodate various accessories, such as lockable boxes that can slide from front to back.

According to a cursory search on the internet, the Qashqai are a nomadic, Turkic-language-speaking people who settled in the mountains of southwestern Iran in the 15th century. When the border with the United States reopens to travellers, feel free to trot out this little fact for Americans puzzled by the badge on the back of the small crossover that’s sold as the Rogue Sport down there.

“Surprised you didn’t know that,” you can say. “Common knowledge, really. And the name’s pronounced CASH-kai.”

On a family camping trip a few hours northeast of Vancouver, the Qashqai’s Canadian name proved to be fitting. Nissan’s compact crossover is not particularly sporty, but with solid fuel economy and a comfortable ride, it will work well if you’re a bit nomadic yourself.

That is, as long as you’re not a nomad in a hurry. With a modest 141 horsepower from its 2.0-litre, four-cylinder engine, the Qashqai offers adequate acceleration but is unhappy to be rushed. The feel of Nissan’s continuously variable transmission (CVT) is far more responsive than it has been in the past. Programmed shift points that artificially mimic a conventional transmission mean there is less of a “rubber-band” lag when you accelerate or brake.

Steering is very light and a bit numb, but handling is satisfactory. Nipping along some back roads through the rolling-hill country around Merritt, B.C., the Qashqai felt well-composed and light on its feet. Body roll was minimal.

More importantly, the little Nissan displayed refined road manners. Despite 19-inch alloys – large wheels often crash their way over bumps – the Quashqai floated along serenely, better than you’d expect from a compact crossover. Road noise was pleasantly muted.

Open this photo in gallery Even on 19-inch alloy wheels, the Qashqai's ride is comfortable and quiet. Brendan McAleer/The Globe and Mail

All the better to enjoy a podcast or two as selected by my five-year-old rear-seat passenger (her favourite: Brains On!, a kids’ science program). The Bose-branded stereo is quite good, helped out by the relatively quiet cabin. Further, the Qashqai now comes standard with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, just the sort of thing to make road-tripping easier.

Manoeuvring around the campsite – or any parking spot – is made easier by Nissan’s 360-degree camera system. The Qashqai is a popular model in European markets for its small physical footprint and is well-suited to both urban and slightly-more rugged settings. It’s small enough for tight parking garages, yet quiet and comfortable enough to handle highway miles.

As the second-most-popular vehicle in Nissan’s lineup after the larger Rogue, the Qashqai has essentially supplanted the Nissan Sentra as a small family car that combines utility and economy. As to the latter, it’ll burn a little more fuel than a compact sedan but returned a respectable 8.0 litres per 100 kilometres in mixed-use driving.

Add in hatchback practicality and available all-wheel drive, and the Qashqai could well serve as the main vehicle for a younger family. Bolt on a roof box for a bit of extra cargo capacity when needed and you’ve got an urban runabout that can handle longer trips.

Call it the Rogue Junior, combining the flexibility that most consumers now expect from a crossover in a more efficient and affordable package. The Nissan Qashqai may have a name that’s hard to pronounce, but its broad appeal is easy to understand.

Looks

Open this photo in gallery The Qashqai received a visual refresh for this model year. Brendan McAleer/The Globe and Mail

Refreshed this model year, the Qashqai is a handsome-looking machine, with a profile that’s a little more stylish than the larger Rogue and a little more grown-up than the funky Kicks. Those 19-inch wheels fill the wheel wells out but will add expense when it comes time for tire replacement. The 17-inch wheels on the mid-range SV model look just fine and are a more reasonable choice.

Interior

Open this photo in gallery The Qashqai's interior is comfortable, though feels less upscale than that of some competitors. Brendan McAleer/The Globe and Mail

Nissan’s interior game is strong on comfort, a little behind on perceived quality. The Qashqai’s plastics can’t match the upscale appearance of rivals from Hyundai, but its seats are supportive and ideal for long-distance driving.

Performance

The basic front-wheel-drive Qashqai can be ordered with a six-speed manual transmission, but most buyers will go for the automatic shifting option. The Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) is as smooth as anything, but some owners of 2010-2016 Nissans have complained of problems with the reliability of the CVTs in their vehicles. Nissan extended its powertrain warranty in some previous models to 10 years, but here your warranty coverage is an industry-standard five years or 100,000 kilometres. There do not appear to be any specific complaints about the Qashqai’s transmission, but it would be nice to see Nissan stand behind its technology with a longer standard drivetrain warranty.

Technology

Nissan’s advanced driver-assistance suite is called ProPilot Assist. It comes on SL trim models only and includes automated cruise control and lane-keeping assist. Both systems work well and take some of the chores out of slogging your way through city traffic.

Cargo

Active families of four or five are going to want the larger Rogue for the added cargo capacity. However, the Qashqai’s configurable trunk has a floor that can be lowered for a useful 678 L of capacity, flattened out when folding the seats down or divided for the grocery run.

The verdict

Designed for comfort, efficiency and ease-of-use, the Qashqai has plenty of features that make both everyday driving and longer road trips pleasant.

I live in Ontario and recently received a Quebec ticket for going 155 km/h in a 100 km/h zone. I’m old enough to know better, and I’m not very happy with myself. I know that the demerit points will follow me to Ontario, but can Ontario charge me with stunt driving as well? – John

If you live in Ontario, some of what happens in Quebec stays in Quebec.

You won't get charged for a Quebec ticket when you get back to Ontario – but you'll get the demerits and the offence will appear on your Ontario driving record. ""While there would be no [Ontario] fines as the offence did not occur in Ontario, there would be demerit points,"" Lee Alderson, a senior issues advisor with Ontario's Ministry of Transportation (MTO), said in an e-mail.

When you're driving in another province, you are subject to the laws and penalties there.

So you’d have to pay fines, and if the offence comes with an instant suspension, police there would take your licence on the spot.

But unless you’ve been suspended because of a Criminal Code violation, that out-of-province suspension won’t apply at home.

Plus, you won't be suspended or fined again for that same offence in your home province.

That’s true even if you got an out-of-province charge for something that normally comes with a higher penalty back home.

For instance, in Quebec, speeding 50 to 59 km/h over the 100 km/h limit gets you a $290 fine. Because it's less than 60 km/h over the 100 km/h limit, it's not considered excessive speeding in Quebec. But in Ontario, speeding more than 50 km/h over the limit is considered stunt driving and comes with a minimum fine of $2,000, up to six months in jail, a two-year licence suspension and an immediate seven-day suspension when police pull you over.

""The offence would have had to occur in Ontario to be subject to that penalty,"" Alderson says.

Demerits in most provinces

Speeding tickets also come with demerits. Whether you get them for an out-of-province ticket depends on where you live and where you got the ticket.

Most provinces and territories signed the Canadian Driver Licence Compact (CDLC), a 1990 agreement to share demerits and driving records.

So if you live in Alberta and got a speeding ticket in Newfoundland, for instance, it would appear on your record,

But British Columbia, Quebec and Nunavut didn't sign the CDLC.

That means that B.C. and Nunavut don’t share traffic tickets with any other provinces or territories. So if you live outside B.C. and you get a B.C. speeding ticket, you won’t get demerits, and it won’t appear on your driving record.

Likewise, B.C. drivers won't see out-of-province tickets on their records. This only applies to provincial offences. Any driving-related Criminal Code convictions, including impaired driving, appear on your driving record everywhere in Canada.

Story continues below advertisement

While Quebec didn't sign the CDLC either, it has separate agreements to share information with Ontario, Maine and New York.

“Ontario and Quebec have a conviction-exchange agreement where select offences, such as speeding, are sent back to the driver’s home jurisdiction,” Alderson says. “In this example, the information would be sent to Ontario and applied to the offender’s Ontario driving record.”

Like any other conviction, it will stay on your record for three years.

Only certain convictions are shared, including speeding, careless driving, running a red light and racing. You will also get the equivalent demerits added to your licence.

So if you’re an Ontario driver, that Quebec ticket for speeding 55 km/h over the limit will get you six demerits in Ontario, even though the offence only carries five demerits in Quebec.

Demerits affect your licence. For instance, if you get more than 15 demerit points in Ontario, your licence could be suspended for 30 days. Why does all this sharing matter? Once an out-of-province conviction appears on your driving record, your insurance company can use it to raise your rates.

Story continues below advertisement

“If you are convicted of racing or stunt driving, you will now be in the ‘high risk’ insurance market,” said Anne Marie Thomas, senior manager of partner relationships at Insurance Hotline, a rate-comparison site. “The premium increase could be as much as two or three times what you were paying before.”

In 2010, Nissan introduced the Nissan Leaf, the first mass-market all-electric vehicle to hit the road. Since then, more than 475,000 have been sold globally. A decade later, Nissan is now bringing a bigger EV to the market: the Ariya all-electric crossover, which it hopes will represent a new direction for the brand.

“The capitalization of experience on almost half a million cars makes Ariya a big leap forward compared to the Leaf,” said Pierre Loing, global vice-president of product planning for Nissan, ahead of the vehicle’s global online launch.

“When the Leaf came to the market, it was not at the centre. It was treading new ground,” added Giovanny Arroba, Ariya’s senior design director. “We’re grabbing the baton from the Leaf in every way. With the Ariya, we wanted to take it to a new sleek, sexy and seamless interpretation to elevate the brand language to a new height.”

The Ariya is built on an all-new EV platform. Compared to the Nissan Rogue, Ariya is wider (by 59 mm), and shorter in length (by 41 mm) and height (by 58 mm). It’ll be offered in four models: two-wheel and all-wheel drive configurations as well as two different battery sizes, standard (63 kWh) and long-range (87 kWh). Nissan estimates an electric driving range of up to 482 kilometres.

The Ariya seats five. Two horizontal, panoramic display screens take centre stage in the high-tech cabin. Buttons, dials and switches are noticeably absent, replaced with capacitive haptic switches that vibrate when touched and blend seamlessly into the wood trim on the dashboard. A full-colour head-up display projects info directly onto the windshield within the driver’s field of vision.

Open this photo in gallery The centre console 'floats' forward and backward to free up space when necessary. Courtesy of manufacturer

Engineers moved the climate-control system from the cabin to under the hood, where you’d normally find an engine. This allowed designers to create innovative elements such as a “floating” centre console, which slides forward and backward to free up extra space when needed. The small gear shifter is designed to fit snugly into the palm of your hand for a relaxed driving position. It sits on the console and also features haptic drive-mode controls. Tucked under the instrument panel is a centre storage box and fold-out tray meant to replicate a mobile office in the future.

The battery pack sits under the centre of the vehicle. With no driveshaft, there’s a flat, open floor and no awkward and uncomfortable centre hump in the rear seats. Slim contoured front seats give the rear occupants a better view of the front cabin, too.

Open this photo in gallery The Ariya's front grille is dubbed a 'tech shield,' as it protects the sensors that serve the driver-assistance functions. Courtesy of manufacturer

Ariya’s striking exterior represents Nissan’s new design language, according to the company. Thin LED headlamps anchor the front grille, which is dubbed a “tech shield” because it protects vital sensors for the driver-assistance functions. In the centre of the shield is Nissan’s redesigned brand logo, which will appear on all vehicles moving forward. Six two-tone exterior paint combinations, each with a black roof, and three full-body colours are available. Copper is a predominant exterior colour and accent in the cabin. Since copper conducts electricity, it is meant to signal Nissan’s vision of the future.

Connectivity also plays a predominant role. The Ariya features two types of connectivity that work hand-in-hand: Nissan’s personal assistance tech and Amazon Alexa. The personal assistant uses voice-recognition to access a number of features such as the climate, navigation and entertainment systems, by simply saying in natural language, “Hey Nissan, take me home.” Amazon Alexa takes things a step further by connecting your car to your home, so you can perform tasks like turning on the lights or adjusting the A/C before you walk in the house. Over-the-air software updates are also available for the first time ever on a Nissan model. Wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto is standard.

Ariya comes with Nissan’s latest semi-autonomous driving system, called ProPILOT Assist 2.0. The system helps drivers navigate stop-and-go highway traffic, stay centered in their lane and maintain a set vehicle speed and distance to the vehicle ahead. Nissan Safety Shield 360 is also standard. It includes a bundle of six safety features such as intelligent emergency braking with pedestrian detection, blind-spot warning and high-beam assist – to name a few.

These are confusing times. Consumers are bombarded with countless sources of information, and it’s difficult to sort out fact from fiction.

Honda Canada has responded with a clear and concise approach to communicating the environmental footprint of its vehicles. In an era of growing climate-change awareness, consumers and environmentalists want to know how the automotive industry is taking action, and confusion should not be an option when it comes time to make a purchase.

The new campaign, available to view at honda.ca, provides verified data on CO2 emissions for each model sold in Canada, and it gives consumers useful information on reducing their own carbon footprints. The campaign doesn’t just represent a return to the company’s roots, says Jean Marc Leclerc, senior vice-president of sales and marketing for Honda Canada – it’s a reaffirmation.

Story continues below advertisement

“A focus on fuel efficiency and using fewer resources has been part of our DNA for a long time,” he explains. “We have a history in this space, so we believe it’s our responsibility at Honda Canada to change the conversation, to get consumers thinking about greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in a different way.”

An industry first, the campaign builds on the most recent federal government GHG report, entitled Greenhouse Gas Emissions Performance for the 2017 Model Year Light-Duty Vehicle Fleet, published by Environment & Climate Change Canada last year. The report verifies that the Honda Canada fleet had the best overall fuel economy in the industry, and lower-than-average carbon emissions among internal combustion engine (ICE) manufacturers.

Based on the data, the Honda Canada website lists how many grams of CO2 its vehicles emit per kilometre. It’s a recognition by the company that environmental performance is a competitive advantage.

“The campaign follows the model the food industry used when it introduced calorie counts,” Leclerc says. “The automotive industry is far behind the food industry right now, but we can bridge the gap – it’s all about giving consumers what they need to make informed decisions.”

Visitors to the Honda Canada website can also make quick comparisons among models. For example, a shopper interested in a Honda Pilot because it suits their lifestyle may decide that they can make a Honda Civic work instead. “The core of the idea is to focus – or refocus – on reducing greenhouse gas emissions,” Leclerc says.

“Whether you’re driving an SUV with an internal combustion engine or a compact car or a hybrid, there are vehicles in every category that perform better than others. At Honda, we have some of the best performing vehicles in the business and we’re just reintroducing this to the Canadian consumer from a different perspective.”

The Honda Canada campaign, Driven to Reduce Emissions Since 1948, says its global organization plans for electric to represent two-thirds of its vehicle sales by 2030, an ambitious target that incorporates a measured approach to technological innovation. It aims to reduce carbon emissions across its business and manufacturing operations.

This focus on the environment also extends to a number of social causes in Canada, as one of four key pillars of the Honda Canada Foundation. Through the Foundation, Honda partners with charities that bring environmental education to classrooms and after-school programs across Canada.

The Foundation’s long-term partnership with Earth Rangers, a kids’ conservation organization, educates young people across the country about animals and the environment through the School Assembly Program, igniting a spark of enthusiasm that motivates children to start taking action to help protect the environment.

Concern for the environment is not new to Honda. In 1972, the company introduced the CVCC engine, the first to meet U.S. Clean Air Act standards without the need for a catalytic converter. And last year, it announced a long-term agreement to purchase renewable wind and solar power to cover more than 60 per cent of the company’s electricity requirements in North America.

All of Honda Canada’s decisions fall under the global “Blue Skies for Our Children” umbrella: a wide-ranging environmental directive to do what the company can to give future generations the opportunity to experience the joy and freedom of mobility while living in a sustainable society.

The truck wars are escalating, but it’s no longer a battle among the Detroit Three. A new crop of pickups are coming, and they’re all electric. Many new automakers are entering the space, vying for a piece of the lucrative pie. Here are six electric trucks on the horizon.

Tesla Cybertruck

One of the most highly anticipated all-electric trucks is Tesla Inc.‘s unconventional Cybertruck. It’ll be available in three versions: a single-motor rear-wheel-drive model (with 402 kilometres of electric range and 3,402 kilograms of towing capacity), a dual-motor all-wheel-drive (with 482 km of range and 4,536 kg towing capacity), and a tri-motor AWD (804 km range, 6,350 kg towing capacity) that can go from zero-to-100 km/h in 2.9 seconds. It’ll have adjustable air suspension with up to 16 inches of ground clearance.

Prices range from US$39,900 to US$69,900. (Add another US$7,000 for the self-driving technology). Canadian prices haven’t been announced yet, but you can reserve one for $150. And the COVID-19 pandemic hasn’t appeared to hamper sales. According to the Cybertruck Owners Club, more than 713,000 Cybertrucks have been preordered since its launch on Nov. 21, 2019.

Production is still on track, beginning in late 2021 for the AWD versions, followed by the RWD in late 2022.

Bollinger B2

One of the most expensive electric trucks comes from a new player, Michigan-based upstart Bollinger Motors LLC. For a newcomer, the all-electric B2 pickup doesn’t come cheap – it’s priced at US$125,000. And it’s pretty barebones, with few safety and convenience features. But it’s functional, with foldable and removable body panels, including the doors, windows and windshield and roof, as well as a “frunk” – front trunk – with 244 litres of space. The bed length extends from 6 feet to 8 feet and 2 inches by removing the rear cab wall and the rear seats, so you can carry up to 16-foot-long cargo in its full-length centre pass-through.

Dual electric motors produce 614 horsepower and 688 lb.-ft. of torque, which will enable it to tow 3,402 kilograms and carry a payload of up to 2,268 kg. Range isn’t the longest – only about 322 kilometres.

Production is set for later this year, founder and CEO Robert Bollinger says. “We are on track at Bollinger Motors. Some of our vendors are delayed, and we are still working with them to get back on track. Some delay may happen, but we’re still hoping it’s minor.”

Rivian R1T

Another new player in the electric vehicle (EV) truck segment is Rivian. The American startup’s truck, designed to be an adventurer’s dream, is called the R1T.

Three battery-pack options are available, with ranges from 370 to 644 kilometres. The fully loaded top model with the largest-capacity battery pack (180 kilowatts) has up to 750 hp and can tow up to 4,990 kilograms. From zero, it’ll hit 100 km/h in three seconds. Inside, it’s luxurious. It seats five passengers, has a trunk in the front, 340 litres of lockable storage to hide valuables, and a flexible crossbar system that expands and collapses so you can mount gear on the roof, the truck bed or the bed floor. For off-roading, it has adjustable air suspension and can wade through water more than 3 feet deep.

Rivian was aiming to be the first EV truck to go to market later this year, but it’s now delayed to 2021. Production will start with the 180 kWh R1T model, followed by the other two trims in late 2022 and early 2023. Prices start at US$69,000.

Arizona startup Nikola Corp. recently unveiled its Badger truck. It’ll be available as either a battery-electric or a hydrogen fuel-cell pickup, designed to go head-to-head against the Ford F-150.

Built for the construction site, the hydrogen fuel-cell truck is expected to have 906 hp and 980 lb.-ft. of torque, a 965-km range, towing capacity of 3,629 kilograms, and a 0-100 km/h time of about 2.9 seconds.

Despite COVID-19 and the recent drop in auto and EV sales in North America, the company is still moving forward quickly; it’s opening up online reservations for its hydrogen-powered Badger on June 29. Prices haven’t been announced yet.

The publicly traded company plans to roll out the battery version in 2021, followed by the fuel cell in 2023. But that may be ambitious, since the company hasn’t even finished building its factory in Coolidge, Ariz.

GMC Hummer EV SUT

Here’s a blast from the past – the Hummer. GM is resurrecting the legendary nameplate under its GMC brand. While details are still sketchy, the all-electric pickup is expected to have up to 1,000 hp and 11,500 lb.-ft. of torque, according to GM.

It’ll have an open-air design so you can remove the four roof panels and front T-bar for a convertible-like feel.

It’s expected to launch in late 2021 as a 2022 model and arrive in Canada in the fall of 2022. “GM has been focused on manufacturing efforts to assist in the fight against COVID-19 while also dedicated to maintaining the development of this important product on schedule, with as little impact as possible. We expect little to no delays on development and launch timing,” says GM Canada’s product communications manager, Michelle Burnham.

Prices will be announced closer to the launch date.

Ford F-150 Electric

Ford is going electric with Canada’s best-selling pickup truck, the F-150.

The F-150 Electric pickup will arrive in “mid-2022,” Jim Farley, Ford’s chief operating officer, said in a recent interview on CNBC. There aren’t many details available on the truck yet, but it’s expected to be built in-house and roll off the line with the current gas-powered F-150.

A new F-150, in gas and hybrid versions, is set to debut virtually on June 25, 2020. The electric F-150 will follow within 24 months. Prices will be revealed closer to the launch date.

The price of gas is down, and Dodge wants to make the most of it with three new Hellcat performance vehicles, including a three-row Durango Hellcat SUV.

These are “for the real crazies, who think enough is never enough,” says Tim Kuniskis, FCA’s head of passenger cars for North America. “Dodge now offers three 700-horsepower-plus muscle cars. This really is the golden age of muscle.”

The most powerful is the new Challenger Hellcat Super Stock, which creates 807 hp and, Dodge claims, will cover a quarter-mile in 10.5 seconds at 211 km/h. It uses the existing 6.2-litre V8 Redeye engine but has improved suspension to help it dig in and shave 0.4 seconds from the Redeye’s quarter-mile time.

The Super Stock uses the current widebody chassis setup, but now has 3.09 final-drive gearing on its limited-slip differential, with 18x11-inch wheels and 315-width tires for extra traction. “As cool as burnouts at 50 mph are,” says Kuniskis, “spinning isn’t winning.”

In Track mode, the Super Stock removes all rebound damping from the front suspension while maintaining all steering control, and it activates a revised, full-control suspension adjustment at the rear.

“The front end lifts, creating weight transfer,” says Darryl Smith, Dodge’s director of performance vehicles. “The rear end holds all that weight transfer, those great big drag radials wind up, and you are pushed firmly to the back of your seat in the most aggressive launch in the muscle car business. And that feeling never gets old.”

The Challenger SRT Superstock will be built in Brampton, Ont., and will be available this fall. No price is yet announced, but the current Challenger Hellcat Redeye Widebody has an MSRP of $93,666 – three times the cost of the most basic Challenger SXT, which lists for $32,507.

The four-door Dodge Charger Hellcat is also pumped up for 2021 with a Redeye edition, which will boost the sedan’s output from 717 hp and 650 lb.-ft. of torque to 797 hp. Dodge says this will make it the most powerful and fastest sedan in the world, with a quarter-mile time of 10.6 seconds at 208 km/h. Its top speed is claimed to be 327 km/h.

At full throttle, says Dodge in a press release, “the Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat Redeye consumes 5.4 litres/minute of fuel – enough to drain the fuel tank in just under 11 minutes, yet is still rated at 10.7 L/100 km when driven in normal highway conditions.”

The Charger Redeye will be available early next year, and again, no price is yet released. Current Charger Hellcats have an MSRP of $77,699.

Perhaps the rarest of the three new Hellcats, however, will be the Dodge Durango Hellcat SUV. It will only be built for the first six months of 2021, and it will not be continued for 2022 – emissions controls that come into effect for that model year will be too prohibitive. Dodge expects to make fewer than 2,000 of them.

The Durango Hellcat will be powered by a 6.2-litre V8 engine and will generate 710 hp and 645 lbs.-ft. of torque. Dodge says it’s been timed at 11.5 seconds over a quarter-mile track and can cover zero-to-100 km/h in about 3.5 seconds. It also has a towing capability of 8,700 lbs. (3,946 kg), the same as the regular 6.4-litre Hemi V8.

It has a much stiffer and more aerodynamic body, to handle the challenges of driving such a large vehicle at speed. A small rear spoiler adds 140 pounds of downforce at the SUV’s top speed of 290 km/h, while an aggressive front “chin-splitter” beneath the grille reduces front-end lift by preventing air from going under the vehicle.

“When you combine the spoiler with the chin-splitter, you get a 30-per-cent improvement in aerodynamic balance,” says Jamie Standring, Dodge’s chief engineer for performance SUVs. Brakes and suspension are also upgraded, with a 5-per-cent improvement in its roll gradient. “That means the car feels more like it’s on rails,” says Standring.

The Durango’s chief designer is more to-the-point in his description. “From a designer’s perspective, it just looks bad-ass and makes the car look really planted on the road,” says Brian Nielander.

Inside the Durango Hellcat, the controls are focused more toward the driver, and connectivity is handled through FCA’s latest-generation UConnect5 system, which is up to five times faster than before. Engineers took the system home on their iPads and tablets, and their families showed them what passengers really wanted from its controls and displays, other than just acceleration and top speed.

There is no price yet announced for the Durango SRT Hellcat. The current top-end Durango SRT has an MSRP of $68,611, so the Hellcat version can be expected to start at about $85,000.

When you first meet Giulia, she comes across as a bit of a prima donna. Sheʼs a bit flighty and seems to need a lot of attention.

Yes, we’re talking about a car. Alfa Romeo introduced the Giulia sports sedan to the world in the most exuberant and romantic fashion back in 2015. Italian opera singer Andrea Bocelli dedicated a love poem to the car and sang the aria Nessun Dorma from Pucciniʼs Turandot as the prototype was revealed. Hearts soared and tears were shed in a thoroughly delightful, over-the-top debut.

At the time, Alfa Romeo made much of the Giuliaʼs pedigree and the two years that the companyʼs “skunk works” team of engineers, designers and stylists spent in isolation, working tirelessly to create the car.

Story continues below advertisement

Fast forward to the 2020 Giulia Quadrifoglio, the flagship four-door grand touring sedan from the Italian automaker, which is now part of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA). Given the hype at the carʼs debut and the companyʼs history of making beautiful, fast cars, the bar is high.

The Giulia certainly does not disappoint. At first blush, itʼs a vehicle that seems to need a lot of attention. The body is a stunning pearlescent white that nobody without a personal detailer or a serious car-cleaning obsession should buy.

Fortunately, there are other colours to choose from, including proper Alfa Red.

The impression continues when you get behind the wheel. A dizzying array of electronic controls – upgraded for this model year with a larger 8.8-inch touch screen and myriad customizable views of everything from navigation to the carʼs real-time performance numbers – could be considered distracting in a driverʼs car.

Open this photo in gallery The Quadrifoglio is the Italian automaker's flagship four-door grand tourer. Emily Atkins/The Globe and Mail

This particular test car was equipped with $8,000 Brembo carbon ceramic brakes. In stop-and-go driving, they are twitchy and overly grabby. For the first few blocks, slowing for traffic and lights was an alarmingly herky-jerky experience. They come into their own on the highway, however, slowing the car smoothly and without drama.

And thatʼs where the Giulia began to grow on me. Once we hit the freeway, the carʼs true Alfa colours emerged.

This car shines on the open road. The eight-speed automatic transmission delivers power from the 505-horsepower V6 twin-turbo engine to the rear wheels so smoothly that shifts are imperceptible, unless you decide to manage them yourself using the paddle shifters in either Race or Dynamic mode. Then the Quadrifoglio becomes a beast anxious to tear up the road and outrun whatever is around, issuing tremendous snorting resonance from the exhaust.

Story continues below advertisement

The engine is Ferrari-derived, the most powerful ever installed in an Alfa. The company boasts that the Giulia currently holds the speed record for five-passenger sedans around Germanyʼs famed Nurburgring racetrack.

Open this photo in gallery The Giulia shines on the open road. Emily Atkins/The Globe and Mail

Handling is surefooted thanks to the 50-50 front-to-rear weight distribution, adaptive suspension and torque-vectoring differential. In the real world, this lets the car boogie over winding, hilly roads or stretch its legs at eye-watering highway speeds.

In an odd gambit, FCA has decided to market this fast, racy model as a combination sports car and grocery-getter. In a July press briefing, Alfa Romeo North Americaʼs brand manager Steve Richards called the Giulia a “daily-driven performance car.” He envisions buyers dropping the kids at school, taking it to work and being able to go road-tripping on weekends.

Heʼs got a point – the Giulia is surely capable of doing all that. But isnʼt every four-door sedan and SUV on the market today? Using the Giulia Quadrifoglio as a daily driver is a waste of its true aptitudes.

While the Giulia is temperamental in stop-and-go traffic, at speed its minor flaws can be forgiven. Where itʼs important – handling and road manners – the car is every bit the star that Alfa Romeo envisioned at the launch five years ago. And while it could certainly be a competent grocery-getter, the Giulia works best as a go-to companion for a spirited run on the open road.

Looks

Open this photo in gallery The Giulia's long, sloping snout and sporty vents give it a classic grand-touring look. Emily Atkins/The Globe and Mail

The Giulia is very much a European-style Grand Touring sedan. Its long sloping snout, sporty vents and intricate Alfa trefoil grilles make it distinctive on approach, but from the back, its broad behind and short rear overhang are fairly typical design elements for cars in this class. Running on 19-inch wheels is a welcome change from the overly large rims some manufacturers choose for their flagship vehicles, and they create satisfying proportions for the Giulia.

Interior

Open this photo in gallery The interior has a welcoming combination of dark suede and leather surfaces. Emily Atkins/The Globe and Mail

This Giuliaʼs dark suede and leather surfaces, combined with carbon-fibre accents, is welcoming, cool and calming. Its simple design is understated and elegant with double rows of contrasting stitching. The seats are extremely comfortable, with extendable seat cushions for the driver and front passenger, and supportive bolstering. Rear leg room is lacking, however; only people with shorter legs would be comfortable there for long.

Performance

Boasting a zero-to-100 launch in 3.8 seconds, the Giulia Quadrifoglio is packed with torque and handling. Coupled with a butter-smooth eight-speed automatic, paddle shifters and drive-mode selector that moves from eco to race, the car delivers performance that progresses from stately to electrifying, depending on your mood.

Technology

For 2020, the carʼs new, larger touch screen is highly legible and offers customizable displays. Smartphone integration is quick, but the interface is made more complicated by the multiple access controls – the screen, console knobs and steering wheel buttons – for various functions. On the safety side, the 2020 model has newly integrated level-2 autonomy.

Cargo

Open this photo in gallery The low-ceilinged trunk benefits from a pass-through to the rear seats. Emily Atkins/The Globe and Mail

The Giuliaʼs trunk has a low ceiling but is deep from front to back, with a generous opening. This limits its ability to accommodate bulky items, although it does have a pass-through into the passenger compartment to handle skis. Itʼs sufficient for a car in this class, but doesnʼt quite measure up to Alfa’s all-rounder claim.

The verdict

The Giulia Quadrifoglio is a handsome, versatile driverʼs car with a few quirks that do not detract from its performance or value.

The next generation of North America’s best-selling vehicle offers a dizzying array of innovations that raises the stakes in the Detroit Three’s relentless war for light-duty truck domination.

Want choice? Fasten your seat belts.

Among the dozens of optional choices on the 2021 Ford F-150, consumers will be offered: a hybrid power train with 5,400 kilograms of continuous hauling power, front seats that fold flat for naps, and/or an on-board integrated electrical power source strong enough to drive multiple power tools.

In this, the 14th generation of the all-American full-sized pickup truck, Ford has foregone revolutionary change in favour of adding features and refinements that aim to meet challenges from GM’s Sierra and Silverado, and FCA’s Ram.

The 2021 F-150 does not have a singular radical change on the scale of the weight-saving all-aluminum body introduced in 2015. Instead, the new truck, which retains its aluminum body, has a broad range of innovations that: make the vehicle more convenient and comfortable on the inside, improve driver safety, and increase productive workspace for contractors.

Or should I say new “trucks?” The F-150 comes in dozens of variables stacked onto its traditional body-on-frame platform. There are 11 different front grilles, six engine choices, 13 wheel choices ranging from 17 to 22 inches, three cab configurations – even three headlamp configurations! – all spread over six trim levels that range from the XL work truck version to the luxurious Limited.

On the exterior, the changes are largely cosmetic and relatively minor. The front grilles are identifiably F-150 macho but have been rounded for a softer look, not unlike the grille found on the Ram 1500. The headlamps are surrounded by C-shaped LED running light halos that bear a passing resemblance to the GMC Sierra. The tailgate offers optional pockets to accommodate c-clamps (for holding materials in place), more tie-down points, and little pockets to hold tablets, cups and pens.

Kick-switch operated power running boards on upgraded models were extended to make it easier to reach into the cargo box.

Ehab Kaoud, chief designer for Ford’s North American trucks, said the wheels have been pushed out two centimetres to provide a more aggressive stance. Yet, the vehicle’s aerodynamics have been improved by three per cent through, among other things, active front grille shutters that close at speed and a front air dam that deploys at speeds above 64 km/h.

The headlamps range from standard halogen reflectors to LED reflectors and, in premium models, “dynamic bending” LED lights that point in the direction the vehicle is turning.

The interior, meanwhile, has plusher, upgraded materials on premium models. Ford has introduced an optional fold-down shift lever, creating a large flat work surface on the centre console to handle laptops and clipboards. Dawn Piechocki, F-150 engineering manager, said one-third of current owners use laptops in the cabs, and yet prefer a traditional shift-lever over space-saving dash-mounted gear controls. Storage space enhancements include a flat storage area in the back seat with foldable storage boxes.

For stolen naps on those too-long days, the F-150 also has available front seats that recline nearly a full 180 degrees.

Another play to contractors (or, far that matter, tailgate partiers) is the available on-board electrical power inverter, with capacities that range from 2.0 kW to 7.2 kW, depending on model. The battery-driven electrical inverter, which is recharged by the truck’s engine as needed, eliminates the need to carry a standalone unit to run power tools.

The SYNC4 infotainment technology has a 20-centimetre touchscreen as standard, but the XLT lux and above models will have a 30-centimetre screen, oriented horizontally. This fourth-generation system offers voice-activated controls, customizable screen, wireless Android Auto and Apple Car Play connections, and both on-screen and traditional control buttons.

Although the 3.3-litre gasoline V6 is the base engine, Ford retains the 2.7- and 3.5-litre Ecoboost (i.e., turbocharged) engines. Kaoub says Ecoboost engines are account for 60 per cent of F-150s sold. The beefier 5.0-litre V8 now has cylinder deactivation, which cuts fuel consumption under light loads.

Craig Schmatz, F-150 chief engineer, notes the 3.5-litre Ecoboost hybrid is the first full hybrid light duty pickup on the market. Though it uses electricity stored in a smallish 1.5 kW/hr lithium battery to save fuel, he said the vehicle can pull its rated 5,400-kilogram load “as long as you need” drawing on the gasoline engine as needed. Ford estimates the hybrid can travel as far as 1,100 kilometres on a tank of gas.

Among the 10 new driver-assist features, one of the most intriguing is the hands-free option. Higher end models come with the hardware that will enable the trucks to be driven hands-free on more than 160,000 kilometres of divided highways in Canada in the U.S. The system won’t be operational right away; Ford says it can be activated for an additional fee when the software is released in the summer of 2021.

When an automaker seeks to keep a best-selling vehicle at the top of the heap, there is tendency to avoid risky changes. The caution is understandable, given the fact that the F-series has been Canada’s top selling truck for 54 years and, around the world, Ford’s truck franchise is valued at more than $50 billion. That is why Ford is keeping a familiar look, while enriching the new F-150 with an array of technology and features.

“It is radical? No,” said Kaoub. “We do vehicles that satisfy our core customer group.”

It’s also playing to American patriotism, with little U.S. flags embossed on the sides of the front dash. One model even comes with an applique map of Ford’s home city of Detroit. Ford emphasizes the trucks are “100 per cent assembled in America,” at plants in Dearborn, Mich., and Kansas City, Mo.

With safety concerns related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Ford did not provide journalists any hands-on experience with the new F-150. Deliveries to Canadian dealerships are expected in November.

Audi is hoping an updated version of its best-selling Q5 SUV will tempt buyers back into showrooms – physical or virtual – now that people are buying cars again.

In May, new vehicles sales rebounded after hitting a record low in April, according to market research firm DesRosiers Automotive Consultants.

The Audi Q5 already has sales momentum on its side. Through the first three months of 2020, it was the best-selling compact luxury SUV in Canada – ahead of the Lexus NX and Audi Q3 – according to GoodCarBadCar data. (This time last year, the Q5 ranked second in sales, behind the Mercedes-Benz GLC, for which sales data is missing for 2020.)

Clearly, the Q5 wasn’t broken and Audi didn’t need to fix it. Nevertheless, it’s getting some significant upgrades for the 2021 model year.

Chief among the updates is a new infotainment system that does away with Audi’s usual rotary-dial controller and replaces it with a new 10.1-inch touchscreen. The brand did the same thing in the revised 2020 A4, and while the screen itself was snappy and responsive, the lack of a physical controller meant taking your eyes off the road more often to look at the screen.

Compared to the number two best-seller, the Lexus NX, Audi’s infotainment system is already miles ahead. The 2020 Mercedes GLC has that brand’s new MBUX infotainment system, which is excellent, and still has physical controls in the form of a highly-intuitive touchpad. (Take notes, Lexus)

Usually when we talk about power in a car it’s horsepower, but increasingly computing power is going to be a differentiator, as is the case here. Audi claims the Q5′s new computing unit has 10 times the power of the previous one. It makes possible things like seamless pinch-to-zoom maps and high-resolution Google Earth images. Live traffic updates are now accurate down to individual lanes too, which should be useful on major highways.

Cloud-based voice control may not sound like a big upgrade, but in our experience the “cloud-based” bit makes all the difference. Similar systems that rely solely on the vehicle’s on-board computing power are often frustrating since they rarely understand what you ask them. In the Q5, if you say, like a barbarian, “I’m hungry,” the Audi will look up restaurants along your current route. Amazon Alexa is also integrated into the car too.

The exterior style has received minor tweaks. It’s still much more conservative, less fussy-looking than the Lexus NX. On the flip side, the Q5 doesn’t really stand out as much among the usual array of small crossovers.

Dany Garand, a Montreal-born senior designer at Audi, said the goal of tweaks to the Q5 were to change how it looked on the road. It does look stronger now in profile, thanks to a lower side-sill graphic that props the car up visually. There are new OLED (organic light emitting diode) rear lights, that run through different animations when you lock or unlock the car. It’s a bit sci-fi and totally unnecessary, but could be useful for showing off to your neighbours.

A new set of 21-inch wheels adds curb appeal, as does a very on-trend new green paint colour.

The Q5 will be available with a plethora of engine options: two different plug-in hybrids, a four-cylinder and a V-6. The non plug-ins have a new mild-hybrid system that will improve fuel efficiency by a few percentage points. The motors are mated to automatic transmissions: a seven-speed dual-clutch with four-cylinder engines or an eight-speed conventional automatic with V-6 motors. A mildly sporty SQ5 model will arrive as well.

We expect quattro all-wheel drive on all versions, but Audi couldn’t provide details on the specifications or fuel consumption ratings of Canadian models yet.

There won’t be a fully-electric version of this SUV, since the Audi e-tron, e-tron Sportback, and upcoming Q4 e-tron already fill that void.

It’s a safe bet to assume prices will start at or around the $46,300 of the current model. If the price stays at that level, it represents a small premium over the Lexus NX and would be a few thousand dollars less than the Mercedes GLC or BMW X3. The Q5 will face off against other strong rivals, including the Volvo XC60, Acura RDX, Lincoln Corsair and Jaguar F-Pace.

As a group, sales of compact luxury SUVs didn’t drop as severally as most other types of vehicles during the initial months of the pandemic, according to data from DesRosiers. They were hot sellers before COVID-19, and automakers will be looking to popular vehicles like these to jump start sales.

Audi, like most other automakers, introduced online shopping for new and used vehicles through its website, as well as contactless test-drives and handovers.

The new 2021 Audi Q5, including the plug-in hybrid and SQ5, will arrive this fall in Canada.

It’s safe to say most of us won’t be jet-setting to far-away vacation destinations this summer, but don’t despair. There are alternatives for your next family getaway, including renting or buying an RV. It’s a great way to hit the open road and explore Canada’s own backyard.

“It’s going to be the year of the RV. It’s never been quite as popular as it is right now,” says Chris Mahony, president of Go RVing Canada, a non-for-profit industry association that promotes the RV lifestyle.

“It’s a combination of the fact that cross-border travel is gone, people are concerned about safety, and RVing gives you the freedom and flexibility to [vacation] in your own backyard,” he adds.

Story continues below advertisement

There are financial benefits, too, Mahony says. Go RVing estimates that a family of four traveling in an RV can save between 65 and 70 per cent of costs compared with a traditional family vacation to the United States, when factoring in accommodation, flights and restaurant meals.

Similar figures likely apply north of the border. Approximately 2.1 million (or 14 per cent) of Canadian households currently own a RV, he adds.

Whether buying or renting, it can be overwhelming and intimidating to start. There are numerous RVs on the market, but the majority fall under two categories: towable (also known as travel trailers) and motorized. The difference between the two is what you might expect: Travel trailers require a vehicle to tow them, while motorized ones don’t. The latter is a self-contained unit with either a gas or diesel engine. Towable and motorized RVs come in many versions and a range of prices.

Towable options

Open this photo in gallery Tent trailers are affordable and lightweight options. Outdoorsy/Handout

Starting at $10,000, tent trailers are the cheapest RVs you can buy. They’re lightweight, come in many lengths (4.6 to 7 metres) and sleep up to eight people. Some are bare-bones, but you can add options such as hot water, air conditioning, washrooms and kitchen appliances. These trailers can be set up quickly and easily or stored away in a garage when not in use. They can also be towed by most six-cylinder vehicles, including a mid-sized car, SUV or truck – you just have to check your vehicle’s tow limits.

If you want something larger (6.4 to 12.2 metres), fifth-wheel trailers are the way to go. They’re towed by a pickup truck using a special fifth-wheel hitch attachment. They’re spacious with high ceilings and slide-outs that extend the RV wall with the touch of a button, to expand the living space. They can sleep up to eight people and have showers and kitchens. They’re also detachable, so you can leave your trailer at the park and take your vehicle to explore the local surroundings. Prices range from $35,000 to $160,000.

Motorized options

When it comes to motorized RVs, there are three types: Class A, Class B and Class C. The largest, Class A, are luxurious and high-end with all the comforts of home. Some can cost as much as $1-million. Many have multiple TVs, several bathrooms and bedrooms, high-end kitchens with real-wood cabinets, marble countertops, stainless steel appliances, and central heating and air conditioning. Class A motorhomes are built on a specially designed chassis that can range from 6.4 to 12.2 metres, so they require more skill and caution when driving. A small vehicle, boat or golf cart can be towed behind the RV, so you can take quick trips in your car while your motorhome is parked.

Class B vehicles, also known as camper or conversion vans, are similar to a Mercedes-Benz Sprinter van. Ideal for up to four people, they’re easy to drive and park because they fit into a regular parking space. They’re good on fuel, too. Prices start at $70,000.

The most iconic motorized RV is the Class C. With its truck-like profile, it sleeps up to eight with unique hideaway beds over the cab and kitchen tables that transform into sleeping accommodations with a few simple steps. They have kitchens, dining areas and bathrooms. Prices range from $60,000 to $200,000.

Do your research

Choosing the right RV to rent or buy depends on your family’s needs, says Mahony at Go RVing Canada. “Are you going out on the open road every single weekend? Are you going south of the border in winter? If so, a motorized [RV] might be handy.”

However, if you have an SUV or a pickup truck, you might want to consider a travel trailer, which offers more RV for less money. Roughly 70 per cent of buyers choose that option, Mahony says.

If you’re buying an RV, he advises you to figure out what you can afford, understand your family’s needs and work with a reputable dealer because you’ll have a continuing relationship with them for service, storage and maintenance. Make sure you understand the details of ownership – including warranty, maintenance, storage, insurance and usage – before you buy. The Recreational Vehicle Dealers Association of Canada is a good place to start to find a certified dealer, he says.

If you’re thinking of renting, he says to do your research and calculate the extra fees for campgrounds, fuel and insurance. Insurance may cost extra or be rolled into the rental price. Typically, an average 7.5-metre Class C vehicle, the most popular motorhome to rent, costs $1,500-$2,000 a week, he says, and comes fully equipped with dishes, glasses, pots, pans, towels and bedding. Travel trailers usually cost $500-$800 a week. Don’t forget to ask what the rental price includes and whether there are any mileage restrictions or additional charges, he advises. Most RV rentals require a standard class-G driver’s licence unless the vehicle has air brakes, and all drivers must be at least 21 years old.

Lastly, Mahoney says, take advantage of valuable online resources to map out your vacation route. The Parks Canada website is a good place to start. It could spur a new appreciation of the country we call home.

However, visit any hiking trailhead in your area, and you’re likely to the same kind of people driving either one of these machines, outfitted with sturdy boots and wearing bright GoreTex.

Looks

Outback

Open this photo in gallery The Outback maintains the utilitarian styling that has defined the model since its debut in 1994. Brendan McAleer/The Globe and Mail

When it first debuted in 1994, the Outback offered an alternative to hulking great SUVs. What it did not attempt to offer is attractive styling, and this latest model is similarly utilitarian. It looks like what it is: a mid-sized wagon with a lifted suspension and some body cladding. If this car could wear cargo shorts and sandals, it would.

In a world where every other crossover comes with a huge grille that looks like it would make julienne fries out of a moose, the Subaru's chunky silhouette is honest. This being the Outdoor model, aimed at younger buyers, there's some blacked-out trim for a sportier appearance. It's a hiking shoe on wheels, and the better for it.

If the Outback is the proto-mammal that presaged the rise of car-based crossovers in popularity, then the 4Runner is a dinosaur. Here, in white, it looks like a cross between a Star Wars stormtrooper and a Tonka truck.

Fat tires on dark 17-inch wheels add to the 4Runner’s sandbox-ready appearance, and a roof basket and metal step-rails finish things off in rugged style. It looks basically the same as it has for the last decade.

Interior

Outback

The Outback’s exterior doesn’t appear to have changed much over the previous model, but the inside is an immediate departure. The “wow” factor is the huge 11.6-inch touch screen, which is quick and functional. Having said that, the trend of having large screens in vehicles is regrettable. They’re distracting. Happily, Subaru’s fitted redundant knobs and buttons for no-look operation.

The Outdoor variant gets a rubbery material covering the seats that is ideal for repelling the various detritus that young children seem to give off. There’s plenty of space for fully-grown kids, too, and the overall quality is a cut above a similarly optioned Forester.

4Runner

The Toyota's interior doesn't surprise with high-tech features, but is, instead, pretty much the same as it was ten years ago. It looks dated, and a little cheap and plasticky.

It's also hugely likeable. No, the 4Runner doesn't have a gee-whiz screen, but it gives off the sense that everything in here will still be functioning perfectly in twenty years, no matter what abuse you heap on it. It's old-school Toyota simplicity at its best.

Performance

Outback

Open this photo in gallery The Outback is surprisingly competent off-road. Brendan McAleer/The Globe and Mail

Previous versions of the Outback were available with either a normally-aspirated boxer four-cylinder engine or a wonderfully smooth flat-six. The latter has been now replaced with a 2.4-litre turbocharged four. It doesn’t have anything close to the character of the six, but it offers plenty of torque for passing and climbing hills.

Story continues below advertisement

The suspension is soft, but body roll is very well controlled, and the Outback is an ideal highway companion. If your drive to the campsite is a long slog on the freeway followed by an hour of gravel roads, the Subaru will have you still feeling fresh when you get there. It's a bit nimbler than the outgoing model, and the added low-end grunt is excellent.

Off-road, the Outback is surprisingly competent. Rutted tracks, mud, or dry and sandy conditions are shrugged off with ease. Subaru's X-mode simplifies everything to the point that not much experience is necessary to traverse some seriously gnarly terrain. For ordinary explorers, there's little that the Outback won't be able to handle.

4Runner

Open this photo in gallery The 4Runner is nearly unstoppable on off-road terrain. Brendan McAleer/The Globe and Mail

While the Toyota Tacoma benefits from a new V6 and a six-speed automatic transmission, the 4Runner is still stomping around with a fairly outdated powertrain. It feels ponderous on the road, and really requires a good stomp on the throttle to get up to highway speeds.

This is a capital-T Truck and doesn’t apologize about it. It neither rides nor handles like a car, and the fuel economy isn’t great. Most of the time, you’ll look down at the speedometer to find out you’re driving slower than you think.

But that's the 4Runner's character, and it's again very likeable and charming. You have to really want the driving experience of a truck to own one of these, but the experience is honest.

Off-road, the 4Runner is nearly unstoppable. Yes, there’s selectable terrain management, but the bones of this truck are what’s important. The 4Runner is one of the few remaining body-on-frame SUVs with a proper low-range four-wheel-drive gearbox. It quite literally jumped through the pubbles and ruts on some lonely forestry service roads, and I wasn’t surprised that the only other vehicle I came across was also a 4Runner.

Technology

Outback

Part of what makes any Subaru a strong contender as a family-friendly offering is the brand’s consistently strong safety ratings. The Outback comes with a camera-based driver-assist system that can help prevent or mitigate collisions, and also includes lane-keeping assist to make long drives less of a chore. It also appears to be more resistant to poor weather conditions than bumper-mounted radar systems.

There's also a very handy front camera that can be used when maneuvering offroad, or just when squeaking into a narrow parking spot.

4Runner

Toyota’s safety systems aren’t quite as complex as Subaru’s assists, but the 4Runner does now come with automated cruise control and forward-collision mitigation. It also has automatic high-beam headlights.

Cargo

Outback

Not only does the Outback have a much faster power tailgate this year, but the Outdoor variant comes with a proper full-size spare wheel. The rear tonneau cover can be retracted with a push, and the hatch opens even when you have your hands full. The swing-away crossbars for the roof rack are a clever solution for carrying larger objects. With the seats up, there’s 920 L of space for gear.

The 4Runner’s rated 255 L of space is a lot less than the Outback, but it’s not quite so cut and dried. For one thing, the Toyota is one of the few vehicles you can get with a retracting rear window, meaning you can stack the trunk right to the brim or hang a pair of mountain bikes out the back. There’s no power liftgate here, which fits the 4Runner’s truck-not-crossover image, but is certainly something owners have been asking for.

The verdict

Outback

As a more polished version of a popular car, the Outback is a smash hit. With the possible exception of the too-large touch screen, everything about the big Subaru wagon is as likeable as a labradoodle. It’s got plenty of utility, is flexible for everyday use and doesn’t fall flat when the going gets rough. You probably don’t need any more car than this.

4Runner

Open this photo in gallery The 4Runner Venture remains something of a crude throwback but charming nonetheless. Brendan McAleer/The Globe and Mail

But perhaps what you don’t need, you still want. The 4Runner, like the Jeep Wrangler, has more off-road prowess than most owners will ever fully exploit. It’s a bit crude on the road and feels very old-fashioned. It’s something of a throwback and a less sensible choice than the Subaru. And yet it’s charming, really good fun to drive and even makes some practical sense because of its great resale. It’s not the smart choice between the two, but if you grew up playing with Tonka trucks, the good news is that Toyota will still sell you a full-size one.

Nothing says summer like a Ford Mustang convertible. It’s the ideal ride for nostalgic baby boomers looking to recapture their youth. The iconic Mustang is retro in its design, yet modern and muscular with high-tech features and an affordable price tag.

The base convertible, powered by a 2.3-litre turbocharged EcoBoost four-cylinder engine, starts at $32,080. Personally, I’d skip it and move up the ladder to the GT trim. At $47,805, it gets a powerful 5.0-litre V8 engine with 460 horsepower and 420 lb.-ft. of torque. It even comes with a six-speed manual transmission. A 10-speed automatic is optional. There’s also room for four adults and 324 litres of cargo space.

Be careful opening the two long doors. In tight parking spots, it will be easy to ding other vehicles.

2020 Mazda MX-5

Open this photo in gallery Petrina Gentile/The Globe and Mail

If you’re single or a newlywed with no baggage – meaning kids or pets – the Mazda MX-5 is a cute, compact two-seat roadster that spells serious summer fun. Top up or down, it’s attractive from every angle. It’s also lightweight, nimble, well-balanced and sporty, thanks to its 2.0-litre inline four-cylinder engine with 181 horsepower and 151 lb.-ft. of torque driving the rear wheels.

The soft top with a glass rear window is easy to open or close. But if you prefer a hardtop, go for the MX-5 RF, short for Retractable Fastback. Its power roof opens and closes in less than 15 seconds.

Trunk space is tight with only 130 litres of capacity, so stick to short, quick day trips. Prices start at $33,100 for the MX-5 GS RWD with a six-speed manual. The MX-5 RF starts at $40,100.

2020 Jeep Wrangler

Open this photo in gallery Petrina Gentile/The Globe and Mail

For thrill-seeking millennials eager to get off the beaten track, the Jeep Wrangler won’t disappoint. Its go-anywhere, off-road capability adds fun to the mix by transforming from an SUV to a quasi-convertible. The roof and doors come off and the windshield folds down for a true open-air experience. Sure, it takes elbow grease, time and patience to remove the roof and doors, but once that’s done, you’re basking in the sun with the wind in your hair. Plus, it’s a true off-roader, able to tackle anything in its path from water fording to rock climbing.

Prices start at $36,295 for the two-door Wrangler Sport. Skip the two-door models and go for a four-door – it’s more practical and easier to get into the back seats.

Porsche 718 Boxster

Open this photo in gallery Petrina Gentile/The Globe and Mail

Porsches aren’t cheap, but they definitely make a bold statement on the road. The mid-engine 718 Boxster has a new GTS 4.0 trim for 2021 – it’s ideal if you’re recently divorced or going through a midlife crisis and want to turn heads. With serious power, two cozy seats, rear-wheel drive, and a soft-top roof that opens or closes in less than 10 seconds, it’s a hit.

At its heart is a four-litre six-cylinder boxer engine with 394 horsepower and 309 lb.-ft. of torque. It’s powerful and fast, hitting 100 kilometres an hour in only 4.5 seconds. Add a vibrant shade of green or blue and you’ll be impossible to miss. Keep in mind, there’s little room for luggage – the frunk, or front trunk, has enough room for a purse. Prices start at $96,900.

Tesla Model Y

Open this photo in gallery David Zalubowski/The Associated Press

For eco-conscious families who want to go green, an electric vehicle like the Tesla Model Y fits the bill. Smaller than Tesla’s Model X SUV, the Model Y has traditional doors – no gimmicky rear-rising gull-wings. It seats five, but a seven-seat version is expected later this year.

The electric range is impressive. The all-wheel-drive long-range model can travel up to 509 kilometres and go from zero to 100 kilometres an hour in 4.8 seconds. Tesla’s supercharger network system, which makes charging fast and easy on the road, is expanding across Canada. The stations let you recharge the battery quickly – restoring about 275 kilometres of range in 15 minutes. Currently, Tesla has about 155 supercharger stations in Canada, most of them in Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia. Prices start at $68,600.

2021 Toyota Sienna

Shocked to see a minivan on this list? Usually minivans aren’t “cool,” but the 2021 Toyota Sienna is an exception. Inside, an optional refrigerator not only keeps beverages cold, it can keep ice cream frozen, too. After the kids make a mess inhaling their cones and other goodies, a built-in vacuum cleaner makes cleanups quick and effortless. It also has a larger rear-entertainment system, 18 cupholders, seven USB keys and 10 airbags.

Getting inside is easier, too. Open or close the rear sliding doors by kicking under the door – no key required. The second-row captain’s chairs also slide forward and back by up to 25 inches for extra room to stretch out. Prices aren’t available yet. But it goes on sale later this year.

The term “dooring” has become legendary among cyclists and drivers alike. The fine itself was always thought by many to be far too low, considering the potential damage to relatively innocent cyclists.

article continues below

The fine has been raised to $368, as of Sept. 21 this year. This is good news. Finally, after decades of associated groups lobbying, there has been a politician who not only listened, but also acted.

The injuries sustained by a cyclist crashing into an open motor vehicle door can be fatal, but are more often serious than minor. Damage to the bike is of much less importance than to the rider.

David Eby, in his role as attorney-general and minister responsible for ICBC, made the announcement about a week ago. This increased fine, coupled with the same penalty point assessment, may be a wake-up call for all drivers.

Using the Dutch Reach, when the right arm is used to open the driver's door, will give all drivers a better angle to spot cyclists approaching from the left side blind spot.

This regulation, and associated fine, is a complete anomaly, as compared to the rest of the Motor Vehicle Act. It is the only time, except for the own lane head-on crash, that a driver can smash into another vehicle and remain blameless. That is right, blameless! Because traffic of all types is at the mercy of person opening the vehicle door, it has been deemed the responsibility of the driver, or any passenger, to look for hazards before opening the vehicle door.

Many drivers are surprised to learn they are 100 per cent at fault, when this type of crash occurs. Furthermore, passengers may also be held liable, if they open a vehicle door and a crash takes place.

It is best to allow passengers to exit the vehicle at the sidewalk location immediately beside the vehicle. This works well, even in a one-way street configuration. Children and unlicensed riders should never exit into traffic. They are often oblivious to the danger of all types of lateral movement.

Now that the minister responsible has taken definitive action against “dooring,” it may be time to take a good look at the paltry fine of $30 for not wearing a bike helmet. Police are reluctant to get out of their vehicles to enforce such an offence, particularly when there are other higher priorities.

Given that the above-mentioned fine of “dooring” has increased about four-fold, it is probably time to do the same with the fine for a helmet violation for cyclists. A sum of $120 would be more like it. Who could argue with it? Or perhaps the fine for a cyclist without a helmet should be about the same as a driver or passenger without a seatbelt.

It is good to see so many cyclists pedalling back and forth. It means fewer motor vehicles on our roads, a healthier population and an environmental advantage.

How long will it be before the cycle crowd becomes the cash cow for government, in the same way motor vehicles have funded all sorts of endeavours?

There are other unanswered questions.

Will there be a special tax on electric vehicles, given they have caused a loss of gas tax revenue?

Will motorized cycles or standard cycles be taxed at the same rate as traditional motorcycles?

Will there be a universal road tax for all users, regardless of the mode of travel?

Will certain cyclists be required to insure, test and register?

The future may well be financial, as opposed to friendly.

Crosley, Jr. of Cincinnati, Ohio, became so appalled at the high prices charged for radios he vowed to do something about it. In co-operation with some University of Cincinnati engineering students, he developed a low-priced radio, and established a plant to manufacture it. His timing was perfect; widespread broadcasting was just beginning.

By the early 1920s, Crosley Radio Corp. was the world's largest radio maker with its own station WLW in Cincinnati. Crosley expanded into appliances and his Shelvador refrigerator pioneered shelves in doors. Avid baseball fan Crosley bought the Cincinnati Reds who played in Crosley Field.

In the 1930s, Crosley revived a dream of producing a light, economical car.

He had his engineers design a tiny two-door, four-passenger model 3,048 millimetres (120 inch) long with a 2,032 mm (80 in.) wheelbase. It weighed only 420 kilogram (925 pound) and had a two-cylinder 0.6 litre (39 cu in.) air-cooled, 15 horsepower Waukesha engine. Things like tube-and-fabric seats, hand-operated wipers, sliding windows and no flexible engine mounts kept the price at $250.

The Crosley was introduced in the spring of 1939 and marketed through Crosley dealerships and appliance stores. By year’s end, more than 2,000 were sold.

Mechanical problems reduced 1940 sales to 422, so Crosley’s new chief engineer, Paul Klotsch, added engine mounts and other improvements for better durability.

Sales revived, and when the Second World War ended, car production in 1942, 3,300 Crosleys had been produced.

Crosley’s war projects included building small, sheet metal, inline four-cylinder engines for navy generating sets. Crosley obtained patent rights to the engine.

When peace came in 1945 Crosley sold controlling interest in the radio/appliance business to concentrate on Cincinnati-based Crosley Motors Inc. and its Marion, Indiana, plant.

The heart of Crosley’s postwar cars was the new engine made of sheet metal stampings and thin-walled steel cylinder tubes brazed together with copper in a furnace. Called the COBRA engine, for COpper BRAzed, it was designed by California sheet metal engine specialist Lloyd Taylor and weighed a feathery 26.8 kg without starter or generator.

With single overhead camshaft and oversquare bore and stroke of 63.5 by 57.1 mm (2.50 by 2.25 in.) it displaced 725 cc (44 cu in.) and developed 26.5 horsepower at a high 5,000 rpm. Its five-bearing crankshaft rotated in an aluminum crankcase.

Crosley kept the previous 2,032 mm (80 in.) wheelbase but increased length to 3,683 mm (145 in.) and weight to 522 kg (1,150 lb).

Production began in mid-1946 and by year's end a car-starved market absorbed 4,987 two-door sedans and some convertibles and pickups. Sales increased to almost 20,000 in 1947 and over 31,000 in 1948, including some 23,000 station wagons, the world’s largest wagon producer. It was Crosley’s best year.

Serious problems surfaced when electrolysis corroded holes in the engine, causing coolant to leak out or enter the crankcase with disastrous results. Klotsch designed a new sturdier and quieter CIBA (Cast Iron Block Assembly) block with cylinder head integral with the block, not removable. Although retrofitted to many cars, Crosley’s reputation was tarnished.

Crosley offered more contemporary styling in 1949, and also introduced Hydradisc four-wheel disc brakes, the first production car with four-wheel, calliper-type discs. After some problems Crosley returned to drums in mid-1950.

Crosley pioneered his 1949 Hotshot sports car which in spite of its tiny engine provided surprising performance. Mechanix Illustrated's Tom McCahill reported zero to 97 km/h (60 mph) in 28.1 seconds and top speed of 119 km/h (74 mph) for the 499 kg (1100 lb) roadster.

The successor Super Sport with 10.0:1 compression ratio reduced zero to 97 (60) to 19.7 seconds and raised top speed of 124 km/h (77 mph).

McCahill was more impressed with Crosley’s engine than with the rest of the car, calling their $1,000 sports car a “tin tub on wheels with a fine engine.”

Crosley “won” the first Sebring, Florida, race in 1950 on an Index of Performance formula calculation, not speed. A Crosley special also ran well in the 1951 LeMans, France, 24-hour race until its French generator failed.

In 1950, Crosley introduced its small, versatile, Jeep-type, dual purpose Farm-O-Road for road and light agricultural use. It had a 1,600 mm (63 in.) wheelbase, six forward speeds and two reverse. Options included dump or pickup boxes and dual wheels.

Engine problems and a changing market reduced Crosley sales to just over 7,400 sales in 1949 and 6,800 in 1950. Although the end was near, Crosley’s 1951 sales held at 6,600. This was below breakeven and Powel Crosley’s automotive dream ended in 1952 after producing just over 2,000 1952 models.

Powel Crosley Jr. died in 1961 at the age of 74, his success with radios and appliances having failed to transfer to cars.",773,0.9075294804736991,business

It won't be in May, it won't be in front of hundreds of thousands of fans, and many of the other rituals associated with the race will be altered due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

But Kellett still got to take in one of the traditions.

""One cool thing that they did do is every year they rename the streets downtown with the drivers' last names,"" said Kellet. ""So there's a street called Kellett Avenue in downtown Indianapolis right now. I went down and took a picture of that the other day.""

The 26-year-old noted that most of the race's traditions revolve around spectators and fan interaction, which he said he considers a real loss for this year's Indy 500. However, he's still looking forward to the pre-race process should he qualify for the race on Saturday.

""Lining up the cars on the front straightaway, 11 rows of three, the pageantry, the history behind the race, it's what makes you realize how big an event it is,"" said Kellett.

Kellett, from Stouffville, Ont., is in the midst of his rookie IndyCar season, albeit one that has been shortened and re-arranged by the COVID-19 pandemic. He's competed in three races so far this season, the GMR Grand Prix (21st) and Road America (20th in both races).

""I think given the lack of track time and testing I'm content with what we've done so far,"" said Kellett. ""Obviously, we want to be competing a little bit further up the course on the road course but I think that will just be a process of learning and getting up to speed with everything.

Practice laps continued on so-called ""Fast Friday"" as IndyCar gives teams a horsepower boost to increase speeds. Fellow Canadian James Hinchcliffe of Oakville, Ont., was seventh overall after Marco Andretti posted the fastest Friday lap since 1996 to finish the day first overall.

""Coming into today with the extra boost there were a lot of unknowns, but it was awesome to get out there and start knocking out 230’s from the first run,"" said Hinchcliffe, whose time was 38.7987 seconds. ""We ran through our program , and I think we made some good progress.""

Kellett was 28th with a time of 39.2844 seconds.

""Just finished up my first Fast Friday. I feel like I can finally breathe now. It was a long day of qualifying runs,"" said Kellett. ""I think we’ve got a good compromise between outright speed and also just having the car for the entire four laps.""

Qualifying will be on Saturday with the race itself on Aug. 23. Should he qualify to race, it will be a dream come true for Kellett, whose favourite Indy 500 moment was when Jacques Villeneuve of Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Que., won in 1995.

""It would be the biggest race of my career and the culmination of a lot of years of hard work coming through the junior ranks,"" Kellett said. ""It would be a big moment. I can't emphasize enough how exciting it would be to be in the field of 33 and represent Canada and represent A.J. Foyt racing.""

The automaker says that depending on the vans or SUV, it may need one or more of four free repairs, including two software updates, replacement of rear view camera and replacement of sliding door outer handle cables.

There have been no reports of crashes or injuries associated with the voluntary recall, said Honda spokeswoman Laura Heasman.

The recall comes after Honda recalled 1.6 million vehicles in the U.S., citing faulty software that can stop the display of the speedometer, engine oil lights, gear positions and rear cameras.

In Odyssey minivans, water can enter the door handle cables and freeze, preventing the doors from latching, and water can also distort the rear-view camera.

The last time I drove a Grand Cherokee, its legendary off-road talents were undiminished. Back on pavement, however, I knew I was driving a design past its prime – a pleasant and comfortable SUV gently easing into mellow old age.

None of this matters in the case of the Trackhawk. This uber-Jeep is simply deranged. Its unique ingredient is so outrageous, so over-the-top manic and surreal, that normal parameters for evaluating a mid-size SUV become irrelevant. It is what it is. If its outstanding attribute speaks your language, you may never want to drive anything else. If not, go buy a Lexus RX hybrid.

The Trackhawk is the product of surgically implanting the insane supercharged V8 from a Dodge Challenger/Charger Hellcat into a Grand Cherokee SRT (as if the SRT’s 6.4 litres and 485 horsepower wasn’t enough). In its new home, the 6.2-litre Hellcat motor makes the same 707 hp as in the original Hellcats (the latter was amplified to 717 in 2019) and 645 lb.-ft. of torque (down 11 on the cars).

The Trackhawk possesses the aerodynamic properties of a brick outhouse and weighs a whopping 400 kilograms or so more than the cars, so don’t expect it to match their claimed 200-mph-plus top speeds; you may have to make do with a mere 180-mph velocity to Con College. But the Jeep does have one advantage on its hellraiser siblings: all-wheel drive. That not only makes it theoretically a four-season daily driver; it also parlays the Jeep’s weight into no-muss, no-fuss launch traction that other Hellcat drivers can only dream about.

There is a launch-control function, but the conventional torque-converter automatic doesn’t quite deliver the literally gut-wrenching step-function departure of rival uber-SUVs with automated-manual transmissions that literally “dump” the clutch. But if that costs the Jeep a tick or two in track testing, it makes it up in the real world. Boosted by a supercharger instead of most others’ turbochargers, there is simply no lag; stomp on the loud pedal and the Trackhawk explodes off the line with an instant-on immediacy that largely makes the launch-control redundant. According to Car and Driver tests, most rival uber-SUVs trail the Jeep from 0-100 km/h even using launch control; driving “normally” on the street, the Jeep’s advantage will only widen.

You want numbers? Jeep claims 0-60 mph (0-97 km/h) in a pulverizing 3.5 seconds. That computes with our measured 3.7-second runs to 100 km/h (according to the Jeep’s Performance Pages) or 3.9 seconds as independently reported by our own test equipment. Whichever way you slice it, this thing is devastatingly fast.

Here’s a different kind of number: 21.9 L/100 km. Over a COVID-curtailed week of driving (i.e., no long highway trips) and making frequent use of the right pedal, that’s what the trip showed. The Trackhawk’s 17.7 L/100 km official combined fuel consumption earns it a $3,000 federal gas-guzzler tax. Its carbon dioxide and smog ratings are both 1 out of 10.

Open this photo in gallery You'll want to keep an eye on the gas gauge when driving the Trailhawk. Jeremy Sinek/The Globe and Mail

Back to the drive, Jeep has masterfully tuned the exhaust system to make huge noise – a savage, crackling, multi-textured shrieking bellow – when you want it. And yet it leaves you in relative peace when you – or your passengers, or anyone else within a one-kilometre radius – don’t want it. When you’re just pottering, an amiable rumble is layered with random whines from the blower and the (otherwise-seamless) transmission; settle into cruise on the highway, and the tailpipe music fades into the background.

As for handling, the extensive chassis upgrades have effectively tamed the Trackhawk’s combination of weight, height and velocity, but they don’t disguise it. This isn’t one of those SUVs that shrinks around you and drives small. On the track you might marvel how well it dances for an elephant – but you still know it is an elephant.

Considerable lean builds up through long cloverleafs, and although the steering is light and precise, it’s too numb to communicate the imminence of run-wide understeer. No doubt in Track mode, which channels 70 per cent of torque to the rear, you could power the rear into a drift even on dry pavement, but you’d need to work at it – and need a safe, private place to do so.

At $113,745, the Trackhawk seems like silly money for a Jeep, until you realize that alternatives of comparable performance (all of them European) are even pricier. The next least expensive, the BMW X5 M Competition, starts at almost $130,000.

The Trackhawk may not match the all-round sophistication of the Europeans, but a Jeep badge has its own cachet, and the sound and fury of that engine will never get old. But on the subject of old, this generation of the Grand Cherokee is due for replacement real soon. Chances are there won’t be a Trackhawk version for a while, if ever, so if this unique brand of dementedness turns your crank, grab one while you can.

Open this photo in gallery Style and safety – For more than 50 years, Canadians have maintained a love affair with the Toyota Corolla. Much of it built on great style and top-line safety technology.

Few vehicles have ever measured up to the worldwide appeal of Toyota’s most iconic nameplate: the Toyota Corolla.

The Corolla has earned its appeal and loyalty among owners from the value it offers. Now with standard industry-leading safety equipment, its innovation in the safety space continues to grow.

Founded on Toyota’s commitment to help reduce traffic accidents, TSS is standard on over 95% of new Toyota vehicles. The TSS package in the Corolla includes features such as Pre-Collision System with Pedestrian Detection, Lane Departure Alert with Steering Assist, Automatic High Beams and Dynamic Radar Cruise Control. There are also eight airbags, a standard backup camera and front seats with whiplash injury-lessening headrests. In addition to this safety package, the 2019 Toyota Corolla sedan packs in standard LED daytime running lights and Display Audio that puts total command at your fingertips.

Corolla has been part of millions of Canadian lives for more than 50 years and is our all-time best-selling model. — Cyril Dimitris, vice president, Toyota Canada Inc.

Now in its 11th generation, the venerable Corolla model is one of the most iconic and popular compact cars in North America. And it is consistently one of the top-selling vehicles in Canada, accounting for about 1.5 million of the more than 40 million Corolla vehicles sold globally.

Open this photo in gallery The Corolla, now in its 11th generation, continues to draw attention and eyes.

“Corolla has been part of millions of Canadian lives for more than 50 years and is our all-time best-selling model,” said Cyril Dimitris, vice president, Toyota Canada Inc. “It’s sporty styling and handling make it fun-to-drive, while its state-of-the-art safety and legendary dependability and efficiency make it a pleasure to own.”

The Corolla has built a loyal fan-base of owners who keep returning to the brand year-after-year, thanks to things like reliability and handling, as well as first-time buyers attracted to the unique style, elaborate accents and standard safety equipment.

Margaret Schuler, of Belleville, Ontario, who now drives a Corolla, has kept coming back to Toyota.

“I’ve had a few Toyotas over the years, from the Tercel back in the 1980s to the Matrix in the 1990s, and I had a Corolla before this one too,” she explained.

“Nothing ever goes wrong with them, they are literally so reliable. The service is good too.”

She also likes the fact that the resale value holds up, due mostly to the reputation the brand carries, and the front and centre standard features included in the TSS system.

Open this photo in gallery It’s difficult to remember a Canadian road-trip when if you didn’t see a Toyota Corolla on the highway, then you were likely driving in one. Shown here is a 1969 model.

The Corolla also includes comfort and security innovations, such as the Display Audio system with SIRI Eyes-Free, Bluetooth connectivity and steering wheel-mounted controls. Then there’s the dual power adjustable seats (available on LE and SE grades only), heated exterior mirrors, power doors and windows, piano-black centre cluster accents, map lamps, and 12v power outlets for personal electronics. With cabin space for five people, the 2019 Toyota Corolla sedan is, as always, comfortable and safe, driven by the ever-reliable 1.8L four-cylinder engine that pushes a peak 132 horsepower which pops to 140 horsepower in the ECO LE model.

Strap either of those to the proven choice of manual transmission or the CVTi-S with sport mode, sequential shift mode and paddle shifters and you’re getting traction in the right direction.

A loyal fan, Ms. Schuler said when it’s time to trade-in her current Corolla, she’ll be returning to Toyota again, adding: “There are other compact cars which may look similar, but I don’t think they’re built as well as the Toyotas.”

A lot of people have been saying that for many years.

It’s why among the vehicles we love, the Corolla – always evolving – has a special place among Canadian drivers.

“Hey, what’s that?”

The middle-aged man stepping out of the pizza shop startled me as I closed the car door after parking. He was staring intently at my new ride, a 2021 Chevrolet Trailblazer in an eye-wateringly bright robin’s-egg blue. “I love the look, man. I even love the colour.”

A bit surprising, considering he didn’t seem to be part of the demographic for this subcompact crossover. I explained to him that the Trailblazer is all-new for this year, just going on sale this month, but that I couldn’t tell him much because I had just picked it up from a dealer and was on my way home. “Read about it in The Globe and Mail,” I said cheekily.

Well, sir, if you are reading this, I can tell you that you would probably like almost everything about the Trailblazer. Slotting in just above the woeful Trax in Chevrolet’s SUV portfolio, the Trailblazer mimics its Blazer big brother in styling, and in a week of city driving and over a good return highway haul between Toronto and Kingston, I grew more and more impressed with it.

The pizza guy is right, too; it is an attractive little car. More angular and boxy than others in the class, this RS version also has an aggressive grille that could remind you of a Camaro. If you squint.

But it’s the performance that will win over drivers. The base engine is a 1.2-litre three-cylinder coupled to a continuously variable transmission, but this RS has a 1.3-litre three-cylinder with a nine-speed automatic. That may sound tiny, but it packs 155 horsepower and 174 lb.-ft. of torque. In both city and highway travel, it proved more than peppy and seemed happy with spirited driving. The transmission is smooth, though with a stab of the throttle from lower speeds, it takes more than a second to jump down gears and get going.

Open this photo in gallery The cloth seats are tight but comfortable. Neil Vorano/The Globe and Mail

However, the Trailblazer, especially in top trims, has a bit of a price problem. The $23,698 base price of the LS is on the higher side compared with its subcompact rivals. The LS, with its 1.2-litre engine and standard front-wheel drive (all-wheel drive is optional), lacks some basic standard equipment such as cruise control and a cargo cover. Stepping up to the LT is probably what most people will do, as it’s the best value of the lot with a few more driver aids and comfort features.

The top-tier RS and Activ, both AWD, share the same base price, but here’s the problem: My RS tester, with added Sun and Liftgate package, Convenience package, Technology package and red metallic interior inserts, is a whopping $35,578. Add in freight and taxes, and it’s close to the $40,000 mark. Only the Honda HR-V approaches that price, and it’s thousands more than others in the subcompact-crossover class.

Regardless, this little Chevrolet in its bright-blue paint won over quite a few people, including myself and the pizza guy. With good looks, better-than-average performance and a host of available features, it can be a standout addition to the crowded subcompact crossover segment.

Looks

It’s a winner here, swapping swoopy lines for sharp angles, and the grille configuration with its hexagonal inserts in black gloss has a high-end look. The black plastic cladding is just enough to suggest a more rugged attitude without looking cheap, while the 18-inch alloy wheels add a touch of urban style.

Interior

Open this photo in gallery Rear-seat legroom is best-in-class. Neil Vorano/The Globe and Mail

The Trailblazer has a well-designed and attractive interior, though some panels are still hard plastic. The RS trim has contrasting stitching on the cloth seats, which are a bit tight but still comfortable. The controls are ergonomic, and the cockpit even gets a D-shaped steering wheel. Seats are a bit tight, but legroom for both front and rear passengers is good. Front passengers have ample space, while rear passenger legroom is best-in-class.

Performance

The 1.3-litre is surprisingly peppy, even on the highway, where getting to passing speed is relatively quick after a brief pause for turbo lag. It’s in town that the delay of the nine-speed transmission kicking down a gear is noticeable and sometimes a little disconcerting, especially if you’re making a left turn through an intersection. The ride is decently sprung, but steering is numb and overboosted.

Tech

Open this photo in gallery A small Chevy logo shows where to wave your foot to trigger the automatic lift gate. Neil Vorano/The Globe and Mail

The LS and LT get quite a few standard driver-assist features such as automatic forward braking, but the RS is fully loaded with many more, including adaptive cruise control and creature comforts such as automatic climate control, eight-inch touch screen and a panoramic sunroof. A small Chevrolet logo is projected on the ground to show you where to swing your foot to activate the automatic lift gate. Of course, you do get what you pay for.

Cargo

Open this photo in gallery The rear seats drop in a 60/40 configuration. Neil Vorano/The Globe and Mail

Overall, the Trailblazer has a respectable 1,540 litres of cargo volume. Not only do the rear seats fold in a 60/40 configuration, but the front passenger seat folds almost flat to accommodate longer items such as a kayak.

The verdict

While the Chevrolet Trailblazer RS is loaded with features, has surprisingly good power and a comfy ride, this one is just too expensive for a subcompact crossover. My money would be with the Trailblazer LT AWD with the 1.3-litre engine.

Prior to my recent purchase of a 2019 Mini Cooper S Countryman ALL4, both my vehicles had been painted a simple, classic black. I liked the understated, time-honoured look. There are those who believe that black is the only appropriate colour for a car. One reason is that black cars look good in every kind of weather and even, as Canadian superstar singer Gino Vannelli observed, “better in the shade.”

A lot of drivers feel the same way; over fifty per cent of the cars on the road are shades of grey and black.

So when I decided to turn in my 2010 Dodge Grand Caravan, I chose to go with something sporty. I wanted a car that looked playful and a little off the wall. I considered many hues: British Racing Green, Chili Red and Chestnut Brown. Ultimately, I went with Island Blue Metallic. I also added a white top and white racing stripes. My new ride would be fun to drive and fun to see.

Story continues below advertisement

It didn’t take long for me to realize that it was, indeed, a very notable vehicle. So notable in fact, that I had become “that guy.” As in, “that guy in the tropical-blue striped Mini.” (It is possible that instead of “guy,” people use more descriptive language to identify me.)

When you drive a unique-looking car, it quickly becomes clear that you have kissed off any semblance of anonymity. Occasionally, I’ll see another Island Blue Metallic 2019 Mini Cooper S Countryman ALL4 with white racing stripes – but not often.

The experience has shown me that anonymity, or at least the sense of anonymity that automobiles create, is the foundation on which most poor driving is anchored. When you lose your anonymity, you must take responsibility for your actions.

When you drive an easily identifiable vehicle, road rage is out of the question. For me, that hasn’t been an issue. I’m not a yeller. Credit the advice of my late uncle Tom Jamieson, who once explained, as he navigated Bayview Avenue and was cut off by a sedan, “If you get angry every time some other guy does something stupid on the road, you’ll lose your mind.” In my old black minivan, I could have gotten away with screaming the occasional anatomy lesson at a fellow motorist. In my tropical blue Mini, I will be remembered. It would be embarrassing, and perhaps a little dangerous, to roll around engaging in road rage, only to be called out in the parking lot of some grocery store by the irate objects of my ire.

In the same way that I am resented for driving transgressions, I am appreciated for driving favours. When possible, I accommodate other drivers. If someone needs to nose into the lane and I can facilitate, I will. Driving my Mini has increased this predilection. If I’m called out in the parking lot of our local grocery store, it’s going to be a friendly wave.

If we are searching for easy, low-tech ways to improve driving habits, we may want to consider incentives for those who opt to make their cars more personal. Why not give a cash rebate to the driver who willingly paints his or her first name on their vehicle? After all, you are much more likely to be a courteous driver if you have “Jennifer” written in bold letters across the side of your Honda Civic.

Why won’t dealerships provide discounts for unique exteriors? In 2016, Dodge offered the psychedelic “Go Mango” hue for its 2016 Dodge Challenger and Dodge Charger SRT models. Why not bring that back on all models? Why not Lantana Purple, Hakone Green, Indy Yellow Pearl? What about a discount on insurance for anyone who is willing to have a digital reproduction of their face printed on the hood of their Ford Fusion?

Of course, if everyone gets weird, then being dull will stand out.

What’s the point of painting your Mini Island Blue Metallic with white stripes or your Challenger “Go Mango” if everyone is doing it?

While the modern hybrid vehicle seems like a relatively new invention, it’s been on the scene for two decades.

The first hybrid sold in North America was the original Honda Insight, which debuted in December 1999. It was revolutionary: a compact hatchback with slick aerodynamics and an advanced hybrid powertrain that consumed just 4.4 litres of fuel per 100 kilometres (4.4 L/100 km) in combined driving.

Since breaking the mold at the start of the millennium, the engineers at Honda have spent the past 20 years perfecting the hybrid powertrain, with models such as the Honda Civic Hybrid (2001 to 2015), the original Honda Accord Hybrid (2005 to 2007) and the Honda CR-Z (2010 to 2016). These vehicles used a different version of the manufacturer’s Integrated Motor Assist (IMA) system, in which an electric motor is mounted between the internal combustion engine (ICE) and the transmission.

Car buyers loved them. By the end of 2012, Honda had sold a million hybrid-powered vehicles around the world. Since then, the Honda hybrid fleet has gone from strength to strength, unveiling better technology, increased efficiency, and more bang for the buck.

For the new model year, Canadians have three Honda hybrids to choose from, with the 2020 Honda Clarity Plug-In Hybrid, the 2020 Honda Accord Hybrid and the 2020 Honda Insight Hybrid.

Some auto makers are pursuing all-electric vehicles in an effort to meet increasingly stringent, government-mandated fleet emissions standards around the world. Honda has dedicated itself to reducing emissions for decades, so the company is able to take a different path.

A 2019 report from Environment & Climate Change Canada bears this out. Based on 2017 data, it identifies the Honda Canada fleet as having the best overall fuel economy in the industry, and lower-than-average CO2 emissions among ICE manufacturers.

At Honda, the focus is on the present and the future. For now, the goal is to continue to provide Canadians with vehicles that are well-engineered, fuel-efficient and fun to drive. No matter which model drives off the lot, it will be a leader in terms of its carbon footprint, without compromising on any of the other qualities for which Honda is renowned. Honda owners also have the comfort of knowing they’re taking steps toward reducing their own carbon footprint.

As for the future? As Honda pursues even greener numbers across the board, two-thirds of its global vehicle sales will be electrified by the year 2030. Some models will be electric vehicles (EVs), while others will be hybrids. Honda has the luxury of being able to take a measured approach to introducing next-generation electrified powertrains – putting them on the road only when they’re fully proven.

Even the best EVs demand some form of compromise. For certain all-electric vehicles, range is still a concern, higher price points are limiting, and there are the logistics of charging to consider. But when you’re behind the wheel of a hybrid engineered by a company with decades of experience in electrification, there is no compromise.

2020 Honda Accord Hybrid

The Accord Hybrid shines a spotlight on the third-generation version of Honda’s innovative two-motor hybrid powertrain. The result: a high-performing sedan that is also highly efficient. Drivers can leave all the heavy lifting to the Electric-Continuously Variable Transmission (E-CVT), which seamlessly manages the connection between the motors and the ICE. Or they can take control with one of three driver-selectable modes: Sport Drive, ECON or EV. The steering wheel-mounted deceleration paddles give the driver another measure of control, allowing him or her to adjust the rate or stopping power while simultaneously charging the battery. The Accord Hybrid is the no-compromises sport sedan that combines winning style and world-class performance.

The Mercedes-Benz GLS has long been my favourite specimen of my least-favourite species. As a green-leaning gearhead, I prefer my cars small, agile and efficient (my daily-driver dream car would be a Volkswagen e-Golf with GTI suspension). But if ever someone gifted me a full-size luxury SUV, I’d have hoped for a GLS.

Offering all the status of a Mercedes, yet half a size smaller and nimbler than key rivals and previously boasting a fuel-frugal diesel option, it came closer than any of its peers to matching my values.”

Redesigned last year, the new-generation GLS has gotten bigger. But its American competitors have too, so it’s still relatively handy in size – at 5,207 mm long, closer to a BMW X7 than a Lincoln Navigator. The diesel option fell victim to the VW TDI-gate scandal years ago, however, leaving two turbocharged gasoline engine options for 2020 – a 3.0-litre inline six in the GLS 450, a 4.0-litre V8 in the GLS 580, both with 48V electric-assist mild-hybrid technology.

Our first exposure to the new GLS last year demonstrated its off-road capability in Utah (a so-called Enhanced Towing Package adds, among other items, a dual-range transfer case and underside protection for some serious off-road cred). This time, we spent a week just tooling around the Toronto area.

Although still recognizably a GLS, the new shape’s softer contours are arguably less distinctive than its sharper-creased predecessor. Wheels start at a large 21 inches, and go up to 23s. Our GLS 580 test sample (base price $117,300) was on optional 22s and decked-out with premium-seating, technology and inteilligent-drive packages for a total MSRP of $133,500.

Most of the upsizing has benefitted the second row, creating expansive legroom with the seats (a choice of 60:40 bench or captain’s chairs) fully back. The aforementioned premium-rear-seating package adds five-zone climate control, second-row MBUX tablet and wireless charging, and more.

Legroom remans ample even with the second-row seats fully forward, which they need to be to get adults into the back. Even then, I could only just fit my 172-cm frame back there with my knees together, albeit in reasonable comfort; methinks Mercedes’s claim that there’s room for an adult up to 194 cm (6-foot-4) in the third row must involve widely splayed knees.

Passage to the third row is less encumbered than in most SUVs, though the second-row seat is slow to power out of the way and leaves exposed seat rails that could threaten your feet.

Both rows of rear seats can be power folded. The resulting deck isn’t perfectly flat, but according to Mercedes data, there is meaningfully more cargo room (now 470 L), behind the third row while seats-folded volumes have grown minimally. Competitive comparisons are clouded by varying measuring methodologies, but it’s safe to say the GLS matches or beats European and Japanese rivals but is out-volumed by the Americans. A Class-III tow hitch is standard, and the tow rating is 3,500 kilograms.

Up front, it’s easy to tailor a throne-like posture with commanding visibility, if you can take your eyes off the Mercedes-signature super-wide screen that comprises the virtual gauge cluster and the interface for MBUX (Mercedes-Benz User Experience infotainment system). The latter can be interfaced by direct touch or via a separate touch pad, and there are still plenty of physical buttons for most basic functions. I never did figure out, though, how to adjust the (optional) head-up display. Also requiring a learning curve is the slender stalk on the right of the steering column: it’s the gear selector, not a wiper switch.

If you’re looking for an SUV that drives like an S-Class limo, the powertrain gets closer than the chassis. Performance delivered by the 483-horsepower V8 merits the “iron fist in a velvet glove” metaphor. In track mode, Mercedes claims 0-100 km/h in an assertive 5.3 seconds; in cruise, ninth gear delivers 120 km/h at a serene, loping 1,650 rpm. Even with a boost from the electric motor, however, there is still a hint of lag below 2,500 rpm. And fuel consumption – 15 L/100 km in our hands – won’t win any Green Car awards.

On the standard air-spring suspension, the chassis impressed us more for its handling (surprisingly wieldy and engaging for its size and weight) than for its ride, which seemed better controlled in Dynamic mode than Comfort but still occasionally sent shudders through the structure. Perhaps smaller wheels and/or the optional active suspension would deliver a suppler ride.

Open this photo in gallery Name a driver-assist technology, and it's probably available on the GLS. Jeremy Sinek/The Globe and Mail

Let’s not even try to list all the infotainment, connectivity and driver-assist technologies: it’s a high-end Mercedes, so suffice to say that if the feature isn’t standard or available, it probably hasn’t been invented yet. That all said, for us the technology was sometimes more annoying than assistive. The voice control occasionally responded to commands we had not made yet took repeated attempts to execute a simple “dial number” request. And the driver-assist technologies were sometimes over-reactive – shrieking alarm at the hydrangeas bordering my driveway – or intervened for no apparent reason. Perhaps we would have been better off without the test sample’s optional MBUX Interior Assistant (basically, gesture control) and the Intelligent Drive package that pushes the envelope of almost-autonomous driving.

Technology niggles aside, it’s tough to top the sense of security and well-being you experience at the wheel of this high-and-mighty Mercedes. And notwithstanding our twinges of guilt at the gas pump (R.I.P. the diesel), it still represents the classy “old money” alternative in a peer group of mostly bling-dripping nouveau-riche status symbols.

In a luxury landscape now overrun with SUVs, it would appear that the drivers who still choose to drive cars are still in it for the actual driving experience.

That certainly seemed to be Lexus’s thinking when it reworked its IS compact luxury sports sedan (read: BMW 3 Series rival) for 2021. Its presentation of the update – which had its public unveiling on Facebook at 7 p.m. today – is dominated by an emphasis on driving dynamics.

“Agility and athleticism expand pure driving performance,” says the press-release headline. Or, as chief engineer Naoki Kobayashi terms it, “what we had foremost in mind in developing the new IS was to make it a car that excelled in communicating with the driver regardless of the road conditions or driving situation.”

Not only does the new IS itself promise a more engaging, tactile driving experience, it also marks the debut of Lexus Driving Signature, which means the same driving traits will eventually be common to the whole Lexus lineup. Contributing to that goal will be a new 5.3-kilometre test course in Shimoyama, Japan, that was inspired by the famed Nurburgring race track in Germany.

Getting down to specifics, the new IS is not a ground-up redesign but rather a subtle reskin and painstaking refresh of the existing architecture. The wheelbase is unchanged, overall dimensions grow only minimally, and the shape is clearly an evolution of the outgoing Gen-3 model, which dates back to 2014.

Open this photo in gallery The upcoming IS is a painstaking refresh of the existing car's architecture. Courtesy of manufacturer

Also basically unchanged is the model lineup offered in Canada: the IS 300 rear-wheel drive (RWD) powered by a 241-horsepower 2.0-litre four-cylinder engine; the IS 300 all-wheel-drive (AWD) with a 260-hp, 3.5-litre V6 under the hood; and the IS 350 AWD with a brawnier 311-hp version of the 3.5-litre V6. Transmissions remain eight-speed on the RWD and (disappointingly) still only six-speed on the AWD pair. Americans can also have the IS 350 as a rear-driver with the eight-speed autobox, but that combo, theoretically the sportiest, is not offered here.

A lot of detailed chassis fettling, including structural stiffening, new suspension geometry, reduced unsprung weight (for example a switch from steel to aluminum control arms), and an increase to 18-inch wheels/tires should elevate baseline handling across the board. Beyond that, the F Sport option ups the wheels to staggered-size 19-inchers with seriously aggressive 265/35R19 rubber at the rear. Going even further, a Dynamic Handling Package adds adaptive variable damping and lightweight forged-aluminum wheels.

The F Sport package also includes a cool-air intake with sound generator, a unique exhaust and, of course, the obligatory go-faster cosmetic touches.

If Lexus does the chassis-work right, not only will it actively please engaged drivers, but even disinterested drivers should like the way the car feels, even if they don’t know why.

Open this photo in gallery The upgraded chassis should provide good handling and engaging driving dynamics. Courtesy of manufacturer

And everybody should get something out of the other enhancements for 2021: An easier-to-reach 8- or 10.3-inch touch-screen display; an enhanced 17-speaker/1,800-watt Mark Levinson audio option; standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto; and an enhanced suite of standard safety technologies under the LSS+ 2.5 umbrella.

In the latter category, the pre-collision system (which includes forward-collision warning and automatic emergency braking) adds longer-range pedestrian and cyclist detection and improved recognition of oncoming vehicles when making a left turn; emergency steering assist has been added; the dynamic-radar cruise control can now automatically increase vehicle speed for overtaking a slower vehicle; and the lane-tracing (lane-centering) assist feature has improved recognition of lane markers and the edge of the road.

The 2021 model is due in showrooms late fall this year. Pricing has not yet been announced but is unlikely to vary much from the current MSRPs, which start at $41,250.

Alonso crashed in Turn 4 when his Arrow McLaren SP Chevrolet dipped onto the concrete portion of the apron at Indianapolis Motor Speedway and sent the Spaniard into the retaining wall. His damaged car rolled onto pit lane for an early end to his afternoon.

Alonso was sixth on the speed chart when he crashed. He ended up ninth for the day.

""It is just the way it is,"" Alonso said. ""Fortunately it happened today and not on (race day). We will learn from this. Nothing we can do now and tomorrow we start again.""

Alonso is making his third attempt to win the final leg of motorsports' version of the Triple Crown. The two-time Formula One champion has victories in the Monaco Grand Prix and 24 Hours of Le Mans, with Indianapolis the only race missing from the trifecta.

He had a strong car in 2017 when he raced at Indianapolis for Andretti Autorsport but an engine failure ended his shot at victory. Alonso failed to qualify for the Indy 500 last year in an effort from McLaren.

He also crashed during Indy 500 practice last year and it contributed to the many setbacks the McLaren team had during its preparations. The McLaren backup car was not the proper shade of orange and Alonso lost valuable practice time as the colour was corrected.

Alonso's crash with just over 50 minutes remaining in Thursday's session was the first wreck since the track opened Wednesday for practice.

Meanwhile, five-time IndyCar champion Scott Dixon topped the speed charts at the end of the day with a lap at 226.102 mph for Chip Ganassi Racing. He was followed by Takuma Sato at 225.693 and Marco Andretti at 225.249 mph as Honda's took the top three spots.

Conor Daly at 225.106 was fourth and the fastest Chevrolet.

James Hinchcliffe of Oakville, Ont., was 17th and Dalton Kellett of Stouffville, Ont., was 28th.

There is one more day of practice before qualifying, called ""Fast Friday"" as IndyCar gives teams a horsepower boost to increase speeds. Defending race winner Simon Pagenaud said Team Penske had a deliberate plan to work on handling Thursday and will worry about speed during Fast Friday practice.

""I have no interest in drafting and getting a big number out there,"" Pagenaud said. ""There's no interest for me to do that. I know I can win this race and I know what I need. That's more important than drafting and putting up a big number.""",422,0.9756488575236145,business

What’s your ideal two-car garage? Ask any gearhead, and you’re going to get a host of answers: a blistering-fast Ferrari F40 and a go-anywhere Unimog; a dashing Aston Martin and a genteel Rolls-Royce; a classic Alfa Romeo and a tow truck for when it gets temperamental. Well, here’s a garage full of fun for you, and only one is actually a car.

Initially, this pairing was conceived of as an oddball comparison. However, a mountain bike can get to places no car can, while a car can ferry around kids and groceries or hit the highway much more easily than a bicycle can.

When you electrify both, things really get interesting. Even during the pandemic, interest in electric vehicles has been increasing rapidly, such that the stock of new electric cars is low. The same is true of electric-assist bicycles, which are having a banner sales year.

Here we are, then, with the 2020 Chevy Bolt ($51,093 with options, before rebates and freight) and a 2020 Sight VLT C1 29 from Canadian cycling company Norco ($9,499). After a $5,000 federal rebate for electric cars plus a $3,000 provincial rebate in British Columbia, the total price tag of $52,592 is about the same as for one conventional, mid-range enthusiast vehicle such as a Toyota 4Runner or a Ford Mustang GT, to choose two widely varying examples.

Next to sleeker, more expensive models from Tesla, the Bolt’s stubby profile looks more like a generic electric vehicle. However, it’s hiding its light under a bushel. GM’s all-electric runabout provides accessible electric performance and is a genuine hoot to drive.

With 200 horsepower available from its AC drive unit and a nearly instantaneous 266 lb.-ft. of torque, the Bolt only takes a half-second longer to reach highway speeds than a previous-generation Volkswagen GTI. Get the Bolt going so its low-rolling-resistance Michelin tires don’t squeal and then punch the accelerator, and it’s just as quick as the GTI. The Chevrolet weighs 160 kilograms more than the VW, but the battery mass is mounted low on the chassis, and with a short wheelbase, the Bolt has handling to match its name.

Open this photo in gallery The Bolt makes for a flexible and fun family hatchback. Brendan McAleer /The Globe and Mail

Together, it adds up to a car that provides what that original Volkswagen GTI did 30-odd years ago: a flexible family hatchback that’s really good fun to drive. On the short and curving highway on-ramp near my house, where modestly powered crossovers can make merging tricky, the little Bolt scooted forward eagerly. Both of my kids in the rear literally shouted, “Whee!”

Something that’s often missed in discussions of electric vehicles is how enjoyable they are to drive. Yes, Tesla makes the headlines as the Model S battles the Porsche Taycan over super-electric-sedan supremacy, but down where price tags are more reasonable, there’s still a great deal of fun to be had.

Further, with 417 km of range from its 66 kWh battery, a roomy cabin and 479 litres of cargo space with the rear seats up, there’s nothing to prevent the Bolt from being the sole vehicle for a family of four. Yes, cold weather and quick driving can sap range, but even with half its range depleted, the Bolt will still have plenty of juice for daily use. Add in a clever left-hand steering-wheel paddle that uses regenerative braking to slow the car, and the entire Bolt driving experience is low stress.

Perhaps the only drawback is the car’s interior which, while spacious and practically laid out, doesn’t look like that of a $50,000-plus vehicle. You’re paying for the batteries and the technology here, so expect the Bolt to be not much nicer than your average GM mid-sized sedan. The rear cargo cover is particularly flimsy.

However, all the expected technology is on offer, displayed on a bright, clear, and not oversized screen. Driver assists such as cross-traffic alerts and automatic headlights are available on the Premier model.

Now, for the e-bike. Hold on to your seat: If the Bolt is a fun little scooter for racing about town, then the Sight VLT is a single-minded bike for racing up and down mountains.

The Sight VLT adds Shimano’s STEPS E8000 pedal-assist unit to Norco’s All Mountain range. The company also offers more reasonable options in trail or cross-country bikes, starting at slightly less than half the price. The C1 29 is a top-level model with a 630 watt-hour in-tube battery pack and roughly 50 kilometres of range.

For this kind of money, you could buy a used Mazda Miata, which, until now, I would have said was the best bang for your buck on wheels. However, riding the VLT, as it absolutely ironed-out hills in its loose-surface Trail mode and then sprinted toward a packed-dirt berm, I’ve had to change my mind. You can make a Miata jump, I suppose, but only the once.

The VLT comes with a weight penalty over a normal mountain bike because of the battery and experienced downhill riders report that it’s not quite as playful as the manual-bike experience. Further, electric-assist bikes are not without their detractors in the mountain-bike crowd, some of whom point out that inexperienced riders can get into big trouble on a heavy, fast bike.

Yet if a sports car on a lonely road offers an intoxicating kind of freedom, then the VLT offers, perhaps, an even more exhilarating kind. You really feel as if you could just ride this thing straight up the side of one of the rugged North Shore mountains. It opens up a whole playground of trails.

Two rides, then: One for treading lightly on the grocery run yet still enjoying yourself behind the wheel; the other for tripling your downhill time on the weekends and seeking out new trails.

There is, of course, no one answer to the perfect two-car garage. This pair, however, is hard to beat.

If your car is hit by an uninsured driver in provinces with public insurance, rest assured – you’re covered, as long as you have insurance.

In British Columbia, for instance, it works the same as in the provinces with private insurance.

Story continues below advertisement

If you're in a crash where an uninsured driver is at fault, your collision insurance, if you bought it, will cover the damages to your car, says the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia (ICBC).

“The majority of B.C. drivers purchase ICBC’s collision coverage and will get the full benefit of that coverage if their vehicle is damaged by an uninsured or unidentified (hit-and-run) driver,” said Lindsay Wilkins, ICBC spokeswoman, in an e-mail. “The claim would be handled under the collision coverage, and ICBC would waive the deductible.”

But in B.C., there’s recourse if you don’t have collision insurance. “For damage to property other than vehicles, or to vehicles without collision coverage, the statutory fund is available when there is no other coverage available,” Wilkins says.

In B.C., anyone with basic insurance or a valid B.C. driver’s licence has uninsured-motorist protection, Wilkins says.

Unlike uninsured protection in provinces with public insurance, which only covers injuries or has a cap on coverage for vehicle damages, B.C.'s fund covers both injuries and collision damage, Wilkins says.

""For damage to property other than vehicles, or to vehicles without collision coverage, the statutory fund is available when there is no other coverage available,"" Wilkins says.

The fund covers up to $1-million for injuries and property damage if you’re in a hit and run or if you’re hit by somebody who doesn’t have insurance.

Story continues below advertisement

That’s different than Ontario, where you’re only covered for up to $25,000 of the damage to your car if you’re hit by an uninsured driver and you don’t have collision. It’s also different than Alberta, Quebec and the Atlantic provinces, where damage to your car wouldn’t be covered at all if you’re hit by an uninsured driver and don’t have collision insurance.

Even in B.C., the fund won't protect you if you're at fault. If you caused a crash, whether the other driver had insurance or not, your car repairs will only be covered if you have collision protection.

Do you need to sue the other driver first to access the fund?

""For most claims for injury, death or damage to property (including vehicle damage), under the statutory coverage, ICBC will settle directly with the claimant and seek recovery from the uninsured motorist,"" Wilkins said.

Saskatchewan and Manitoba

What about the other two provinces with public insurance?

In Saskatchewan and Manitoba, if you have basic insurance, then you and your car are covered in any collision, whether the other driver is insured or not.

Story continues below advertisement

“In Saskatchewan, a valid registration means you have basic plate insurance on your plates which includes coverage for damage to your vehicle (subject to a deductible), personal-injury insurance from a vehicle collision and liability insurance for damage your vehicle causes to another vehicle or property, or injury to others,” said Tyler McMurchy, spokesman for Saskatchewan Government Insurance (SGI), in an e-mail.

Unlike in other provinces, Saskatchewan and Manitoba drivers don't need to purchase additional collision coverage – damage is covered even if they're at fault.

For instance, in a collision where both drivers have insurance, the at-fault driver would just have to pay the deductible on his vehicle. That deductible is $700 in Saskatchewan and $500 in Manitoba.

If you don't have insurance at all, then your vehicle damage won't be covered.

“If you were breaking the law by driving an uninsured vehicle ... and you were struck by another uninsured vehicle or you were a victim of a hit and run, your vehicle would have no insurance coverage and you’d have to pay for any repairs to your vehicle out of pocket,” McMurchy says. “As a Saskatchewan resident, you’d still have no-fault injury coverage if you were hurt, however.”

In both provinces, if you’re at fault and don’t have insurance, the insurance company could sue you for the cost of the damages to the other vehicle.

Toyota’s much-anticipated plug-in hybrid version of its popular RAV4 compact SUV goes on sale today in Canada – but only in Quebec for now.

Quebec offers a generous subsidy for buying electric vehicles, and the 302 horsepower RAV4 Prime PHEV qualifies there for an additional provincial rebate of $8,000 on top of the national rebate of $5,000 available to all Canadians. This means Quebecers will see $13,000 removed from its list price.

The most basic RAV4 Prime, the SE edition, has an MSRP of $44,990. The better-equipped XSE edition lists for $51,590, and the top-of-the-line technology package lists for $56,990. These prices are before all rebates.

British Columbia also has a rebate program for electric vehicles that will provide an extra subsidy of $1,500. Toyota expects to begin selling the RAV4 Prime in B.C. before the end of the year, but only in small quantities to start and probably less than a thousand Canadian vehicles in total during 2020. No other provinces offer rebates on EVs, though the vehicle will begin to be sold in the rest of Canada by next summer.

The RAV4 Prime is not a totally electric vehicle, and it has a gasoline engine for much of its driving that can cover more than 900 km between fill-ups. However, its larger 18.1 kWh battery, which gives a totally-electric range of 60 kilometres, and its starting price below $45,000, help qualify it for the full discount available to EVs both federally and in Quebec. It qualifies for the full discount available to PHEVs in B.C.

In fact, in Quebec, the RAV4 Prime will be slightly less expensive than the equivalent RAV4 Hybrid, while offering more features and an extra 83 horsepower.

Toyota says it does not plan sales strategy around government incentives. “(They) are typically short-term in nature, they normally last less than a full product cycle, and they tend to come and go without warning,” says Stephen Beatty, Toyota Canada’s Vice-President for Corporate Affairs.

“Program criteria like price caps, or technology requirements, regularly change, so you need to make the assumption that if you’ve done the competitive product planning correctly, a whole segment of the market is going to move at the same time, keeping things in relative balance. But while that’s the only assumption you can make, it sometimes doesn’t hold true, particularly where regional incentives vary within a single national market.”

Ontario offered the most generous EV rebates in North America until 2018, when they were cancelled by the newly-elected Conservative government.

Quebec also has a punitive policy of fining automakers that do not sell enough zero-emission vehicles. It’s a complicated formula of credits, but basically, Quebec’s Bill 104 demands that a rising percentage of an automaker’s total sales in the province must be zero-emission, or electric, vehicles. For every vehicle sold below that percentage, there is a fine of $5,000. In 2020, the percentage is 9.5. Last year, it was 6.5 per cent, and next year it will be 12 per cent, rising to 22 per cent in 2025. British Columbia is considering implementing a similar policy.

Story continues below advertisement

(If an auto maker sells more than the required percentage – for example, Tesla, which sells 100 per cent of its vehicles as EVs – then it obtains credits that can be sold to other automakers. There are similar laws in California and 10 other states, and Tesla has earned more than US$2 billion so far by selling its credits to competitors, notably FCA and General Motors.)

Toyota’s Prius Prime is the maker’s only other plug-in hybrid, and it was also first sold in Quebec in order to avoid punitive provincial fines. Toyota says every model in its lineup will have an electrified version by 2025, and it expects 40 per cent of its Canadian sales to be electrified by then. This year, it expects 20 per cent of its sales to be electrified, but this includes conventional hybrids that still create tailpipe emissions and so do not offset Quebec’s demand for zero-emission vehicles.

The RAV4 is Toyota’s best-selling vehicle in North America, and it is the best-selling passenger vehicle in both Canada and the U.S. that is not a pickup truck. The basic RAV4 starts at $28,090 and the RAV4 Hybrid starts at $32,350.

RAV4s for North America are built in Canada at Toyota’s plants in Cambridge, Ontario, though production was ceased for almost a month in the spring due to precautions against the COVID-19 virus. Toyota says it is struggling to meet demand, building additional vehicles at its Kentucky plant and importing others from Japan. The RAV4 Prime is built in Japan, where it’s already on sale.

“The reality is, the world is changing very rapidly. The types of products that are in demand are changing quite dramatically,” says Beatty.

“As you can imagine, with governments intervening in markets all around the world, planning correctly for that is a very difficult task. We are committed to making sure that electrification spreads across our lineup, and that it happens very quickly. The Prius Prime has been an enormous success story here in Canada and we hope to follow that same path with the RAV4 Prime.”

I’ve taken them apart and cleaned them, and they’re fine, but after a week or so the squeal comes back.

Derek

I’ve never kept official records, but I’m pretty sure noisy, squealing brakes is the No. 1 car complaint I get the privilege of dealing with on a daily basis. However, when I think back to the days that I was a young technician at a Honda dealer, I don’t seem to remember the problem being as prevalent. I’m dating myself now, but I remember early 90s Accords travelling 200,000 kilometers on a single set of brake rotors, only having to resurface them at each brake-pad-replacement interval.

Story continues below advertisement

How times have changed. The brake lathes at our shop – one stationary, one on-car-only – get used sporadically, whereas they used to be functioning all day long.

Manufacturers repeatedly state that brake parts and wheel bearings are exactly the same quality as I fondly remember, but I don’t buy it – everything is cheaper now.

Derek, your issue is going to be one of these issues: corrosion buildup on a poor-quality brake component, the use of improper brake lubricants, or one of the anti-squeal brake-pad shims is missing or not sitting in its proper place. Chances are, Derek, if your DIY skill level is sufficient, you are dealing with this latter issue.

Almost weekly, a vehicle shows up to my shop after receiving the $99 brake-job special from one of the numerous dark and dingy garages that populate most major cities’ back streets. The car owner is frustrated because they weren’t told their $99 investment came with these horrible noises emanating from their brakes. After we inspect and verify proper installation, we usually try to send the owner back to the original shop for some sort of warranty. Sadly, the vehicles usually re-appear a short time later with an even more frustrated owner, who now asks us to throw out the parts and start over again with better quality pieces.

Hi Lou!

Here’s an interesting one for you. I drive a 2012 Mazdaspeed 3 with 84,000 kilometres on it. My summer tires are 225/40-18s on factory rims. The car drives superbly on these tires and wheels. However, when I switch to my winter tires, which are 215/50-17s on aftermarket rims, I get a pull to the left on acceleration. When I lift, the pull disappears. Otherwise, the car tracks straight, there is no vibration or wheel-wobbling to indicate a bent rim or belt problem. Also, the car brakes straight and true.

But here’s the weird part. If I swap the front pair for the rears, the problem completely disappears. No pull, no nothing, just like on the summer tires. What do you think? All I can think of is that one of the tires is very slightly of a different diameter, and that the differential (it is limited-slip) is partly locking under power due to the different rotational speeds. It is a mystery to me.

Story continues below advertisement

Thanks!

Dave M., Tara, Ont.

That is an odd one Dave. Most higher-horsepower front-wheel-drive vehicles do have noticeable torque steer when winter tires are installed.

That being said, your limited-slip differential should not be engaging on acceleration, unless wheel slip is occurring. Therefore, your issue has to be tire related. The fact that your summer tires drive true and straight and your winters, in one orientation, also drive fine, indicates that one tire is not right. Could it be a tire diameter problem? Sure, but you should be able to measure your tire depth and verify and compare your results.

Any tire retailer will attest that sometimes tires can look perfectly fine but cause the oddest of drivability problems. Don’t overthink it Dave; I’m sure when the time comes to replace the winter tires, the new set will drive perfectly.

What’s on my radar

A recent study from research firm IHS Markit suggests that the average age of cars and trucks in the U.S. is on the rise at 11.9 years, while Canadian stats from 2016 indicate 9.6 years. However, I’m sure the Canadian numbers are also on the rise given the ongoing pandemic – people are being more cautious with their money. Accordingly, I have noticed a defined shift in the discussions that I have with my customers, from “what new car should I buy?” to “what used car should I buy?” Whether this is going to be a long-term shift or just a temporary blip is unknown to me, but since many are asking, here are my thoughts.

Story continues below advertisement

Be realistic with your budget. Too many buyers try to reach for the newest car possible by buying a higher-mileage vehicle. I have found that most who purchase a high-mileage vehicle typically spend the amount they saved on unexpected repairs within the first couple of years of second-hand ownership. Looking for something well-maintained, but a couple of years older with average mileage, is almost always better. Know what average mileage is for your locale. For example, if you are located in the Greater Toronto Area, the average vehicle will see approximately 20,000 km per year. When a vehicle you are looking at has significantly lower kilometres per year than that, it had better come with a full service history so you can verify. No service history and low annual kilometres? I’d be cautious. Know who you are buying from. When you go to purchase a private vehicle, it should have a license plate on it that corresponds to the vehicle registration. If the car in question is only a few years old and has inaccurate – or no – plates on it, chances are you are dealing with someone flipping cars for profit, also known as curbsiders. Run away from these people. Don’t always trust the accident-free paperwork. Many cars have unreported accidents that were paid for in cash by the previous owner. It takes a trained eye to spot some of the not-so-obvious paint and accident-repair work. I regularly perform pre-purchase inspections on vehicles sourced from big local dealers that have undiscovered accident repairs. A pre-purchase inspection or second opinion by a qualified professional is never a bad idea.

In 1928, Chrysler purchased Dodge Brothers Co. and continued the momentum by introducing both the low-priced Plymouth, an evolution of the four-cylinder Chrysler 52, and the mid-market De Soto.

article continues below

De Soto’s creation came about almost accidentally. In 1928, Walter Chrysler’s initial attempt to buy Dodge Brothers was refused by the banks that controlled it, so he created the medium-priced De Soto.

Then, when the bankers changed their minds and agreed to sell Dodge to Chrysler, the De Soto was already on the assembly line.

The 1929 De Soto was introduced in August 1928 to an enthusiastic acceptance. Within a year, 81,065 were sold, a first-year model sales record that stood for more than 30 years.

Named for Spanish explorer Hernando De Soto, discoverer of the Mississippi River, De Soto was intended to convey a spirit of “travel, pioneering and adventure.” Usually it didn’t, although for a period in the 1950s it did build the hot0performing Adventurer.

The Depression reduced De Soto’s 1930 sales to 34,889 in spite of a straight-eight engine joining the six. The eight was discontinued in 1932, although De Soto added free-wheeling that allowed coasting without compression braking. It also got the soft “Floating Power” engine mounts pioneered by Plymouth in 1931.

For 1933, De Soto was moved to a higher price range closer to Chrysler and away from Dodge. When De Soto and Chrysler introduced their controversial streamlined Airflow models in 1934, De Soto went totally to the Airflow but Chrysler wisely hedged by also continuing the conventional “Airstream.”

Airflows were well-engineered cars, but their radical style did not sell well, so De Soto revived its conventional Airstream model in 1935, but also kept the Airflow until 1936.

De Soto’s fortunes gradually improved through the 1930s, given a considerable boost when they proved to be very good taxis. Many New York City De Soto cabs covered more than a million miles during the Second World War car shortage.

With the Airflow discontinued in 1936, all De Sotos had conventional styling for 1937. The peak of its 1940s elegance was reached in 1942 just before production ceased for the war. The ’42 was liberally decorated with chrome, a bold vertical bar grille and “Airfoil” headlights concealed under metal covers.

After the war, De Soto returned to production early in1946 with their 1942 design with some changes to fenders, doors and bumpers. The hidden headlamps were gone.

Chrysler Corp. introduced its all-new styling in 1949 and many thought they took a wrong turn with taller, more conservative cars than the competition.

In 1951, Chrysler Corp. scored a coup with its sensational new hemispherical combustion chamber overhead valve Firepower V-8. Soon nicknamed the Hemi, Chrysler’s developed 180 horsepower from 5.4 litres (331 cu in.), the most powerful engine in the American industry. De Soto got its smaller 4.5-litre (276 cu in.), 160 horsepower Firedome Hemi midway through the 1952 model year, its first eight since 1932.

Chrysler Corp. finally abandoned the stodgy styling with its 1955 Forward Look. Vestigial fins made their appearance, grew higher for 1956 and really went wild the following year.

Chrysler seemed determined to match General Motors with chrome and fins in what would be called the Decade of Decadence. The term “rolling jukeboxes” was not without justification.

In the face of a squeeze on mid-priced cars caused by low-priced cars growing larger, De Soto lost market share through the 1950s. Also, it always seemed to suffer in Chrysler’s shadow; even the high- performance Adventurer series beginning in 1956 didn’t turn the tide.

But the corporation continued trying, launching a full line of 22 De Soto models in four series for 1959. Alas, the resuscitation attempt was a losing cause.

For the restyled 1960 models, now with unit construction, only the Fireflite and Adventurer series were offered. The Adventurer lost its performance-car fangs when horsepower dropped from 350 to 305.

New De Soto models were introduced for 1961, but the writing was clearly on the wall.

Production ceased in November 1960 after only about 3,000 1961s had been built. They were not marketed in Canada.

De Sotos were almost always known as solid if unspectacular cars that provided good value for money for conservative buyers. Except for the short-lived “real” 1950s Adventurer models, they didn’t have a strong performance reputation.

During De Soto’s 30-plus years, just over two million were built. The year in which it died, 1960, was the year its first year sales record was broken.

Reflecting the changing times, the car that did it was the new compact Ford Falcon.",767,0.960393484794181,business

If we didn’t see this one coming, we should have. FCA has been finding new roles for its supercharged 700-plus-horsepower Hellcat V8 ever since the engine first torched tarmac in the 2015 Challenger and Charger. The 6.2-litre monster motor now also performs in the Trackhawk version of the Jeep Grand Cherokee, will soon play a part in the Dodge Durango and has “guest starred” in aftermarket conversions of the Jeep Gladiator.

But the Hellcat-motored 2021 Ram 1500 TRX is more than just the world’s fastest pickup truck. (Or so FCA claims.) It also aims to rewrite the rule book on truck off-road ability. Going even further, it also represents a new pinnacle trim grade for Ram, offering luxury (e.g. suede and carbon-fibre trim) and technology (e.g. head-up display) not available on even Ram’s previously-ultimate Limited grade.

The mission, said interior design chief Ryan Nagode, was to create a top-dog halo product previously lacking in the Ram line.

The current unchallenged halo-wearer among high-performance off-road pickups is the Ford F-150 Raptor. And “TRX” reads an awful lot like “T-Rex.” See where Ram is going with this? Dinosaur wars!

Canadian pricing has yet to be revealed, but when it goes on sale late this year, U.S. pricing starts at US$69,995 (C$93,000). And yes, that is just a starting point. Ram will provide options to help you spend more. Or try to bag yourself one of the 702 Launch Edition models (100 of them for Canada) that start at $88,570 stateside.

For reference, the Ford Raptor SuperCrew starts at $79,199 and its twin-turbo 3.5-litre V6 is rated at 450 hp; the closest equivalent from GM, a GMC Sierra AT4 with the off-road performance package and 6.2-litre, 420-hp V8, would start at around $70,000.

Available only in a Crew Cab/Short Box configuration, the Ram’s new “apex predator” is founded on a beefed-up frame that is claimed to be 75 per cent new. New aluminum front control arms and upgraded rear axle help widen the track by 6 inches, and TRX-exclusive 35-inch Goodyear Territory tires are sheltered by flared fenders that broaden the body by 8 inches. A 51-mm suspension lift provides 300 mm of ground clearance.

Off-road oriented features and tech include Bilstein Black Hawk e2 active dampers, Active Terrain Dynamics, 8 drive modes (including “Baja” for desert racing), 13-inches of front and 14-inches of rear wheel travel, a tow-hook at each corner, electronic locking rear differential, and a high-mounted alternator to facilitate the 32-inch-deep wading target. The transfer case includes a full-time AWD mode and a 2.64:1 Low Range.

Open this photo in gallery Inside, the 12-inch touch-screen includes an update of Performance Pages and a standard Launch Control. FCA US LLC/Courtesy of manufacturer

Combine all that with the 6.2-litre supercharged V8′s 702 hp and 650 lb-ft of torque and you have a monster truck that can accelerate from 0-60 mph (96 km/h) in 4.5 seconds, 0 to 100 mph (160 km/h) in 10.5 seconds, and then, at the end of the drag strip, continue across the farmer’s field next door without slowing down.

In case you’re wondering, the engine is 5 hp down on its passenger-car version, mainly due to the pickup’s different exhaust plumbing. Top speed is electronically limited by the tire construction to “only” 190 km/h.

Moving back inside, the 12-inch touch-screen includes an update of Performance Pages that includes Off-Road Pages. A traditional T-handle shift lever replaces the rotary knob on other Rams and is supplemented by aluminum shift paddles. Launch Control is standard.

An available digital rear-view mirror is a first for FCA (as is the head-up display) while other visual aids include a forward camera that shows the tire lines for the steering angle, and twiddle-a-knob trailer reverse steering control that doesn’t need a prior set-up process.

A Buick pickup truck? Unlikely. But even without going that far, Buick is now basically a truck company. Last year, its three SUV nameplates accounted for more than 90 per cent of its sales in Canada. And by far the best-selling of them all was the tiny, almost toy-like Encore.

Since SUVs are working for Buick, it’s no surprise the brand is expanding its market coverage. After all, there’s a wide space between the compact Envision and the full-size, three-row Enclave that would be filled nicely by, say, a two-row mid-sizer (anybody remember the 2004-2007 Rainier?).

Instead, the 2020 newcomer is another subcompact. So is the Encore GX a replacement for the no-suffix Encore? Apparently not. We’re told the GX’s role is to plug the gap between the Encore and the Envision. However, the GX doesn’t exactly “split” the difference – it’s actually much closer in size (4.35 metres long) to the existing Encore (4.28) than to the Envision (4.67).

On paper, the GX’s 1.2- and 1.3-litre turbo three-cylinder engines look like a downgrade from the 1.4-litre turbo four-cylinder of the original Encore. The new triples are, however, state of the art; even the 1.2′s 137 horsepower is only one down on the older 1.4, and its 162 lb.-ft. of torque beats it by 14 lb.-ft. Respective outputs for the 1.3 as tested are 155 hp and 174 lb.-ft. Fuel-consumption numbers are not class-leading but better than average.

In Canada, the GX is offered in three trims. The smaller engine comes only in the base Preferred trim, with a continuously-variable automatic transmission (CVT) and front-wheel drive, starting at $26,098; all-wheel drive (with a driver-selectable FWD mode) is paired with the 1.3 engine and a nine-speed automatic and starts at $28,098. Select and Essence grades start from $30,098 and $32,598 respectively.

Buick no longer aspires to purvey “motorcars” that are “distinctive, substantial, powerful and mature,” but Quiet Tuning is still one of its signature traits. So, how does that work out with a mighty-midget three-cylinder under the hood? Somewhat. The engine doesn’t obviously present like it’s “missing” a cylinder, and it’s never disagreeable. But neither is its sound signature anything like premium when working through the gears.

On the highway, it settles down nicely into the relaxed, long-legged stride of a much bigger vehicle. But don’t expect an old-style big-Buick pillowy ride. In the GX, involved drivers will enjoy quick, light-and-lively steering and relatively taut, responsive cornering, but the ride is stiff.

Open this photo in gallery The all-black interior can be swapped for beige or, on the Essence trim, caramel colours. Jeremy Sinek/The Globe and Mail

As for the cabin environment, the test sample’s all-black interior didn’t strike us as overtly premium, despite faux-carbon-fibre accents and some real white stitching. I suspect it works better with the alternative beige or (on the Essence trim) caramel interior colours – a level of décor choice rare in this corner of the market.

Despite Buick’s entry-premium aspirations, the Encore GX is priced much closer to mainstream subcompact crossovers than to premium European ones. That said, some plebe alternatives start for thousands less with manual transmission, while like-priced rivals may include more standard features.

With the possible exception of its laid-back highway cruising, there is no single aspect of the Encore GX that stands out from its peers, but solid ability across a broad range of attributes adds up to an appealing package overall. Just be careful that all the options don’t lure you into paying $40,000 (before taxes) for a fully loaded one. That may not be a lot of money for a Buick, but it’s a lot for a subcompact SUV.

Looks

Raked screens and large, well-attired 18-inch wheels help the Buick look less boxy or dorky than most of the competition. To our eyes, it also looks bigger than it is.

Interior

Open this photo in gallery Most functions can still be controlled with manual buttons and dials. Jeremy Sinek/The Globe and Mail

The 94.3 cubic-foot passenger volume is average for a segment that ranges between 88 and 100. Your average adult can sit behind your average driver without crowding, though smaller people may wish the rear bench was higher for a better view out. The driving position is also rather low, despite a standard 10-way power seat. Exterior sightlines could be better, ditto the readability of the analog gauges on a bright day (the digital speedometer in the centre 4.2-inch display is a welcome alternative). The integrated centre-stack touch screen is an 8-incher on all trims and, happily, most everyday adjustments can still be done with real buttons.

Performance

Over several hundred kilometres of freeway cruising, we admired how easily the little engine handled the long-legged top gear, showing 2,200 rpm at 120 km/h and only rarely needing to downshift. Then we realized it was topping out in eighth gear. To access ninth (1,800 rpm at 120), we had to upshift manually, and often, even that didn’t work. A shorter axle ratio would make ninth more usable while trimming the 10.3-second saunter from 0- to 100-km/h. Subjectively, the GX feels quicker than that. It launches very linearly, with no perceptible turbo lag, and in cut-and-thrust traffic, the transmission seamlessly picks the right gear at the right time. We averaged 7.9 L/100 km over a week of mostly highway driving with the A/C on.

Technology

Open this photo in gallery Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and SiriusXM satellite radio come standard. Jeremy Sinek/The Globe and Mail

Standard safety tech includes forward-collision alert, automatic emergency and front-pedestrian braking and lane-keep assist. On the infotainment side, 4G LTE Wi-Fi capability, SiriusXM, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard. The Select trim adds lane-change and blind-spot alerts, but adaptive cruise (standard on a $28,000 Hyundai Kona), navigation, automatic parking assist, head-up display and wireless charging require extra-cost packages.

Cargo

Open this photo in gallery The seatbacks fold nearly flat, improving the usability of the cargo space. Jeremy Sinek/The Globe and Mail

Cargo volumes are a little above average, and usability is enhanced by seatbacks that fold very nearly flat; a bi-level cargo deck that lies flush with the folded seats when up; and a fold-flat front passenger seat. A hands-free power liftgate is standard on the upper two trims and the GX can tow 1,000 lbs.

The verdict

Stylish, functional and fun to drive. Base pricing is reasonable, but watch those options!

The attractive four-passenger two-door sportster set a first model year sales record of 680,989, admittedly a long one that ran from April ’64 to August ’65. It caught the competition so off guard it took rival Chevrolet until the 1967 model year to respond with its Camaro.

The Mustang made Ford’s general manager Lee Iacocca a household name and put his picture on the cover of both Time and Newsweek. It also spawned a class of vehicle known as the Pony Car.

As inevitably seems to happen, the Mustang grew bigger and heavier. By 1973 it was about 305 millimetres longer, 152 mm wider and about 272 kilograms heavier than the original.

The Mustang had outgrown its original appeal as an affordable, nimble sporty car. As Iacocca summed up: “The Mustang market never left us, we left it.”

Sales confirmed this, sliding from more than 600,000 in model year 1966, to just 134,267 in 1973. What’s more, new, lighter, imported 2+2 mini-Pony Cars combining four-on-the-floor fun with upscale luxury were becoming increasingly popular. They were filling the segment Mustang had created and gradually abandoned.

Cars such as the Toyota Celica and Ford’s own German Capri (sold by Lincoln-Mercury dealers, and ironically inspired by the original Mustang), were the stimulus for a new, smaller Mustang to try recapturing the earlier magic.

Plans for the trimmer 1974 Mustang began in 1970, and just as the original was based on mundane Falcon components, the new one used the new-for-1971 subcompact Ford Pinto as its foundation. This complete departure was called the Mustang II.

Iacocca specified a wheelbase of 2,438 to 2,540 mm in notchback and fastback coupes. This precluded using a long engine, so a 2.3-litre, overhead cam inline four was the base power with a 2.8- litre, overhead valve V-6 optional, and standard in the upscale Mustang II Mach I. The four was the U.S.-built Pinto engine while the option was a stretch of the Capri’s 2.6 litre V-6 from Germany.

Ford’s engineers took downsizing seriously and made the Mustang II even smaller than the original. The wheelbase was reduced from 2,743 mm to 2,443 mm and ove-all length from 4,613 mm to 4,445 mm. It was a full 508 mm shorter and 102 mm narrower than the bloated ’73 model it replaced.

In spite of its smaller size, mandated safety and emission equipment brought the unit construction Mustang II’s weighy to 1,270 kg, a little heavier than the original’s 1,179 kg.

The attractive styling was influenced by coachbuilder Ghia of Italy, recently acquired by Ford, and carried on the long-hood, short-deck theme of the original. It came as a notchback and hatch-equipped fastback.

The Mustang II was no match for the original’s performance. Road & Track (8/64) reported the original 4.7 litre (289 cu in.) V-8 Mustang sprinted to 97 km/h (60 mph) in 9.0 seconds and had a top speed of 177 (110).

The Mustang II Mach I with the 2.8 litre V-6 (R&T 9/73) ran zero to 97 (60) in 13.8 seconds with top speed of 161 (100). The four was, of course, even slower.

When Ford advertised the new 1974 Mustang as “The right car at the right time,” they couldn’t have known how prescient they would be. In November 1973, conditions changed dramatically when the Arab oil embargo precipitated the first of two 1970s “energy crises.”

Not only did gasoline prices spike but its supply was rumoured to be in jeopardy. Fuel economy immediately became the hot item and helped boost the smaller Mustang’s first calendar year sales to 385,993.

With oil crisis memories fading by 1975, Ford offered a 5.0-litre V-8 in the Mustang II, bringing performance closer to the original’s. R&T (1/75) recorded zero to 97 km/h (60 mph) in 10.5 seconds and top speed of 171 (106).

A Cobra II with options such as extra trim, black grille, front air dam and rear spoiler came in 1976. There was also a Stallion package with different paint treatment and stallion decals on the front fenders. For 1978 there was the even more garish King Cobra with standard 5.0-litre V-8, deeper air dam, stripes and a cobra decal on the hood.

The Mustang II was built through the 1978 model year, then replaced by the 1979 Fairmont-based, third-generation Mustang. Many Mustang enthusiasts disdained the Mustang II as a wimpy aberration, not a “real” Mustang. It was, however, a product of its time and became a desirable collectible for many.",749,0.9464708686341877,business

It isn’t Hyundai’s least expensive vehicle yet, but it soon may be. In some markets, Hyundai has already discontinued the Accent, its current five-door subcompact hatchback, giving the Venue the crown. But that hasn’t happened in North America — yet.

The Venue comes in four trim levels, with my tester, the Ultimate model, carrying a sticker price of $24,899.

The Venue is aimed at the urban first-time buyer, and it appeals to that group with a budget-friendly price. Despite its diminutive dimensions, its boxy body contains ample room for friends and cargo.

Headroom is a generous 1,000 millimetres in the front and 980 mm in the back. Legroom is 1,050 front and 870 mm back, with passenger interior volume pegged at 2,602 litres.

My tester had the Ultimate trim level — the fanciest — with premium items more commonly found in luxury brands. The interior is simple, uncluttered and logically arranged.

Comfort items that I didn’t expect include a heated steering wheel, power sunroof, push-button start and climate control.

The rear seatbacks fold 60/40 and the cargo floor has two positions. Cargo capacity is 335 litres with the seats up and 1,148 with them down.

The infotainment system consists of an eight-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto capability. The menus were easy to decipher and the system response time was good.

Technophiles will appreciate Hyundai’s BlueLink connected vehicle system, which allows users to access some functions — such as remote vehicle lock or unlock, remote start and remote climate control via their smartphone.

The system even has an automatic collision notification function that will call for emergency services in case of a crash.

My tester had navigation built-in, but lesser trims don’t offer that feature.

There is only one engine available, a 1.6-litre four cylinder producing 121 horsepower and 113 pound-feet of torque.

A manual transmission is available — but only in the base model. Every other trim gets a continuously variable transmission).

Power is delivered to the front wheels only — there is no all-wheel-drive option. As if to compensate, drivers can choose a Snow option along with Normal and Sport modes.

Let’s be frank, that last mode is more optimistic than fact. If you do choose Sport, the engine rpms go up, but you don’t really go faster.

If performance is what you’re after, you really should consider the Kona, the Venue’s bigger brother.

Fuel economy is 8.0 litres per 100 km in the city and 7.0 on the highway.

Compared with the Nissan Kicks, another subcompact SUV, power output and fuel consumption are similar.

With a 2,520-mm wheelbase and a 5.1-metre turning radius, the Venue is refreshingly nimble in the city. Unfortunately, the short wheelbase also results in a choppy ride on rough roads.

Apart from premium touches in the cabin, the Ultimate also impresses with its safety suite.

You get forward collision-avoidance assist (with automated emergency braking), lane-departure warning with lane-keeping assist, driver-attention warning, blind-spot collision warning with lane-change assist and rear cross-traffic warning.

While these features have become more common of late thanks to trickle-down effect of technology, it is the first time an entry-level model (albeit the highest trim in the line) has been so equipped.

With certain models, the Venue contrasts its entry-level stigma with a trendy/hip vibe, with eye-catching two-tone paint schemes and flashy wheels.

The Venue might be inexpensive to start. It can even be plain. But dress it up and you can go to town — and that’s the point.

SUVs and crossovers are everywhere these days. And every day you hear of a manufacturer introducing larger and larger models that can carry more cargo and passengers.

Lexus has quietly gone the other way, with a model that hits all the high notes in a subcompact body.

It is a segment that has seen a number of luxury entrants, from the Volvo XC40 to the BMW X1.

But Lexus has a winning card up its sleeve.

Luxury brands traditionally play up on their vehicle’s performance versus regular brands. Lexus, on the other hand, can tout their fuel efficiency as a trump card instead.

The UX is available as the 200, with a 2.0-litre four-cylinder that produces 168 horsepower, or the 250h, with an Atkinson-cycle 2.0-litre gasoline engine mated with Lexus’ fourth-generation electric hybrid system that cranks out a combined 181 hp.

I drove the latter car with the F Sport Series 2 package.

If you like luxury, yet want to drive something socially conscious at the same time, the UX hybrid is your vehicle.

With a gentle foot, you could be able to consume a miserly 5.7 litres of fuel per 100 kilometres in the city and 6.2 on the highway.

The hybrid drivetrain technology, from parent Toyota, works seamlessly and effectively. While the competition fits engine stop/start to its vehicles, the electric motor in the hybrid drive in the UX provides propulsion until about 10 km/h.

The UX will, under light load, revert to electric power even at higher speeds. The transition is completely transparent — the only way you can tell is when the vehicle tells you of the change.

A drive-mode selector allows you to choose Eco or Sport if you find the middle-of-the-road Normal setting not aggressive enough for your driving style.

Choose Sport when you desire an extra urgency to your drive, but don’t expect too much. The UX will get from zero to 100 km/h in about nine seconds.

The regular UX is front-wheel-drive only. The hybrid UX sends engine power to the front wheels via a CVT transmission and uses an electric motor to power the rear wheels, making it all-wheel drive.

If you choose to take to the back roads, you will find the UX 250h a pleasant companion.

My tester had the F Sport package, which includes a sport-tuned suspension and 18-inch wheels, among other performance upgrades.

The interior is a knockout, with an edgy design and a youthful vibe. My tester had an attractive contrasting red-on-black colour scheme.

The traditional analog gauges have been replaced by an eight-inch customizable digital display in front of the driver.

The 10.3-inch infotainment screen is on the top of the dash. It is flanked by an conventional analog clock — a nice, classy touch.

The system is hamstrung by a too-sensitive touchpad controller that I found frustrating to use.

As if to compensate, Lexus has relocated the audio system’s volume and tuning knob to the outside edges of the centre console. It’s an unconventional location, but it works great once you are used to it.

Although the UX may be the least-expensive Lexus, you wouldn’t know when sitting in it. Fit and finish is excellent, with attention to detail evident throughout. My tester was the top of the line and came with items such as heated and ventilated front seats, power adjustable seat belts, a premium audio system and supportive seats.

The only thing that Lexus could not change is the tight rear quarters. If you are on the tall side, you might want to think twice about having anybody sit behind you.

The cargo capacity on par with this segment, with 486 litres of capacity.

However, the liftover height makes it difficult to load heavy cargo. That’s disappointing because there doesn’t seem to be anything — not even a spare tire — underneath the floor.

The UX comes with a comprehensive driver-assistance suite. Standard features include forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, bicycle and pedestrian detection, adaptive cruise control, lane-departure warning, lane-tracking assist and traffic-sign recognition.

The parking-assist system uses sensors to detect objects when you are backing up, and will apply the brakes automatically if it senses an imminent collision.

As the entry-level vehicle to the Lexus brand, the UX is well-suited to its role. It is affordable (for a luxury vehicle), looks attractive on the outside and the well-appointed cabin is a great place to dwell.

“When I pulled myself out of the car, I lost it,” Vernon, 21, said. “I’m surprised I didn’t die today.”

The Sooke couple were travelling south in the direction of Langford when their vehicle was struck by a truck which was making a left turn from Whittaker Road onto the Malahat, just north of the Shawnigan Lake exit.

“I looked down to change a song on the radio and when I looked up I saw the truck directly in front of us,” said Vernon, who was sitting in the front passenger seat of the Honda.

“Next thing I know, we were spinning and hitting things. It felt like we were crashing forever. We ended up on the median.”

The Ford truck hit the Honda on its passenger side, near where Vernon was seated. The air bags did not deploy, Pollitt said. Two ground-ambulance crews were dispatched to the scene at 8:30 a.m, according to B.C. Emergency Health Services. The couple received treatment from paramedics on the scene before being transferred by ambulance to Victoria General Hospital.

Pollitt, 25, who was driving, was relatively unharmed but Vernon suffered several injuries in the crash, including a broken clavicle.

The passenger side window shattered during the crash, sending small shards into Vernon’s eyes, which is being treated with medication. “The whole right side of my body is cut up,” she said.

It could have been far worse. Vernon was just doing up her seatbelt at the time of the crash. (Pollitt had stopped moments before, so she could use a bathroom).

But the car is now a write-off due to the extensive damage, Vernon said. “It looks like we were in a garbage compactor. The whole side is ripped open. I looked at it once I got out, and thought: ‘Holy [expletive]. I can’t believe we were in that.’ “

Lieut. Gerry Lacquement of the Malahat Volunteer Fire Department, whose station is located at 935 Whittaker Rd., less than one kilometre from where the crash happened, was on the scene within minutes.

He joined two separate passersby — one of whom was a nurse, the other an industrial first-aid attendant — who had stopped minutes earlier to offer help. “Sometimes you luck out and get good people who happen upon the scene,” Lacquement said.

He arrived to find the Honda facing the wrong direction. After impact, the vehicle had been spun around and was deposited onto the safety barrier, facing north.

“It turns out they were going southbound, but the vehicle was facing opposite their direction of travel.”

The crash took place just north of the oft-discussed Shawnigan Lake Road exit, a section of the highway that has received extensive safety upgrades in recent years.

But the Malahat as a whole has long been a concern for Vernon, who said several friends have been in crashes in the vicinity.

A friend of her father, who lived with the Vernon family when she was young, died on the highway the day he received his motorcycle licence 13 years ago.

“The amount of friends I’ve had die on the Malahat, who haven’t made it through those crashes, is insane,” she said.

“At least I made it, though.”

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau prorogued Parliament Tuesday, saying he needs a Throne Speech to launch a new recovery plan and insisting the move is consistent with his party’s pledge not to misuse the procedural move.

Mr. Trudeau made the announcement the same day that he named Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland as the new Finance Minister, a position vacated Monday by the resignation of Bill Morneau. She is the country’s first woman in that role.

In proroguing Parliament until Sept. 23, Mr. Trudeau shuts down committee investigations into the Liberal government’s WE Charity controversy. The Prime Minister promised a Throne Speech when Parliament returns and a confidence vote, which could trigger a federal election if the minority government Liberals fail to win the support of at least one of the three main opposition parties.

Story continues below advertisement

The Prime Minister said prorogation and a Throne Speech are necessary because the world has changed since the government approved its initial Throne Speech in December, which was based on the Liberal Party’s 2019 campaign pledges.

Background: For Chrystia Freeland, the political is personal

Freeland’s appointment completes the centralization of power in Trudeau’s office

Freeland just inherited the hardest job in Canada. How long can she keep it?

“We do not want an election. But it is obvious that the Throne Speech we gave eight months ago is no longer relevant for the reality that Canadians are living and that our government is facing,” Mr. Trudeau told reporters at a news conference on Parliament Hill. “There are many things we committed to Canadians in that Throne Speech that we will be continuing to work on, but many others that aren’t the priority that they once were. ... I think it is important that Canadians have a clear idea of the plan that we have for building a stronger economy that is more inclusive, that is greener, that is fairer for all Canadians.”

The Liberal Party’s 2015 election campaign platform included a specific pledge not to abuse the use of prorogation, after criticizing the former Conservative prime minister’s use of the procedural tool.

“We will not resort to legislative tricks to avoid scrutiny,” the platform said. “Stephen Harper has used prorogation to prevent Parliament from properly reviewing and debating his proposals.” The platform said House of Commons rules would be changed “to bring an end to this undemocratic process.”

Mr. Harper faced criticism for proroguing Parliament in December, 2008, during the onset of the global financial crisis, at a time when opposition parties were planning to defeat his minority Conservative government. The prorogation bought the government time and allowed it to survive confidence votes when Parliament resumed the next month. Mr. Harper’s third of four prorogations in power was also controversial. The December, 2009, prorogation had the effect of shutting down a politically sensitive parliamentary investigation into the government’s handling of Afghan detainees.

During the Trudeau government’s first four-year term, Parliament was never prorogued.

When asked about that campaign pledge, Mr. Trudeau insisted the current situation is different.

“Stephen Harper and the Conservatives prorogued Parliament in order to shut it down and avoid a confidence vote. We are proroguing Parliament to bring it back on exactly the same week it was supposed to come back anyway and force a confidence vote,” he said.

The House of Commons was scheduled to sit for one day next week as part of an agreement with the NDP earlier in the year to continue the suspension of regular sitting days while allowing some committee work to continue. There have only been 45 regular sitting days since the October, 2019, election because of suspensions related to the novel coronavirus.

Regular sitting days were scheduled to resume on Monday, Sept. 21. Mr. Trudeau could have decided to allow committee work to continue and to prorogue just before the Throne Speech, rather than immediately.

The effect of prorogation is that regular committee work is shut down as all bills and committee studies die.

The existing bills and committee studies are not necessarily ended for good, however. Procedural options exist for MPs to approve motions that would reinstate bills and studies back to the stages they were at at the time of prorogation.

Mr. Trudeau said that documents related to the now-cancelled contract with the WE Charity designed to help students during the pandemic would still be released.

“I can say that we have released all those documents to the members of the committee so that they can spend their time going through those mountains of documents over the coming weeks so that they can continue to ask any questions they like on this issue,” he said.

Opposition MPs on the House of Commons finance committee have received an estimated 5,000 pages of documents.

At the time of the Speech from the Throne, a new Conservative leader will be in place. A leader is to be named on Sunday and will have to hit the ground running in preparation for a possible election.

The decision to prorogue Parliament was met with disdain from opposition parties on Tuesday.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said the prorogation is aimed at blocking the WE Charity investigation.

“Earlier this year, Justin Trudeau shamefully shut down Parliament to try and avoid accountability. Now he has locked out opposition MPs who were working hard to fix his government’s pandemic programs [and] help Canadians and get to the bottom of his corruption scandal,” he said in a statement. “Justin Trudeau is walking out on Canadians in the middle of a major health and economic crisis, in a disgusting attempt to make Canadians forget about his corruption.”

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said shutting down Parliament in the middle of a pandemic and an economic crisis is wrong.

“Canadians shouldn’t be forced to pay the price for Mr. Trudeau’s scandals,” he said on Twitter.

Earlier in the day, Mr. Singh told reporters in Vancouver that this week’s events are “deeply troubling” and a sign that the Liberals are more focused on themselves rather than dealing with the pandemic.

“It seems like the Liberal government is more interested in throwing the finance minister under the bus than the Prime Minister taking responsibility for his own breaches of conflict-of-interest laws and his own breaches when it comes to scandals,” Mr. Singh said.

Prior to Mr. Trudeau’s prorogation announcement, he was at Rideau Hall for a ceremony to swear in Ms. Freeland to the critical finance portfolio.

On Monday, Bill Morneau, who had served in the role since 2015, announced he was leaving the Trudeau cabinet. Mr. Morneau is also resigning as an MP. The resignation followed several media reports of disagreements between the two men, but both praised each other in their public comments this week.

Both are the subject of investigations by the Ethics Commissioner related to a now-cancelled contract with WE Charity to administer a program for students during the pandemic.

The Ethics Commissioner will proceed with his report on Mr. Morneau even if he is no longer an office holder, his office confirmed on Tuesday.

At a committee hearing into the issue last month, Mr. Morneau revealed that he had reimbursed $41,366 to WE Charity for travel expenses that the group covered for personal trips his family took to Kenya and Ecuador in 2017.

He is the only finance minister that Mr. Trudeau has had since his government came to power in 2015.

Mr. Trudeau thanked Mr. Morneau for his service, adding that he counted on the minister’s leadership, advice and close friendship over the years.

The swearing-in of the new cabinet was the first of its kind during the pandemic. Those attending the ceremony wore masks, and chairs at the ceremony were spaced out to enable physical distancing.

Ms. Freeland, who was first elected in 2013, will be the first female finance minister in Canadian history, and she is regarded in Liberal circles as a good listener, strong communicator and as being able to take on significant undertakings for the government.

From 2015 to 2017, Ms. Freeland served as the international trade minister and oversaw the renegotiation of Canada’s free trade agreement with the European Union.

From January, 2017, to November, 2019, she held the Foreign Affairs portfolio and concluded the renegotiation of the North American free-trade agreement between Canada, Mexico and the United States.

Ms. Freeland is also a former journalist and author.

She expressed hope that her appointment will inspire other women and signalled that her focus is on crafting an economic recovery plan that includes a strong environmental focus and addresses the fact that the economic impact of the pandemic “is hitting women particularly hard.”

“I am conscious of the fact that I am Canada’s first woman Finance Minister,” she said. “It’s about time that we broke that glass ceiling. I’d like to say to all the Canadian women across our amazing country who are out there breaking glass ceilings: Keep going.”

Representing Canada during trade talks with the United States involved regular discussions with provincial and territorial premiers, who must approve aspects of any trade deals that fall under their jurisdiction.

As Deputy Prime Minister, the Alberta-born Ms. Freeland was assigned to keep working closely with the provinces on a range of issues including sensitive such as energy policy. That role increased substantially at the onset of the pandemic, as she was placed in charge of a special COVID-19 cabinet committee and was Ottawa’s main contact with the premiers to co-ordinate Canada’s pandemic response plan.

Ms. Freeland negotiated with the provinces on a federal pandemic support package, which increased from an initial offer of $14-billion to $19-billion when it was finalized in July.

“It’s very likely that all the premiers would share the perspective that Minister Freeland, in her previous roles, whether it was COVID or prior to that with trade discussions, was very willing to reach out to the premiers, me included,” Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister told The Globe and Mail Tuesday.

“I appreciated that dialogue and I think that’s going to be essential moving forward.”

Mr. Pallister said “of course I’m concerned” about the instability in Ottawa as the finance minister is replaced in the middle of a pandemic, but praised the fact that Mr. Morneau’s replacement was announced quickly.

Another Progressive Conservative Premier also had high praise for Ms. Freeland and her appointment as Finance Minister.

“There’s no secret, I think the world of Chrystia,” Ontario Premier Doug Ford told reporters at an event in Scarborough that included a call for more federal funding for public transit.

“I sent her a message this morning. She was strong as Deputy Prime Minister, and if there is one person I have confidence in, it’s Chrystia Freeland, that we can work together, we can sit down, pick up the phone. And one of the first phone calls – I’ll let her get settled in – but we need money for the transit system,” he said. “There’s no better person I’d want to work with than Chrystia Freeland. She’s going to do an incredible job. She’s a good friend and I can’t wait to start working with her to move our projects forward.”

Jerry Dias, the president of Unifor, said Tuesday that he worked hand-in-hand with Ms. Freeland during the renegotiation of the new U.S. free-trade agreement. Mr. Dias said she will bring a broad understanding of people to her new role as Finance Minister.

“She is deeply principled ... I watched her dealing with the United States, I watched her dealing with [U.S. President Donald] Trump on the softwood lumber dispute. I watched her deal with the aluminum tariffs during the [free-trade] debate,” he said. “I know her. I respect her.”

Committees — Committees, including special and legislative committees, cease to exist. Membership on committees, except the membership of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, is terminated and all chairs and vice-chairs no longer hold these positions.

Documents — No document may be tabled until the first day of a new session.

Quote — ""Prorogation of a session brings to an end all proceedings before Parliament. With certain exceptions, unfinished business 'dies' on the Order Paper and must be started anew in a subsequent session."" — House of Commons Procedure and Practice, Third Edition, 2017.

Length — Prorogation can be as short as a few hours, or as long as several months. During this period, the House of Commons and Senate are shut down but the government remains in power and MPs remain MPs.

Frequency — Most Parliaments are prorogued at least once and often there are several prorogations and sessions in the life of a Parliament.

Authority — Prorogation is ordered by the Governor General on the advice of the prime minister. It is not covered by statute. Rather it is a personal legal power of the Governor General and by convention the prime minister has the right to provide advice. And by convention it's actually the prime minister's decision.

Granted — Prorogation is routinely granted. In December 2008, then-governor general Michaelle Jean took a few hours before granting prorogation, but that was a thorny case because opposition parties were threatening to defeat the government and install a coalition government shortly after an election.

Ceremony — At one time, prorogation was done in a formal ceremony in the Senate chamber, but that hasn't been used in decades. A simple proclamation signed by the Governor General does the trick today.

Liberal promise — In their 2015 election platform, the Liberals said Stephen Harper's Conservatives ""used prorogation to avoid difficult political circumstances. We will not.""

Limits — Governments can't use prorogation to shut down Parliament indefinitely. That would violate the constitutional requirement that Parliament meet at least once every 12 months. And without Parliament to approve a budget and spending estimates, the government would run out of money.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau resigned suddenly from the Trudeau cabinet Monday evening, saying he never intended to run in the next election and that a new finance minister is needed to oversee the long-term economic recovery from the pandemic.

The announcement came in the wake of recent reports of tension and policy disagreements between the Finance Minister and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

He said the Prime Minister had not asked him to resign. Mr. Morneau did not directly address the notion that tensions existed.

Mr. Morneau said he intends to put his name forward as the next secretary-general of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) with Mr. Trudeau’s endorsement.

Mr. Trudeau released a statement afterwards praising Mr. Morneau and pledging that Canada will “vigorously support” his OECD campaign. Neither man provided any public indication that they were at odds.

The Prime Minister is planning to announce a new finance minister “shortly,” two senior government officials told The Globe and Mail. The officials, who are not being identified by The Globe because they are not authorized to comment publicly on the matter, said Mr. Morneau’s replacement will not be former Bank of Canada and Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, who has recently been advising the government in an informal capacity.

Current Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne and Treasury Board President Jean-Yves Duclos are viewed in Ottawa as possible candidates.

The finance minister and his staff are the key point of contact in government for executives at Canada’s largest banks, who have generally forged solid relationships with Mr. Morneau, according to sources familiar with banks’ frequent contact with the Finance Ministry during his tenure. The Globe is not identifying the sources because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.

Among bankers, Mr. Morneau was seen as a rare but important voice of restraint and fiscal discipline, serving as a counterbalance to some of the government’s more free-spending instincts, the sources said.

The loss of that voice, in the midst of planning for the next phase of the economic recovery from the pandemic, marks an unsettling turn to many in Canada’s financial sector, they said.

Goldy Hyder, the president and CEO of the Business Council of Canada, said that business leaders thanked Mr. Morneau for his service to Canada and for his commitment to sound public policy over the past five years in extremely challenging circumstances.

“Canada needs strong and steady leadership during these extraordinary times to help ensure a healthy and durable economic recovery,” Mr. Hyder said in a statement while he wished him well for his bid to become the next OECD secretary-general.

Financial market reaction was muted, according to BMO chief economist Doug Porter, who pointed to a momentary decline of 0.2 per cent in the Canadian dollar after the announcement.

“Any serious market reaction is likely to await the announcement of a replacement, and thus any related potential shift in policy direction,” he said in a note.

At the news conference on Parliament Hill, Mr. Morneau told reporters that he met with the Prime Minister earlier in the day to inform him that he would not be running in the next election. That vote is scheduled for the fall of 2023, but could come sooner given that the Liberals only hold a minority of seats in the House of Commons.

Mr. Morneau said he never intended to run in more than two elections and that the next phase of Canada’s economic recovery from COVID-19 requires a finance minister who can oversee the plan over the next several years.

“That’s why I’ll be stepping down as finance minister and as Member of Parliament for Toronto Centre,” he said.

“It’s been a real privilege to have this job. But like any job, there’s a time where you’re the appropriate person in the role, and the time where you have to decide when you’re not the appropriate person in the role.

“Since I’m not running again, since I expect that we will have a long and challenging recovery, I think it’s important that the Prime Minister has, by his side, a finance minister who has that longer-term vision. And so that’s what led me to conclude, during this time period, that it’s appropriate for me to step down.”

He is the only Finance Minister that Mr. Trudeau has had since his government came to power in 2015.

Mr. Trudeau thanked Mr. Morneau for his service, adding that he counted on the minister’s leadership, advice and close friendship over the years.

“Bill, you have my deepest gratitude and I know you will continue making great contributions to our country and for Canadians in the years to come,” Mr. Trudeau said.

Mr. Morneau had yet to release a 2020 budget. Plans to table one in March were shelved as the severity of the pandemic set in. In July, he released a fiscal “snapshot” that revealed the deficit for the current fiscal year is projected to reach $343.2-billion. He said a further update would be released in the fall.

Mr. Morneau entered politics in 2015 after leading Morneau Shepell, the Toronto-based pension-management and employee-benefits company originally founded by his father.

He put his pension expertise to work immediately as finance minister, securing a national agreement with the provinces and territories to expand the Canada Pension Plan, an achievement that had eluded his predecessors. He also played a central role in negotiating the federal government purchase of the Trans Mountain pipeline from Kinder Morgan in 2018.

His relationship with Canada’s small-business owners took a major hit however after he announced a package of tax changes in 2017 that many owners felt were unfair, leading the government to back away from several elements of the original plan.

Last Tuesday, The Globe reported that sources said Mr. Trudeau was not committed to keeping Mr. Morneau on as the key architect of the federal government’s economic revival plan after the two clashed over the Finance Department’s policy responses to the COVID-19 crisis.

Insiders said that Mr. Trudeau was uncertain whether Mr. Morneau was the right fit to steer the country into a postpandemic economic recovery.

The Globe did not identify the sources because they were not authorized to speak publicly about Mr. Trudeau’s plans for a cabinet remake that could lead to the departure of Mr. Morneau.

The PMO issued a statement after last week’s Globe report that said Mr. Trudeau had full confidence in his Finance Minister.

Both the Conservatives and the NDP have expressed skepticism about reports of friction between Mr. Trudeau and Mr. Morneau and suggest it is a Liberal attempt to take the public focus off of the WE controversy.

The Ethics Commissioner is investigating Mr. Morneau and Mr. Trudeau over whether they breached the Conflict of Interest Act in relation to a now-cancelled contribution agreement of $543.5-million with the WE Charity that has been the source of a political firestorm for the Liberals this summer.

At a committee hearing into the issue last month, Mr. Morneau revealed that he had reimbursed $41,366 to WE Charity earlier that day for travel expenses that the group covered for personal trips his family took to Kenya and Ecuador in 2017, leading to his second public apology that month related to his involvement with WE.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said that Mr. Morneau’s resignation is further proof of a government in chaos.

Story continues below advertisement

Mr. Trudeau’s government is consumed by scandal at a time when Canadians are worried about their health and finances, Mr. Scheer said on Twitter, adding the departure is an attempt to try and save the Prime Minister.

“Scapegoating Morneau does not solve the problem,” he said. “As long as Trudeau is Prime Minister, the corruption will continue.”

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said in a statement that the Liberal government is losing a finance minister at the same time as it’s about to leave millions of Canadians on the Canada Emergency Response Benefit without any idea of how to pay the bills in August.

His party’s ethics critic, Charlie Angus, added that there wouldn’t be a finance minister in the world that steps down in the middle of the biggest crisis of the century and says it is the perfect time to look for other opportunities.

“He took the fall for the Prime Minister and he did it very loyally and he walked the plank,” Mr. Angus said in an interview. “This is about Justin Trudeau’s ethics crisis and it cost him his finance minister just like his last crisis [the SNC-Lavalin affair] cost him his justice minister.”

Former Liberal justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould, who resigned from Mr. Trudeau’s cabinet in the last Parliament over the SNC controversy, said on Twitter that resignation day is a tumultuous day by any measure and for many reasons whether it is voluntary or not.

“I have to think there is more to this story,” she said.

The frayed dynamic between the Prime Minister and his finance minister has been put under the microscope by political insiders who wondered if Mr. Morneau would be able to remain in his post.

Liberals were comparing the situation to the tense relationship between prime minister Jean Chrétien and his finance minister Paul Martin in the 1990s and early 2000s that created deep and long-lasting divisions in the party.

The Prime Minister’s former principal secretary Gerald Butts took to Twitter earlier on Monday to urge his former colleagues to “knock it off” unless they missed losing.

He said Liberals are more lethal to Liberals than are any competing partisans and that Canadians have “little patience for this stuff in the best of times, and these are not those.”

Michele Cadario, a consultant and former deputy chief of staff to Mr. Martin when he was prime minister, said there is always a “healthy tension” between a prime minister and a finance minister, who heads a department that views itself as the defender of the public purse.

“What is something that no one ever wants, and no one should want, is for any of those tensions to surface and for any of the sniping back and forth,” she said.

Ms. Cadario, who along with Jenni Byrne, a former deputy chief of staff to prime minister Stephen Harper, recently formed an organization to help companies recruit more women to boards of directors. After Mr. Morneau’s announcement, Ms. Cadario told the Globe that Ms. Freeland would be an “excellent” choice to replace Mr. Morneau.

“I very much hope that his resignation means Canada will have its first female finance minister,” she said. “It’s past time to crack that glass ceiling.”

The decision by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to shut down Parliament for six weeks could disrupt opposition efforts to probe the WE Charity controversy and mean the end of a special committee investigating the crisis in Canada-China relations, which the Liberals initially voted against creating.

Opposition MPs outnumber the members of the minority Liberal government on committees and can therefore override the governing party to call hearings, but Mr. Trudeau’s move to prorogue Parliament shuts down all committee activity until the new session begins Sept. 23. Even after that, there will likely be weeks of delay before committees resume operating.

Three different Commons committees were investigating the WE Charity controversy, including the finance committee, the ethics committee and the government operations committee. As standing committees, they will be reconstituted when Parliament comes back.

Trudeau prorogues Parliament until Sept. 23 after appointing Freeland Finance Minister

Prorogation of Parliament: what does it mean and what happens next?

‘Proroguing’ isn’t a dirty word in itself – but the power to reset Parliament demands our vigilance

“This makes the investigation go dark for six weeks,” Conservative finance critic Pierre Poilievre said.

The Conservative Party and New Democrats also registered serious concern Tuesday about the future of the Special Committee on Canada-China Relations. As a special committee created by a vote in the House of Commons, it would need to be voted back into existence when Parliament returns.

The committee was in the midst of preparing a report on the crisis in Hong Kong and was expecting to hear from former ambassador John McCallum in September. Any planned reports cannot be issued now.

For its part, the finance committee had planned to hold more meetings on the WE controversy in August and early September, according to Mr. Poilievre.

He accused Mr. Trudeau of proroguing to tamp down a controversy that has hurt his government. The Prime Minister could have held off on prorogation until the night before a planned Throne Speech this fall and let the committees keep operating, Mr. Poilievre said.

“Justin Trudeau is desperate to hide the truth,” Mr. Poilievre said.

Before taking power, Mr. Trudeau campaigned against using prorogation to avoid tough questions. “Stephen Harper has used prorogation to avoid difficult political circumstances. We will not,” the Liberal Party’s 2015 list of campaign promises said.

Still, an estimated 5,000 page of documents related to the WE Charity contract have been released. Mr. Poilievre said the clerk of the Common’s finance committee has made this commitment. The documents are being saved on USB sticks for committee members.

WE Charity is affiliated with several related charities and the for-profit ME to WE company. It has been embroiled in controversy since striking a deal with the federal government for a contract to run a $543.5-million program to pay students for volunteer work. The agreement was cancelled on July 3 amid conflict-of interest allegations against Mr. Trudeau.

The minority Liberal government opposed the formation of the China committee and voted against its creation in December, 2019, but it was outnumbered by opposition votes as the Bloc Québécois and NDP backed the Conservative motion. Relations between the two countries have deteriorated significantly since China locked up two Canadians in apparent retaliation for Ottawa’s arrest of a Huawei executive on a U.S. extradition request.

Conservative MP Garnett Genuis, who was a member of the Canada-China committee, said its dissolution interferes with an urgent need to issue recommendations on what Canada can do to help Hong Kong as the Chinese Communist Party cracks down on democratic freedoms in the former British colony.

NDP MP Jack Harris, another member of the China committee, said he’s angry about what has happened and will seek to resurrect it.

Peter Fragiskatos, a Liberal member of the committee, said he would like to see the China committee resume after prorogation. “I think the committee has done very good work and we’ve heard from some extremely strong witnesses who have given us a really good idea about the nature of the Canada-China relationship.”

Philippe Lagassé is associate professor at Carleton University. He researches the Westminster system.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has announced that Parliament will be prorogued until late September – and Canadians can be forgiven for thinking that this move is suspect.

Ever since Stephen Harper advised governor-general Michaëlle Jean to prorogue parliament in 2008, saving his minority Conservative government, the very word “prorogue” has been associated with controversy. Last fall’s aborted prorogation of the British Parliament by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, which the United Kingdom Supreme Court quashed in an unprecedented ruling, has only fuelled the sense that this is an illegitimate power.

Prorogation’s bad rap probably explains why Mr. Trudeau avoided proroguing the last Parliament altogether; nothing prevented him from proroguing, but not doing so set him apart from his predecessor. His decision now to prorogue until Sept. 23 – amid the simmering scandal over WE Charity and after the resignation of his finance minister – looks cynical as a result. Given that Parliament was to return in late September anyway, a prorogation of just over a month may not seem all that dramatic, but the fact that the committees holding hearings into the WE Charity will no longer be meeting is significant. Whether this is a fair characterization depends on the government’s ability to show it was necessary, and for Canadians to decide if they agree.

Trudeau prorogues Parliament until Sept. 23 after appointing Freeland Finance Minister

Prorogation of Parliament: What does it mean and what happens next?

But the mere mention of the word “prorogue” need not, on its own, trigger alarm bells. Prorogation does serve a purpose, and is usually deployed without nefarious intent. It is important to judge each prorogation on its own merits.

Prorogation ends a parliamentary session, allowing a new one to start. When a session is ended, all parliamentary business stops: Government bills that haven’t become law must be reintroduced, unless the House of Commons reinstates them, and committees cease to function, their inquiries halted, and they must be reconstituted when the new session begins. When Parliament resumes, the governor-general reads a new Speech from the Throne outlining the plans for the new session – allowing the government to highlight new priorities, with the deck cleared of parliamentary business to make room for them – before the legislature’s business gets under way again.

Prorogation, then, is an act of renewal within a single parliament. Used in this way, it shouldn’t raise eyebrows. If a parliament has been in session for a while, it may be time for a refresh.

The problem is that this power can be abused, especially in minority parliaments, to allow prime ministers to delay scrutiny, avoid votes of non-confidence or otherwise undermine the will of parliament. Mr. Harper’s 2008 prorogation prevented the opposition from bringing down his government and replacing it with a loose-knit and ultimately unstable coalition. On Dec. 30, 2009, Mr. Harper again prorogued Parliament, until March 3, 2010, leading critics to charge that he was interfering with a committee inquiry into Canada’s handling of Afghan detainees. The U.K. government’s attempted prorogation last year, meanwhile, was a naked effort to take back control of Brexit from Parliament.

Prorogations that last weeks or months are usually bad news. There’s no need for prorogations to last very long – Canada has no standard length, but the British average is eight calendar days – and Parliament should sit as often as it can. A long prorogation is obviously made worse when committees are looking into troubling government behaviour. Ending a parliamentary session when a vote of non-confidence is looming amounts to a constitutional crisis. When used in these ways, prorogation is the effective equivalent of what U.S. constitutional scholar Mark Tushnet calls “constitutional hardball,” employing legitimate powers in ways that violate wider norms.

Is there a way to prevent prime ministers from abusing prorogation? The 2008 prorogation led many to argue that Ms. Jean should have rejected Mr. Harper’s advice to prorogue. Had she done so, that would arguably have prompted Mr. Harper’s resignation, leading to a change of government before the Commons formally withdrew confidence. Tempting though it may be, expecting the viceregal representative to refuse a prime minister’s advice to prorogue – even if the government appears on the cusp of losing confidence – risks dragging the governor-general into partisan frays. In the end, Ms. Jean judged – rightly – that it was for the Commons to decide Mr. Harper’s fate, rather than make that decision herself.

Story continues below advertisement

Another option is to regulate prorogation in law. While the British Parliament can do whatever it wants with the prorogation prerogative, our legislature is more constrained, given our codified constitution. The power to prorogue Parliament belongs to the office of the governor-general under paragraph 41(a) of the Constitution Act, 1982, meaning that passing a law to terminate or modify the power would require the unanimous consent of all the provinces and the two Houses of Parliament. Imposing statutory limits on prorogation without a constitutional amendment would be legally dubious.

In a Canadian context, preventing improper prorogations depends on making them politically costly. Our heads of government should be named and shamed if they advise extended, tactical prorogations rather than short, purposeful ones. This isn’t a great solution, but it may be the only one we’ve got – now, it’s up to Canadians to decide if this prorogation is too long given the Trudeau government’s troubles.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is meeting with Bill Morneau on Monday amid questions about the extent of the federal government’s pandemic spending and the Finance Minister’s political fate.

The Prime Minister and Mr. Morneau are scheduled to meet in a bid to sort out their differences, Reuters news agency reported Sunday, citing sources who requested anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation.

The Monday meeting was reported first by Bloomberg.

Story continues below advertisement

Mr. Morneau’s office declined to confirm to The Globe and Mail that the discussion was to take place and it did not answer when asked about the Finance Minister’s relationship with the Prime Minister.

The Prime Minister’s Office also did not respond to requests to comment on Monday’s meeting.

The meeting marks a high-stakes moment for Mr. Trudeau and Mr. Morneau, who has served in his portfolio since 2015.

Two sources told The Globe on Sunday that the PMO has been going around the Finance Department to consult private-sector economists on what levels of government spending and deficit are tolerable to credit rating agencies.

On Tuesday, The Globe reported that sources said Mr. Trudeau is not committed to keeping Mr. Morneau on as the key architect of the federal government’s economic revival plan after the two clashed over the Finance Department’s policy responses to the COVID-19 crisis.

Mr. Trudeau was uncertain whether Mr. Morneau was the right fit to steer the country into a postpandemic economic recovery, insiders said.

The Globe and Mail did not identify the sources because they were not authorized to speak publicly about Mr. Trudeau’s plans for a cabinet remake that could lead to the departure of Mr. Morneau.

The PMO issued a statement after The Globe report that said Mr. Trudeau had full confidence in his finance minister.

In July, the Prime Minister’s Office was caught off guard when Mr. Morneau revealed he recently repaid $41,366 to WE Charity for expenses incurred on trips his family took with the organization to Kenya and Ecuador three years ago.

In testimony before a parliamentary committee, Mr. Morneau said his wife and daughter travelled to Kenya in the summer of 2017 to learn about WE school projects and that, later that year, he travelled to Ecuador with his family to see and participate in WE’s humanitarian work in that country.

The Ethics Commissioner is now investigating Mr. Morneau and Mr. Trudeau over whether they breached the Conflict of Interest Act. The probes stem from a now-cancelled contribution agreement of $543.5-million with the charity that has been the subject of much angst this summer for the Liberal government.

Nik Nanos, the founder and chief data scientist of Nanos Research, said in an interview that the minister of finance is usually one of the most powerful cabinet ministers sitting around the table and that whenever there is a disagreement between the minister and the prime minister it is “never good.”

Mr. Nanos also said the WE controversy had a significant negative impact on Liberal Party support. But he noted that weekly tracking by his firm is showing that the impact has been abated following the testimony of the Prime Minister and his chief-of-staff, Katie Telford, before a parliamentary committee.

“That was the key pivotal moment for the Liberals when they started to staunch the bleeding of support,” Mr. Nanos said.

Mr. Trudeau told the House of Commons finance committee on July 30 that WE Charity got “no preferential treatment” and he “pushed back” when he heard of the idea of the charity administering the program because he wanted to make sure the public service was ready to fully justify the choice.

Mr. Trudeau has also apologized for not recusing himself from cabinet discussions on the contribution agreement with the charity despite his family connections to the charity.

His wife, Sophie Grégoire Trudeau, is an ambassador for the organization and his mother and brother have both been paid for speaking engagements.

WE Charity has said that since 2016, the Prime Minister’s mother, Margaret Trudeau, has been paid about $312,000 in speaking fees and his brother, Alexandre Trudeau, received about $40,000. Ms. Grégoire Trudeau was paid $1,400 for one appearance, at an event in 2012.

Conservative finance critic Pierre Poilievre said Sunday the Prime Minister would have fired Mr. Morneau weeks ago for accepting the trip from the charity but said the problem has been that Mr. Trudeau would have to fire himself for his own ethical lapses.

Mr. Poilievre predicted Mr. Trudeau’s team would make a “forthcoming firing” of Mr. Morneau about a policy fight when there is no such row.

NDP ethics critic Charlie Angus said Sunday the Liberal government will be rocked by two damning reports from the Ethics Commissioner once released.

“They [PMO] have been sending signals ever since Morneau forgot about the $41,000 in flights, that they’re not happy with them, that there’s problems,” he said. “I think it’s that they know they can’t continue with Morneau.”

Lori Turnbull is the director of the School of Public Administration at Dalhousie University and the deputy editor of Canadian Government Executive magazine.

Back in 2015, Justin Trudeau’s Liberal Party ran on an ambitious platform that promised to do government differently. They proposed a fresh, modern take on what they defined as antiquated institutions: cabinet, the Senate, the electoral system and the appointments process.

The Liberals would go on to win a majority government, and in those early days, Mr. Trudeau spoke of his intent to employ a “government by cabinet” approach, which would trust and empower ministers to own their own files and do their jobs. He would support rather than script and second-guess the ministers in his gender-equal cabinet, whom he said he chose because of their personal and professional credentials rather than their loyalty to him or the Liberal Party. It would be on the basis of these qualities, he said, that he would pledge his confidence in his ministers.

But in that “antiquated” system of parliamentary governance in which we operate, the concept of “confidence” has tremendous significance. The legitimacy of a government ultimately depends on whether it holds the confidence of the elected legislature. Cabinet ministers serve in their roles as long as they enjoy the confidence of the Prime Minister. And while the meaning of confidence is hard to pin down with any degree of exactness, it is not achieved simply by meeting expectations with respect to competence or compliance with rules. Confidence goes deeper than that; it is synonymous with trust.

That’s relevant now, as we’ve been hearing a lot about confidence lately – and, in some cases, a possible lack thereof. A year after Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott resigned in connection with the SNC-Lavalin affair, with both citing a lack of confidence in the government’s handling of the issue, another high-profile cabinet minister – Bill Morneau, who has tended to the Canadian economy during the pandemic – announced Monday that he would be stepping down.

The Finance Minister’s departure comes amid probes by the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner and two standing House committees around a now-cancelled multimillion-dollar distribution arrangement between the federal government and WE Charity. Mr. Trudeau and Mr. Morneau, who failed to recuse themselves from cabinet’s decision despite family ties to WE Charity, have been at the centre of the controversy. In recent weeks, Mr. Trudeau has assured Canadians that his crisis-time Finance Minister had his “full confidence.” Now, he’s headed for the door.

In his evening news conference, Mr. Morneau – rather than the Prime Minister himself, notably – told Canadians that he was not pushed out. From an optics perspective, a voluntary resignation is the only version of events that remaining cabinet ministers could hope to defend. After all, how could the Prime Minister fire his most senior minister for the same kinds of mistakes he is alleged to have made himself on the same file?

On the other hand, keeping Mr. Morneau around wasn’t working, either: The Prime Minister’s frequent expressions of confidence in him sounded forced. And Mr. Trudeau’s words would’ve been more reassuring had he not been himself involved in the WE situation and if he hadn’t begun a public courtship of former Bank of Canada governor Mark Carney to assist with Canada’s economic recovery.

The WE scandal damaged Mr. Morneau’s reputation, but the fallout from that could have been managed. Still, it seemed to be the tipping point in the Prime Minister’s confidence in his Finance Minister, despite his ambitious visions of a new style of government.

The departures of Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Ms. Philpott were noteworthy for how they expressed a lack of confidence in the Prime Minister, rather than the other way around. And with Mr. Morneau – left out in the cold as he watched his boss make inroads with Mr. Carney, but apparently still interested in public service as he prepares to run for secretary-general of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development – there appeared to have been the same crisis of confidence.

For now at least, Mr. Morneau will be replaced in the finance portfolio by Chrystia Freeland, the “minister of everything” in whom the Prime Minister clearly has boundless confidence. He has hers, too: When asked to comment on her boss’s role in WE Charity, she said she has “complete confidence” in Mr. Trudeau. Her appointment will surely help the government reset itself, but Mr. Morneau’s departure remains a loud statement on what confidence means in Justin Trudeau’s “government done differently.”

BLAIR GABLE/Reuters

Outgoing Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer says his replacement must quickly put together a strong team in the Commons and for the next campaign, and he’s happy to offer whatever advice needed on that score.

But there are two other pieces of advice he hopes whoever is elected later this month will also find a way to heed: the need for a leader to communicate authentically and to break through into the cities and suburbs whose voters are essential if the Tories are to win a majority government.

“That is the critical ingredient,” he said Wednesday in a wide-ranging interview with The Canadian Press on what was his last day in the House of Commons as Opposition Leader.

By the time the House of Commons sits again, the Conservatives will have elected Andrew Scheer's replacement. Scheer spent just over three years as leader of the party but resigned in the aftermath of the last election when he failed to win a majority. The Canadian Press

His failure to win that majority sparked both an internal and external debate in the aftermath of the 2019 federal election that eventually led Mr. Scheer to resign, pending the result of the Conservative leadership race.

The vote is finally coming to an end Aug. 21, after being delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic, and four candidates are in the running: current MPs Erin O’Toole and Derek Sloan, former cabinet minister Peter MacKay and Toronto lawyer Leslyn Lewis.

Mr. Sloan and Ms. Lewis both come from the social conservative wing of the party. Both have promised that if they do win, they would include legislation curtailing access to abortion on their agenda.

Though Mr. Scheer promised he’d never allow a Conservative government to bring forward legislation on abortion, his own social conservative views on the subject were a flashpoint during the campaign.

Mr. MacKay once infamously called them an “albatross” hanging around the party’s neck.

Mr. Scheer dodged a question Wednesday on whether, if an avowed social conservative is elected as the next leader, the party would just find itself stuck dealing with the subject anew.

He said he still believes a prime minister can be a social conservative, and it’s only under the current Liberals that people who hold those views have come to be demonized in the public square.

Mr. Scheer is only the second permanent leader the Conservative Party of Canada has had since it was formed in a merger of the Canadian Alliance and Progressive Conservatives.

Stephen Harper became the leader of the new party in 2004, and would go on to lead the Tories through a succession of minority governments before winning a majority in 2011.

In the majority years, Mr. Scheer – who had first been elected an MP from Regina in 2004 – served as Speaker of the House of Commons, but when the Tories lost power in 2015 and Mr. Harper resigned, he decided to try for leadership.

He won in a squeaker of a vote in 2017.

“We ended up seeing a bit of a division, a potential division after the last leadership,” said Alberta MP Matt Jeneroux.

“Andrew Scheer came in, he kept this party together, he kept this party united. That’s really going to be his legacy.”

Story continues below advertisement

Mr. Scheer said Wednesday he does consider that an accomplishment, and a challenge that his replacement will face.

The race this time, by all accounts, has been far nastier inside caucus than in 2017.

But the context is also different than when Mr. Scheer took the helm that year.

The unprecedented situation forced by the COVID-19 pandemic means the next leader, if elected prime minister, could inherit a government with a historically high deficit, among other major economic and social challenges.

For a party that’s built its brand on keeping government small and costs down, it will require thoughtful policy, Mr. Scheer said.

“Many on the left are going to try to use the pandemic as a justification for a return to the failed policies of the past,” he said.

“One of the things I believe the next leader of the party here, and advocates for free market economics around the world, will have to do is rewin the battles that we won in the eighties.”

Then, communist and socialist states in Eastern Europe and elsewhere were flailing against the economic growth taking place in capitalist societies, he said, making it clear that the recipe for success isn’t more government intervention but letting people and markets take the lead.

“What we have to do in our party here in Canada is find a way to communicate that message in a way that people can appreciate and support,” he said.

The next leader needs to be mindful of the true communications challenge posed by political life, he said.

“You have to maintain your authenticity and still allow who you are to flow through and connect with people,” he said.

“But it’s also a very difficult environment because you have to always be polishing a message.”

One message that Mr. Scheer said he heard loud and clear late last fall was that he was missing too much in the lives of his five children.

It was a late-night kitchen conversation with his teenage son, Thomas, that cemented his decision to step down, a conversation that came as the fact he was using party funds to pay for their private school tuition was becoming a public issue.

That his kids were pulled into the political morass is part of the job, he said, but he hopes they will take away from the entire experience that politics can be a positive force.

“You go through a lot of criticism online, in the media, from your opponents but you can also have a tremendously positive impact on your community,” he said.

Mr. Scheer said he will remain the MP for Regina-Qu’Appelle, and will serve in whatever capacity the new leader requests.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer says his party will keep digging for answers on how the Liberals decided to award COVID-19 related support programs to organizations with close Liberal ties. Scheer says both the WE controversy and a decision to outsource a rent-relief program to a company that employs the spouse of the prime minister’s chief of staff are problematic. The Canadian Press

Yesterday, Morneau resigned but said he was not pushed out by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Mr. Morneau says long-term leadership is necessary to guide the country’s finances through an extended and challenging recovery from the pandemic. Morneau said he does not intend to run in the next federal election.

Today, the Prime Minister announced the federal government will prorogue Parliament, to return with a Speech from the Throne followed by a confidence vote on September 23. Documents related to the now-cancelled WE Charity contribution agreement will still be released.

With prorogation, all legislation and committee work dies. However, existing bills and committee studies are not necessarily ended for good, as MPs can approve motions that will reinstate bills and studies back to the stages they were at at the time of prorogation.

At a news conference on Parliament Hill, Mr. Trudeau said a reset is required for the government to help the country recover from the impacts of the pandemic. The prorogation is about gaining or testing the confidence of the House, he added.

The end of the CERB will leave a large number of unemployed workers with less generous benefits, potentially reducing consumer spending and adding uncertainty to Canada’s economic recovery.

Several economists project that hundreds of thousands of people will receive less than the $500 provided weekly under the CERB, a shift that could mean a slowdown in the pace of recovery.

The government aims to get more people to accept work that is available, without harming those who still need some degree of support – moving people off the CERB and on to an expanded EI program, or a “parallel benefit.”

Low-wage workers have been disproportionately hurt by the pandemic, with their employment dropping by 14.6 per cent from February to July, compared to a 2.6-per-cent drop for all other paid employees.

The Prime Minister’s Office says Justin Trudeau has “full confidence” in Bill Morneau to navigate Canada’s economy through the COVID-19 crisis, but did not say whether he would remain in the job after a cabinet shuffle expected in the coming weeks.

The Globe and Mail reported on Tuesday the Prime Minister is not committed to keeping Mr. Morneau as the key architect of the government’s economic revival plans after the two clashed over policy, and concerns about the minister’s involvement in the WE Charity scandal.

Facing intense media scrutiny and reaction from market analysts over whether Mr. Trudeau had lost confidence in the Finance Minister, the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) issued a statement on Tuesday afternoon affirming its support of Mr. Morneau.

“Of course the Prime Minister has full confidence in Minister Morneau, and any statement to the contrary is false,” the PMO said. “The Prime Minister knows that Minister Morneau and the entire team of cabinet ministers will keep up doing the work that Canadians rely on to get them through this pandemic.”

A senior government official said the PMO had to issue the statement because other media had interpreted The Globe story as meaning Mr. Morneau would be removed as finance minister when, in fact, no decision has been made.

The statement did not say Mr. Morneau would continue as finance minister if Mr. Trudeau shuffles his cabinet, as expected before the return of Parliament in September, but lauded him for his role during the coronavirus shutdown and for past economic measures, including reforms to the Canada Pension Plan.

“Since we formed government, Minister Morneau has worked relentlessly with all his colleagues, and closely with the Prime Minister, to deliver critical support for Canadians to build a strong and resilient economy,” the PMO statement said.

The Globe also reported on Tuesday that the PMO was surprised when Mr. Morneau revealed he recently repaid the WE organization about $41,000 in expenses for trips he and his family took with the charity. Senior officials told The Globe on Monday that he failed to let anyone in government know about the trips to Kenya and Ecuador in 2017. The Ethics Commissioner is investigating Mr. Morneau and Mr. Trudeau over a contract that was awarded to the charity.

The Globe is not identifying the senior officials or the other sources for this story because they were not authorized to speak publicly about Mr. Trudeau’s plans for a cabinet remake that could lead to the departure of Mr. Morneau, a Toronto businessman who was named Finance Minister in 2015.

A source who has regular contact with Mr. Morneau said on Tuesday that he and his staff were blindsided to find out Mr. Trudeau was debating the Finance Minister’s future and that the PMO has hurt his credibility at a crucial time. The relationship can’t be easily repaired unless the Prime Minister gives his personal and continued support to his Finance Minister, the source said.

On Monday, the Finance Minister’s office said Mr. Morneau has no plans to leave politics and is engaged in reviving the economy.

“Minister Morneau fully intends to keep working on the Prime Minister’s team and getting Canadians through the pandemic,” communications director Pierre-Olivier Herbert told The Globe.

Craig Alexander, chief economist of Deloitte Canada, lauded Mr. Morneau for his stewardship of the economy during the COVID-19 lockdown, but said he did not think the uncertainty over the Finance Minister’s future would rattle investor confidence in Canada.

“Mr. Morneau has done a very good job. He has been Finance Minister in a very difficult time, and the government’s response to the pandemic and the likely economic consequences was the right one,” he said. “I doubt markets are responding significantly to any of the political uncertainty at the moment.”

He said markets would wait to see if policies change.

“If the answer is that there is a change of leadership but it doesn’t suggest any change in the current government stance as the appropriate policy response to the current crisis, then markets are unlikely to to be significantly affected,” he said.

The federal government has provided $160-billion in direct COVID-19 support, and the deficit this fiscal year is projected to hit $343-billion, the largest shortfall since the Second World War.

Insiders said earlier this week that Mr. Trudeau is thinking about a possible new finance minister as he examines new stimulus and social safety net measures.

During the lockdown, the Prime Minister came to rely on Mark Carney, former governor of the Bank of England and Bank of Canada, for informal policy advice, and now on plans to revive the economy, sources said.

The sources did not deny that Mr. Carney could replace Mr. Morneau if he is interested, although he would need to win a seat in Parliament. Other contenders are Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne and Treasury Board President Jean-Yves Duclos, the insiders said.

The Prime Minister and Mr. Morneau disagreed over plans to move the Canada Emergency Response Benefit into a revamped and broader Employment Insurance Program, sources said. The PMO wants a two-year freeze on premiums, while Mr. Morneau prefers a one-year freeze to save money, sources said.

In the early rollout of coronavirus relief, Mr. Trudeau overruled Mr. Morneau on several important measures, including the Finance Minister’s preference for a 10-per-cent wage subsidy. The Globe reported in April that the subsidy was increased to 75 per cent under pressure from Mr. Trudeau. The Prime Minister also instructed Mr. Morneau to drop legislation that would have given the Finance Department extended taxing and spending powers until the end of 2021, sources have said.

Do it, and you’re on the hook when the prime minister inevitably ignores your request that he ruin his political career “for the sake of the country.”

It looks weak when it fails, which is every time, and it can also look ill-judged. A measure as drastic as resignation should reflect the severity of the justification for calling for it. It can’t be trotted out every time a scandal breaks without becoming meaningless.

Story continues below advertisement

The truth is, if a prime minister actually committed a misdeed heinous enough to merit his or her resignation, no one on the opposition benches would need to demand that it happen. There would be enough torsion energy coming from the public, and from within the PM’s own party, to load and fire the catapult.

The resignation issue came up last week when Yves-François Blanchet, the leader of the Bloc Québécois, called for the heads of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Finance Minister Bill Morneau, based on their poor (but not resignation-worthy, in our opinion) judgment in the WE Charity scandal. For good measure, he also demanded the resignation of Katie Telford, Mr. Trudeau’s chief of staff. (Mr. Morneau announced his resignation late Monday over an unrelated issue.)

Had Mr. Blanchet left it at that, no one would be talking about it this week. But he went a step further and vowed that he will attempt to trigger a general election this fall if his daring triple-resignation manoeuvre is rebuffed.

Given the historically low success rate of opposition leaders’ calls for resignations, Mr. Blanchet has now committed himself to tabling a no-confidence motion when the House resumes.

There’s no other way around it. The chances of Mr. Trudeau, his Finance Minister and his chief of staff resigning en masse over the WE Charity scandal were zero, and Mr. Blanchet knew it. If he wasn’t grandstanding, he should begin drafting his no-confidence motion immediately. Why procrastinate?

The reason Mr. Blanchet has decided to go this route isn’t exactly self-evident. For starters, it seems unlikely that another party would team up with the BQ this fall in order to give them the required votes to pass the motion.

The motion is a non-starter without the Conservatives, but the Official Opposition will still be breaking in a new party leader and probably won’t be eager to test the electoral waters so quickly. The NDP is low on funds and not in a solid position to campaign.

Story continues below advertisement

The most recent polling isn’t favourable, either. The Liberals are still leading all parties. If an election were called, Mr. Blanchet could see his attempt to dethrone the Prime Minister result in Mr. Trudeau winning a new mandate.

In spite of the weirdness of it, there is an upside to Mr. Blanchet’s gambit. In a likely unintended way, the leader of a party dedicated to Quebec independence has done a favour to Canadian democracy, by reminding voters that Mr. Trudeau leads a minority government, and that Parliament isn’t some vestigial memory of the Before Times.

Parliament, you say? What’s that?

It’s that institution in Ottawa that the Liberals have sidelined during the COVID-19 crisis.

Thanks to a Liberal motion supported by the NDP and the BQ, the House of Commons has been adjourned since March, except for emergency sessions to pass pandemic-related spending bills. Mr. Trudeau spent most of the crisis running the country by press conference outside his residence, free from the scrutiny of the House of Commons.

The only sop to accountability was a short-lived special COVID-19 committee that sat mostly by remote video technology. Opposition members were only allowed to ask questions about the pandemic; all other subjects were banned.

Story continues below advertisement

In short, the Liberals reduced Canada’s chief democratic institution to bystander status during the greatest public-health and economic emergency of modern times. And they did it with a minority government.

That’s just wrong. The Trudeau government has taken advantage of this crisis to rule as if it held a majority in Parliament. Mr. Blanchet’s threat of a no-confidence motion serves as an unexpected antidote to that, by reminding Canadian voters that this Prime Minister still has to answer to Parliament, and that the interests of our democracy come ahead of those of the Liberal Party.

What a weak Liberal bench. Chrystia Freeland apparently is the only one qualified (and I use that term very loosely) to assume any position that comes available. I wonder if she can moonlight as Governor-General as well? –Puma2

She is not qualified to be Finance Minister. Why her, with no financial background? Another bad decision by Justin Trudeau. –Imagine70

Jim Flaherty was a sociologist and a lawyer in a motor-vehicle accident and personal-injury litigation practice. Your sexism is showing. –FDionne

Finance Minister Bill Morneau resigns, insists he was not pushed by Trudeau

So the real question that has to be asked is: Does Bill Morneau’s resignation change the channel and take the focus off the WE Charity scandal? Far from it. In fact, it probably leaves many in the financial sector wondering exactly what lies ahead for Canada. It is extremely rare for a finance minister to resign in the middle of a crisis. -HeavyJetCaptain

I watched the press conference. He took it like a man, I respect that.

Having said that, I believe he was one Canada’s weakest finance ministers in recent history, he was certainly no Jim Flaherty or Paul Martin.

However, he was by far the best Justin Trudeau had for the position. With such a thin bench, I cannot see how this will work well for Canadians. –Uncle Fester

Bill Morneau is resigning as the federal minister of finance and a Liberal MP. Morneau says he is putting his name forward as a candidate to be the next secretary general of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. The Canadian Press

Nice. In other news: “Captain Edward Smith has announced that the White Star Line vessel RMS Titanic will be returning to Southampton – its port of origin – after striking an iceberg off the coast of Newfoundland late last night. Captain Smith expects that the return to port will be ‘uneventful.‘ ” –Calgary Republican

While he’s obviously made some mistakes, Bill Morneau is at least a serious person with real experience. I’d rather those people remain in cabinet than out. I’d prefer if it was the Prime Minister who resigned instead. –POPDAD19

The Liberal vessel of governance is ablaze and Canada’s future is burning with it.

Bill Morneau is headed for a Liberal Party lifeboat while Justin Trudeau remains on the bridge with his dedicated crew of progressive activists, steering a course toward a fiscal reef that is about to tear the bottom out of Canada’s economy.

It is unlikely this crew is about to go down with the ship, but there will be precious little succour for Canadians left to founder in the cold sea of financial disaster awaiting them. –sanctimonious

I supported the CERB – even the very weak eligibility controls. It was necessary in a crisis and cost a lot of money. Since then, the government has shown a desire to slosh money around without restraint. The payment to seniors – generally people with fixed incomes unchanged by COVID-19 – was unneeded and inexplicable. The whole WE Charity mess was worse.

I am not concerned about the apparent connections between Justin Trudeau and WE so much as the apparent lack of understanding that the money can run out. Canada is not Greece, and we have a manageable debt-to-GDP ratio. Even with a $343-billion deficit, we are not in bad shape. However, adding in provincial debts does make for a scarier scenario. Our government should understand that there is an eventual wall and stop sloshing money around to non-crisis recipients.

Story continues below advertisement

Also, all of this debt needs to be repaid – either through future taxes or the destructive effects of inflation. I am not sure Mr. Trudeau understands this. –michaelgreason

The political crisis of Bill Morneau’s resignation shows the Liberals at their worst

From my position, it appears Justin Trudeau’s vision of the future involves spending more money – lots more money, and Bill Morneau was reluctant to go along. Looks like the big spenders won the day. So I wonder: What does Mr. Trudeau want to spend more money on? How will the NDP view his vision? I think it’s time to be afraid. Very, very afraid. –BMracek

“Which leaves it up to the NDP. The party isn’t ready for an election. But how could Leader Jagmeet Singh prop up a government in such turmoil?”

Mr. Singh wields a lot of power in this minority government. He will likely prop up Justin Trudeau in exchange for even more deficit spending and higher taxes (the kind that will discourage investment and innovation needed for economic recovery).

Mr. Trudeau will likely get another free pass from voters and from the NDP, and this pattern will continue until the Conservatives can connect with younger voters. –billy112

This is par for the course for the Liberals. The voters sent them out to the wilderness for three straight election cycles because they couldn’t stop generating problems. It took them embracing Justin Trudeau to get back in the game.

Now it’s the Conservatives’ turn in the wilderness because of pretty much the same problem. Stephen Harper started thinking he was infallible, then the voters turfed him.

This is politics. It’s a vipers pit, and most voters learn quickly to cast a jaundiced eye to the whole process. –Since When

One Hezbollah suspect found guilty, three acquitted in death of former Lebanese prime minister Rafik Hariri

A member of Hezbollah has been found guilty by an international court of the 2005 car bombing that killed former Lebanese prime minister Rafik Hariri and 21 others. But it acquitted three other suspects, and ruled there was not enough evidence to link Hezbollah leadership or the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to the assassination.

Hariri, who was backed by Saudi Arabia, France and the United States, was killed as he was lobbying for an end to Syria’s 29-year military presence in Lebanon.

The verdict is likely to add to the tensions in the country, which had already been in deep political and economic crisis prior to the devastating explosion this month in Beirut that killed more than 180 people.

Calgary’s Attabotics gets $50-million from Teachers, Honeywell to expand its ant-inspired warehouse technology

Open this photo in gallery Scott Gravelle, CEO of Attabotics Jeff McIntosh/The Globe and Mail

The Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan is leading a $50-million (U.S.) investment into warehouse robotics company Attabotics Inc. to help the Calgary firm build out its client roster and technology – vertical storage structures inspired by ant colonies that it says can reduce warehouse footprints by as much as 85 per cent.

Attabotics has redesigned the traditional warehouse from horizontal to vertical and works with a growing number of brands, including the department store chain Nordstrom. Rather than running around endless aisles, Attabotics’s robots scour a single vertical structure to store and move goods to workers who handle packing and shipping.

Scott Gravelle and several partners launched Attabotics in 2015, naming it after Atta, one of the groups of species of leafcutter ants. After watching a documentary in which a scientist poured molten aluminum into an ant habitat, Mr. Gravelle realized that ants’ networks of tunnels and chambers took advantage of vertical pathways and storage.

Richard Gwyn was one of Canada’s most influential political journalists of the past 60 years. He worked at a number of outlets, from the old news agency UPI to Time Canada, but he was best known for his political and foreign affairs columns in the Toronto Star. Mr. Gwyn, who died on Aug. 15 at the age of 86, was also the author of seven books, including a two-volume history of Sir John A. Macdonald and The Northern Magus, a portrayal of the enigmatic prime minister Pierre Trudeau.

Most of all, he was a reporter, a man who never gave up on a story and often embarrassed his peers by beating them to a scoop. His first big exclusive came in 1958 when he was working in Ottawa for UPI.

“Gwyn scored a world exclusive that Princess Margaret, then 27, had asked that John Turner, a 29-year-old Montreal bachelor, be added to the guest list for an official ball in Vancouver in the summer of 1958, where they danced the night away,” said Bob Lewis, former editor of Maclean’s, who interviewed Mr. Gwyn for his book Power, Prime Ministers and the Press: The Battle for Truth on Parliament Hill.

“Richard was the journalist you wanted to be,” Mr. Lewis said. “You could never stay ahead of the guy.”

Mr. Gwyn, who became such a part of Canada’s political commentariat, was an alumnus of a British public school. He had one of those hyphenated surnames and never quite lost his English accent, though he did drop the hyphen once he landed in Canada.

Richard John Philip Jermy-Gwyn was born on May 26, 1934, in Bury St. Edmunds, a picture-book English town 130 kilometres northeast of London. He was the son of Brigadier Philip Jermy-Gwyn, an army officer who served in India, and the former Elizabeth Edith Tilley. Young Richard went to Stonyhurst, a private Jesuit school for the Anglo-Catholic elite. He remained a Catholic all his life.

He next went to Sandhurst, the British military school, but soon left for Canada. He was 19 and found life in postwar Britain stifling. His first stop was Newfoundland, where he eked out a living selling subscriptions to a Catholic magazine. He then landed a job at a Halifax radio station. On the ferry over, he met Sandra Fraser, the Newfoundland-born woman who became his wife and literary partner.

They went on to become the journalistic power couple of Ottawa, she as a writer and contributing editor for Saturday Night magazine, he as a high-profile columnist for the Toronto Star. Both became officers of the Order of Canada; she won the Governor-General’s Literary Award, and he was nominated for the same honour.

After a stint in Ottawa’s press gallery, Mr. Gwyn went on to be executive assistant for the Liberal minister of communications, Eric Kierans. Two years later, he moved into the civil service under deputy minister Allan Gotlieb. Most people who leave journalism for such jobs never return. But Mr. Gwyn, fortified with insider knowledge of how government worked, returned to work as a journalist, eventually joining the Toronto Star.

When the paper hired Mr. Gwyn for its Ottawa bureau, the managing editor, Martin Goodman, told him: “What we’re looking for from you is a sense of the inside.” He delivered on that. Mr. Gwyn didn’t wait for something to pop up in Question Period or hang around the media scrums. He was out digging, using his contacts with civil servants, politicians and their army of aides.

In 1984, other columnists mused about when an election might be called. He gleaned the date through a careful analysis of inside dope, not guesswork. He knew that prime minister John Turner had flown to London to meet secretly with the Queen, asking her to postpone her visit because he wanted to call an election. “Circle the date September 4 on your calendars,” he wrote in his column. The prime minister’s office denied it all. But when the election was called, it fell on the date Mr. Gwyn had predicted.

In 1985, Mr. Gwyn was posted to England as the Star’s international affairs columnist. He covered everything from the fall of the Berlin Wall to the end of apartheid in South Africa. He returned to Canada in 1992.

Ian Urquhart, a former managing editor of the Toronto Star, said in addition to being a natural journalist, Mr. Gwyn had two great strengths: “He worked in government for five years, so he had insights most of us didn’t have. And he had the perspective of an outsider, coming from England as he did,” Mr. Urquhart said.

That outsider’s point of view applied not only to Mr. Gwyn’s journalism but to his books on Canada. Mr. Urquhart remembers being at a book launch for one of Mr. Gwyn’s volumes on Sir John A. Macdonald when he was chatting with University of Toronto historian Michael Bliss.

“Michael said to me: ‘Richard has put the professional historians of Canada to shame,‘” Mr. Urquhart recalled.

John Honderich, editor and then publisher of the Toronto Star, said above all Mr. Gwyn was a hard-working reporter.

“His genius was to take two giant steps back and analyze the situation. He was incredibly reliable, and he was a great digger. Pundits today do it off the top. Richard always did the work. He was a great reporter,” Mr. Honderich said.

The author Charlotte Gray says Mr. Gwyn was helpful and generous to colleagues.

“At one point, someone plagiarized one of his books, but he thought the novel was so good, he never said anything,” said Ms. Gray, who was Mr. Gwyn’s friend. “He didn’t pass a lot of moral judgments. He was quite amused when Sir John A. Macdonald or Joey Smallwood flirted with scandal. He was a pragmatist and understood what politics requires.”

Mr. Gwyn was also a force on television even though he was not naturally telegenic. He did several programs at TVO, the Ontario public TV network, starting with Realities, a program he did with journalist Robert Fulford. From 1994 he was a regular on Studio 2, the daily current-affairs program on TVO. That was so popular TVO expanded it to a program called Diplomatic Immunity, where he would appear with his fellow panelists, Eric Margolis and Janice Stein.

Steve Paikin said Mr. Gwyn was a natural on television.

“The guy could communicate. He could organize his thoughts well and articulate them well, and he played well with others. He could disagree with somebody else if he was in the midst of a debate without being personal or resorting to ad hominem attacks. That’s what made him so good at what he did,” Mr. Paikin said.

“Richard was a particular kind of guy. He didn’t know about sports, nothing about the Leafs or the Blue Jays, he didn’t golf, and as a result, his passion in life was issues, the country and the world. Policy, thinking, writing and reading were the things that he loved to do, and he could do all of them with the best of them,” Mr. Paikin said.

Mr. Gwyn was modest about his success. He said he was lucky to be born when he was, 11 years before the start of the postwar baby boom.

“The big thing in life is to time your birth. I was just ahead of the baby boomers. You didn’t have to worry about getting jobs. [Today] I would be struggling,” he told Mr. Lewis.

Mr. Gwyn felt he was lucky to come to Canada.

“The Canadian values of tolerance, civility, and decency are precious and are becoming more and more rare the world over,” he wrote in 1997. In one of his last columns in the Toronto Star in 2016, he said: “For some time now, it’s been obvious that Canada is one of the most successful countries in the world.”

Mr. Gwyn stopped writing and appearing on television as he realized he was suffering from dementia. He leaves his wife, Carol Bishop-Gwyn.",1396,0.8984023704165416,politics

Poland’s Health Minister Lukasz Szumowski said on Tuesday he was resigning from his post, the second resignation in two days from the ministry, which has faced growing criticism for its handling of the coronavirus crisis.

Szumowski’s approach in the early stages of the pandemic made him Poland’s most trusted politician in April, but his image has been dented by scandals surrounding the purchase of ventilators and masks.

Szumowski has denied any wrongdoing.

“I would like to inform you that today I am resigning … I decided it was that time,” he told a news conference, adding that he had initially planned to resign early this year but had stayed on to deal with the developing crisis.

Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki later on Tuesday said that he would announce the new health minister’s name by the end of the week.

The announcement came a day after Deputy Health Minister Janusz Cieszynski announced he was leaving the ministry.

Both Szumowski and Cieszynski had faced calls to quit over alleged irregularities in buying masks and purchases of ventilators which did not arrive.

Poland has seen a spike in coronavirus cases in recent weeks, driven in part by outbreaks among coal miners.

The country of 38 million has reported a total of 57,876 coronavirus cases and 1,896 deaths.

It was the explosion that shook Beirut, 15 years before another one levelled entire neighbourhoods of the city. On Tuesday, an international court finally delivered something like justice for the first blast, finding a single Hezbollah member guilty of carrying out the 2005 car bombing that killed former Lebanese prime minister Rafik Hariri and 21 others.

It was a verdict that satisfied few, while adding to the already sky-high tensions in Lebanon. The country’s deep political and economic crises were exacerbated by a massive Aug. 4 explosion in the port of Beirut, which killed 180 people and made 300,000 others homeless.

The more recent disaster is believed to have been caused by an unattended stockpile of ammonium nitrate. Many Lebanese blame Hezbollah – which is widely believed to have used the port for smuggling and storing weapons, and which wields wide influence over a government that ignored repeated warnings about the impending disaster – for both explosions.

The United Nations-backed Special Tribunal for Lebanon ruled that one Hezbollah member, 57-year-old Salim Ayyash, who was tried in absentia, was guilty of five charges related to the assassination of Mr. Hariri. It was an act that rattled this country to its core, and helped ignite sectarian tensions across the Middle East.

But The Hague-based tribunal acquitted three other suspects, and ruled there was not enough evidence to link either the Hezbollah leadership or the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to the crime.

Mr. Hariri, who was backed by Saudi Arabia, France and the United States, was killed as he was lobbying for an end to Syria’s 29-year military presence in Lebanon. Following the assassination, hundreds of thousands of Lebanese took to the streets in protests that forced the Syrian army’s withdrawal from the country a few months later.

Leaders fear crisis sparked by Beirut blast could lead to civil war

But Hezbollah has remained, and has tightened its grip on this deeply divided country. Hezbollah is backed by Iran, and its supporters are almost uniformly Shia Muslims; Mr. Hariri was Lebanon’s most prominent Sunni politician.

The 57-year-old Mr. Ayyash, who has yet to be sentenced, is believed to still be at large in the Hezbollah stronghold of southern Lebanon. The group’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, has dismissed the special tribunal as a tool of Western powers, and has said the group will ignore the verdict.

Speaking in The Hague after Tuesday’s ruling, Mr. Hariri’s son, Saad, called for Hezbollah to hand over Mr. Ayyash. “Nobody should expect any more sacrifices from us. We have sacrificed what is dearest to us. … Hezbollah is the one that should make sacrifices today,” he said. “We will not rest until punishment is served.”

There was palpable tension in Beirut, where a state of emergency has been in place since shortly after the port explosion. Soldiers drove in long convoys, circling through empty streets that would normally be clogged with traffic.

Anti-government protesters, who had planned to march Tuesday toward the official residence of President Michel Aoun, an ally of Hezbollah, called off their demonstration amid concerns that emotions were already too high in the country. “We’re trying not to be hot-headed,” said Karl Karam, a key organizer of the protests, which are affiliated with none of the sectarian political blocs.

Instead, a crowd of several hundred of Mr. Hariri’s supporters gathered at his tomb in the centre of the city to listen to the verdict as it was read out over loudspeakers that were mounted on top of a white van. The conviction of a single Hezbollah member did little to satisfy their desire for justice. “The person convicted belongs to an organization with a very strict hierarchy,” said 29-year-old May el-Masri, a member of Future Youth, a pro-Hariri movement. The conviction of one member, she said, means “Hezbollah is accused.”

The court didn’t go quite as far, saying only that “the evidence also established that Mr. Ayyash had affiliation with Hezbollah.”

In a 2,600-page verdict that took some five hours to read, the judges said they had been convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Ayyash was the owner of one of six mobile phones that were critical in ordering and co-ordinating the attack. The owners of the six mobile phones “had access to what could be described as ‘military grade explosives,’ "" and had “knowingly agreed to murder Mr. Hariri,” the court found. “They are thus co-conspirators.”

However, the tribunal ruled that the evidence against three other suspects – Assad Sabra, Hassan Habib Merhi and Hassan Oneissi – was “insufficient” to prove they were among the users of the other mobile phones.

Charges against a fifth suspect, Mustafa Badreddine, a top Hezbollah commander, were dropped after he was killed while fighting in Syria in 2016.

“We acknowledge that this verdict may not bring the closure desired by many in Lebanon. However, today’s verdict upholds the principle of accountability and serves as a small but significant step forward in the continued pursuit for democracy, justice and security in Lebanon,” Global Affairs Canada said in a statement. Ottawa contributed $8-million to the special tribunal in the 11 years since it was established, and several RCMP officers were seconded to the investigation.

Presiding Judge David Re said the tribunal – a panel of 15 Lebanese and international judges that made its base in the Netherlands for security reasons – had determined that “Syria and Hezbollah may have had motives to eliminate Mr. Hariri, and some of his political allies.” But, Judge Re added, “there is no evidence that the Hezbollah leadership had any involvement in Mr. Hariri’s murder and there is no direct evidence of Syrian involvement.”

Mohammed Obeidi, a political analyst seen as close to the Hezbollah leadership, said the tribunal was wise to focus on the guilt or innocence of the accused individuals, rather than the Hezbollah leadership. “This is very important, because that means they are not going to antagonize the political and security system in Lebanon. This is not important for Hezbollah – this is important for Lebanon.”

The verdict was a disappointment for those who believe Hezbollah is responsible not only for the killing of Mr. Hariri, but also a string of other assassinations that have targeted pro-Western political figures.

“There is a serial killer in Lebanon, made up of Hezbollah and the Syrian machine. I escaped, but many died,” Marwan Hamadeh, a former cabinet minister and political ally of Mr. Hariri’s, told The Globe and Mail before the verdict was announced. Mr. Hamadeh survived a 2004 car bombing that killed his bodyguard. Mr. Ayyash also stands accused of that attack, in a separate case before the same special tribunal.

Nayla Tueni, the chief executive officer of the an-Nahar newspaper, said Tuesday’s verdict and the form of accountability it brought were nonetheless important for Lebanon, especially in the wake of the port explosion.

“But I am worried, of course. I am worried every second in this phase about what will happen,” said Ms. Tueni, whose father Gebran was killed in another car bomb, 10 months after Mr. Hariri’s death. “We do not know what price we Lebanese will pay.”

The gravitas of the moment was not lost on the former journalist and mother of three. After she spoke the English words of her oath of office, she paused to take a deep breath, before repeating the oath in French.

""It's about time,"" Freeland said later at a press conference on Parliament Hill.

She said a feminist agenda has been a key part of the Liberal government, and she is glad to be able to bring her experiences as a woman and a mother to the COVID-19 economic recovery she will now lead.

Lori Turnbull, a politics professor and director of the school of public administration at Dalhousie University in Halifax, said for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to put Freeland in the role is the most substantive move he has made yet to back up his self-proclaimed feminist agenda.

But, Turnbull said, Freeland is not there as a token woman.

""There are very few people on the political scene in Canada who have proven themselves like she has,"" said Turnbull. ""She is a fantastic choice for finance minister. He knows that.""

Freeland, 52, has spent the last five years earning a solid reputation both inside and outside of cabinet, first in international trade, then foreign affairs before she was promoted to deputy prime minister and intergovernmental affairs after the 2019 election.

She was credited with leading the successful, though at many times testy and fraught renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, holding so firm against the often unpredictable whims of U.S. President Donald Trump, she managed to get under his very thin skin.

""We don't like their representative very much,"" he said of her in September 2018.

Just two weeks earlier, Freeland poked the Trump bear directly, arriving in Washington, D.C., for last-ditch trade talks wearing a T-shirt her kids had given her for Christmas the year before. Splashed across the front of the shirt, in bold black letters, it said ""Mama (does not equal) chopped liver."" On the back it said ""Keep Calm and Negotiate NAFTA.""

When Trudeau named her deputy prime minister in 2019, he also gave her a mandate letter that had her take the reins on some of his government's biggest, but also most politically tricky, policies: negotiating new health-care agreements with the provinces, climate change and the carbon tax, an assault rifle ban and reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples.

While no longer foreign affairs minister, she also retained responsibility for the Canada-U.S. relationship, and as intergovernmental affairs minister, she was dispatched to soothe over the Trudeau government's open sores with mostly conservative provincial premiers.

And while she represents a wealthy, central Toronto riding, she was born and raised in northern Alberta. Those roots mean she has been tasked with bringing some Alberta perspective to the cabinet table. The Liberals didn't elect a single MP in that province and the western anger centred in Alberta over the Trudeau government's energy policies runs loud and deep.

""She's a Swiss-army knife of cabinet ministers,"" joked Greg MacEachern, a former Liberal ministerial staffer and now a senior vice-president at government-relations firm Proof Strategies.

He said to see how effective Freeland is, one need look no further than how much the Ottawa-Ontario relationship has changed with her lead.

""Not that long ago, Premier Ford and the Liberal prime minister were using each other as battering rams,"" said MacEachern.

On Tuesday, Ontario Premier Doug Ford was one of Freeland's biggest fans.

""There's no one that would be better in that role than Chrystia Freeland,"" Ford said.

While Ford's federal counterparts were dismissing Freeland's appointment as part of the same old Liberal story, Ford offered both the federal government and Freeland his full support.

""I just want to wish them all the best because they're partners with us,"" he said. ""And I absolutely love Chrystia Freeland. She's amazing. I'll help her. I sent her a message, congratulations. I'm there. I'll have her back. I'll help her any way we can.""

She was also welcomed by some of the Liberals' biggest critics in the business world. Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, has been highly critical of the pandemic response for small businesses.

""What I like best about (Freeland) in Finance is her proven ability to work with people, even when there are areas of disagreement,"" Kelly said on Twitter. ""This has been missing in the department for several years.""

MacEachern said Freeland also has something else outgoing Finance Minister Bill Morneau did not: good and close relationships with many backbench Liberals.

While Morneau went into cabinet immediately upon his election to Parliament in 2015, Freeland had spent time before that as one of just three dozen Liberal MPs when the party sat in third place in Parliament.

Freeland, who worked as a journalist in Canada, the United States, Ukraine and the United Kingdom, was persuaded by Trudeau to enter politics in 2013 to run in a byelection in Toronto Centre. She won, and in 2015, after ridings were rejigged, she ran and won a second time in the neighbouring riding of University-Rosedale.

Trudeau said Tuesday that she had been ""a key player in my government from day one.""

The WE Charity scandal highlights an important principle that seems to have fallen out of fashion lately: Charities, government and politicians are not in the same business, nor should they be.

As is now well known, the Trudeau Liberals contracted WE Charity to deliver, on its behalf, the Canada Student Service Grant program. That decision has been widely panned on ethical grounds, specifically in relation to alleged conflicts of interest.

There are other questions raised here about the proper role of charities. Why do we have them, and are they becoming too enmeshed with government and politics?

Canadian law treats its approximately 90,000 registered charities with incredible favour. Registered charities are generally exempt from income tax. Qualifying donations to registered charities attract generous income-tax credits. These tax concessions cost the public treasury billions in forgone revenue every year. And that is just the tip of the iceberg. There are also property-tax concessions and innumerable other exemptions from onerous rules of law. All told, the law does a lot to promote the institution of charity.

Why do we invest so much in charities?

We presumably do not do this just so charities can deliver government programming as standby independent contractors. We have a capable government work force to do the work of government. Neither do we have charities to help brand politicians. We have political parties for that purpose.

Charities are about something different. Charitable donors establish and fund scholarships. They help remedy food insecurity. They fund medical research. They support the arts, museums, animal welfare, human rights, the environment, education, religion and so much more.

Governments have long since occupied many of these fields as well. But there is a big difference: Governments mandate financial contribution through compulsory taxation. Charities are about the voluntary choice to share with others outside of the government.

Having to pay (via taxes) and choosing to share (via donations) are fundamentally distinct avenues for the flow of money. Donors voluntarily make the morally valuable choice to tangibly affirm, through charitable giving, the equal worth, value and dignity of their end beneficiaries.

Story continues below advertisement

A large part of what we are endorsing through the promotion of charity is the other-centredness and voluntarism that lie at the heart of true charity. These are worth supporting. Of course, they are also the very things that get muted when charities become too entangled with government and politics.

While this entanglement has long been a concern, it has intensified in recent years.

In their first mandate, the Trudeau Liberals enacted tax reforms that effectively allow charities to operate as full-time lobbyists. Prior to that, charities could only engage in limited advocacy. Charities definitely have a valuable role to play in public policy development. But where is the charity if the only activity is advocating for governmental intervention?

Now through the WE Charity debacle, we see a continued blurring of the boundaries. This is certainly not the first time a government has utilized a charity for program delivery. But there is a whiff here of the use of charity for political branding. The political prize in this game may not have been outsourced efficiency, but rather the halo effect of the government’s public partnership with a well-connected progressive charity.

The political response throughout was that only by contracting with WE Charity could the government achieve its objectives. That, of course, depends upon how you define those objectives. If political branding was one of the goals, then the statement is true. But then so much for the other-centredness that defines true charity.

We would do well to keep charity, government and politics separate. Otherwise, charity risks becoming yet another limb of government or cog in the political wheel. And what, then, would be the point of it all?

In 2005, philosopher Harry Frankfurt wrote a bestseller titled On Bullshit. In a tight 80 pages, the Princeton University professor defines his subject as speech whose goal is persuasion without regard for the truth.

When Finance Minister Bill Morneau suddenly announced his resignation on Monday night, the words he was forced to use – starting with the howler that this was a long-planned, voluntary “resignation” – were of the genus explored by Mr. Frankfurt. As were high-level government leaks, each more Frankfurtian than the last, which over the previous week had been designed to besmirch Mr. Morneau and set the stage for his departure.

Like someone emerging into the light after a long Maoist struggle session, on Monday night Mr. Morneau said that his abrupt leave-taking was, in fact, part of a “plan” he’d had since entering politics. He’d always intended to serve for only two terms. And so, in the middle of an economic crisis on which he was the lead minister, just 10 months after re-election and with the next fixed election date 38 months away, he had to resign. Immediately.

And in any case, leaving would give him time to apply for his real dream job: secretary-general of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. So, it was time to go. After a hastily called news conference. With Prime Minister Justin Trudeau not in attendance, but tweeting out fulsome praise – all the sincerity of a drugstore condolence card; all the personalization of a form letter – for someone his minions had spent the previous week smearing.

The explanation for Mr. Morneau’s surprise “resignation” is as covered in Frankfurt as Mr. Trudeau’s surprise claim last month, before a House of Commons committee, that when he found out WE Charity was about to be awarded a huge contract, he “pushed back” and demanded more due diligence. If that’s what happened, then why didn’t the PM and the ministers and bureaucrats defending him say a word about it, for weeks? Why was the most exculpatory explanation not the first thing he had to say, but the last?

In the parliamentary system, cabinets get shuffled, and ministers with them. It happens. There’s no reason for there to be anything dishonourable about the business. Mr. Morneau, the only finance minister the Trudeau government has ever known, has been in the job for nearly five years. It was a long run. It was a good run. If the PM felt it was time for a change, a change could have been made with grace.

If the PM believed Mr. Morneau’s oversights on the WE file demanded a resignation, that could have been done, too. Apologize for the error, step down, do time in the penalty box and eventually return to the ice. In the old tradition of ministerial responsibility, that’s how it went. Though, owing to Mr. Trudeau’s similar, bigger WE problem, perhaps that couldn’t be given as the public reason for Mr. Morneau’s removal.

And if this was about making room for Mark Carney – opening up a safe Liberal seat, and the most powerful ministry – then why not just say that? The government could sell it as going from strength to strength. Ditto for moving Chrystia Freeland into Finance.

But that’s not how this went down. Instead, anonymous Liberal sources were dispatched to insinuate that the Trudeau government was Animal Farm, and Mr. Morneau was Snowball. The tale being shopped around last week was that the erstwhile Finance Minister of The Middle Class and Those Working Hard to Join It had secretly been working hard to stick it to hard-working Canadians – and it was only thanks to the PM’s intervention against this Conservative mole in his cabinet that Ottawa’s generous pandemic economic bailout package came to be.

Who comes up with these whoppers? But these off-the-record allegations against Mr. Morneau do serve a purpose, namely aiming to brand the next election as a binary choice between open-the-taps Liberals and cut-now Conservatives. Right-leaning commentators have unwittingly furthered this rebranding, by repeating it as gospel.

However, the trouble with a government smearing its most prominent minister is that, in trying to dirty him, it has mostly soiled itself.

In a Trudeau cabinet of spokesmodels – men and women who dutifully recite whatever script is handed them – Mr. Morneau was one of the few who offered something more. There aren’t many like that in this government, and today there’s one fewer.

WE Charity told federal MPs it had registered Thursday with the federal lobbying registry, months after receiving a $543.5-million contract to run the government’s student grant program.

Dalal Al-Waheidi, the executive director of WE Charity, told the House of Commons finance committee that the organization did not register previously because it didn’t think it was necessary under lobbying rules.

“If I thought that registration was required, we would have done it,” Ms. Al-Waheidi told members of Parliament.

Story continues below advertisement

Ms. Al-Waheidi testified on the same day that WE announced it was cutting 67 full-time and contract staff in Toronto and closing its office in London, putting another 19 employees out of work.

She testified alongside Scott Baker, chief operations officer of WE Charity, and Sofia Marquez, who previously worked as WE Charity’s director of government and stakeholder relations.

MPs questioned Ms. Marquez about her lobbying efforts and why she didn’t register. Lobbying rules require corporations to register when the cumulative lobbying activities of all employees adds up to a “significant part of duties,” which has been defined as the equivalent of 20 per cent or more of the working hours of one full-time employee, over a one-month period.

Prime Minister Trudeau and WE Charity: The controversy explained

Ms. Marquez said the time she spent lobbying different levels of government “varied” and that she is not able to provide MPs with a percentage of how much time she spent lobbying.

Conservative MP Pierre Poilievre questioned Ms. Marquez about her communication with the Prime Minister’s Office and Finance Minister Bill Morneau’s office. Ms. Marquez said she has communicated with staff in Mr. Morneau’s office and e-mailed a staffer in the PMO. She also had a half-hour phone call with a policy director in the PMO on May 5 about the “current state of the proposal.” Ms. Marquez said she was also on a phone call with Minister of Diversity and Inclusion and Youth Bardish Chagger and WE co-founder Craig Kielburger.

The contract was signed on June 23 but came into effect on May 5, 2020. WE has said the May 5 date reflects when it began working on the project and incurring eligible expenditures to design, build and prepare to deliver the program. However, cabinet’s final decision was made more than two weeks later.

Mr. Poilievre asked Ms. Marquez repeatedly whether the PMO said WE could begin implementing the program, given May 5 is the date WE began its work. She said she was not aware of the contract being implemented and her conversation was not about the project’s implementation.

“Well it’s an incredible coincidence that WE, that your organization, has suddenly registered to lobby all of these months after all of the lobbying happened,” Mr. Poilievre said.

In its filing to the federal lobbyist registry, WE Charity disclosed 65 communications with federal officials or ministers in 19 different departments or federal institutions, dating as far back as January, 2019. It lists 18 individuals, including Ms. Al-Waheidi, as in-house lobbyists for the organization. Craig and Marc Kielburger, the brothers who founded WE Charity, are not listed even though they have talked to ministers.

Opposition parties last month asked lobbying commissioner Nancy Bélanger to investigate whether WE Charity violated the Lobbying Act.

Members of Parliament questioned the three committee witnesses Thursday about who in government gave WE the green light to implement the program. No one provided a name, and Mr. Baker said the organization never felt it had the green light, but understood that to deliver the program, it had to build it in May and June.

WE has been embroiled in controversy over a $543.5-million federal volunteer program called the Canada Student Services Grant. The government gave WE a contract to administer the program, which included up to $43.5-million to cover expenses. The agreement was cancelled on July 3 amid conflict-of-interest allegations involving Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whose family members have been paid to speak at WE events. Mr. Trudeau and Mr. Morneau have both apologized for not recusing themselves from the decision around WE. The charity received $30-million in expenses and has promised to pay back the full amount although $8-million remains outstanding.

The controversy erupted amid a pandemic that has dried up donations and forced the charity to lay off more than 200 workers in March. The layoffs caused dissension among WE’s board of directors and led to the resignation of chair Michelle Douglas, who said she and other members quit in late March over concerns about the lack of financial transparency.

Ms. Al-Waheidi told the committee Thursday that the combination of the pandemic and the controversy had been devastating and forced WE to scale back.

WE plans to keep its 43,000 square-foot Toronto headquarters, called the Global Learning Centre, but Ms. Al-Waheidi said in a statement it is “actively assessing which real estate holdings could be sold.” That includes buildings in Toronto that were supposed to be used to provide free space for not-for-profit social enterprises.

WE holds roughly $40-million worth of property in Canada, which includes around 10 buildings in Toronto. The organization has already cancelled all WE Day events, the organization’s annual celebration of volunteers, and suspended partnerships with most corporate sponsors. It is also assessing all of its operations.

Britain had been a major centre for WE and the group has had a separate British charity for 10 years.

Ms. Al-Waheidi said that while WE’s British operations will be centralized in Toronto, the organization will continue to have a registered charity in Britain overseen by a British board of directors. That arrangement will be reviewed in a year, she added.

The Globe has a sponsorship partnership with WE Charity. The agreement expires on Aug. 31 and will not be renewed.

Haram Lubnan. Poor Lebanon.

As if hosting more than a million refugees from the Syrian war next door, an economy in free fall and COVID-19 weren’t enough, now the catastrophic destruction of the port of Beirut has left more than 150 dead, more than 6,000 injured and some 300,000 people – 5 per cent of the population – homeless. What can end this tale of woe for a country whose capital once saw itself as the Paris of the Middle East?

Story continues below advertisement

Sadly, that image is long gone, destroyed by the 1975-1990 civil war, corruption and regional turmoil. The hapless government called for a state of emergency in the wake of the port blast, only to be confronted by demonstrators chanting the slogan that almost a decade ago sparked the Arab Spring: “Ash-shab yurid isqat an-nizam.” Which, in essence, translates to: “The people want the overthrow of the regime.”

Although the government has now resigned, popular fury is set to increase. On Aug. 18, the Special Tribunal for Lebanon in the Hague will issue its verdict on the 2005 assassination of former Lebanese prime minister Rafik Hariri. Four members of Hezbollah – the Shia militia and political party backed by Iran and Syria – have been tried in absentia for the bombing of Mr. Hariri’s motorcade.

Whatever the Special Tribunal’s verdict, political tensions will rise. Hezbollah, classified as a terrorist organization by the United States and the European Union, enjoys widespread Shia support. Its militia is more powerful than the Lebanese army and it has a powerful bloc in parliament.

Just as the presence of Palestinian guerrillas and their “state within a state” was a factor in Lebanon’s civil war, so Hezbollah’s “state above the state” will provoke still more calls – by Lebanese and outsiders alike – to end a system in which political and economic power is allocated not by merit, but by religious sect.

But is that what “the people,” with their banners calling for thawra (revolution), really want? Lebanon, carved out of the Middle East a century ago by the Sykes-Picot accord between Britain and France, is a mosaic of Christians, Muslims, Druze, and others (some 18 sects are officially recognized). In 1943, when France ended its League of Nations mandate, independent Lebanon’s political leaders declared an unwritten “National Pact” under which the president would be a Maronite Christian, the prime minister a Sunni Muslim and the speaker of parliament a Shia Muslim.

As the first prime minister Riad al-Solh put it, the aim was to “Lebanonize Lebanese Muslims and to Arabize Lebanon’s Christians.” The Christians were to distance themselves from the West and the Muslims were to abandon the idea of Lebanon as part of a larger Arab nation.

The original premise was that Christians and Muslims were more or less equal in number. But the most recent census in Lebanon was conducted in 1932, and it is clear that Christians now comprise just a third of Lebanon’s citizens.

Story continues below advertisement

But why adjust the system to reflect demographic reality if the result would be another bout of sectarian warfare? The Taif agreement that led to the end of 15 years of civil war only tinkered at the edges, giving Muslims parity with Christians in parliament and enhancing the power of the prime minister.

Lebanon’s demonstrators have long demanded an end to confessional power-sharing and an end to meddling by a host of foreign powers, from America and Israel to Syria and Iran. Their one success was that domestic and international revulsion at the murder of Mr. Hariri forced Syria to withdraw its troops in 2005, 29 years after they began “safeguarding” Lebanon.

Lebanon has always been a fragile construction. When I lived in Beirut in the 1970s, the city was indeed the cosmopolitan “Paris of the Middle East,” until the civil war, abetted by outside powers, fragmented it into heavily armed neighbourhoods in which the religion listed on one’s identification card could mean life or death.

Given the sophistication and entrepreneurial energy of the Lebanese, it is conceivable that ending the confessional system would turn fragility into strength. But I doubt it.

The real challenge is to enforce accountability. It is shameful that the warlords of the 1970s and 1980s have become not statesmen but mobs in charge of protection rackets (power cuts, for example, provide easy money for suppliers of diesel generators). It is shameful that selfish bankers and official reluctance to guarantee urgent economic and financial reform have stalled negotiations with the International Monetary Fund.

The Lebanese deserve better. In the wake of the disaster in Beirut, the open question of how they will achieve it has become more difficult than ever to answer.

Many governments around the world have approved large fiscal- and monetary-aid packages designed to alleviate the economic toll of COVID-19 containment measures. Much of this spending will likely be financed through government borrowing. Some investors worry increasing government debt will stifle future economic growth or otherwise lead to market ruin. However, even as governments wade deeper into “red ink” in their effort to support families and businesses, we at Fisher Investments don’t believe that rising government debt automatically portends looming economic or market catastrophe.

This article examines how the stock market has historically responded to different government-debt levels in the US. We’ll look primarily through the lens of the United States, which serves as an insightful example since it has a large amount of outstanding government debt, is the world’s biggest stock market by market capitalization, and issues the most widely traded government-debt securities—US Treasurys.[i]

The US has large (and getting larger) debt burden, but that’s not the whole story

Story continues below advertisement

Congress allocated nearly $2.8 trillion in emergency aid as of mid-May and gross US federal debt that isn’t held by the government itself (i.e. net public debt) is now around $19.6 trillion.[ii] The scale of the 2020 fiscal measures—both announced and planned—is indeed significant, but how does that compare to other government responses? As of May 15, 2020, China’s fiscal response amounts to around 1.2 trillion yuan ($169 billion), while Japan added a ¥17 trillion ($157 billion) aid package to a previously approved 2020 budget. Meanwhile, the UK’s spending measures total around £175 billion ($214 billion). These amounts vary widely, but when normalized by comparing against each country’s economic output, the range varies from China’s 1.3% of gross domestic product (GDP) to the U.S.’s 13%.[iii]

In the U.S., the result is a ballooning 2020 budget deficit, which causes some investor concern. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released an updated 2020 budget forecast on 24 April, in which the CBO estimates the U.S. will spend about $3.7 trillion more than it receives in taxes during fiscal year 2020.[iv] That deficit is financed through U.S. Treasury debt, which adds to the U.S. net public debt load. These estimates are all subject to change and reality may differ, but if debt makes you nervous, those figures are likely anxiety-inducing.

It’s the ability to service debt, not absolute debt levels that counts

In our view, a government’s ability to make scheduled interest and principal payments—what the financial industry likes to call “servicing debt”—is the most important consideration to monitor. You’ll often see government-debt levels compared to GDP as an approximation of a country’s ability to afford its debt. The idea is to compare what a country owes to what it generates in a single year—similar to how you’d compare a household’s debt to its income. However, we think focusing on absolute debt levels compared to GDP can be misleading. A country accumulates debt over decades, but GDP is an annual flow of economic activity, making this a useful but imperfect measure of affordability.

Ultimately, governments pay their creditors with revenue generated from taxes, so we believe a better way to evaluate a country’s ability to handle its current debt load is net interest costs as a percentage of tax revenue. By historical standards, U.S. government debt today appears very affordable. In 2019, interest payments’ share of tax revenue was lower than it was during most of the 1980s and 1990s. And those were overall great periods for U.S. stocks. Even with expected debt-level increases and tax-revenue declines this year and next, we believe U.S. debt should remain affordable.

Lower interest rates and longer maturities take off some additional pressure

Story continues below advertisement

There are a number of other factors that can affect a country’s ability to afford its debt. First, there’s the debt servicing cost, which is determined by interest rates. Historically low-interest rates around the world (and governments tend to enjoy some of the lowest rates) have kept borrowing costs low for many years. Additionally, with government bond yields at historic lows (and in some regions, actually negative), newly issued debt should take advantage of these low rates and relatively cheaper debt financing.

A second factor that affects the affordability of government debt is its maturity or the length of time for which the money is being borrowed. When government debt matures and the principal amount must be repaid, many governments, including that of the U.S., issue new debt to pay off the old. Refinancing at currently low rates means older, more-expensive debt can be replaced with newer, less-expensive debt. For example, since 2009, the U.S. Treasury has increased the average maturity of outstanding U.S. debt from less than 50 months to 69.2 months, as of the end of March 2020—effectively locking in lower rates for longer.[i] Similarly, the UK government has also been actively increasing the average maturity of its debt—known as gilts—which now sits at around 15.3 years.[ii] In either case, we believe interest rates would likely have to materially rise and stay elevated for years in order to significantly increase overall debt servicing costs in the US or UK.

A few final thoughts

In our view, stock markets typically price in information relevant for how the world will look between about 3 and 30 months from the present time. The long-term nature of government-debt obligations tends to fall outside of that window, blunting the impact to markets. Plus, while recently passed spending and aid packages are big, remember that they aren’t all permanent balance-sheet entries, and they may not cost as much as originally estimated. For example, in the U.S., $454 billion of the Federal Reserve’s monetary efforts backstops loans to small businesses. To the extent these loans are repaid, that money could be recouped. The Fed will also return interest on those loans to the Treasury, as it does all of its profits, further defraying the cost. Another $211 billion relief measure is deferred—but not canceled—employer payroll taxes. Finally, this increased spending is likely a one-time splurge, not a new, permanently higher spending plateau. Following the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent stimulus and bailout efforts, the U.S. budget deficit initially soared in 2009 but then fell for six straight years. So while the amounts may boggle the mind, we don’t believe government debt is signaling stock market ruin.

Back in February, Toronto-based GMP Capital unveiled plans to swap its publicly traded stock for shares in partly owned subsidiary Richardson GMP. Winnipeg’s Richardson family is a significant shareholder of both companies, and the restructuring has been playing out over the past two years.

On Thursday, GMP Capital announced that, as part of the transaction, its shareholders will receive an additional 15 cents a share, or a total of $11.3-million, in a special dividend. It also said the Richardson clan will leave additional capital in the company to fund expansion by keeping $32.1-million invested in preferred shares, a holding the family was required to redeem.

In addition, GMP Capital changed the terms of the share swap with Richardson GMP’s owners, who include the firm’s 165 financial adviser teams. The company was planning to trade one GMP Capital share for every two shares of privately held Richardson GMP; now the ratio is one share for every 1.875 shares.

GMP Capital executives said the changes reflect a decline in Richardson GMP’s value after the sharp drop in interest rates in March, which cut into the profits it earns on its clients’ cash balances. In February, the transaction valued the entire franchise at $500-million; now the figure is $420-million.

“The revised terms to the previously announced transaction in February, 2020, strike what, we believe, is an appropriate balance taking into account the effects of the global pandemic, feedback raised by various stakeholders and retaining the appropriate level of capital to execute our long-term value creation strategy,” said Donald Wright, chair of the board at GMP Capital, in a news release.

Shareholders are scheduled to vote on the transaction on Oct. 6. If the deal is approved, the Richardson family will own approximately 40 per cent of Richardson GMP, the company’s financial advisers will have a 28.5-per-cent stake and existing GMP Capital shareholders will hold 31.4 per cent.

Last year, GMP Capital sold its capital markets business to St. Louis-based investment dealer Stifel Financial Corp., raising $42.2-million, in order to focus on managing money for high net worth individuals. Richardson GMP advisers currently oversee $29-billion of client assets, up from $23.5-billion when the stock market slumped in March.

“After a multiyear process to transform GMP, we can begin to capitalize on the considerable opportunities in the multitrillion-dollar wealth management industry in Canada,” said Kish Kapoor, interim president and chief executive of GMP Capital. He said that once the deal is completed, the company plans to recruit financial advisers from rival dealers, including the bank-owned firms, and will attempt to acquire small wealth management platforms.

“We believe, and the Richardson family believes, that the financial services ecosystem needs strong, high-quality independent firms,” Mr. Kapoor said. “Amongst many things, the health crisis has reminded us about the importance and demand for high-quality, face-to-face advice, especially during a period of volatile and uncertain markets.”

Notwithstanding inflated share prices, politics and the pandemic, the answer from many is a resounding “yes.”

That’s not just because unprecedented stimulus – US$20-trillion and counting – is forcing a structural change in how financial assets are valued.

It’s also down to years of societal shifts, innovation and now, the pandemic, which could transform forever the way people work, study and shop – playing into the dominant hand of tech stocks.

So while renewed coronavirus outbreaks and looming U.S. elections have made some investors cautious, many equity bulls are hanging in there, having already boosted the value of stocks globally by US$24-trillion since end-March.

As global equities near record highs, strategists say the quickfire bear-to-bull switch was not only justified but deserves to go further.

“The COVID pandemic has taken existing trends – greater dependency on tech, online shopping, remote working, etc. – and supercharged them,” said Benjamin Jones, a senior multi-asset strategist at State Street Global Markets.

With technology stocks holding on to their eye-popping gains, investors say the next leg of the rally is likely to come from value stocks – so called because they trade at cheaper valuations than their growth-oriented peers.

Stocks are benefiting of course from above-average equity-risk premiums, the return one can earn by holding stocks compared with risk-free assets. Global stocks carry an equity-risk premium of 4.6 per cent, while for U.S. stocks, it’s at 4 per cent.

That might erode over time, but for now interest rates appear firmly stapled to the floor.

As for valuations, they are hovering near 22 times forward earnings for the U.S. S&P 500 index, the highest since the dotcom bubble in early 2000. But then, the index too has changed dramatically with technology by far its biggest sector component.

Making up around a third of the benchmark index, they are the ultimate pandemic stay-at-home beneficiaries, especially those known as FANGMAN – an expanded tech group comprising Facebook, Apple, Netflix, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and chipmaker Nvidia.

Their multiples of 80-100 times forward earnings have led the broader market higher.

Until a few decades ago, bank, oil & gas, and industrial stocks made up a bulk of the S&P 500. These sectors typically trade at lower multiples, given commodity price volatility and high capex needs – a major reason behind this year’s underperformance of Britain’s FTSE benchmark.

“What’s odd about the market debate is that it’s set up as follows: look at the S&P 500 and the response is the equity market is expensive. Then you ask people what they like and they favour a lot of the secular-growth, high-multiple stocks,” said Morgan Stanley chief cross-asset strategist Andrew Sheets.

A ratio of U.S. stocks on a market weighted basis to an equally weighted index of shares is at its highest levels since the 2008 crisis, indicating the dominance of the handful of large tech stocks in the market.

The valuations make all the more sense because of the lower for longer interest rate environment, said Maximilian Kunkel, CIO of Global Family Offices at UBS.

“As a result we remain constructive on risk assets even after the rally.”

Many others would seem to agree. On derivative markets, the put-to-call ratio for U.S. stocks, a measure of positioning sentiment, is the lowest since 2010. The ratio is inversely related to equity performance.

Some caution is although warranted, given that asset classes of all stripes have gained. A portfolio with a 25 per cent split in stocks, bonds, cash and gold would have earned a record 18 per cent in the past 90 days, BofA analysts calculate.

But the edifice is vulnerable to a rise in inflation, many argue, with investors’ holdings of yield-sensitive investments up US$8.1-trillion over 18 months, according to Morgan Stanley.

Though prices have rebounded from deflationary territory fairly quickly, inflation remains far below central bank estimates, indicating equity valuations will remain attractive.

Latest flows data shows investors are switching from cash to equities.

“I would still say investors are underweight equities and that provides a fairly decent backdrop for risk assets to rally,” said Jason Borbora-Sheen, portfolio manager at Ninety One Asset Management.

“We believe this latest settlement proposal would be viewed as a favourable outcome and would expect the stocks to react positively to the news as a global settlement would put the uncertainty behind,” JPMorgan analyst Lisa Gill said.

The lawsuits accuse drugmakers of overstating the benefits of opioids while downplaying the risks and allege distributors failed to flag and halt a rising tide of suspicious orders.

The first firms in the robo business in Canada have either reached their five-year anniversary or will shortly. Although still a small segment of the investment advice business, robos have established themselves as a strong option for people seeking low-cost help in building and maintaining investment portfolios built mainly with exchange-traded funds, or ETFs.

Five years is also long enough for investors to get meaningful information about the returns generated by the portfolios robo-advisers use for clients. The 2019-20 Globe and Mail Robo-Adviser Guide will help you assess the return information that firms provide on their website.

The guide also includes detailed comparisons of the fees each robo-adviser charges. If you’re wondering what to expect in future returns from a particular robo firm, give more weight to low fees than stellar past results.

Prepare for a challenge in comparing returns at robo-firms. Some report monthly returns for the model portfolios they use for clients, others quarterly. Some offer comprehensive annualized returns, which are easiest to use for comparison purposes, while others use combinations of annualized, cumulative and calendar-year results.

All too often, benchmark comparisons are left out of the reporting on model-portfolio returns. Without benchmarks, you can’t properly grade returns.

The Globe and Mail Robo-Adviser Guide helps you assess returns by including information on:

Whether model portfolio returns are available for prospective clients to look at on a firm’s website;

The use of benchmarks for context in assessing portfolio returns;

Whether returns are shown with portfolio management fees deducted, as well as the cost of the ETFs used in the portfolio.

As ever, the guide covers all the key aspects of choosing a robo-adviser. You’ll find comparative information on the provinces and territories they operate in, the kinds of accounts they offer, how personalized their business is, the cost of their advice and the fees attached to the ETFs they use. As you’ll see, costs can vary by hundreds of dollars per year, even thousands.

A few common features of the robos that appear the Globe guide:

Paperless account-opening with e-signature is standard, so there’s no need to fill out paper forms and send them in;

Commissions for buying and selling ETFs in your account are generally included in the portfolio-management fee. Exceptions: Nest Wealth charges as much as $9.99 per trade with a cap of $100 per year, per account; Smart Money Capital Management charges 1 cent per share with a $4 minimum per trade.

Almost all firms use pre-set model ETF portfolios that match your investing profile; an exception is Nest Wealth, which provides unique portfolios for each client;

All rebalance your portfolio periodically – selling hot ETFs and buying cold ones – to bring you back to your target mix of stocks and bonds;

Assets are generally held at held by third-party or related investment dealers that are members of the Canada Investor Protection Fund, which protects eligible account assets for up to $1-million against dealer insolvency.

You can interact with your robo firm via its website, by phone and, often, through some combination of secure e-mail, live online chat and Skype.

I asked Mr. Choi for a quick take on his view – thumbs up or down. “Huge thumbs up,” was his reply.

What a relief – not just for Aeroplan members, but everyone who collects reward points. The rebooting of Aeroplan shows that life as a points collector doesn’t have to be about takeaways.

The life cycle of a reward program is to start strong to attract members and then reduce benefits to improve profitability. But when the new Aeroplan relaunches on Nov. 8, it will be better. This revamp is a challenge to all the reward programs and credit cards out there. What improvements do they have to offer?

Story continues below advertisement

A big win for Aeroplan members in the reboot: All seats on Air Canada flights are available to book for Aeroplan rewards, including premium economy and business. Previously, there was a limited number of seats available for reward redemptions. Also, carrier surcharges that can cost hundreds of dollars disappear, although there’s a minor trade-off for this gain in a $39 booking fee for partner airlines. “I’d rather pay $39 than $900 to fly to Germany on points via Lufthansa,” Mr. Choi said by e-mail.

Now for an issue that is going to bug Aeroplan members hoping to book summer or holiday season travel – dynamic pricing. It means high-demand routes and travel dates will require a higher expenditure of points, while off-peak travel will cost less.

A few other notable points:

Existing Aeroplan miles will be accepted on a one-to-one basis (going forward, miles will be called points)

You can share points and benefits with family

There’s a new redemption chart spelling out the points required to fly between different points – Mr. Choi says there are some sweet spots that mean fewer points will be required.

Aeroplan.com will eventually be wound down and reservations will be made on aircanada.com

Rob’s personal finance reading list

Can the housing market stay hot?

Toronto Life asked seven experts for their view on the housing market – a mix of analysts, academics and housing industry people. The most optimistic views came from the housing industry people, which prompted a response on Twitter from Evan Siddall, president of Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp., a federal government agency that has a mandate to help Canadians access affordable housing. Here’s some good news for first-time buyers: The mortgage stress test you have to pass when qualifying to get a mortgage is about to ease a bit.

The new way to pay on the installment plan

All about new services that allow people to put pay for even modest purchases as low as $35 in installments with interest rates as low as zero. The idea is to get more people to buy things they presumably can’t afford. Otherwise, why the installments?

A $12.99 kitchen safety system that works

Introducing cutting gloves – wear them when you’re using a kitchen knife or grater and skip the nicks and cuts. This U.S. article prices these gloves at $9 – Amazon.ca has then for as little as $11.23.

Shopping for a new car? Compare insurance costs before buying

This list of tips for new car buying includes information on how insurance costs for the same class of vehicle can vary widely. In the example provided, two similar SUVs differ in annual premiums by more than $1,500.

Ask Rob

Q: In a recent column, you talked about balanced ETFs and published a list ranging from conservative to growth funds. You often talk about diversification. So why not invest in each of the balanced ETFs on your list? I am 68 years old and have $180,000 to invest.

A: Believe me, it’s much to your benefit to choose one suitable balanced ETF and leave it at that. These ETFs provide a fully diversified portfolio – exposure to thousands of individual stocks and bonds. You don’t need anything further, which means you limit your brokerage commissions for buying and selling ETFs and you limit the time needed to maintain the portfolio.

For example, one big long-term risk is that your portfolio fails to deliver the growth you need to meet your goals.
There is a tendency, however, to pay more attention to risk that is right in front of you.
Moreover, focusing on short-term risks alone may mean ignoring or increasing your long-term risks.
We believe long-term investors should invest for the long haul and focus more on risks to their goals and less on shorter-term worries over volatility.","Investing in stocks in volatile markets isn’t easy. Uncertainty and volatility can shake the faith of even the most optimistic and experienced investors. Investors often react by changing their investment strategies to reduce portfolio volatility. Sometimes this can make sense. But keep in mind, volatility is just one of many investment risks. Risk is multi-faceted and there is almost always a trade-off. Minimizing volatility can expose you to other, potentially more profound, risks.

We believe current economic uncertainty and market volatility concerns present a good opportunity to re-evaluate risk and what it means for you and your portfolio, both in the short and long term. We have found that investors tend to focus on short-term risk, notably volatility. But if you shift your perspective and focus to the long term, risk often looks very different. For example, one big long-term risk is that your portfolio fails to deliver the growth you need to meet your goals. This often happens when people don’t have an appropriate asset allocation or portfolio strategy aligned with those goals. Or they fail to account for inflation or a long investment time horizon.

Investors tend to see short-term volatility as their biggest risk

Story continues below advertisement

Volatility is a measure of how much a security’s returns vary over time. A security with very low volatility will offer a relatively steady rate of return. More-volatile securities, however, have a greater dispersion of returns, as measured by standard deviation from their average. In simple terms, more-volatile securities tend to have bigger swings in price. Risk, on the other hand, is a much more expansive concept that includes all uncertainties.

There is a tendency, however, to pay more attention to risk that is right in front of you. And most commonly when investors refer to “risk,” they’re referring to short-term volatility—stock prices moving down over a few days or weeks. Watching your investment accounts drop can be harrowing, but—if you don’t need to draw from these savings in the short term—short-term volatility may not pose a big risk to your long-term goals.

For example, if your investment time horizon is 10, 20 or 30 years, then short-term ups and downs over a few days, weeks or even months shouldn’t be a huge concern. Human psychology, however, makes it hard for us to stomach even short-term declines. Myopic loss aversion, a key principle of behavioural economics, identified by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman, holds that, “when directly compared or weighted against each other, losses loom larger than gains.”[i] This means we tend to find a loss more painful than we find a similar or even larger gain pleasurable. This can cause investors to go to great lengths to avoid losses, even if it means sacrificing future gains.

However, over the long term, risk is different. Whilst investors are often most concerned with short-term declines, one of the biggest risks over the long term is that your portfolio’s growth falls short of what you need to reach your goals. Given this risk, adjusting your portfolio to reduce volatility, shifting your asset allocation out of stocks too soon or trying to time the market can all be risky over the long term.

Straying from your optimal asset allocation is dangerous

Investors who need portfolio growth over longer time horizons typically own equities for their history of strong long-term growth. If you have determined you need to be substantially invested in stocks in order to reach your goals, it can be dangerous to react to short-term volatility by departing from that asset allocation. Why? The long-term annualised return of equities is 8%, whilst fixed interest has returned 6.1%.[ii] The difference between these two long-term annualised returns may seem minor and an acceptable trade-off for less stomach-churning volatility. But consider that a $500,000 portfolio invested for 20 years that grew 8% annually would have a final value of $2,330,479—whereas a similarly sized portfolio invested for 20 years that grew at 6% annually would have a final value of $1,603,568. A 2% difference compounded over 20 years can result in a sizable difference in final portfolio value. That’s why asset allocation decisions—and the discipline to adhere to a portfolio strategy—are so important.

Then, too, if you deviate from your target asset allocation by selling some or all of your equities, you’ll face a second perilous decision: When should you reinvest in equities? In a month? When the market calms down? When everything feels safe? Unfortunately, in the short term, the stock market is almost impossible to predict and any attempt at market timing may be riskier than a buy-and-hold strategy. Stock market returns are highly uneven and it’s not unusual to see big gains in just a few trading days. Given that missing a handful of these big “up” days can be costly, we believe it often makes more sense to stay invested in equities.

Story continues below advertisement

Lastly, it is important to remember that a stock market correction—a sharp, sudden drop of -10% to -20%—is often followed by a recovery that is just as sharp and sudden. To benefit from selling out of equities during a correction, your timing would need to be impeccable. You would need to sell some or all of your equities early enough to dodge a substantial portion of the downturn. And you would need to buy back in so as not to miss out on the rebound. We know of no investor consistently able to do so. If you sold out of stocks too late or bought back in too late, you may have ended up experiencing a good deal of the downside and missed out on a substantial portion of the recovery. We believe the takeaway is, if you try to time equity markets to avoid short-term declines, there is a great likelihood you do yourself more harm than good.

Short-term volatility is a risk. But depending on your investment time horizon, it may not be your biggest risk. Quite simply, for many investors, the biggest risk is failing to achieve the growth they need to meet their long-term goals. Moreover, focusing on short-term risks alone may mean ignoring or increasing your long-term risks. Though it may be tempting at times, deviating from your optimal long-term asset mix just to reduce short-term volatility can make it less likely that you achieve the growth necessary to reach your long-term goals. We believe long-term investors should invest for the long haul and focus more on risks to their goals and less on shorter-term worries over volatility.

The last five months have been unprecedented within the global capital markets with historic volatility, a laser focus on the “COVID-19 economy” and myriad projections on how the world will look coming out of the pandemic. Many companies have been forced to rapidly adapt their business models to adjust to changing demand environments and new physical-distancing requirements, and these changes have become the focus for many investors over the last few months. That said, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, one of the most powerful trends within both Canadian and global capital markets was an increased focus on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) practices. We believe this trend is poised to accelerate.

Numerous studies have demonstrated how firms that score highly on an ESG framework tend to provide stronger shareholder returns over the long term. This, in our view, is reflective of the long-term view employed by many leaders in the ESG space, and the ability of these leaders to identify both longer-term potential risks and opportunities for growth and efficiencies. The COVID-19 pandemic has provided a concrete example of why companies and investors have become more focused on longer-term risk mitigation and on a company’s ability to pivot its growth strategy based on a rapidly changing environment.

Trillions of dollars of monetary and economic stimulus aimed at reducing the economic fallout for tens of millions of Americans out of work because of the coronavirus have driven the S&P 500 up more than 50% from its March 23 low, with the benchmark now up nearly 5% for 2020.

While the pandemic has forced many restaurants and shops out of business, large supermarkets and retailers with strong online sales have grown. Thanks mostly to Amazon, the S&P 500 consumer discretionary index has gained 23% in 2020, making it the second-strongest performer among 11 sector indexes, below technology.

The information technology index has jumped 25% year to date, lifted by Microsoft, Apple, Mastercard and other companies seeing stronger demand for their products and services as people staying at home do more shopping online.

While some investors worry that the rally since March has been concentrated largely among tech companies, others have confidence that these stocks’ gains are justified as the pandemic leads to a sharp increase in online shopping, cloud computing and other uses of technology.

“These are firms that have solid fundamentals that are superior to the broader market and will benefit from recent trends. We do not find that this high concentration is a source of systemic risk,” said Benjamin Jones, senior multi-asset strategist at State Street Global Markets.

With the U.S. corporate earnings season mostly completed, a record number of companies have beaten dramatically lowered estimates. But the second quarter is still set to be the low point for earnings this year.

Even after a recent modest improvement in profit estimates, the S&P 500 is trading at about 22 times expected earnings, its highest multiple since the dot com era two decades ago.

The COVID-19 pandemic has been an adjustment for most financial advisors, who have had to work from home and meet with clients virtually amid extreme market volatility, but the experience has been a bit different for those at smaller firms.

Accessing resources to work out of the office, such as additional computers, telephones and extra internet bandwidth, has been a challenge for smaller firms – especially when competing with bigger counterparts seeking the same equipment and services.

But for smaller firms and their advisors, this size has allowed them to be more nimble when it comes to helping clients find solutions and cope with the fallout from the pandemic. The COVID-19 crisis has also been a test of these firms’ business-continuity plans, with mostly positive results.

“When you’re smaller, it’s much easier to mobilize,” says Debra Hewson, president and chief executive officer of Vancouver-based investment management firm Odlum Brown Ltd., which has about 100 advisors across five offices in British Columbia overseeing about $15-billion in client assets.

Odlum Brown has invested heavily in its remote access platform over the past 18 months, ensuring it was accessible and secure. The inspiration, in part, was an increasingly mobile workforce – as well as the possibility of an event that could force staff to work away from the office, such as a power outage or earthquake.

“We did it for business continuity reasons,” Ms. Hewson says. “We certainly didn’t plan on a pandemic, but when COVID-19 hit, we were fortunate to be able to mobilize our people to work from home really quickly. When they turned on their computers at home, they had the same experience, technology-wise, as if they were in the office. That was really helpful.”

She says the client experience was relatively seamless, except for the inability to meet in person due to physical distancing requirements, which was difficult for some during the market meltdown in March.

During that volatile period, in particular, the firm spent a lot of time communicating with each other and with clients through different channels including e-mail, telephone and video calls, “because everyone takes information differently,” Ms. Hewson says.

“I’d like to say it was business as usual for us, just a bit more frequent. I’m quite proud of that. It’s not like we had to come up with a new way of doing things. A lot of this we were already doing, we just ramped up the regularity,” she says.

One of Odlum Brown’s biggest challenges was finding computer equipment for advisors who suddenly found themselves working from home, in particular monitors to use as second screens. It turns out many companies, across many sectors, were looking to buy the same products.

“The challenge was finding stores that still had them in stock,” she says, adding that they were able to source a large supply of monitors through an advisor’s connection.

For Montreal-based PWL Capital Inc., which has 26 advisors across four offices managing more than $4-billion in client assets, a challenge at the start of the pandemic was getting its telecommunications provider to boost its internet bandwidth to enable employees uninterrupted access to its virtual private network.

Telecom networks were under a huge strain when the pandemic first hit as so many companies were relying on remote access to support their at-home workforces.

“We’re not the Royal Bank, saying, ‘Improve our VPN.’” says Brenda Bartlett, PWL’s president and CEO. “Being a smaller firm, we don’t always get the telecom provider’s attention right away.”

It took a couple of weeks before their connection was smooth, “which seems like an eternity,” especially amid the market upheaval at the time.

PWL itself was well prepared for the pandemic, Ms. Bartlett says, having made a significant investment in its technology and infrastructure three years ago, including beefing up its remote access capabilities for advisors.

“We did it to ensure that our client-facing teams could go out and meet clients and be fully functional … and didn’t have to be nailed down to a chair at the office to get anything done,” she says.

“When COVID-19 hit, it was the best test of our business continuity plan. If it happened three years ago, I don’t think I could’ve made that statement. … I’m very proud of my team who mobilized to do everything to make it work,” she says. “From a client experience, it has been virtually seamless.”

Meanwhile, Dahlin Sabey, founder and CEO of Calgary-based Belay Wealth Inc., a mutual fund dealer with about 30 advisors across Canada who manage about $750-million in client assets, says the pandemic hasn’t had much of an impact on his firm’s operations. In part, that’s because Belay Wealth was created in late 2018 as a mostly digital firm relying on its own proprietary software platform to run client accounts.

“When COVID-19 hit, it didn’t actually change our operations at all [because] we were already 100 per cent online,” he says.

In addition, having a small team meant the firm didn’t need to implement blanket protocols. Instead, the dealer worked with advisors individually to come up with their own ways to do business safely.

For example, one advisor in Victoria purchased plexiglass screens to put between him and clients who still wanted to meet in person.

“Being a smaller firm, we know our advisors and what they need … instead of just sending out a memo to everyone to saying, ‘These are our rules,’” Mr. Sabey says.

He points out that these small-firm advantages have attracted more interest from outside advisors during the pandemic.

In normal times, Mr. Sabey says he’d receive about five calls a week from advisors potentially interested in joining his firm.

“Now, we’re fielding about 40 calls a week,” he says, many of which have been unhappy with how their larger firms have handled the pandemic.

Smaller firms can be more flexible and agile, including during times of crisis, he says. “That’s how we compete [with the bigger firms].”",1015,0.9372951079094531,business

A net 46 per cent of investors surveyed by BofA said “it’s a bull market,” up from 40 per cent the previous month. A secular bull market is one where the prevailing trend is for higher prices, with short corrections interrupting it.

World stocks have bounced back by 51 per cent from their mid-March lows, adding US$24-trillion in value in five months as investors bet on a rapid rebound in economic activity after record plunges.

Of the 181 survey participants, who manage half-a-trillion U.S. dollars in assets, a net 79 per cent expect a stronger economy, the strongest reading since December, 2009.

“Asset allocation stubbornly skewed toward U.S. growth stocks,” BofA said. But it added “green shoots” were appearing for inflation assets and rotation into Europe and emerging market equities, which have lagged tech-heavy U.S. stocks.

The survey found that the “most crowded” trade for the fourth month running was a long position in U.S. tech and growth stocks, the ultimate beneficiaries of pandemic-led transformations in the way people work, study and shop.

The long gold trade was the second most crowded, with a net 31 per cent saying the metal was “overvalued,” the most since 2011 after no participants said they considered it to be so last month. Gold rose above US$2,000 an ounce for the first time earlier this month.

As global equities near record highs again, strategists told Reuters that the quickfire bear-to-bull switch was not only justified but deserves to go further.

But evidence of a fresh rise coronavirus infections in some countries has led to caution and the survey showed that a “second wave” of the pandemic was still seen as the biggest risk to markets for the fifth straight month.

Here’s a survey of reaction:

WILLIAM NORTHEY, SENIOR INVESTMENT DIRECTOR, U.S. BANK WEALTH MANAGEMENT, HELENA, MONTANA

“This is certainly a circumstance where capital markets are looking beyond the current earnings and economic chasm that have been created by the economic shutdowns in response to COVID-19. Capital markets are looking to 2021 and 2022 levels of recovery with a degree of optimism that there is a health solution around the corner.”

“It’s certainly aided by the fact that we have been supported by historically low interest rates and very accommodative policy. Not only from a monetary standpoint, but from a fiscal policy standpoint – both, here in the United States and abroad. The policy responses have been incredibly forceful and provided a necessary bridge through this voluntary economic shutdown as we deal with these conditions created by the pandemic.”

NEIL WILSON, CHIEF MARKET ANALYST, MARKETS.COM, LONDON

“We saw a pullback in June and it’s been steadily marching forward since, so that record was on the cards. I’m still surprised we got there without additional stimulus. But my instinct, is that this is too high, it looks massively overbought, I mean, it’s not sustainable looking at the earnings. I think it’s mainly the liquidity being pumped into the system, all these funds need to go there. As we get closer to the election I’d expect more volatility and a pullback”.

BENJAMIN JONES, SENIOR MULTI-ASSET STRATEGIST AT STATE STREET GLOBAL MARKETS

“Though US equities are back to all-time highs there is a great deal of dispersion in returns for the year and the style, sector, and stock level. Growth, tech, and internet retail for example have posted solid gains this year as we have seen existing trends towards a greater reliance on technology accelerate in the wake of the pandemic.”

“I am not concerned that tech has driven a lot of the gains and that the largest five stocks make up such a large proportion of the S&P 500. These are firms that have solid fundamentals that are superior to the broader market and will benefit from recent trends. We do not find that this high concentration is a source of systemic risk.”

BRIAN PRICE, HEAD OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL NETWORK, WALTHAM, MASS.

“The path of least resistance seems to be higher for US equities as of late. Markets are seemingly encouraged by a nationwide improvement in coronavirus data after a spike in various parts of the country last month. Big tech and certain consumer companies like Amazon continue to do well but we’ve also seen an improvement in relative performance of cyclical and value-oriented names as of late. This dynamic should be viewed as healthy for the equity market as wider breadth could be key to determining whether or not stocks will continue their advance. There are plenty of risk factors that investors will continue to monitor, such as a resurgence in coronavirus cases, failure to pass another relief bill, and the upcoming elections. Investors are encouraged that we’re back near all-time highs in the market, but they’ll need to stay vigilant for what lies ahead over the coming months.”

JIM PAULSEN, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST AT THE LEUTHOLD GROUP IN MINNEAPOLIS

“I don’t know if I’d put a great deal of significance on this. It’s important in the short run particularly for traders. There’s no doubt about it. We have these psychological levels that are important for traders because markets move around them.”

“I’d put this in the same category as when the market is looking at a 200-day moving average. It’s a technical level that creates trading opportunities for shorter-term minded traders. It could create volatility. It could be a launching pad if it breaks through solidly to create a good few days on the upside but it could also mark a point where you want to sell for the next week. Often when we break a milestone we pause. All of that is true.”

TIM GHRISKEY, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, INVERNESS COUNSEL, NEW YORK

“It was inevitable. Markets go higher over the long term, and it’s a reflection that the pandemic has limited longevity and the economic downtown will also have limited longevity. There are companies that are doing well in this environment, and even doing better, primarily the growth stocks, which are not impacted by the decline in consumer spending.”

“It’s an emotional level. It’s a market rebound a lot of investors don’t understand and are skeptical about. But the stock market is about anticipating the future and we feel in about a year or so most of the population will be immunized with a vaccine, and the economy will begin to return to accelerated growth.”

KEITH LERNER, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, TRUIST/SUNTRUST ADVISORY SERVICES, ATLANTA

“It does confirm what we’ve been saying for several months: that this is a new bull market that we’re in. There’s mounting evidence in our work that suggests we’re in a bull market as a whole. We’ve been positive, increasing equities, since early April. So far what we’ve been seeing in this market is very consistent with what we tend to see coming out of meaningful lows. The one thing that’s different…this is by far the fastest recovery we’ve seen from a 30% decline.”

“In some ways, the market making a new high, along with (COVID-19) cases coming down, actually relieves some pressure on Congress to get something done (on renewing stimulus). That could be something in the short term that weighs on the market. Ultimately I think something will get done. I don’t think it’s a long-term risk.”

BRIAN BETHUNE, ECONOMIST, TUFTS UNIVERSITY, MEDFORD, MASS

“The problem we’re dealing with is the Fed has clobbered rates down across the yield curve. So where are people going to earn a return? The reason they’re going into the S&P 500 is because there’s a dividend yield and a buyback yield. There were some cutbacks so my guess is that the gross yield is down to 3%, that’s still 3%. So people are realizing this and now the funds are shifting out of fixed income into equities, and that creates a momentum play.

“Given the situation we find ourselves in, that’s a good thing, no question. I don’t buy into the view of the people who say it’s a bubble, it’s the reality of what’s going on in terms of zero returns on fixed income.

“The economy, generally speaking, is doing better than what people had expected. That’s the second piece of what is propping up the stock market. There was an over-correction on the downside and once people realized it was overdone, then it returned.”

OLIVER PURSCHE, PRESIDENT, CIO, BRONSON MEADOWS CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, FAIRFIELD, CONN.

“The S&P 500 has been trying to make that new record for a while. We don’t know yet whether we’re going to close above it. But today’s housing starts number is clearly what’s lifting stocks a little today. Very strong earnings by Walmart are also helping the S&P. Those are the catalysts. It’s a slow melt up; it’s really a summer melt up.

“It’s too early to tell, because data keeps on changing, what coronavirus is going to look like in September, October, November, but the market is clearly betting it’s not going to be all that bad.”

Since the March 23 closing low, the S&P posted the largest gain in a 103-day period in 87 years, according to Refinitiv data.

Trillions of dollars in fiscal and monetary stimulus have made Wall Street flush with cash, pushing yield-seeking investors into equities. Amazon and other high growth technology-related stocks have been viewed as the most reliable to ride out the crisis.

Doubts about the underlying health of the economy, however, persisted in Tuesday’s session, with lukewarm reactions to bumper results from Home Depot and Walmart limiting gains.

“The S&P 500 has been impressive and has created a lot of wealth, but I am not sure that reflects the overall health of the economy,” said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist at Incapital.

“The rally has more to do with asset inflation, which is fueled by all the liquidity and all the continued support in the economy as well as the weakening dollar,” he added.

Consumer discretionary rose the most among major S&P sectors on strength in Amazon while technology stocks provided another major support to the benchmark index.

Home Depot Inc reported its biggest rise in quarterly same-store sales in at least two decades, however, its shares fell about 1% after analysts cautioned that its sales might have hit their peak.

Walmart Inc traded marginally higher after posting its biggest-ever growth in online sales as shoppers cashed in stimulus checks and ordered everything from electronics and toys to groceries from the safety of their homes amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

Data on Tuesday showed U.S. homebuilding accelerated by the most in nearly four years in July in the latest sign the housing sector is emerging as one of the few areas of strength in an economy suffering a record slowdown. That further added to market optimism.

Minutes from the Federal Reserve’s recent meeting due on Wednesday, meanwhile, may provide some insight into how the central bank sees the recovery playing out. The Fed has cut rates to near zero to bolster business through the pandemic.

It starts with a stock market slump. Concern escalates to worry as you watch the financial news describe the precipitous drop—and speculate on a worsening outlook. Worry becomes full-blown anxiety as volatile markets devolve into a larger downturn.

It’s normal to experience anxiety and unease during turbulent stock markets or in the depths of a bear market. And these feelings aren’t just in your head. A 2014 University of California, San Diego study suggests that daily fluctuations in stock prices can have an almost immediate impact on the health of investors. The study found sharp stock market price drops are accompanied by an increasing number of hospital visits over the following two days—especially for mental-health reasons.[i]

Besides the potential physical and psychological toll, financial anxiety can also cause investors to make emotionally driven mistakes that could imperil their long-term financial goals. However, there are positive steps you can take to help combat those stressful feelings and avoid making costly investing mistakes that could jeopardise your financial future.

Take a media break

The addictive ping of social media and the squawk of always-on news can be constant sources of anxiety during market downturns. It’s good to stay informed, but spending too much time subject to relentless market updates and binging on social media can be detrimental if you’re not able to find some distance and regain perspective on current events or your longer-term investing goals. Consider taking a break from the news and social media to help keep yourself on an even keel. Maybe limit yourself to a set amount of time per day or per week. Stay informed, but try not to fixate on day-to-day market movements. Watch out for sensationalism and opinion in the content you consume and compare them against verifiable facts. In particular, social-media platforms or online blogs can often harbour hastily written or poorly researched information from dubious sources. So keep your guard up to avoid investing tips from sources lacking ethics, expertise or both.

You can get a compound effect if you layer more positive behaviours on top of your media break. For example, when you feel the social-media spiral and the financial news pulling you down, spend some time outside, go on a walk, start a project or get some exercise to help you reset your frame of mind.

Find a way to feel in control financially

Anxiety often comes from a lack of a sense of control. You may feel like events are sweeping you up and you’re powerless to do anything. Even though market moves are outside your control, you’re far from powerless during market downturns. There are a number of actions that can help restore your sense of financial control and curb anxiety.

Get your financial house in order: Investments are only one part of your overall financial picture. Exert financial control where you can. If you don’t have a financial plan, sit down with everyone affected by your monthly budget to prioritise necessities. If you’ve already got a financial plan, revisit your budget and priorities to make sure you know where your money is going. Then consider trimming any excesses you find. To help your short- and medium-term finances, make sure you have—or are working towards—an emergency fund to cover at least three months of expenses. An emergency fund can help if you encounter unexpected expenses or lose a portion of your income.

An emergency fund can help if you encounter unexpected expenses or lose a portion of your income. Revisit your investing goals; rebalance your portfolio if necessary: If you’ve got a financial plan in place, but it’s been a while since you’ve reviewed your previous goals in light of recent life events, now might be a good time to revisit it. If you find your long-term goals have changed or your portfolio has strayed too far from its targeted asset allocation, you might need to rebalance to get back in line.

If you’ve got a financial plan in place, but it’s been a while since you’ve reviewed your previous goals in light of recent life events, now might be a good time to revisit it. If you find your long-term goals have changed or your portfolio has strayed too far from its targeted asset allocation, you might need to rebalance to get back in line. Reframe “doing nothing” as an active choice: When markets are pitchpoling, it can feel like you’re tumbling along with them. It’s common to feel like you need to do something—others may be selling out of the market and insisting you should too. However, those feelings could move you further away from your financial goals if you sell at the wrong time and then miss out on a subsequent rebound. So what can you do? Doing nothing may be a better option if you already have a prudent investing plan with an optimal asset allocation. This may not feel good in the moment, but you can mentally reframe it. Think of it as an active decision to continue along a path that will likely pay off if you’re able to remain disciplined over the long run.

Lean on a trusted adviser for help

Financial anxiety can make you feel as if you’re in over your head and you don’t know what to do. We believe the practices presented in this article can help you feel calmer and more in control. But remember, you don’t need to go it alone. Working with a trusted investment professional can serve as an outlet for your financial anxieties. If you don’t have a financial professional with whom you work regularly, now might be a time to find one. Think of an adviser as a financial counsellor who can help you stay on track with your financial plan as you navigate whatever challenges you’re facing.

Your money manager should help educate you about common investing biases, such as myopic loss aversion, which describes the human tendency to feel the pain from losses much more than we feel the joy from gains. This bias has led many investors to sell stocks low after a crash—only to miss out on subsequent gains whilst waiting to get back into the market. Having open and honest conversations with your financial professional can help you avoid making mistakes that could significantly decrease the likelihood of achieving your long-term financial goals. The more frank you are with your investment professional, the more he or she can help set you up for financial success. A good professional should consider the curiosities, hesitations, passions and fears you’ve discussed to personalise their service and help you gain more confidence in your plan.

Financial anxiety is a common problem. Using some of these techniques to help give yourself more control and comfort can be a great first step on the path to a better financial future.

[viii]Judging by financial publications we follow regularly, few would likely be surprised by recession—as sentiment seemingly reflects the bear market maturing.
ZEW equity market sentiment index for the eurozone, August 2000 and February 2020.","Whilst every equity bear market (a fundamentally driven decline exceeding -20% from a prior high) has different specific circumstances and details, we think many of them—including the current one—have some commonalities. An important one, we think, is how sentiment evolves during a bear. Magnitudes, causes and durations vary—which may make bear markets seem bewildering. But in our experience, how people react emotionally to a bear is timeless.

For bull markets—periods of overall rising equity prices—we think legendary investor Sir John Templeton described sentiment’s path best: “Bull markets are born on pessimism, grow on scepticism, mature on optimism and die on euphoria.” But this only takes you through market sentiment on the way up. For the other side of Templeton’s quote, Fisher Investments’ Founder, Executive Chairman & Co-Chief Investment Officer Ken Fisher reframed Templeton’s depiction: “Bear markets are born on euphoria, grow on grinding economics, mature on recession and die on panic.” This generally shows the development of bear markets, which are typically joined shortly thereafter by a period of broad-based economic contraction (a recession).

Now, 2020’s bear market didn’t follow this blueprint early on. It is fair to say sentiment wasn’t universally euphoric at the global equity market’s February peak, in our view. The ZEW sentiment index for eurozone equities was moderately positive in February at 21.6 (above zero is optimistic), but it was nowhere close to its 79.4 record high in 2000.[i] In the US, over 41% of investors were bullish, according to the American Association of Individual Investors’ survey, just above its average since 1987.[ii] Moreover, the economy didn’t begin contracting gradually this time—production suddenly stopped as COVID-19-related responses closed businesses, which halted growth.

Story continues below advertisement

The bear market’s unprecedented speed compressed the sentiment cycle, in our view. The MSCI World Index’s high was on 12 February, a couple weeks before shutdowns in Europe began.[iii] Then, reality still seemed sunny to us and many observers we follow. In late January, the International Monetary Fund’s World Economic Outlook projected global growth accelerating to 3.3% in 2020.[iv] Sentiment may have been optimistic, but it appeared justified and rational to us. Absent COVID-19’s global spread and the associated interruptions to business, that optimism may have eventually become euphoric. But the surprising institutional response to shut down business around the world cut the sentiment cycle’s progression short, in our view. Growing outbreaks in South Korea, Italy and Iran brought rising alarm. Italy’s first case was announced on 20 February. But a full lockdown didn’t occur until 10 March. Business closures—for weeks, if not months—erased hope economic activity might avoid a big collapse.

A global recession looks increasingly likely from the early data rolling in. Whilst we think employment data are a lagging indicator, 17 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits in March’s last three weeks.[v] Before this, there had never been a week above 700,000 in the series’ 53-year history.[vi] The eurozone composite purchasing managers’ index (PMI), combining manufacturing and services, plunged to 29.7 in March—well below the 50 level, which indicates contraction—in its biggest ever single-month drop.[vii] For the world, March’s global composite PMI fell to 39.4, its lowest level in 11 years.[viii]

Judging by financial publications we follow regularly, few would likely be surprised by recession—as sentiment seemingly reflects the bear market maturing. Forecasters from major financial firms project huge drops in Q2 gross domestic product (GDP, a government-produced measure of economic output) for most major economies. In early April, the IMF warned GDP could fall more than during the recession that accompanied 2008’s global financial crisis. Comparisons we read in the press go further. Many headlines we encounter suggest we are on the verge of another Great Depression—modern history’s biggest economic contraction on record. Many pundits we see argue the recovery, whenever it comes, will be hamstrung by high unemployment, business failures and rising government debt. To us, the mood appears rather panicky.

It isn’t clear if current sentiment marks the bear’s end. We think it will be clear only in hindsight, but the fear and panic we see isn’t unusual. We think markets, which efficiently discount widely known information, likely reflect that panic. A reality that doesn’t meet or exceed that should positively surprise investors. That is how, as Templeton put it, “Bull markets are born on pessimism.”

Whilst the current bear market is unique in its shocking speed, sentiment’s evolution to apparent panic suggests it may progress to a conclusion swiftly. Sentiment is unpredictable—and could always go lower—but the further it stretches expectations downward from likely outcomes, the easier it is for reality to positively surprise, in our view.

The S&P/TSX composite index fell 30.06 points to 16,626.06.

The energy sector led the decline with shares in the sector, on average, losing 1.58 per cent of their worth as the price of oil retreated. The October crude contract lost five cents to US$43.12 per barrel.

Oil prices have struggled to make notable headway beyond the US$43 mark, said Bangsund, as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to suppress the outlook for oil demand.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries leaders are set to meet Wednesday, she added, ""so the market may be in a bit of a holding pattern in anticipation of what's to come out of that meeting.""

As well as resources, the financial sector fell Tuesday, down 0.5 per cent.

Indexes south of the border have higher exposure to growth-oriented sectors than the TSX, said Bangsund, such as the technology giants and consumer-discretionary stocks like Amazon that led Tuesday's performance charge.

In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average shed 66.84 points to 27,778.07.

The Nasdaq composite rose 81.12 points to 11,210.84, while the S&P 500 index added 7.79 points to 3,389.78 finally cracking its previous all-time closing high of 3,386.15 set in February.

The S&P 500 also cracked its previous intraday high, also set in February, hitting a record 3,395.06 earlier in the trading day.

""Surprisingly we're not seeing a lot of reaction to the news of Finance Minister (Bill) Morneau's resignation,"" said Bangsund.

Morneau resigned late Monday. Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland was sworn in as his replacement Tuesday afternoon.

""The one area you would thought would be most impacted would be in the currency market,"" said Bangsund, ""but the Canadian dollar is actually stronger on the day owing mainly to the unrelenting drop in the U.S. dollar.""

The Canadian dollar traded for 75.93 cents US compared with 75.72 cents US on Monday.

Elsewhere in commodities, the September natural gas contract added nearly eight cents to nearly US$2.42 per mmBTU. The December gold contract advanced US$14.40 to US$2,013.10 an ounce and the September copper contract gained seven cents to nearly US$2.98 a pound.

The record confirms, according to a widely accepted definition, that Wall Street’s most closely followed index entered a bull market after hitting its pandemic low on March 23. It has surged about 55% since then.

That makes the bear market that started in late February the S&P 500′s shortest in its history.

Since the March 23 closing low, the S&P posted the largest gain in a 103-day period in 87 years, according to Refinitiv data.

Trillions of dollars in fiscal and monetary stimulus have made Wall Street flush with cash, pushing yield-seeking investors into equities. Amazon and other high growth technology-related stocks have been viewed as the most reliable to ride out the crisis.

Doubts about the underlying health of the economy, however, persisted in Tuesday’s session, with lukewarm reactions to bumper results from Home Depot and Walmart limiting gains.

The S&P 500 flirted with all-time highs for several sessions before finally hitting a new record, raising questions about whether this run of gains could last.

“The S&P 500 has been impressive and has created a lot of wealth, but I am not sure that reflects the overall health of the economy,” said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist at Incapital.

“The rally has more to do with asset inflation, which is fueled by all the liquidity and all the continued support in the economy as well as the weakening dollar,” he added.

Unofficially, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 67.32 points, or 0.24%, to 27,777.59, the S&P 500 gained 7.79 points, or 0.23%, to 3,389.78 and the Nasdaq Composite added 81.12 points, or 0.73%, to 11,210.84.

In Canada, stocks closed slightly lower, pressured by a 1.58% dip in the energy sector. The S&P/TSX Composite Index lost 30.06 points, or 0.18%, at 16,626.06. The Canadian benchmark index remains more than 7% below its all-time high set in February of this year, in part because of its heavy weighting in the oil and gas sector and its minimal exposure to technology names.

The October crude futures contract in New York retreated five cents to US$43.12 per barrel.

The December gold contract advanced US$14.40 to US$2,013.10 an ounce and the September copper contract gained seven cents to nearly US$2.98 a pound - but the TSX materials sector ended the day with a 0.42% loss.

Consumer discretionary rose the most among major S&P sectors on strength in Amazon while technology stocks provided another major support to the benchmark index.

A total of 1,930 starts have been recorded for the capital region for the first seven months, up only slightly from 1,921 Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. said Tuesday in its monthly report on housing starts.

What’s notable is that these homes are going ahead as Greater Victoria’s housing market remains strong, even as unemployment last month reached 11.1 per cent — the third consecutive monthly increase.

The capital region has seen single-family housing starts increase as developers focus on major projects in the West Shore, such as Latoria North and South on Royal Bay lands in Colwood.

Smaller lots, low interest rates and lower land costs are among factors luring builders to the West Shore.

Year-to-date, single-family house construction rose by 20 per cent, with 420 starts, an increase from 349 for the same months last year.

Last month alone, the number of homes started in Greater Victoria was 363, up from 307 in July 2019. The majority — 321 — were in Langford, Colwood, View Royal and Sooke.

Of the single-family homes that got underway this year, 273 of them have been in Langford, Colwood, View Royal and Sooke, with 51 in July alone.

Across Canada, a total of 245,604 starts were recorded in July, an increase of 16 per cent from 212,095 in June.

“The national trend in housing starts increased for a second month in July,” said Bob Dugan, CMHC’s chief economist.

“Higher multi-family starts in major urban areas, including Toronto, Vancouver and oil-producing centres in the Prairies drove the national increase.

“Following declines in previous months from COVID-19 measures, higher activity in June and July leaves the trend in housing starts in line with the long-run average level of housing starts.”

Dugan predicted that national starts will trend lower in the near term because of the negative impact of COVID-19 the economy.

Omar Abdelrahman, TD Banking economist, said, “Canadian housing data continues to defy expectations.”

The latest numbers “reinforces the resilience of homebuilding activity, and housing market activity more broadly, despite the unprecedented, pandemic-induced hit to the economy.”

Other than a pandemic-related shutdown in Quebec in April,“homebuilding has shown only a muted response to COVID-19, swiftly returning to pre-pandemic levels. This stands in contrast with more severe declines and more drawn-out recoveries seen in other industries,” Abdelrahman said.

Housing demand now and in the near term will be partly fuelled by past population growth, low interest rates, and general demand, he said.

However, he cautions that lower immigration limiting population growth could reduct that activity.

Economists on average had expected an annual rate of 210,000, according to financial markets data firm Refinitiv.

""Housing starts continue to rebound nicely. Strong underlying demand and low rates mean builders likely won't be packing away those hammers any time soon,"" wrote Priscilla Thiagamoorthy, an economist at BMO Capital Markets Economics, in a note to clients.

The increase came as urban starts of apartments, condos and other types of multiple-unit housing projects rose 18.8 per cent to 184,431 in July while single-detached urban starts climbed 12.3 per cent to 47,564.

Rural starts were estimated at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 13,609 units for July.

""The strength in homebuilding was widespread across all regions, but was, surprisingly, led by the Prairies and Atlantic Canada,"" wrote Omar Abdelrahman, an economist at TD Economics. ""Indeed, aside from the complete pause in Quebec in April due to restrictions on non-essential economic activity, homebuilding has shown only a muted response to COVID-19, swiftly returning to pre-pandemic levels.""

Despite the upward trend, Bob Dugan, CMHC's chief economist, said in a statement that he expects homebuilding to slow in the near future. Dugan's statement cited the negative impact of COVID-19 on economic and housing indicators.

""Despite the housing market's durability thus far, we continue to see a soft spot ahead given the ongoing lack of immigration and upcoming resumption of many deferred mortgages,"" wrote Royce Mendes in a note to clients from CIBC Economics.

""Furthermore, interest from investors for short-term rental condo units in downtown cores has come under severe pressure just as demand dynamics are shifting toward a desire for suburban homes with more space and backyards.""

An index is a select number of stocks listed on an exchange. These selected stocks are typically designed to provide an approximation of the performance of the broad index. This means that each index is typically within one country or one geographic area, and some countries have numerous indices. It is important to note that not all indices are valued the same way.

The key for most investors is to determine which index is the closest benchmark to gauge their overall stock market performance. Indices provide us a system of measuring change that can be documented and reported in the newspaper, radio, internet and television. Investors should use caution when looking at this information to make investment decisions and to monitor their own portfolio. Let’s start by first obtaining an understanding of the major indices used around the world.

To assist you in obtaining a better understanding of the various “equity” benchmarks, we have included a few points below, sorted geographically.

United States and Canada

If you have equities within your portfolio, then chances are one, or more, of the four indices below could be a benchmark you could look at periodically.

• Dow Jones Industrial Average (US): Consists of the 30 largest and most widely held public companies in the United States.

• S&P 500 Index (US): S&P stands for Standard & Poor’s, and this Index consists of just over 500 large companies, most of which are American.

• NASDAQ Composite Index (US): NASDAQ stands for National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System, and this Index is made up of over 3,300 companies.

• S&P/TSX Composite Index (Canada): TSX (formerly TSE), stands for Toronto Stock Exchange, and this Index consists of approximately 231 large companies as measured by market capitalization, all of which are Canadian.

If you have expanded your portfolio beyond Canada and the United States then we have summarized a few points of other major indices around the world below.

Americas

• IPC Index (Mexico) is a market capitalization weighted index containing 35 companies.

• Bovespa Index (Brazil) isbest known as Ibovesa and is comprised of the most liquid stocks traded on the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange. This Index has a broad range of companies.

Europe

• Euro Stoxx 50 (Eurozone) is a European Index for the Eurozone, holding 50 of the largest and most liquid stocks from 9 countries within the Eurozone.

• FTSE 100 Index (United Kingdom) is a market capitalization weighted index representing the performance of the 100 largest UK-domiciled companies. FTSE stands for Financial Times and the London Stock Exchange.

• CAC 40 Index (France) consists of 40 large French companies as listed on Euronext Paris.

• DAX Index (Germany) consists of the 30 large German companies trading on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.

• IBEX 35 Index (Spain)iscomprised of 35 large Spanish companies traded on the Bolsa de Madrid which is Spain’s primary stock exchange.

• FTSE MIB Index (Italy)consists of 40 large Italian companies traded on Borsa Italiana’s (BIt) MTA market.

• AEX Index (Netherlands)iscomposed of Dutch companies that trade on Euronext Amsterdam and is comprised of a maximum of 25 of the most actively traded securities on the exchange.

• OMX Stockholm 30 Index (Sweden) is a market value weighted index that consists of the 30 most-traded stock classes.

• SWISS Market Index (Switzerland) is made up of 20 of the largest and most liquid stocks. The index is capped so that no one constituent exceeds a weight of 18 per cent of the overall index.

Asia and Pacific

• Nikkei 225 (Japan) is a stock market index for the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE). The Nikkei 225 is the most watched index of Asian stocks.

• Hang Seng Index (Hong Kong) is a free float-adjusted market capitalization weighted stock market index in Hong Kong consisting of 50 companies broken down by four main sectors.

• S&P/ASX 200 Index (Australia) is a market capitalization weighted and float-adjusted stock market index of 200 stocks listed on the Australian Securities Exchange.

Largest Company in Canada

Over the years, we have seen several companies become Canada’s largest company by market capitalization. Few investors can forget the rise of Nortel Networks. It had become so large in August 2000 that it was more than ten times the size of the second largest company in Canada.

Research in Motion became the most valuable company in Canada in October 2007. Remember when natural gas prices spiked and Encana became the largest company in September of 2005? How about Valeant Pharmaceuticals? This stock became the largest company in Canada by market capitalization in July 2015.

On May 6, 2020, Shopify overtook Royal Bank of Canada to become Canada’s most valuable company. It remains to be seen if Shopify will continue its dominance or if it will suffer a similar fate to its predecessors.

What is a Market Weight Index?

There are a couple of different terms used such as “market value-weighted index” and “capitalization-weighted index” that mean the same thing as a market weighted index. Essentially, with a market weighted index, a security’s weighting is based according to the total market capitalization of the security. This means that larger capitalization securities will have a higher weighting percentage in the index and have a greater influence on the index as the price of the security rises or falls.

Let’s take a look at the TSX Composite Index which is a market weighted index. On January 1, 2020, the TSX started the year at 17,063.43 and was at 16,169.21 as of July 31, 2020 – a decline of 5.24 per cent.

In that same time period the top point contributor to the index was Shopify which contributed 637.75 points. Barrick Gold was the second top point contributor adding 187.88 points to the index.

As noted above, Shopify has become the biggest stock in Canada. If you were to take Shopify out of the index then the index would be down 10.56 per cent. This shows how much one security can influence an index in a market-weighted index.

What is a “Capped” Index?

If you are following an index that has the word “Capped” in it, then they will put an upper limit on the weight of any single security. For example, you can monitor the S&P/TSX Capped Composite Index which restricts the weighting of any security to a maximum of 10 per cent. Another example of a capped index is the SWISS Market Index which capped its weighting at 18 per cent in 2017 to address some of the larger capitalized stocks such as Nestle and Novartis.

What is an Equal Weight Index?

An equal-weighted index is comprised of a group of companies. The index holds an equal dollar amount in each stock. Each company’s stock carries equal importance in determining the performance and total value of the index. Many market-weighted indices will have an equal weight index equivalent. For example, the S&P 500 Index has an equal weighted version where it takes all the constituents of the S&P 500 Index and assigns an equal weight to each.

Let’s look at how the S&P 500 Index and its equal weighted counterpart compare.

Similar to the market-weighted S&P/TSX Composite Index, a few large companies can have a huge influence on the performance of the index.

On January 1, 2020, the S&P 500 Index started the year at 3,230.78 and was at 3,271.12 as of July 31, 2020, an increase of 1.25 per cent. Three of the largest capitalized companies on the index contributed 176.84 points to the index (Amazon +66.33 points, Apple +66.10 points, and Microsoft +44.41 points). If you look at the equal weighted version of the S&P 500 then you have a much different story. Using the same time period of January 1, 2020 to July 31, 2020 the equal weighted S&P 500 Index posted a decline of 7.60 per cent.

In our next article, we will discuss how some investors use these indices as part of their investment strategy.

The number of sustainable investment products and assets under management (AUM) have continued to grow during the COVID-19 pandemic, providing more options for financial advisors looking to add responsible investments to their clients’ portfolios.

Sustainable investments – which include investment funds focused on environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors or companies making an impact in specific areas such as diversity and inclusion or climate change – have reached about $8.8-billion in AUM in Canada in 92 funds (excluding fund of funds) as of June 30, according to data from Morningstar Canada. That’s up 13 per cent from $7.8-billion, or 72 funds, as of Dec. 31, 2019.

The majority of sustainable investment funds in Canada, or 63 of the 88 that Morningstar Canada tracks, have also outperformed their peers for the first half of the year, “providing an acute observation that investing sustainably does not necessarily come at the expense of returns,” says Ian Tam, director of investment research at the Toronto-based firm.

Morningstar Canada’s research conducted over the past decade shows that sustainable investing “is not detrimental to investor outcomes,” Mr. Tam says, despite concern among some investors that responsible investing means sacrificing returns.

For advisors, the challenge is determining which type of sustainable investments are best suited to their clients, such as a fossil-fuel-free fund or something with a broader ESG mandate. Then, advisors need to ensure that the investments they choose are in areas they believe will perform well in the long term and aren’t a short-term fad that may fade quickly.

“We spend a lot of time thinking about themes versus trends,” says Martin Grosskopf, vice-president and portfolio manager, sustainable investing, at AGF Investments Inc. in Toronto, who manages AGF Global Sustainable Growth Equity Fund. “Trends you want to be careful about, themes you want to invest in … [because] themes won’t dissipate over time.”

Examples of longer-term sustainability themes include clean energy, carbon reduction and waste management, Mr. Grosskopf says.

Specifically, he points to well-known renewable energy companies such as Brookfield Renewable Partners LP (BEP-UN-T), which he holds in the AGF fund, as well as Innergex Renewable Energy Inc. (INE-T), Northland Power Inc. (NPI-T) and Algonquin Power and Utilities Corp. (AQN-T).

“These [companies] are solid, long-term opportunities,” Mr. Grosskopf says. “For some [investors], they were considered too boring to own. [But] these companies generate very good yield on long-term contracts and their opportunities are growing because their cost of capital is coming down.”

There’s also more investments in renewable projects, he says, “driven by government objectives and corporate decarbonization efforts.”

The AGF fund also holds other environmentally friendly companies that are part of the trend toward carbon and waste reduction, including Ecolab Inc. (ECL-N), which provides water and energy technologies and services, as well as Trex Co. Inc. (TREX-N), which recycles plastics bags and turns them into composite decking products.

“I would encourage [advisors] to look at these areas as long-term opportunities,” Mr. Grosskopf says of sustainable investing themes, in general.

Tim Nash, an independent investment coach at Good Investing in Toronto, says diversity and inclusion – which fall under the “S” and “G” part of ESG investing – are also expected to be important sustainable investing themes in the years to come.

He says more companies are making commitments to do better in this area, particularly in the wake of the social unrest following the police killing of George Floyd in the U.S.

The COVID-19 crisis has also highlighted income and health inequalities that exist in many countries around the world.

“[These events] have put a magnifying glass on the inequities that exist in our society,” Mr. Nash says. “People are saying, ‘Enough.’ It’s a bit of a breaking point.”

Story continues below advertisement

Companies are being forced to respond to calls for social justice, and Mr. Nash says investors are watching. And those that take action are more likely to outperform their peers who do little or nothing, over the long term.

Still, he cautions advisors and investors to do their homework on investments that claim to be ESG friendly. Some investment funds may not live up to their claims, while others may turn out to not fit investors’ values in other areas. For example, an ESG fund might hold gun, tobacco or gambling stocks, which an investor may be opposed to.

“It’s not always transparent,” Mr. Nash says. “It’s up to investors and advisors to do their due diligence and look under the hood of these products because they are different and use different methodologies. Also, look at the companies that are inside.”",788,0.8398234645420771,business

VICHAILAO/iStockPhoto / Getty Images

When financial advisors bring up philanthropic giving as part of a holistic wealth management strategy for clients, those advisors’ own charitable involvement can often arise. That provides advisors an opportunity to share their values and lead by example.

Many are charitably inclined and donate either their time or their money for worthy causes. But it can be challenging for advisors to bring up the conversation around strategic charitable giving strategies out of the blue when discussing investments or other financial matters, says Jeremy Hampson, senior wealth advisor at Assante Capital Management Ltd. in Montreal.

“If you’ve never spoken to your clients about charity and they come in and think they’re going to have a meeting to discuss their wills or their portfolios and you start [the conversation] with, ‘Have you ever thought about giving away half your estate?’ It’s not going to go very well,” he says.

Story continues below advertisement

One way to start the conversation is by looking at the charitable donations that clients included on their annual tax returns or by inquiring about their participation in fundraisers they may happen to be involved with, he says. Then, clients will often also ask about an advisor’s volunteer or philanthropic activity, which can help create that connection on the subject.

Mr. Hampson’s story with charities goes back almost 50 years, as his family was involved in grassroots organizations to support his sister with special needs. As an advisor, he began giving presentations on planning for special needs families, which led to fundraising and involvement with boards. He’s currently president of West Island Association for the Intellectually Handicapped, a charity in Montreal that assists people with intellectual disabilities, autism and their families.

Discussing his own charitable involvement usually leads to a larger conversation about philanthropy and ultimately strengthens the advisor-client relationship, Mr. Hampson says.

“[Clients then begin] to understand what makes me tick and what I’m passionate about,” he says. “It humanizes who I am and what I’m doing, so it just really adds another dimension to that relationship.”

Not only is it helpful for advisors who discuss philanthropy with clients to lead by example, but as a matter of integrity, it’s critically important for them to be engaged in and passionate about their own charitable activities, says Keith Thomson, founding partner and managing director at Stonegate Private Counsel in Toronto, a division of CI Private Counsel LP.

“There are two ways to give, with time and [money], and for advisors to be walking the talk, they should be doing both,” says Mr. Thomson, who’s on the board of directors for the Canadian Association of Gift Planners.

Invariably, Mr. Thomson says clients will ask him about the charities to which he gives and works with during conversations about their charitable interests. He takes these opportunities to discuss his philanthropic journey, which spans almost 30 years, including serving on the boards of organizations like the Toronto Foundation and AMREF Health Africa in Canada.

“It’s a wonderful conversation that’s not about money. It’s about what they can do with their money to make the world a better place,” Mr. Thomson says.

Although philanthropy comes up in the context of estate planning with older clients who have accumulated wealth, Linda Shick, senior vice-president and portfolio manager, private client group, at Raymond James Ltd.’s Family Wealth Counsel Advisory Group in Toronto, says giving back is also particularly important for those in the younger demographic who have been involved in charities while they were in school.

“[Younger] people who have been referred to me check out [my] website and one of the things they say is [that my] community involvement is important [to them],” says Ms. Shick, who is a member of the Raymond James Canada Foundation advisory committee and serves on the board of directors at the St. Felix Centre in Toronto.

Indeed, according to the Case Foundation’s final Millennial Impact Report, which was released in 2019 and included analysis from a decade of surveying more than 150,000 U.S. millennials on how they interact with causes, this cohort makes philanthropic decisions based on personal connections and moves toward greater activism as they age.

“They can actually pick their advisors based on community involvement. So, I think that’s actually going to get more important as this generation builds wealth,” Ms. Shick says.

Ultimately, advisors looking to become more involved in philanthropy and giving back should consider causes or organizations with which they feel a personal connection and seek further information from not-for-profit professionals, Mr. Hampson says.

“Even if you don’t have the time to volunteer, then pick up the phone and have a conversation with the executive director of that place and find out what they’re looking for,” he adds.

With many fundraisers cancelled this year because of the COVID-19 pandemic, this is an ideal time for advisors to reach out and ask how they could help. (According to Imagine Canada’s Sector Monitor charities report published in May, almost three-quarters of charities reported a decline in at least one form of donations, with events-based fundraising affected most significantly.)

“A lot of advisors are really savvy when it comes to marketing and [developing] business opportunities, and that’s exactly what charities need the most help with right now – strategic thinking and fundraising capabilities,” Mr. Thomson says.

“For those advisors who are willing to volunteer time and money, this is the time to do it,” he adds.",923,0.9506866384940226,business

When the COVID-19 crisis first hit, it changed many people’s day-to-day realities and cast their futures into uncertainty, making it difficult for them to focus on distant goals. But now that the initial shock has passed, financial advisors say clients are once again starting to discuss their long-term plans.

“There were a few months there in which the whole notion of the future felt like it was just not relevant,” says Karin Mizgala, co-founder and chief executive officer of Money Coaches Canada in Vancouver. “There was more focus on the immediacy of, ‘Are my investments still okay?’ ‘Do I still have a job?’ ‘What does this mean to my family?’ [and] trying to get organized with the kids and parents at home.”

However, she says that through June and into July, her firm’s website has seen an uptick in inquiries about retirement planning to almost double historical numbers.

“It feels like we’re now moving into a new phase in which people are starting to think about what impact COVID-19 and the financial markets are having on their life and on their future,” Ms. Mizgala says. “COVID-19 has forced us to really think about what’s important to us, what’s meaningful, what our values and goals are.”

As clients pay renewed attention to their goals and, in some cases, begin to change them – for example, she says several of her clients are now more focused on charitable giving – advisors can check in to make sure those goals are meaningful, measurable and achievable.

Ms. Mizgala teases out her clients’ goals by asking open-ended questions, engaging in active listening and reflecting client answers back to them.

“It’s a back-and-forth dialogue that ultimately helps them and helps us hone in on the direction that they want to go in and, of course, where they’re at now. Then, the planning process fills in the gaps of laying out what the various options are and scenarios that can help them achieve those goals,” she says. “The beautiful thing about planning and working with a financial planner is that you can put pen to paper on any idea without having to actually execute on it until you look at the pros and cons.”

Nicole Ewing, Canadian strategist, client needs research, at Edward Jones in Ottawa, also says it’s important to dig deeper to get a clear picture of a client’s goals.

“Many clients default to, ‘Well, I want to retire,’” she says. Asking probing questions like the following can help make that more specific: “What does that look like? Does retirement mean financial freedom? Does it mean a particular age? Does it mean a particular income level at that point? Having a dialogue about it definitely helps define the goals better.”

In addition, Ms. Ewing sees clients’ shorter-term, more immediate concerns as a potential jumping-off point that can broaden conversations about longer-term planning and introduce new goals clients may not have considered.

For example, she says many clients are focused on staying healthy right now, so perhaps it’s a good time to discuss how to manage the financial repercussions of health challenges in the future. Similarly, with some clients concerned about downward pressure on real estate values, it may be appropriate to talk about how to make retirement plans less vulnerable to fluctuations in the real estate market.

“We can’t control some of the events that might happen to us during our lifetimes, but we can plan for them and take the opportunity of what we’re experiencing now to think about how it might impact us later,” Ms. Ewing says. “Focusing on goals allows us to look forward to that future, and building that foundation now allows us to work toward that. For a lot of people, focusing on goals provides comfort and a feeling of hope.”

While in-depth conversations are one way to zero in on a client’s goals, a recent Morningstar Inc. study titled “Mining for Goals,” suggests that providing clients with a menu of choices can help significantly, too. According to the study, 73 per cent of survey participants changed one of the three top goals they had shared with the researchers after they saw a standardized master list of 17 potential goals.

“[We asked the study’s participants] two very straightforward questions – Why are you doing this? What are you aspiring to? – and many of the answers they give right off the top of their heads turn out to be not very reliable,” says Ryan Murphy, head of decisions sciences at Morningstar Investment Management in Chicago.

“[But] just giving people a little bit more time and space and a structured process to think through what their motivations and what their preferences are can help them identify and communicate those better. That really helps the advising process and helps people develop a financial plan that serves their long-term best interests,” he adds.

Starting with a list may be more important than ever in the current environment.

“There’s good evidence that shows during times of heightened stress and uncertainty, people’s attention narrows, their focus on the here and now is amplified, and it gets harder to think about the abstract or the more distant future,” Mr. Murphy says.

Whether clients are still in crisis mode or emerging from it, Mr. Murphy says that, “good financial planners are able to help their clients articulate and understand their reasons for investing – what their goals are – and then make sure that their financial plans, their asset allocations, the details of investing match up nicely to serving those long-term goals.”",940,0.9184971348994884,business

Ron Harvey, senior financial advisor at IPC Investment Corp. in Ottawa, has learned to be strategic about scheduling video calls with clients and colleagues while working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic.

He only schedules two or three video meetings a day between Tuesdays and Thursdays and reserves Mondays and Fridays for administrative tasks and to catch up on his work.

Limiting the number of video calls he takes per week has worked wonders for curbing virtual meeting fatigue, more commonly known as “Zoom fatigue,” a form of burnout unique to conversing through a screen, Mr. Harvey says. Compared with face-to-face discussions, virtual meetings typically require more attention to pick up on non-verbal cues, allow greater room for distraction and increase our self-consciousness over our own image in the corner of the screen.

“I find it helps a lot,” he says of his scheduling tactics, noting that his clients are generally amenable to these parameters as well. (His assistant, who typically schedules his calls, always offers clients three or four available meeting slots, which has proven effective.)

Zoom fatigue is by no means unique to the financial services industry. Workers across all industries are tiring from endless screen-to-screen contact. But for many advisors, virtual meetings are inescapable. With increasingly volatile markets and clients in distress, the past few months have required new levels of remote meetings – and that has left advisors with no choice but to take them on.

Mr. Harvey suggests that advisors struggling with virtual meeting fatigue experiment with their schedule and stick to whatever works. For example, he’s also found success in leaving windows of time before and after each meeting to do preparation and follow-up work.

Without the burden of a commute, he also starts his work-from-home days slightly earlier than normal, logging in at 8 a.m. and logging out by 4:30 p.m. He fills his calendar with opportunities to take breaks and go for walks, which keeps him from spending hours on end in front of the screen.

He also strives to keep his client meetings as focused as possible to limit the amount of time doing video calls. He writes an agenda, sends it to clients a few days in advance and sticks to it during the meeting.

“The client and I have a structured meeting; that’s how I think other advisors who are concerned about spending all their time on a computer screen [can avoid fatigue],” Mr. Harvey says.

Domenic Gallippi, regional director at Russell Investments Canada Ltd. in Toronto, takes a similar approach. He does upfront prep work to ensure that his meetings are “ultra-effective” and efficient. Attendees receive an agenda a few days prior, during which they can ask questions and or add items to the to-do list. Everyone knows going into the meeting what it’s for and all have the chance to make the most of the conversation.

“We’re trying to avoid having those lumpy days during which you have, you know, 10 Zoom meetings and then you don’t have any for the next three days,” he says. “How you deliver a solid 15- to 30-minute conversation [when] by the time you’re at your sixth or seventh [videoconferencing meeting] of the day, you feel like or sound like a robot.”

Mr. Gallippi says that sending preparatory material to clients in advance of virtual meetings can also help earn back the trust that’s so often eroded without face-to-face contact. Research on “computer-mediated communication” shows that non-verbal cues are an essential part of establishing a sense of rapport with another person; while videoconferencing is an alternative to face-to-face communication, it’s not an entirely effective for the purposes of building client trust.

“Anytime that you take away the in-person interaction, it makes something a little bit more challenging. For a lot of people, the in-person interaction is what is what cements the trust in the relationship,” Mr. Gallippi says.

He strives to make up for this by showing the others on the call that he’s done his homework before meeting with them.

“[Make] sure that your audience understands there’s a level of preparation that you put into the meeting,” Gallippi says. “Something as simple as the calendar invitation. … If you have a copy of the deck ready, or whatever it is that you’re going to be sharing ... I think goes a long way in terms of them believing you’re a subject matter expert.”

Mr. Gallippi’s colleague, Julie Zhang, Russell Investments’ director of North America sales in Seattle, says she’s learned to treat Zoom fatigue the same way she treats other forms of fatigue.

When life went into lockdown in March, she quickly grew overconfident about the efficiency of virtual meetings and packed “easily … 10 to 12 meetings a day,” into her schedule, all taking place over Zoom.

“At the end of March, I was like, ‘I can’t do this, I’m exhausted,’” Ms. Zhang says. She found relief in being more mindful about her schedule – respecting when certain matters could be kept to e-mail and working breaks into her day to step away from the screen.

Mr. Harvey echoes the sentiment, acknowledging that it can be difficult, at times, to respect breaks for what they are. Be disciplined about it if you have to, he suggests.

“Don’t spend all of your downtime reading articles online,” he says. “That’s how you can get yourself too glued to the screen at all times.”",934,0.9543792484620565,business

The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way people work, made “secure” jobs insecure and exposed corporate weaknesses – all of which is prompting some Canadians to rethink their careers. That provides a relationship-building opportunity for financial advisors to help their clients decide whether to risk jumping ship in the middle of an economic storm and – if they make that leap – to work with them to protect their finances.

“What’s happening with the labour market is causing the relationship between employers and employees or contractors to be reimagined,” says Carolyn Levy, president of Randstad Technologies at Randstad Canada, the Canadian division of the global staffing, recruitment and employment services firm, in Calgary.

“In a wonderful way, there’s actually a lot of opportunity ahead for people who maybe wouldn’t have considered working in some organizations … because of the commute or because of the flexibility that they might need,” she adds.

The stigma associated with working from home and connecting remotely to meetings is fading because so many people have had to make the shift to a home office – and this new reality has also given some people more time to reflect on whether they’re in the right jobs and at the right companies, Ms. Levy says.

There are hints of employee discontent in the June edition of the Randstad Workmonitor Global Report, which was based on a survey conducted in May.

While 90 per cent of Canadian survey participants said they had adapted to their new pandemic-influenced working situation, just 77 per cent thought their employer was looking after their well-being through the pandemic and 61 per cent reported that the pandemic has had a negative impact on their job.

In addition, Canadian survey participants said their employers were placing increased demands on them, as 55 per cent said employers expect staff to make themselves available outside regular working hours – almost 12 percentage points higher than in November 2019.

However, Kurt Rosentreter, portfolio manager and senior financial advisor with Manulife Securities in Toronto, warns that clients considering a career switch in the current environment need to be extremely cautious.

“We could be on the cusp of the biggest recession we’ve seen in 20 years,” he warns. “If unemployment goes from 4 per cent to 12 per cent, you don’t want to be quitting your job right now.”

That said, Mr. Rosentreter has some younger clients who have suggested they may want to start talking about a potential career change later this year depending on how the next few months play out. He thinks it’s important to walk clients through a cost-benefit analysis. Factors to consider include the expenses associated with retraining, whether there will be a period of reduced or no income, what workplace benefits and insurance protection they’re giving up, and what income and benefits the new career offers.

Mr. Rosentreter says it’s also critical to evaluate the potential impact that a change of career could have on a client’s current financial plan.

“If you’re going to do a restart or even a pause, both will have an implication on your longer-term goals. Is that also in your vision of an acceptable range of possibilities?” he asks his clients – and he reminds them to involve their partner, if they have one, in the decision-making process.

For Patti Dolan, portfolio manager with Mission Wealth Advisors at Raymond James Ltd., career transitions among clients aren’t a new trend. She’s located in Calgary, where a downturn in the oil and gas sector in the past few years was prompting professionals to go back to school and change careers well before COVID-19 came along. Now, the pandemic is another factor making people re-evaluate their professions, she says.

Ms. Dolan says it’s important to help clients realize and prepare for the immediate financial and real-life implications of making such a change.

“They need to look at how they could carry themselves financially for the next two to four years if they’re looking at going back to school,” she says. “If they’re transitioning into another job or another career path, are they going to be taking a salary cut? And how long will it take to build that up again?”

Clients also need to ask themselves, “What if this doesn’t work out? What would I do next?” Ms. Dolan says.

‘Smart beta’ has emerged as the next stage of advancement for investors and financial advisors interested in diversified, low-cost equity exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which have performed swimmingly during the past decade thanks to the U.S. bull market’s rising tide.

Smart beta ETFs screen investments for factors beyond market-capitalization weightings associated with traditional ETFs – and they’re becoming increasingly popular.

According to ETF.com, more than 1,000 smart beta ETFs now trade on North American stock markets, including 95 that were launched last year. Investors have poured more than US$1-trillion into the category.

Todd Mathias, certified financial analyst, vice-president–senior ETF product strategist at Franklin Templeton Investments in San Mateo, Calif., says their popularity is driven in part by investment advisors, who are increasingly wary of clients’ overexposure to broad-based indexes like the S&P 500.

“Many [advisors] tell me they have been worried about this for a few years, and it only becomes more top of mind when you look at the current multiples [in stock prices],” he says.

Thus, advisors are looking to smart beta strategies as a way to moderate risk while providing some form of protection if the market reverses quickly.

“Smart beta rewrites the traditional index rulebook, which weights and invests by the size of the company’s security,” Mr. Mathias says.

In contrast, smart beta’s factor-based index approach employs research-driven strategies to screen stocks for an ETF portfolio.

Typically, these screens encompass one of five strategies: quality (companies with good earnings growth), value (firms that are undervalued), momentum (stocks that have stronger recent price appreciation), low volatility (companies with lower risk than the market) and dividend (those firms paying out higher dividends than average).

In the past couple of years, the low-volatility subcategory has been especially popular, according to National Bank of Canada Financial Inc., which tracks ETFs.

Story continues below advertisement

The firm reports it has seen waves of inflows into smart beta ETFs. In 2019 alone, low-volatility ETFs attracted $2.5-billion in Canada, and much of this inflow came in the aftermath of the U.S. market selloff in late 2018.

Mr. Mathias points to the past year as an example. In the first six months of 2019, a low-volatility smart beta ETF would have outperformed the market. The second half of the year was a different story, though, with the strategy lagging behind the S&P 500 by about 8 per cent.

Due to the cyclical nature of each smart beta strategy, investors face the challenge of selecting the right factor to not only match current market conditions but future ones, too. Essentially, advisors run the risk of picking the wrong ETF at the wrong time.

The industry has moved to address this by creating multi-factor smart beta ETFs.

Mr. Mathias says these multi-factor ETF strategies essentially give investors another layer of diversification, providing exposure to several factors at once in one low-cost, liquid portfolio.

“By combining these factors thoughtfully, you can enhance returns and reduce risk, while still keeping clients invested in equity markets,” he says.

Mr. Mathias says Franklin Templeton offers four multi-factor ETFs in its suite of ETFs in Canada. Among them is Franklin LibertyQT U.S. Equity Index ETF (FLUS), which has attracted more than $240-million in client assets since its 2017 launch in Canada.

FLUS utilizes a rules-based approach to select U.S. stocks, which have favourable exposure to four factors and strategically weighted: quality at 50 per cent, value at 30 per cent, momentum at 10 per cent and low volatility also at 10 per cent.

Mr. Mathias says Franklin Templeton’s smart beta offerings are not designed to capture all the upside of the broader markets. Rather, multi-factor ETFs seek to mitigate downside risk while capturing a substantial portion of the upside in the market.

Open this photo in gallery Jeremy Olen, chief investment officer, The Financial Services Network SUPPLIED

This emphasis on quality resonates with many advisors, he adds. Among them is Azeem Virjee, senior investment advisor and portfolio manager at Wellington-Altus Private Wealth Inc. in Calgary, who says “traditional portfolio construction” presents challenges because “market capitalization is based on two key assumptions:” markets are efficient and investors are rational. “In reality, [neither] is often not the case.”

Mr. Virjee adds that a single-beta approach, while useful at times, is not as desirable as a multi-factor ETF, which “helps smooth out returns” over time.

By design, multi-factor ETFs reduce the depth of market dips, which in turn helps keep clients happy, Mr. Mathias says.

“The strategy is basically saying, ‘I believe value, quality, momentum and low volatility are strategies worth investing in, but I don’t want to be on the wrong side with a strategy losing money one to two years,’” he explains. “So, by blending all these factors together in one product, I’m getting the best of all worlds.”

Jeremy Olen, chief investment officer at The Financial Services Network in Sacramento, Calif., which provides investing and portfolio consulting services to independent advisors, points out that multi-factor ETFs are ideal for expressing long-term market views in a client portfolio “in a low-cost, tax efficient manner.”

They often have low management expense ratios and because they offer exposure to several factors, advisors don’t have to trade in and out of single-factor ETFs to adjust to market conditions, which would otherwise increase trading costs and potentially lead to realized, taxable capital gains, he says.

For financial advisors and investors, the past decade has been about adjusting to the ‘new normal’ in portfolio construction.

Facing lower yields from fixed income, many portfolios have undergone a facelift as investors looking for greater returns jumped from safe, low-return, fixed-income instruments to riskier, higher-yielding bonds or dividend-paying stocks.

“The fixed-income portion of the portfolio has become much more complicated – to say the least,” says Ahmed Farooq, vice-president of exchange-traded fund (ETF) business development at Franklin Templeton Investments in Toronto.

Even for advisors, building this life preserver part of the portfolio has been challenging, particularly when it comes to convincing clients they need fixed income after more than a decade of rising equity markets and morose bond returns.

“It’s not an easy game,” says Edward Jong, a fixed-income portfolio manager with T.I.P. Wealth Manager Inc. in Toronto.

He notes among the challenges for fixed income is the low return environment globally, in which European and other nations have issued more than $11-trillion in bonds with negative yields.

Traditional portfolio construction is “predicated heavily on modern portfolio theory and the advantages of diversification” and does not necessarily work like it did more than a decade ago, says David Andrews, vice-president and client portfolio manager at Franklin Templeton Investments in Toronto.

The diversification and risk-reducing benefit of adding bonds to equities has weakened. That means investors will need to start considering their options when seeking the safety cushion fixed-income investments provide.

While Canadian and U.S. fixed-income yields aren’t yet negative, they’re still losing propositions after inflation and taxation.

However, a strong argument can be made that investors’ portfolios need greater exposure to fixed income today more than ever. As Mr. Farooq notes, it’s more than likely many portfolios are out of balance from their original investment goals.

“In the 10 years of this reigning bull market, a lot of investors lost focus on the fixed-income exposure just because equities were up,” he says.

Moreover, if investors were buying fixed income, it was often “higher-octane” bonds, Mr. Farooq adds.

Most advisors acknowledge fixed income’s value as a portfolio cushion, padding against equities’ downside; driving that point home to clients is another matter, though.

“You have to do a lot of education,” says Adrian Mastracci, discretionary portfolio manager at Lycos Asset Management Inc. in Vancouver.

Specifically, he says he must explain to clients often that fixed income is necessary, albeit bitter, medicine for long-term portfolio health.

“Sometimes, when you look at the [fixed-income] returns you just have to hold your breath and carry on. That’s what I tell my clients,” he says.

Mr. Mastracci uses several portfolio management tools to get better fixed-income exposure, including individual bonds, guaranteed investment certificates and ETFs.

But it’s ETFs that have been a game-changer for bond investing in the past decade, with investors happy to take what a low-cost, diversified passive strategy gives them.

While that’s worked well over the past 10 years, a passive strategy may not be as rewarding over the next decade, Mr. Andrews says.

For example, a Canadian bond ETF that tracks a benchmark index by design will be affected, inevitably, by Canada’s large energy sector, which remains mired in a slump. That may pose more risk than advisors and investors are comfortable with going forward.

That’s where a new breed of ETFs may prove their worth. They’re actively managed with low management expense ratios (MERs) that look beyond traditional ETF investing.

Story continues below advertisement

Active ETFs start by tracking a benchmark index and a portfolio manager has the flexibility to deviate from the designated index or sector allocations to achieve alpha – better returns – based on their analysis.

These fund managers have the greenlight to adjust their portfolios tactically in response to events such as monetary policy changes, geopolitical events, interest rate changes or more – all of which can make fixed-income investments tougher to navigate.

Truly active portfolio managers also have the tools and the research capabilities to select bonds properly in an effort to help deliver better investor outcomes, while a passive portfolio manager has to match the fundamentals of the benchmark index.

This new generation of ETFs might involve, for example, providing broad exposure to Canadian government and blue-chip corporate bonds while leaving a significant allocation – say, up to 30 per cent of the portfolio – “designed to fill gaps that are not fulfilled in the Canadian bond marketplace … with investments that are off the Canadian benchmark,” Mr. Andrews explains.

That allocation might include high-yield U.S. bonds and short-term bank loans to generate a positive real return in the fixed-income allocation of the portfolio, he adds.

Or, an actively managed global bond ETF might still be “benchmark aware” providing, for example, diversified exposure based on the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index, but with a “fundamental screen on top,” Mr. Farooq says.

Story continues below advertisement

As such, the fund manager can underweight geographical allocations on the benchmark, which have negative yields and instead overweight “other countries with a positive outlook,” he says.

Also noteworthy is that actively managed ETFs can come with management fees that are competitive with those of passive products.

“It’s never been cheaper to get diversified exposure to bonds in the portfolio,” Mr. Andrews adds.

Put another way, advisors and even do-it-yourself investors don’t have to go it alone constructing the fixed-income portion of the portfolio unless, of course, they want to.

“For the most part, advisors are more comfortable with the equity side of the equation but some less comfortable managing the uncertainty we have with fixed-income market going forward,” Mr. Andrews says.

The federal housing agency says the seasonally adjusted annual rate of housing starts came in at 211,681 units in June, up from 195,453 in May.

""Homebuilding has thus far been resilient through the pandemic,"" said Rishi Sondhi, an economist at TD Economics, in a note to clients. ""This is a much different result from some of the more bearish forecasts out there and represents a stark change from most other industries, which cratered earlier on and are just now beginning their slow recovery process.""

Economists on average had expected an annual pace of 198,000 starts, according to financial markets data firm Refinitiv.

Exceptionally low interest rates and government support programs such as CERB may have helped boost household incomes despite a soft job market, wrote Claire Fan, economist at RBC Economics.

""Against that backdrop it is not so surprising that housing activity has been more resilient than many had been expecting,"" wrote Fan in a client note.

The result came as urban starts of apartments, condos and other types of multiple-unit housing projects rose 13.0 per cent to 154,602 units in June, while urban starts of single-detached homes fell 4.5 per cent to 42,073.

Rural starts were estimated at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 15,006 units.

The six-month moving average of the monthly seasonally adjusted annual rates of housing starts rose to 199,655 in June, up from 197,063 in May.

Sondhi wrote in the TD client note that demand for housing could keep homebuilding activity afloat until 2021, but that in the ""medium term,"" housing starts should ease as population growth slows.

An economist at CIBC Capital markets linked the surge in housing starts to Ontario, which loosened COVID-19 restrictions on construction later than other provinces. Royce Mendes, executive director and senior economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said that it is possible Ontario and Quebec may still be playing catch-up from slowed construction during the first months of social distancing.

""Furthermore, with immigration on hold given travel restrictions, demand for housing isn't growing at the same pace it was prior to the pandemic. As a result, we continue to see scope for a softening in Canada's housing market over the coming months,"" wrote Mendes in a note to clients.

Q&A with Paul MacDonald, CFA Chief Investment officer and portfolio manager, Harvest Portfolios Group Inc.

The healthcare sector rebounded strongly at the end of the year despite a weak start to 2019. That momentum should carry through in 2020, says Paul MacDonald, chief investment officer at Harvest Portfolio Group.

In an interview, Mr. MacDonald talked about the philosophy behind the Harvest Healthcare Leaders Income ETF (TSX: HHL, HHL.U), the long term energizers driving healthcare stocks and why the sector will continue to perform regardless of U.S. election year anxiety.

What do you see for the healthcare sector in 2020 and beyond?

Story continues below advertisement

Over the medium to longer term, the healthcare sector has several themes. The first is aging populations. The second is technological innovation in medical devices, equipment and drugs. The third is rising demand in emerging markets. These are permanent and noncyclical forces, so we want to be positioned there.

In the shorter-term, we see attractive valuations, though U.S. political noise will continue this year. But over the past three or four months there has been a positive shift in the sentiment towards the sector. It has been a noticeable change.

What were the surprises in 2019?

Healthcare was the second worst performing S&P sector behind energy. What drove that? In part the extreme views and rhetoric as the Democratic primaries came into focus early in the year. The talk about socializing the system worried some investors.

You could see that impact when it came to quarterly earnings. The stocks of companies with strong earnings and guidance would struggle to rally. If they missed earnings it was a very painful experience.

But as the year went on there was a shift. Companies were rewarded again for robust earnings. So, when I look at 2020, I think you have an environment where valuations are discounted, sentiment is improving and some of that extreme rhetoric has subsided. Policies are coming much closer to centre. When you put that together, we see an incredible longer-term opportunity.

How should investors approach the sector?

Story continues below advertisement

Our message to advisers is that if you want healthcare and income that’s what our fund is all about. If you want healthcare exposure you want to own a basket.

Medtech has been the shining star for several years and on the flip side, biotech has underperformed. Large cap biotech companies have been under pressure for the past 12 to 18 months. Even for hundred-billion-dollar market capitalization companies, a momentum shift can move share prices by 30 per cent in a very short span.

Medical technology companies have shown a clear growth picture. So, they’ve been afforded much higher multiples. Perhaps this is because they’re perceived to have less exposure to some of the political narrative. That trend could continue.

We want to be in those types of companies as a group. Any individual name, say Johnson & Johnson, a $375-billion company, can move 15 per cent up or down based on whether it’s the news, or there have been disappointing drug trials, political noise or the threat of lawsuits.

So, for us, diversity across the subsectors is key, being exposed to all areas including med techs, pharmaceuticals, biopharmaceuticals and managed care such as insurance.

How much will U.S. politics affect things in 2020?

Story continues below advertisement

We are likely to have rhetoric all year, but does the market look beyond it? It would seem to me that it is starting to do that.

What we saw in early 2019 is actually what I would’ve expected in early 2020. But as you peel back the layers of the system, you realize it is extraordinarily difficult to effect change.

There are numerous vested parties, whether it’s the manufacturers, distributors, whether it’s the insurance companies. There’s always going to be resistance to radical change.

Tell us about the Harvest Healthcare Leaders Income ETF

We have a very simple process to narrow down the universe of 3,000 companies to about 75. We require a minimum market capitalization of $10-billion. They have to be North American listed and have to have options trading so we can take advantage of our covered call strategy. The covered call strategy generates income by foregoing a little bit of the upside.

From the 75 companies we select 20, filtering for things like earnings, return on equity, cash flow metrics and balance sheet metrics. We look at it as a healthcare pie and want to make sure we have exposure to each one of the pieces: medtech, biotech, services, insurance and make sure we are not overexposed to any one area. We want to be diversified.

Story continues below advertisement

As at December 31, 2019, 42 per cent of the ETFs holdings are in pharmaceuticals, 20 per cent in biotechnology, 19 per cent in healthcare equipment and supplies and 16 per cent are healthcare providers.

How has the ETF performed?

The ETF posted a positive return in 2019 in a very volatile market. We’ve continued to generate growth and income. Even though healthcare was the second worst performing subsector behind energy in the S&P 500, we’re still up double digits for the year.

Do you have any final comments?

We are later cycle now. It is definitely the time to be invested in good quality businesses. That should always be the case, but even more so now.

We think that healthcare is an opportunity for those that can look beyond macro noise. It has defensive characteristics; good dividend yields and valuations that are at discounts to the broader market.

With Canadians facing slow growth in the economy at home, mild economic growth globally and continued low interest rates, it will be a challenge for financial advisors and investors alike to eke out decent fixed-income returns in their portfolios, investment experts warns.

In fact, Franklin Templeton Investments Corp.’s 2020 Capital Market Expectations report predicts that fixed-income returns on global government and corporate bonds will lag past rates of return.

That means advisors and investors will have to get creative when it comes to fixed-income investing and consider how to use active and passive investing strategies to make up the difference.

Story continues below advertisement

Darcy Briggs, senior vice-president, portfolio manager with Franklin Bissett Investment Management in Calgary, says the best strategy is to be nimble and cast a wide net for returns.

“Going into 2020, [interest] rates are relatively low, credit spreads are pretty tight and we are in a low-volatility environment,” he says. “This is a very unusual environment, it doesn’t happen very often.”

Dan Hallett, vice-president and principal at Oakville, Ont.-based Highview Financial Group worries that the extended bull market has “blinded investors to the risks they’re taking” when they allocate more of their investments to higher-returning equities and away from fixed-income.

Thus, he suggests investors stick with a traditional portfolio mix of 60 per cent equities and 40 per cent fixed income rather than abandoning the latter, which is risky.

“Generally speaking, investors’ bond allocations should largely stay intact,” Mr. Hallett argues. “Emphasizing high-quality corporate bonds can add a bit of extra yield [and] any reduction of bonds to redirect money to higher-returning assets should be done modestly.”

Yet, Mr. Briggs says his firm is cautious when approaching fixed-income investments in the current environment. Rather than looking for home runs or taking bold positioning, he says Franklin Bissett is “looking to play a little more defence and hit singles.”

That includes using multiple levers to generate returns in the current environment, one of which is investing in selective “fallen angels” – or using extensive credit analysis to buy debt opportunistically in companies that have been downgraded due to a weakened financial position.

Story continues below advertisement

Mr. Briggs provides the example of Cenovus Energy Inc., which lost its investment-grade status for a time in 2016.

“A number of investors can’t hold subinvestment-grade [debt],” he says. “So, we are monitoring these types of securities for potential opportunities”

Mr. Briggs expects similar buying opportunities may arise this year as the trend among public companies of late has been to increase leverage for numerous reasons, one of which was for share repurchases. The current environment has created conditions for overall credit ratings to migrate downward, generally, given company fundamentals at the current stage of the credit cycle.

“There comes a time that if global economic activity doesn’t pick up, some of these companies actually trip, which may create conditions leading to a credit rating downgrade to junk,” he says

The dividing line between “junk” and investment-grade bonds can create the potential of superior returns, he notes. One recent example he cites is supermarket operator Sobeys Inc., which dipped below investment-grade status before improving its operations.

Mr. Briggs also looks beyond Canada’s narrow fixed-income market as 85 per cent of it comprises of government bonds and debt issued by financial service firms.

Story continues below advertisement

He believes that investors have no choice but to embrace an active investment strategy to generate fixed-income returns in a low interest rate environment.

“We can dissect the multiple risks that we see, selecting those with better risk-return potential and move portfolio positioning to capitalize in order to generate excess benchmark returns,” he says. “With a passive strategy, you don’t even get benchmark returns. You get benchmark minus [management expense ratio] returns.”

The risks associated with a passive approach to fixed-income investing “have gone way up,” says Yves Rebetez, an exchange-traded fund (ETF) analyst and chief investment officer at Pascal Financial in Toronto.

That’s in large part because investors are assuming more duration risk as the average term periods of debt held within fixed-income ETFs is lengthening and making investors potentially more vulnerable to interest-rate changes.

Mr. Rebetez sees the appeal for investors to have a fund manager adjusting for credit and duration risk rather than taking a passive approach to fixed-income investing. “The problem is I am not sure I even want to be in that space because of low returns.”

However, lower bond returns are still better than returns generated by holding cash or cash equivalents, Mr. Briggs says.

Story continues below advertisement

While some wary investors have retreated to holding more cash in money market funds or ultra-safe, locked-in investments, such as guaranteed investment certificates (GICs), he worries that strategy is setting them up for disappointment.

“In 2018, cash was the best performing asset, but it was the best performing asset for the first time in 20 years. In 2019, it was the worst performing asset. It lagged fixed income and it really lagged equities,” he says.

As for holding GICs, except for those that are cashable, “you’re locked in with zero liquidity. It is a trade-off for safety but if it allows some investors to sleep better it is understandable,” he adds.

For investors looking for better fixed-income returns and liquidity than those offered by GICs but with more safety than a pure fixed-income fund, a short-duration bond fund, which invests in debt of two to three years, on average, is a good option, Mr. Briggs suggests.

“You are able to get better than cash returns,” he says. “It kind of wedges in between a pure no-risk GIC and a bond fund return. You don’t have a lot of volatility, generally, with a short duration bond fund.”

The Covid-19 pandemic has had at least one positive effect on Richard Myers’s business. Users of Alternawork, his 25,000-square-foot co-working offices in Oakville, Ont., can now safely receive and send packages without signatures or other human interaction.

The pandemic helped with the signature aspect, with many shipping companies and couriers dropping the requirement in order to maintain physical distancing. But “smart lockers” have also been key in allowing them to deliver and securely store packages until office users are ready to pick them up.

Infrared light sensors in the lockers detect when a package is inserted, at which point a notification is sent by text message or e-mail to alert the recipient that there’s mail waiting for them. It works the same in reverse – users can insert packages and let carriers know they’re ready for pickup.

In either case, the recipient scans a QR code or enters a supplied PIN onto a touch screen that then opens their respective locker slot.

These capabilities helped Alternawork, which has a second location in Kelowna, B.C., mitigate the worst months of the pandemic without having to close down, which has been a boon to the enterprise clients who use its offices.

The small company’s experience could be a taste of what’s to come for the larger commercial real estate sector as property managers and developers look to ensure physical distancing in workplaces for the foreseeable future.

“It was perfect because we were able to have package delivery, but touchless,” Mr. Myers says. “That was a big deal for us.”

The smart lockers used by Alternawork are supplied by Snaile, a Mississauga-based company founded in 2015 by serial entrepreneur Patrick Armstrong after Canada Post announced it was planning to end door-to-door delivery and shift to community mailboxes.

The company developed the sensor and notification technology that, when installed inside existing lockers, could save people from making pointless trips to their mailboxes.

But Mr. Armstrong was left without an obvious market after the Liberal government scrapped the conversion plan. He was then approached by private equity real estate investment firm KingSett Capital about developing a full product – the sensor and notification technology, plus the mailboxes themselves.

Story continues below advertisement

Snaile has since grown to 14 full-time employees, with smart locker installations in 23 Canadian cities. Property company partners include Oxford and Cadillac Fairview.

Most installations are residential – multifamily apartment buildings and condos – but the company also has a handful of corporate clients, including Alternawork and Ontario Power Generation, which uses Snaile lockers at its downtown Toronto offices on University Avenue.

Mr. Armstrong says he is in talks with a number of commercial property developers, who are now assessing the role that smart lockers can play in a postpandemic world.

Many office tower managers, for example, are looking for ways to decrease the amount of foot traffic in their buildings. Installing smart lockers in lobbies could be one way to do that.

“Everyone is wondering what we are going to do when we go back to work. It’s a fresh problem, it’s going to be a big problem,” he says. “They are trying to limit [mail] carriers running around in the elevators.”

Snaile lockers are accessible by a number of major carriers, including FedEx, Purolator, DHL and Intelcom, one of Amazon’s largest package delivery services in Canada. A notable holdout, however, is Canada Post, with whom Mr. Armstrong is trying to work out a deal.

Story continues below advertisement

Canada Post has increased the number of mechanical lockers in residential buildings across the country to more than 11,000, from 9,300 at the end of 2019. Though the lockers don’t have sensors or internet connectivity, package recipients still get email or Canada Post app notifications when a delivery is made.

A spokesperson would not comment on negotiations with Snaile but said the Crown corporation recently underwent a request for proposal process for future parcel locker offerings and is not yet in a position to release details.

Snaile is facing competition in the corporate field, potentially from Canada Post, but also from the likes of Pitney Bowes, which is marketing similar Intelligent Lockers to property managers and developers.

Industry observers say demand for smart lockers in commercial properties was low before the pandemic, but the new reality may indeed change that. Finding space for them in existing buildings could prove problematic, but they are likely to be no-brainers in future developments.

“Keeping couriers out of the building may increasingly become the norm,” says Oliver Tighe, executive managing director of Colliers valuation and advisory services group for the Greater Toronto Area. “For new buildings, it has become a standard feature rather than a unique feature.”

April Franco, associate professor of economics and strategy at the University of Toronto Scarborough, expects there will be a race to install smart lockers among property developers and the companies that supply them.

With limited space, few building managers will want to install more than they have to, similar to utility lines, which means the competition will be fierce. Locker providers that provide ubiquitous interoperability with carriers are likely to have the advantage.

“This is one of those things that people say, ‘Of course, why didn’t we think of this before?’ The pandemic is acting as a coordinating device,” she says. “The fixed costs are big and we don’t want to have three or four sets of [lockers] out there.”",916,0.9711522031124394,business

SUPPLIED

Financial advisors and investors will likely have to take on more risk in their investment portfolios in the coming decade if they want to achieve the rates of return they have been accustomed to over the past 20 years.

That’s because the annual returns in a range of asset classes that are core to Canadian portfolios – including Canadian equities, government and investment-grade bonds – are projected to be lower over the next seven to 10 years, according to money managers at Franklin Templeton Investments Corp. They presented some of the key insights from the firm’s Capital Market Expectations report at its 2020 Global Investment Outlook event in Toronto last month.

To produce the report, the firm examined the expected rates of returns of more than 50 asset classes by looking closely at a variety of factors, from historical risk premia, economic growth and inflation prospects to debt levels, populism and how policy-makers are expected to respond to the next economic downturn.

Notably, Franklin Templeton predicts that Canadian government and investment-grade corporate bonds will lag past rates of return dramatically. That means advisors and investors will likely have to adopt a more aggressive asset mix to meet their goals, said William Yun, the firm’s executive vice-president of multi-asset solutions in New York, at the event.

“If you are looking just at your typical 60-40 equities-fixed income portfolio, you may not be able to achieve your required rates of return,” he warned, noting that such an asset mix would only produce returns of slightly more than 4 per cent.

Thus, he recommended that advisors and investors adopt a “multi-faceted approach” to achieve better returns.

“There are different asset classes, different ways to achieve a return for clients that meet their risk objectives rather than just staying with Canadian equities and Canadian fixed-income,” Mr. Yun said.

That means adding more U.S., international and emerging-markets equities and corporate bonds, and even more alternative assets, such as hedge funds, to the mix.

He notes that the asset mix “depends on each investor, their risk tolerance and time horizon. But, in general, in this low inflationary environment … you may have to consider alternative asset classes.”

As such, advisors and investors might consider other non-traditional assets, such as real estate, to produce superior returns.

Franklin Templeton’s outlook predicts that “the global economic environment will be supportive of risk assets” over the next seven years, which should help those advisors and investors who adopt a more diversified and multi-asset portfolio.

Overall, the firm predicts moderate global growth with low inflation, but more near-term volatility.

The firm remains positive on emerging markets, noting that growth potential should lead to outperformance over developed-market equities and bonds.

In developed markets, Franklin Templeton expects that equities have greater performance potential than bonds.

Specifically, the firm is overweight on U.S. equities, based on the ability of the U.S. central bank to cut interest rates further if required and a resurgent U.S. consumer, who is enjoying higher wages and employment, and a rising net worth.

Mr. Yun noted that U.S. retail sales are “very strong and if you have even a mildly confident consumer that is spending in the U.S. – where consumption is about two-thirds of the economy – that is another positive sign in terms of its economic outlook.”

As for north of the border, Franklin Templeton money managers recommend investors underweight Canadian equities in the coming year, and they hold a neutral approach to Canadian government and investment-grade bonds.

“We have a fairly cautious view on the Canadian economy given some of the cyclical and structural challenges,” said Ian Riach, Toronto-based senior vice-president and portfolio manager, Franklin Templeton multi-asset solutions, at the event.

He pointed to rising manufacturing inventories and declining capital investments and corporate profits, plus a heavily indebted Canadian consumer, who may be running out of borrowing capacity.

It’s estimated that Canadians currently owe $1.75 for every dollar in income that they generate, almost double the 90 cents owed per dollar earned in 1990. By comparison, U.S. consumers have cut their debt since the recession of a decade ago and are in better shape financially.

“With consumer debt at high levels and maybe the negative implications that it can have for banks, and challenges within the resource sectors, the Canadian economy is vulnerable,” Mr. Riach said.

That includes not just the energy industry, but also the mining and forestry industries, which face challenges because of trade disputes and a global slowdown.

Story continues below advertisement

He noted that corporate fundamentals in the form of profit margins and earnings per share are “not dire but are weakening,” while there are policy hurdles to foreign investment in the form of perceived high business tax rates and excessive bureaucracy in Canada.

Canadian equities are priced “fairly attractively” compared with those in the U.S. and their long-term averages, but Mr. Riach is not recommending a buying spree, noting that markets can stay undervalued for long periods.

“Despite valuations being very attractive, we think Canadian equities are vulnerable to further disappointment,” he said.

Franklin Templeton’s analysts are also downplaying the possibility of a recession this year, putting the odds at just 20 per cent, stating that it would take an extraordinary shock to the economic system to cause a downturn.

Think you’re smarter than average? Whilst this is mathematically true for only around half the population, we think most people would likely answer ‘yes.’ Regardless of whether you happen to be smarter than average, this sort of statistical impossibility is one example of people generally overestimating their abilities and skills—also known as overconfidence. Confidence can be a good thing but, in investing, overconfidence can lead to critical errors that may seriously hurt your chances at a comfortable retirement. Here we’ll explore where this bias comes from, some of the other cognitive errors that often accompany it, and why it can be one of the biggest factors standing between investors and their goals.

The Origins of Overconfidence

Overconfidence likely stems from behaviours that provided humans an advantage in the past. In hunter-gatherer societies, overconfidence may have been an evolutionary necessity—when the average work day involves chasing down an animal five times your size for dinner, it’s hard to be too confident. But modern life and investing are very different, and giving in to overconfidence these days can warp our investing habits for the worse.

Story continues below advertisement

Unfortunately, many other human tendencies contribute to overconfidence, making it a potentially powerful bias that’s difficult to overcome. For instance, we may naturally accumulate pride about our skills and accomplishments. In investing, pride accumulation occurs when investors attribute investing successes to what they believe are their skills, potentially ignoring the true underlying reasons (or even luck) that may have been involved. On the other side of that coin is regret shunning, which occurs when investors attribute their investing failures to outside forces instead of acknowledging personal mistakes and limitations.

Confirmation bias is another natural inclination that can feed into overconfidence and further wreak havoc on our decisions. Confirmation bias leads us to only pay attention to evidence that supports our pre-existing beliefs. We can see this in many aspects of life. Unless you love to argue, you probably spend more time with people who generally share your beliefs than with people who contradict your ideas at every opportunity. Similarly, most of us tune in to news sources that generally express our political beliefs. When investing, if you limit yourself to information that validates your existing beliefs, you’re essentially creating blind spots in your strategy. Markets are complex and dynamic. If you narrow your focus too much, you’re increasing the likelihood you miss something important that may impact your investments.

Another common error, hindsight bias, is also closely tied to pride accumulation and regret shunning. Hindsight bias is the feeling of ‘I knew it all along!’—even if that wasn’t the case. We have a tendency to remember the more prescient thoughts we had in advance of an eventual event and disregard the conflicting thoughts we had at the same time. For example, leading up to the 2008 global financial crisis, do you remember feeling a financial downturn was imminent? Were you concerned about the real estate market in the United States and subprime mortgages, and expected those concerns would impact equity markets? Now, if you did have these concerns, did you act on them? We’ve encountered many investors who say the downturn was obvious at the time, but still participated in the declines—classic hindsight bias. Inaccurately remembering past judgments like this can lead us to overestimate our future ability.

The Consequences of Overconfidence

Overconfidence—in conjunction with confirmation bias, hindsight bias and other cognitive errors—can lead to many poor investing choices that can significantly impact your financial future. Overconfident investors may overestimate their investment-picking ability, which can lead to making big bets and taking big risks.

For instance, have you ever bought into a ‘hot’ initial public offering or a potentially risky security because you remember past securities you ‘knew’ would do well before they surged? Was your choice based on careful, thorough, impartial analysis? Because hindsight could be a factor, and if that leads you to make a big, risky investment, you could be taking on more risk than you should due to bias.

Owning too few equities is another potentially damaging strategy to which overconfident investors may fall victim. If you own just a handful of individual equities in your portfolio, you’re likely making large, risky bets. Investing in equities always carries the risk of loss—no matter your confidence level. However, you can lower your individual security risk by diversifying your portfolio with at least a few dozen equities from various industries and geographies. An extreme case of this error occurs when investors hold their own employer’s shares as a large portion of their investment portfolio. You may think you work for a great company, but virtually no one but the most senior executives truly knows the direction of the company, and sometimes even they don’t know an equity-tanking scandal is about to unfold.

Consider the case of Enron employees in the 2000s—those who invested in Enron’s shares in their retirement plans not only lost their jobs when the company folded, but also lost their retirement savings. Workers for Parmalat in Italy or Swissair in Switzerland may have encountered similar situations if they decided to hold large investments in their company’s shares prior to the company’s equity losing its value.

Avoiding Overconfidence

How can you avoid making these mistakes? Given all the various ways investors can fall prey to overconfidence, it may seem overwhelming. But you can take several steps to help stay humble and prudent when investing.

To begin, flip your natural tendencies on their heads by shunning pride and accumulating regret. You can always be wrong in your investing choices—even the most legendary investors don’t get it right all of the time. In fact, if you were right just 70% of the time over the long term, you would likely be an investing legend. Look for opportunities to recognise your mistakes and take responsibility for them. Revel in them a while. Learn from them. And remember, not all of your past investing successes can be attributed to your own skill—luck is often a factor. For proof, consider keeping a journal of your investing thoughts and comparing how often they actually aligned with market performance. Revisit it often—how frequently were your thoughts or predictions actually aligned with real market movement? If you made a market decision, check to see if it made you worse or better off. Even if you did well, did you actually outperform relative to other similar investments? If you are able to learn from the times you were mistaken, you may have a better chance of avoiding similar mistakes in the future.

You can also consider using a trusted financial adviser or coach to help you stay on the path towards your goals. Avoiding common investing mistakes can be difficult, especially when working on your own. An adviser may be able to help provide an impartial perspective and investing expertise. Finally, study markets as much as possible. But be wary as you gather your information and don’t forget the impact of confirmation bias. Do your best to seek out multiple sources of information, including those that may present opposing beliefs or viewpoints from your own.

Although you can never be fully rid of biases, you can be more aware of them and know how to minimise their impacts on your investing decisions. Whilst behavioural biases apply to many aspects of life, making financial mistakes because of them can have far-reaching consequences. They may actually hinder your ability to retire or live the comfortable retirement you’ve been working towards. So don’t forget to check your biases at the door when you start investing—and continue to re-evaluate them every day.

ARIES (March 21 - April 20):

Don't work your fingers to the bone this week, especially if most of your work is done for other people. A magnificent Sun-Mars link will energize you like never before, but it's still possible to overdo it, so be sensible about the tasks you agree to take on.

TAURUS (April 21 - May 21):

Partners and loved ones must be allowed to do things their way this week, even if you are 100 per cent convinced it's the wrong way. As always, people learn quicker if they learn from their own mistakes, so stand back and let them get on with it.

GEMINI (May 22 - June 21):

Your social life may have been in a bit of a lull of late but it will pick up again as from today. Friends are always fun but now they will be absolutely fabulous, so don't sit at home watching TV — get out there and have a good time.

CANCER (June 22 - July 23):

This week's Sun-Mars link could make you a touch aggressive, so be careful what you say and who you say it to. If you go to extremes it's as good as guaranteed that someone even more extreme will come back at you, which may not be pleasant.

LEO (July 24 - Aug. 23):

The makings of success are right in front of you now but it's up to you to do something with them. Put on your best clothes and your most smiley face and greet the world with warmth, wit and wisdom. There are no limits Leo, at least not for you.

VIRGO (Aug. 24 - Sept. 23):

You may feel compelled to step in and speak up for someone you think is being given a hard time for no good reason, but do you really know the whole story? It could be that on this one occasion they deserve to be chewed out a bit!

LIBRA (Sept. 24 - Oct. 23):

SCORPIO (Oct. 24 - Nov. 22):

SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 23 - Dec. 21):

This is one of the best times of the year for you and you must seize the opportunities that are coming your way. Sometimes Sag you can be too laid-back for your own good, so make an effort to get up and get at 'em. It won't be too hard.

CAPRICORN (Dec. 22 - Jan. 20):

Act tough today. Give those you deal with, both at work and on the street, the clear impression that if they give you a hard time they will get it back tenfold. You can be quite intimidating at times, and that fact will work in your favour.

TAURUS (April 21 - May 21):

It’s not easy being patient with people who seem to stretch everything out twice as long as it needs to go, but stay calm and don’t lose your temper. You may find, once they finally get to the point, they’ve got something to say that’s worth listening to.

GEMINI (May 22 - June 21):

Push yourself a little bit harder than usual today, because the planets indicate that extra effort will pay off big time. That applies not only to your work but also to affairs of the heart. Take time to let the one you love know how much you really care.

CANCER (June 22 - July 23):

In one way you will gain financially today, but in another way you will lose more than you expected. On balance you should come out at least even, so don’t let any losses get you down – almost certainly they are no more than temporary.

LEO (July 24 - Aug. 23):

You may not want to get involved with someone who is clearly being provocative for the fun of it, but if you don’t clamp down on their stupidity now you could be subjected to it even more later on. You’ve got better things to do with your time.

VIRGO (Aug. 24 - Sept. 23):

This should be an enjoyable day for you but it might be spoiled if you allow someone’s negative attitude to get you down. Whatever they say, and no matter how logical it may sound, resolve to ignore it. Be positive at all times and in all situations.

LIBRA (Sept. 24 - Oct. 23):

Do you take what a friend or work colleague tells you seriously? You should know from past experience that this particular individual is not to be trusted – not necessarily because they are dishonest, but because they are so easily fooled themselves.

SCORPIO (Oct. 24 - Nov. 22):

You may have total and utter faith in your own abilities but the planets warn there is a danger you could overreach yourself and end up having to backtrack at the very last moment. Try looking ahead a bit rather than rushing in where angels fear to tread.

SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 23 - Dec. 21):

You have never been one to watch what you say and it’s inevitable today that some of your opinions will upset those of a delicate disposition. That’s too bad. There is no reason at all why you should tone down your act to protect others’ sensitive natures.

CAPRICORN (Dec. 22 - Jan. 20):

If you must spend money over the next 24 hours either make it other people’s money or make sure you can get a refund later on. Jupiter in your sign is making you a bit extravagant at the moment, so keep your cash in your pocket if you can.

AQUARIUS (Jan. 21 - Feb. 19):

You will call it as you see it today and won’t care in the slightest if your honesty upsets people. It seems to be part of your role in life to say things that less radical types believe should be left unspoken. Say them often and say them loud.

PISCES (Feb. 20 - Mar. 20):

By all means enjoy the good things in life, and don’t feel bad if not everyone around you is able to share in your delight. Just because you are sensitive by nature does not mean you have to take the cares of the world on your shoulders.

Make sure you are in control today. Make sure everything, at home and at work, is done the way you want it to be done. Not everyone will be happy about it, of course, but what can they do? When you are this dynamic there’s just no stopping you.

TAURUS (April 21 - May 21):

Over the past few months you will have noticed that even when there was disruption in your life it seemed to work out well in the end. It may not be so easy to see the light behind the dark now – but it’s still there, so don’t stop looking.

GEMINI (May 22 - June 21):

Make it your business to encourage a friend or family member today, especially if they seem to be losing heart over a project they once had high hopes for. A little bit of praise could make all the difference, and get them fired with enthusiasm again.

CANCER (June 22 - July 23):

You just cannot sit still at the moment – there is so much that needs to be done and there never seems to be enough time. What happens over the next few days should convince you that running about here, there and everywhere is not the answer.

LEO (July 24 - Aug. 23):

Whatever you choose to do today you will tackle it with passion and power, and that’s great. But you also need to make sure that what you do has a purpose, one that benefits not just you personally but those you interact with on a daily basis.

VIRGO (Aug. 24 - Sept. 23):

Today’s Mars-Pluto link is sure to bring your hidden anger to the surface, and it may not be a pretty sight! No doubt you are entitled to be annoyed with people who have let you down, but will shouting at them solve anything? It rarely does.

LIBRA (Sept. 24 - Oct. 23):

Don’t be afraid to discuss your dreams and desires with someone you trust. You may be worried that they will pour scorn on what you want to do with your life, but it’s far more likely they will encourage and assist you, and that’s what you need.

SCORPIO (Oct. 24 - Nov. 22):

Pluto, your ruler, links with Mars, planet of anger, today and it’s likely that whatever resentment you feel against certain people will come to the surface. It may be right to get annoyed with them but don’t get so annoyed that you endanger your own reputation.

SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 23 - Dec. 21):

You may believe that the best way to get what you want is to take it, but give that some thought before you act on it. Even if you are successful in the short term you could set up counter forces that cause all sorts of problems later on.

CAPRICORN (Dec. 22 - Jan. 20):

You cannot always get your own way, no matter how much power you have, and that is a lesson you will need to learn over the next few days. Today’s Mars-Pluto link warns you are by no means the only one with desires that demand to be met.

AQUARIUS (Jan. 21 - Feb. 19):

You need to take a money matter a lot more seriously than you have been taking it in recent weeks. The planets indicate that some sort of crisis is about to occur and if you treat it as a joke the joke will most likely be on you.

PISCES (Feb. 20 - Mar. 20):

Yes, of course, there is nothing you cannot do in life, but some things are going to be easier than others. Be smart and focus on those aims that don’t require you to prove yourself by putting everything on the line. Life doesn’t have to be hard.

TAURUS (April 21 - May 21):

Don't waste your precious time on people who you either don't feel comfortable with or who seem to operate on a level you cannot relate to. You are under no obligation to hang around with them, so pick your moment and leave them behind.

GEMINI (May 22 - June 21):

Your ruling planet Mercury joins forces with both the Sun and Mars today, which among other things will give you a clearer idea of what changes need to be made. Once you see the logic of sweeping away the past the idea will no longer terrify you.

CANCER (June 22 - July 23):

No matter how eager you are to press ahead with a new project you must give it more thought. Cosmic activity in the money area of your chart warns the cost of doing business may be higher than expected. It's still worth it but watch the pennies.

LEO (July 24 - Aug. 23):

Something you have been worrying about for ages will soon be no more than a distant memory, so cheer up and approach what you have to do today with a glad heart. Life is getting better by the minute and soon you won't want the days to end.

VIRGO (Aug. 24 - Sept. 23):

Something that has taken up more of your time and energy than it is worth needs to be ended - now! With both the Sun and Mercury moving into your sign over the coming week you must clear the decks for action — of which there will be plenty.

LIBRA (Sept. 24 - Oct. 23):

How you deal with people is always important but over the next few days you will get opportunities to make the kind of friendships that last a lifetime. Remind yourself constantly that it's not about what you achieve but how much you love and laugh.

SCORPIO (Oct. 24 - Nov. 22):

Listen carefully to what people who are more knowledgeable than you have to tell you today. Scorpios rarely take advice - you quite rightly trust your own inner voice - but on this occasion what you learn could save a lot of unnecessary work.

SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 23 - Dec. 21):

You must be honest with yourself this week. There is no point pretending that something is working out well when clearly it's not. Make use of the Sun's last few days in one of the more dynamic areas of your chart to begin some much-needed changes.

CAPRICORN (Dec. 22 - Jan. 20):

Your powers of persuasion will be hard to resist today, but make sure you use them for positive reasons. If you try to sweet-talk people into giving you what you desire the universe will find ways to deny you. Be open and honest about your needs.

AQUARIUS (Jan. 21 - Feb. 19):

Cosmic activity in your opposite sign has brought a lot of surprises of late, and no small amount of joy as well. Keep those feeling of warmth and wellbeing going as long as you can. Events matter, but how you choose to react to them matters more.

PISCES (Feb. 20 - Mar. 20):

You never like making unpopular decisions but you have no choice now. Someone you love has had plenty of chances to sort themselves out but still they are making the same old mistakes. Step in and get it sorted for them — which is what they want anyway.

TAURUS (April 21 - May 21):

It's not like you to get emotional but something has forced your feelings to the surface and over the next few days no one will be left in any doubt what they are. Try to be positive in all situations and always keep a smile on your face.

GEMINI (May 22 - June 21):

If you are in a position where you can break away from your usual environment for a while then don't hesitate, just go for it. If you have to stay right where you are though there's still plenty you can do to make life more exciting. Use your imagination.

CANCER (June 22 - July 23):

Now is the time to get serious about a money matter you have been deliberately avoiding in recent weeks. The upcoming new moon will bring with it the solution you require and it won't be long before you wonder what all the fuss was about.

LEO (July 24 - Aug. 23):

This is the ideal time to clear out some of the junk in your life. In fact, the more you manage to get rid of now the more room you will create for the universe to bring in something better in the near future. Be ruthless with yourself.

VIRGO (Aug. 24 - Sept. 23):

It would appear that you are involved in a situation you don't know much about and now you feel out of your depth. Like it or not you will have to put your hand up today and ask for assistance from those in a position to rescue you.

LIBRA (Sept. 24 - Oct. 23):

What can you do to make life more enjoyable for the people around you? Friendships are under excellent stars at the moment and the more you do for others now the more will be done for you later on — although that's not your motivation, of course.

SCORPIO (Oct. 24 - Nov. 22):

If you want something enough you will find a way to get it, especially on the career front as you are determined to prove yourself and move up in the world. Just remember there is often a price to be paid for success. Make sure you can afford it.

SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 23 - Dec. 21):

The approaching new moon will open your eyes to new possibilities and the more you are willing to believe that great things are possible the more the universe will send opportunities your way. Don't be too rigid in your thinking. An open mind is a winning mind.

CAPRICORN (Dec. 22 - Jan. 20):

There is no point feeling guilty about things you said or did in the past. It may be natural to experience some remorse but don't overdo it. Everyone makes mistakes — yes, even a Capricorn — but not everyone learns from them. Make sure you do.

AQUARIUS (Jan. 21 - Feb. 19):

Cosmic activity in the relationship area of your chart makes this the perfect time to reach out to the people you love and remind them how much they mean to you. Don't just assume they know they have a place in your heart — prove it to them.

Layton Reid was a globe-trotting photographer—then came a melanoma diagnosis. He returned home to Halifax to work as a wedding photographer. After remission, he got married and had a son. But, the melanoma returned and it was now at Stage IV. This Is Not the End of Me is Dakshana Bascaramurty’s tale of her friend’s three-year journey as he tried desperately to stay alive for his young son, Finn, and then found purpose in preparing Finn for a world without him.

As her return to work and Finn’s transition to daycare loomed, it was difficult for Candace to come to terms with the fact that Finn was no longer a baby, no longer an appendage whose survival was dependent on her. And that, more than anything, made her long for another baby. But Layton had now made it clear that wasn’t going to happen. This wasn’t something she could wear him down on like she had with so many things before. What bothered her was that Layton couldn’t cut her any slack, couldn’t bring himself to see her perspective, or even sympathize with what was a natural hormonal, emotional response to this point of transition. Why did he see her motivations as selfish?

Candace brought up the possibility of marriage counselling, but with so much on both their plates, it seemed like an inaccessible luxury—to even find the time to go to an appointment or coordinate a house call with a therapist was out of reach. The solution was what it had been since Layton began Gerson: Candace gave in and told her husband that their marriage was more important than having another child. As soon as she let it go, she could feel things thaw between them.

Finn had now gotten used to life without his dad, who had been relegated to a sort of supporting character in his world. At Finn’s daycare, there was a corner where they posted pictures of the children’s parents and siblings, and if a child ever felt particularly homesick or upset, one of the staff would walk him or her up to the wall to stare at their family snapshot. The idea of that was so heartbreaking to Layton: that these children might be traumatized by being separated from their families for only a few hours. What would happen if it wasn’t only one day? What if it was forever? Surely a photo on the wall wouldn’t cut it.

The sadder thought: would Finn even take comfort from seeing his father’s photo on the wall? Now Layton, in recovery from lung surgery, could see Finn for only about an hour a day after Candace brought him home from daycare. Before, when she carried Finn through the door, he’d screech in excitement at seeing his daddy again, but now he was more subdued. Layton couldn’t hold him or play with him or do much more than watch him while they were in the same room together. He’d become a stranger to his son. Still, it was thrilling to see Finn’s independent personality developing. He had his own language he spoke now, a highly articulate baby babble, and he’d mimic his parents and dance and give high fives to anyone who asked for one. This was the motivation to get better that outweighed all the rest. Layton believed that Finn needed him to some small degree, but he needed Finn more.





In a house with a loud, obnoxious dog, a wild toddler, and the frequent presence of two extroverted women, Callie the cat was in many ways the member of the household most like Layton. And so when she died in the new year, Layton took it harder than Candace did. He and Callie could be in each other’s company, silent, not needy, but a mutually comforting presence. In Ottawa, in those difficult months following Layton’s first diagnosis, Callie would sit on his chest: a warm, furry mound lightly breathing as he watched TV or worked on his laptop. She always found a way to lighten the mood. But as new members moved into the household, the attention she received steadily decreased.

Their veterinarian thought Callie had leukemia and had advised they put her down. At the appointment, Layton found it chilling to see a warm body inhaling oxygen and exhaling carbon dioxide suddenly go cold and still.

When Layton returned home, it was as if Finn knew his father had experienced loss: he reached out to him more to play, to snuggle. Even though Layton knew intellectually that his son was too young to understand death or mourning, he took comfort in explaining this extra affection this way. It was a wonder that this child, who so recently had been a clump of cells, was now showing early signs of empathy. Layton’s favourite framed photo in the house was the one of Finn on the day he was born: freshly pulled out of Candace, a wrinkled mass, eyes wide and adjusting to the light and, more broadly, to the world outside his mother’s body.





In April, Layton went in for a CT scan and he was feeling optimistic. If things came back clear, he’d wind down Gerson and return to something of a normal life again. He’d been figuring out how to re-enter the photography scene—a full-day wedding would be too much for him to dive right into, but maybe he could set up some kind of portrait business, an interesting way of capturing all the guests who attended a wedding.

On the day of the appointment, Candace and Layton took a bottle of champagne with them. Layton had previously joked with his parents, “If it’s clean, I’m gonna pop it open. If it’s not, I’m going to get on the bridge and jump.”

The scan was clean. No cancer. Layton and Candace walked out of the office beaming, playfully shoving each other and saying, “You were scared!” “No, YOU were scared!”

They strolled down the bridge, the one Layton now didn’t have to jump off, popped the cork on the champagne, and both glugged some down. Layton was aware that he’d feel terrible the next day, but wouldn’t it be nice to feel terrible from a good, old-fashioned hangover than from cancer for a change?

They headed to Willie and Phil’s. Layton raced up the stairs to the den, the same place where he’d told his parents about the stomach and lung tumours two years earlier, and shared the news with them.

“That’s great, that’s great,” Willie said, smiling, and then she and Phil started talking about other things. Layton’s face fell.

“Well, fuck, this is the best news!” he said, annoyed that they weren’t understanding the significance of what he’d told them.

Willie reminded him gently that he’d always asked that they not get too high on the highs or too low on the lows. Willie knew she couldn’t be too happy about this because things could change at any moment.

Layton had asked the surgeon for a digital copy of his CT scan and received a stark greyscale image of his abdomen: his lungs asymmetrical black masses; his stomach a little blob nestled into his liver; his ribs a string of small rounds, like slices of calamari. Everything looked a little skewed and to the wrong scale, but what was important was that there were no tumours—what had been cut out with surgical instruments had stayed out. He thought about blowing up the scan at Kinko’s, sticking it in a big frame and mounting it in the bathroom or living room—visitors might take it to be a macabre art piece, but to him it would be a source of inspiration. Maybe seeing that scan would help his parents understand how huge this news was.

But Willie and Phil had been right to hold back from celebrating with their son. A week later, Layton, Candace, and Finn were playing in the yard when the colour suddenly drained from Layton’s face. He told Candace he was tired and needed to sit down, and she followed him inside. As he stood in the kitchen, he suddenly looked up to the ceiling, his neck tracing a circular path as though there was a bird or wasp flying overhead. Then his legs buckled under him and his whole towering frame fell to the kitchen floor and he began convulsing.

You need to put yourself about over the coming year. You need to show your face in places where important people gather. Half the battle in life is just turning up, and if you are always around when others need you the rewards could be substantial.

ARIES (March 21 - April 20):

There is never a wrong time to be an Aries and as things stand it’s a great time right now. The sun in Leo means you have the energy and ambition to go all the way, so don’t listen to those who tell you to tone down your act.

TAURUS (April 21 - May 21):

Not everything will go your way today and over the weekend but most things will, so resolve to ignore the small stuff and focus only on the bigger picture. Where relationships are concerned though, be warned: a secret infatuation won’t stay secret for long.

CANCER (June 22 - July 23):

You may come into money over the next few days, but don’t be tempted to rush out and spend it all in one go. Cosmic activity in the main financial area of your chart warns you need to control the more impulsive side of your nature.

LEO (July 24 - Aug. 23):

Cosmic activity in and around your birth sign makes you super ambitious, which is great, but other aspects warn you need to take care when dealing with people in positions of power. Why? Because their interests may be seriously at odds with your own.

VIRGO (Aug. 24 - Sept. 23):

Try not to be too trusting over the next 24 hours, because if others get the idea that you will agree to anything they will most likely ask you for everything. It’s not wrong to put your own interests first – in fact right now it’s essential.

LIBRA (Sept. 24 - Oct. 23):

SCORPIO (Oct. 24 - Nov. 22):

There could be things happening in your job or career that you probably don’t much enjoy, but over the longer-term the changes now taking place will benefit you in numerous ways. Trust that the universe knows what you need – and quit worrying!

SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 23 - Dec. 21):

Instead of trying to improve your circumstances every which way, try enjoying things the way they already are. Your success and happiness depend more on the mental attitude you choose to adopt than on how ambitious you are or how much money you make.

AQUARIUS (Jan. 21 - Feb. 19):

Make a serious effort to see the situation you are in from someone else’s point of view. It won’t be easy for someone whose opinions are as inflexible as yours, but if you can do it then it could open up a whole new world of creative possibilities.

PISCES (Feb. 20 - Mar. 20):

A confrontation of some sort is likely today, one that has been brewing for quite a while. If you are smart you will make an effort to meet others halfway (but no further than that) so a solution can be hammered out that everyone gains from.

We had some rules about getting a dog: female, 40 pounds, short-haired, and most importantly, not anxious.

“You’re enough,” my partner said, not unkindly, but because there isn’t room in our tiny Vancouver apartment for more anxiety.

Story continues below advertisement

We failed on all counts and ended up with Shermy, a two-year-old male dog. Sixty-two pounds of constant shedding, thanks to his golden retriever/lab/shepherd/collie mix undercoat. The places I find fur mystify me.

There are things people don’t tell you about getting a rescue dog, like your dog may be afraid of garbage cans. Baby strollers. Bike helmets. Umbrellas. Cameras with telephoto lenses. The hiss of a bus lowering. Sneezing. The ironing board. The iron.

No one tells you about doggie Prozac, or that their dog is on it and yours might need to be too.

Instead, we’re bombarded with moving stories about rescue dogs whose personalities blossomed once they found good homes. We consume sob-inducing videos about dogs who understand their good fortune and become the goodest doggos ever seen after they’re adopted. We see dogs who were afraid to be touched become cuddle-obsessed babies.

I devoured those stories before adopting Shermy. Change a dog’s life, and by doing so, change your own. I bought the narrative because that’s what friends and acquaintances, not just the Internet, told me.

No one mentions the dogs that never reach normal ‒ until you get your own problem furry friend. Then, the stories you hear from fellow dog-owners. Dogs on three or four anxiety meds; dogs who hate their owners’ partners; dogs who ate the entire couch; dogs that run a half-marathon and still have energy to jump on horrified strangers.

Of course, no one tells you your dog may be reactive or have fear aggression and anxiety brought on by improper socialization, and they may never get over it. Our dog trainer looked at us sympathetically as she broke that news to us.

We weren’t surprised, exactly. Most of Shermy’s actions were recognizable. Dog anxiety doesn’t necessarily manifest that differently from human anxiety, but I can articulate my symptoms before my behaviour gets out of control. I know what the racing heart, trouble breathing, catastrophic thoughts on repeat, panic attacks and tingling fingers mean, and can usually identify what’s causing them.

Canines don’t have that luxury. The only way Shermy lets me know how he’s feeling is through his actions, which are immediate and tend to fall into the less-than-acceptable categories of snarling, yelping and furiously lunging with his hackles up. I see people’s judgment sometimes: I’m the bad dog-owner with the bad dog.

Shermy’s anxiety is noticeable. He lashes out at strangers, startles at noises (and sometimes at nothing), and melts down at the slightest change in routine. Predictability is useful in anxiety management, but often impossible. There’s only so much I can do ‒ for him and for myself. I’ve snapped at strangers as well, because anxiety overrode my ability to behave in a socially responsible way.

Shermy can be embarrassing at the park because he’ll bark incessantly at the dog he wants to play with. No one wants to play with the barking dog. He’s more likely to drive a furry friend (and their human) away by doing the wrong thing. He’s a master of avoidance, and will pull me as hard as he can away from something that makes him uncomfortable. When I’m anxious, I avoid people and places too ‒ even people and places I usually like.

Anxiety dulls people’s abilities to react appropriately or make rational decisions. Trauma, real or imagined, is magnified by this frantic thundering in your chest that doesn’t belong, but has made room for itself anyway. Threats seem to come from every direction and every task feels insurmountable. When Shermy can’t cope, he can’t react in a calm way. Everything becomes a disaster. Life is unmanageable. I get it.

Humans don’t always pay attention to how anxious feelings make us act. We fixate on how we feel, not on what we’re doing in response to the feelings. My own behaviour patterns are clearer to me after watching Shermy’s reactions.

I would like to be able to tell you that having an anxious dog has made it easier to treat myself with compassion and empathy. That I’ve softened toward myself when I’m feeling anxious for “no reason,” instead of being annoyed with my stuttering progress toward less anxiety. It would be a nice story ‒ a tidy ending. It would better fit with the narrative we see on Instagram and YouTube about dogs who thrive in their new lives and the people who experience new levels of happiness because of their pets. These are lovely, heartwarming stories, and we need simple joys right now.

But that’s not what’s happened. Sometimes, Shermy’s car-whimpering, leash-pulling, startling, midnight-barking, pacing and aggression toward people half a block away cause me more anxiety. His unpredictability upsets my own need to avoid surprises.

The thing about Shermy is that he is a good dog. He puts his own toys away. (Only sometimes. He’s a dog.) He hasn’t devoured any designer shoes. He snuggles like a champ and plays adorably with toys. He zooms around with other dogs, who don’t bother him the way unfamiliar humans do. When we sleep in and he needs to pee, he slides his head under my neck to wake me up. We stick our hands in his mouth to clean his teeth and he lets us clip his toenails without flinching. He doesn’t hump strangers, roll in mud, chase cars or beg for food. He sits contently by my desk for hours while I write and has no idea that I’m sharing his embarrassing secrets with everyone. If anyone but him is being hugged, he trots over to join in. He’s a decent listener ‒ if there are no squirrels around.

Shermy’s main issue is he believes that every little thing in the world, from empty garbage cans to hats left behind on boxwoods, to skateboarders and the husky down the street, is going to attack him at any second and that he needs to attack first. Alternately, he’ll dig his heels in and refuse to walk past a shopping bag or an oddly shaped bush. Anxiety loves avoidance.

There are beautiful days when Shermy moseys on his leash without ripping my arm from its socket and wears a giant, squishable retriever grin. People smile at him when we walk past and I imagine them thinking, “What a sweet dog.” Sometimes, strangers tell him he’s a good boy. He usually chooses that second to bark at them.

Shermy’s good-boy moments remind me that he is more than his anxious behaviour. He’s more than one thing. He loves us and we love him. Mostly. If Shermy is more than his anxiety, then surely I am too. That’s helpful to remember on bad days when panic is winning, nothing is normal, and I still need to function like a human adult. Maybe this is a heartwarming dog story, after all.

Leadership, it has been said, occurs at the intersection of character and circumstance. We saw that demonstrated recently when Barack Obama spoke in eulogy to John Lewis and we see it here every day in B.C. as otherwise seemingly ordinary, albeit people well-qualified in their own areas, step up to provide the leadership, politically and medically, that shows us a path through crises like the COVID-19 pandemic.

article continues below

They inspire us to follow that path, knowing that some might take that path less willingly than others.

We’ve also see the tragic effect of the abdication and subsequent absence of leadership which has an entire nation to the south of us in chaos.

The question is how, in an age of 24/7 “news” and unsubstantiated opinion from any number of pulpits, do we explain genuine leadership so that we can clarify its characteristics for our kids as they move into that next stage of their lives, when they will need to select leadership at the ballot box?

How, for example, do we teach them to distinguish between conscientious leaders and demagogues — responsible aspirants to public office and career tub thumpers?

How do we help our kids recognize the loud mouth and the empty vessel?

To begin with, we can explain, genuine leadership is difficult and requires a blend of integrity, clarity, decisiveness, the courage to speak up and, probably most important of all, humility.

Like being a good parent, a good teacher, even just a worthwhile member of a democratic culture, being a good leader is not easy.

Demagoguery, which requires few or none of the qualities of actual leadership, seeks support by appealing to the less worthy desires and prejudices of ordinary people, avoids rational argument, points fingers and assigns blame.

Leadership, the research tells us, requires integrity, judgement, competence and vision.

Successful leaders demonstrate these qualities in abundance and maintain their sense of purpose in the face of obstruction.

So what, do we tell our kids, are the distinguishing characteristics of those whose leadership is worth supporting?

Leadership researcher and high-performance transformational coach Andi Saitowitz, of the Adler Institute, identifies listening as being a “sine qua non” of leadership without which other qualities fade into insignificance.

“Active listening is all about really hearing others beyond what is said verbally. When people feel heard and validated, it makes them feel valued and, as a result, drives far better engagement,” Saitowitz says.

Leaders, in other words, accept the advice of authentic experts.

According to Saitowitz and others, true leaders never stop learning and see themselves as perpetual students. They stay curious and ask questions with an open mind and view the pursuit of continuous learning as a strategic asset.

Leaders, sometimes in the face of all evidence to the contrary, remain optimistic.

“Leaders who are optimistic believe they can create a positive future that is better than the present. They instil hope and faith in their people and serve as a shining light of possibility” she says.

And leaders deliver.

Demagogues tend to rely on fear of the unknown and suspicion of those who are different or whose philosophy differs from their own.

A mountain of research into leadership also points to emotional intelligence as an important factor which distinguishes leaders from demagogues.

Daniel Goleman, author and researcher on the brain and behavioural sciences, defines emotional intelligence as the ability to not only understand and rein in one’s own emotions but the ability to understand the emotions and behaviour of others.

As our kids move into this world of 24/7 news and sometimes bizarre opinion, the ability to spot trustworthy leadership and its qualities becomes more and more essential to preserving a free democracy. Free that is, of fraudulent leadership which lacks respect for the truth, is quick to assign blame and slow to take responsibility.

But enough of all that. It is not about leadership “up there” our kids need to recognize, but the qualities of everyday personal leadership which will shape that way our kids learn and live as they grow into adulthood; practice in decision-making, strategic and critical thinking, accountability and the ability to set goals and deadlines and “get things done.”

True, these are among the qualities we admire in genuine leaders, but they are also abilities and characteristics kids need to master for themselves in their day to day lives; not to quit at the first sign of difficulty; to expect to face challenges and understand that resilience is a skill that can be developed over time to deal with inevitable bumps in the road.

Leadership, we will tell our kids, begins with you.

Mind planet Mercury is super strong on your birthday this year and whatever you focus your brain power on will bring astonishing results. Don’t let other people’s negative attitudes come anywhere near you – cocoon yourself in an unbreakable shell of positivity.

ARIES (March 21 - April 20):

What comes into your life over the next few days will improve your mood no end. And what goes out of your life will improve it even more! You may be generally content with the way things are at the moment but there is always room for improvement.

TAURUS (April 21 - May 21):

Don’t waste your precious time on people who you either don’t feel comfortable with or who seem to operate on a level you cannot relate to. You are under no obligation to hang around with them, so pick your moment and leave them behind.

GEMINI (May 22 - June 21):

Your ruling planet Mercury joins forces with both the sun and Mars today, which among other things will give you a clearer idea of what changes need to be made. Once you see the logic of sweeping away the past the idea will no longer terrify you.

CANCER (June 22 - July 23):

No matter how eager you are to press ahead with a new project you must give it more thought. Cosmic activity in the money area of your chart warns the cost of doing business may be higher than expected. It’s still worth it but watch the pennies.

LEO (July 24 - Aug. 23):

Something you have been worrying about for ages will soon be no more than a distant memory, so cheer up and approach what you have to do today with a glad heart. Life is getting better by the minute and soon you won’t want the days to end.

VIRGO (Aug. 24 - Sept. 23):

Something that has taken up more of your time and energy than it is worth needs to be ended – now! With both the sun and Mercury moving into your sign over the coming week you must clear the decks for action – of which there will be plenty.

LIBRA (Sept. 24 - Oct. 23):

How you deal with people is always important but over the next few days you will get opportunities to make the kind of friendships that last a lifetime. Remind yourself constantly that it’s not about what you achieve but how much you love and laugh.

SCORPIO (Oct. 24 - Nov. 22):

Listen carefully to what people who are more knowledgeable than you have to tell you today. Scorpios rarely take advice – you quite rightly trust your own inner voice – but on this occasion what you learn could save a lot of unnecessary work.

SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 23 - Dec. 21):

You must be honest with yourself this week. There is no point pretending that something is working out well when clearly it’s not. Make use of the sun’s last few days in one of the more dynamic areas of your chart to begin some much-needed changes.

CAPRICORN (Dec. 22 - Jan. 20):

Your powers of persuasion will be hard to resist today, but make sure you use them for positive reasons. If you try to sweet-talk people into giving you what you desire the universe will find ways to deny you. Be open and honest about your needs.

AQUARIUS (Jan. 21 - Feb. 19):

Cosmic activity in your opposite sign has brought a lot of surprises of late, and no small amount of joy as well. Keep those feeling of warmth and wellbeing going as long as you can. Events matter, but how you choose to react to them matters more.

Initially this was bearable, or at any rate better than mowing the lawn. But the more of it you endure, the more irritating Hollywood clichés become.

article continues below

First, who came up with the idea that tough guys can project power by eating alone in the presence of subordinates?

For an example, see John Noble as Denothor in The Lord of the Rings, slobbering over his dinner while one of the hobbits looks on. (In passing, what should have been a first-class movie — actually a trilogy — was wrecked by directorial malpractice. Half the cast can’t act, and those who can are so intimidated by Peter Jackson’s insistence on canonical accuracy, they’re reduced to whispering their lines.)

Then, we have an infuriatingly prissy Jeremy Irons as the board chair in Margin Call, toying delicately with his lunch as Kevin Spacey, who has just fired half his staff, looks on mutely.

This doesn’t communicate authority. It communicates asking to get hit with a brick.

Next, there’s the apparent belief that having your star chew gum endlessly adds an element of edginess. No it doesn’t. It adds an element of the emetic.

See, for example, William Devane in the movie Space Cowboys, incessantly chawing like a demented rodent (as, to be fair, he does in most of his movies.)

Or more aggravatingly, Sam Shepard ruining a key scene in The Right Stuff where, playing test pilot Chuck Yeager, he climbs aboard the first aircraft to reach supersonic speeds.

All the time he’s masticating like a cow on crystal meth. I suppose that’s one way to break the sound barrier.

In passing, this, too, should have been one of the great movies of all time: Uniformly strong cast (unlike the pretty boys in Apollo 13), excellent special effects for the era and the unforgettable sight of massive rockets blasting off launch pads.

Yet all that is ruined by a director (Philip Kaufman) who fell in love with his project, and let it run to a yawn-inducing three hours.

Tinseltown notwithstanding, you don’t clean your teeth by sticking a toothbrush in your mouth, pursing your lips around it, and thrusting it in and out like a plumber wielding a roto-rooter. All that does is lubricate your tonsils.

More so, why the preoccupation with dental hygiene in movie after movie. Is this some kind of product placement by the American Association of Orthodontists?

Likewise, who’s impressed by a gangster with a gun in one hand and a lollipop in the other? I know. Telly Savalas got away with it in the TV series Kojak. But that should have been the end of it.

And while we’re at it, why has Hollywood yet to deliver a half-decent rendering of Alexandre Dumas’ masterpiece, The Three Musketeers? This was one of the great action/intrigue novels of the 19th century, arguably the first of its kind.

But although there have been at least half a dozen English language productions, they invariably descend into slapstick humour. See, for example (or better still, don’t see) the execrable 1948 version, with Gene Kelly turning in a clown act as d’Artagnan.

All right. This is admittedly a jaundiced view of things.

So what does a good film look like? Obviously it’s a matter of personal taste, but my vote goes to Michael Mann’s The Last of the Mohicans.

Everything about this classic is perfect. The opening scenes of mist-filled valleys reaching far into the distance create exactly the intended sense of a remote yet threat-filled land. (The movie was shot in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina. It portrays the American frontier during the French and Indian wars of the 1760s.)

The cast are all first rate. Had there been any justice, Wes Studi would have won an Oscar for his portrayal of the Huron warrior Magua, the scariest bad guy you ever saw.

There are numerous settings of breathtaking beauty, like the shots of a young English officer coming by coach to meet his intended bride (she has other ideas.) The coach is filmed crossing a hump-backed bridge over a glass-smooth pool, all perfectly mirrored in the water below.

Although you know, pretty well, the ending in advance, the tension never lets up.

And surprisingly, a line from Rudyard Kipling creeps in, when Hawkeye, explaining why pioneer families dwell in this “defenceless” land, tells Cora: “Out here, they’re beholden to none. Not living by another’s leave.”

I say “surprisingly” because this leaf out of libertarian philosophy would never pass muster in Hollywood today.

Jerome Michael Yutaka Kinoshita: Father. Husband. Editor. Chef. Born June 26, 1951, in Hamilton; died Jan. 29, 2020, in Toronto, of complications from a stroke; aged 68.

To call Jerry a “foodie” would be doing him an injustice. Good food was something he truly adored. He could describe in detail a dish he had a decade ago as if it were yesterday. He also thoroughly enjoyed cooking – which his wife and two daughters perhaps never really appreciated until COVID-19 hit and they felt his absence in the kitchen.

Jerry was the youngest of three boys, his family part of a dark chapter in Canadian history. His parents had been interned in British Columbia during the Second World War and relocated to Ontario shortly after. He excelled in academics and sports, and his love of sports – both watching and playing – remained a core part of his life.

After studying journalism at Ryerson, he landed a job in 1974 at The Globe and Mail and found himself so at home he spent 42 years there, briefly as a writer and then as an editor. Writers appreciated how calm and patient he was, while fellow editors relied on his vast general knowledge and mastery of spelling and grammar. Much as Jerry loved his colleagues, he hated mistakes. For several years, his were the last eyes to see stories about to be published, scouring them for typos and breaches of The Globe’s often-bizarre style guidelines.

He worked on many major news events, but perhaps his proudest was as lead editor on a story about Toronto’s “hidden homeless.” The following spring, he was in the audience to hear journalist Margaret Philp sing his praises while accepting a National Newspaper Award.

Jerry rarely brought his work home. Apart from his willingness to edit his daughters’ school work, he saved that side of himself for the office. At his celebration of life, former colleagues shared hours of stories about how Jerry’s talent made them better writers and editors, how he loved to brag about his daughters’ accomplishments and how everyone in the newsroom knew how badly he wanted his favourite teams to succeed.

He and Janice, who married in 1989, had many shared interests, from good food and wine to basketball and baseball. They had been friends for many years and few were surprised when they finally fell in love. Off the job, Jerry did not make friends easily, and often balked at going to dinners and parties, but once there, he always had a great time. In the summer, he escaped to the cottage, often polishing off a detective/spy novel (or two) in a day before dinner with Janice on the deck, enjoying a glass of wine and a beautiful sunset.

Much of Jerry can be found in his daughters, but Christine, 26, and Laura, 23, also had an impact on him. They inherited his love of food, going so far as to create an Instagram account dedicated to it where Chef Jerry became a staple. When they developed more complicated relationships with food, he adapted. When Christine became a pescetarian, he adapted and accepted that now he’d rarely get to eat red meat, something he loved. She would text him recipe ideas, only to find he’d already bought all the ingredients by the time she got home.

He left The Globe in 2016 and, until his stroke last October, devoted retirement to travelling with Janice, playing golf with his brother, watching the Raptors win a championship, hoping every year would finally be the year for the Habs and spending quality time with his daughters. His dedication to his family was genuine and rare.

Jerry’s legacy endures through his intellect and talent, and of course the many dishes he had mastered. To honour him on his birthday, Laura made his famous Jamaican seafood stew, with a slight modification: much more seafood than the recipe calls for. Jerry would have certainly shaken his head, but eaten it with a smile.

You feel you have a special destiny and that feeling will grow as the year goes on. You are more likely to find out what that destiny is if you make friends with people who share your outlook on life. Together you can make the world a better place.

ARIES (March 21 - April 20):

Don’t hold back – give life everything you’ve got. There is so much cosmic activity working in your favour that almost anything you do will be a success, so get busy and start climbing your highest mountain, and don’t stop until it’s been conquered.

TAURUS (April 21 - May 21):

Chores may be tedious but the planets indicate that what you have to do this week could in fact be quite exciting, if you approach it from the right angle. Your state of mind is all-important: if you think something is going to be fun then it will be.

GEMINI (May 22 - June 21):

If you are on the move and meeting people this week it will not only be fun in itself but could also take your mind off an issue that has been giving you sleepless nights. Come next weekend the problem will most likely have resolved itself.

CANCER (June 22 - July 23):

There is more than one way to get what you want, so be flexible and be ready to move in a direction you don’t usually travel if that is the route most likely to take you closest to your goal. Always have a fallback plan, or several.

LEO (July 24 - Aug. 23):

The sun in your sign means you are very much at the centre of things now, and no doubt your ego will be swollen by all the compliments that come your way. Don’t believe them all though – some people will say anything to gain your approval.

VIRGO (Aug. 24 - Sept. 23):

If someone in a position of authority gives you a hard time this week then you must give them an equally hard time back. The planets warn if you stand there and take it they will be encouraged to pick on you again. Don’t let that happen.

LIBRA (Sept. 24 - Oct. 23):

Why wait for life to come to you when by getting out there and setting the agenda you can make things happen the way you want them to happen? The planets urge you to think nothing but positive thoughts – then surely your dreams will come true.

SCORPIO (Oct. 24 - Nov. 22):

Are you reluctant to accept some kind of promotion because you fear you are not up to the job? if so, you should remind yourself of all the times in the past when you feared getting it wrong but ended up doing it better than everyone else.

SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 23 - Dec. 21):

Because so many of your opinions are at odds with the way most people think you are sure to attract disapproval, but no one can stop you believing what your sixth sense tells you is true. Speak up and spread your valuable message far and wide.

CAPRICORN (Dec. 22 - Jan. 20):

If friends and relatives seem unable to make up their minds about what you should be doing, then just do what feels right to you. Most likely they will follow your lead and have a surprisingly good time. They may even thank you for it.

AQUARIUS (Jan. 21 - Feb. 19):

You’ve been a bit too cautious in recent weeks and now you need to go right the other way and take a few risks. So long as they are calculated risks, as opposed to stupid ones, you stand every chance of ending the week ahead of the game.

PISCES (Feb. 20 - Mar. 20):

Avoid other people’s petty squabbles this week, especially if you don’t know all the facts. The more they try to draw you in and get you involved the more distance you must put between them and you. It’s not your fight, so stay out of it.

A sun-Mars link on your birthday means your destiny is in your own hands. If you have a clear goal and a strong desire to be the very best at what you do, the coming year could see you breaking through to the big time – which is where you belong.

ARIES (March 21 - April 20):

Don’t work your fingers to the bone this week, especially if most of your work is done for other people. A magnificent sun-Mars link will energize you like never before, but it’s still possible to overdo it, so be sensible about the tasks you agree to take on.

TAURUS (April 21 - May 21):

Partners and loved ones must be allowed to do things their way this week, even if you are 100 per cent convinced it’s the wrong way. As always, people learn quicker if they learn from their own mistakes, so stand back and let them get on with it.

GEMINI (May 22 - June 21):

Your social life may have been in a bit of a lull of late but it will pick up again as from today. Friends are always fun but now they will be absolutely fabulous, so don’t sit at home watching TV – get out there and have a good time.

CANCER (June 22 - July 23):

This week’s sun-Mars link could make you a touch aggressive, so be careful what you say and who you say it to. If you go to extremes it’s as good as guaranteed that someone even more extreme will come back at you, which may not be pleasant.

LEO (July 24 - Aug. 23):

The makings of success are right in front of you now but it’s up to you to do something with them. Put on your best clothes and your most smiley face and greet the world with warmth, wit and wisdom. There are no limits Leo, at least not for you.

VIRGO (Aug. 24 - Sept. 23):

You may feel compelled to step in and speak up for someone you think is being given a hard time for no good reason, but do you really know the whole story? It could be that on this one occasion they deserve to be chewed out a bit!

LIBRA (Sept. 24 - Oct. 23):

You are the kind of person who gets along with all sorts of people, and that talent will serve you well this week. If you find yourself in the middle of some kind of feud, offer a solution that everyone can agree on. But don’t take sides.

SCORPIO (Oct. 24 - Nov. 22):

The sun and Mars combine across the work and career angles of your chart, which suggests you will be a lot more ambitious than usual. By all means strive to impress important people, but don’t strive too hard. Make everything you do look effortless.

SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 23 - Dec. 21):

This is one of the best times of the year for you and you must seize the opportunities that are coming your way. Sometimes Sag you can be too laid-back for your own good, so make an effort to get up and get at ‘em. It won’t be too hard.

CAPRICORN (Dec. 22 - Jan. 20):

If someone tries to get you to do something you don’t agree with this week you must complain long and loud. Not only is it the wrong thing for you, but if you stay silent they will take that as a sign they can bully you any time they choose.

AQUARIUS (Jan. 21 - Feb. 19):

You may not be the most patient of people but as the sun moves through your opposite sign it would be smart to give others time to say what they need to say and do what they need to do. Not everyone thinks and acts as fast as you.

PISCES (Feb. 20 - Mar. 20):

If you need to make changes to your work situation, now is the time. This is one of those weeks when you will be able to assert yourself in ways that colleagues and employers cannot ignore. You can be quite persuasive when the mood takes you.

Don’t be surprised if you miss out on the promotion you were expecting on the work front. It may be a letdown to begin with but over the next 12 months there will be many other opportunities to shine. It could even be a blessing in disguise.

ARIES (March 21 - April 20):

The fact that someone seems hypercritical of you at the moment suggests they fear you are pulling too far ahead of them – and they’re right, you are. There is no reason why you should rein in your ambitions. Give them something else to worry about today.

TAURUS (April 21 - May 21):

Creative activities are under increasingly good stars, but because changes planet Uranus begins one of its retrograde phases today – in your own sign – you cannot afford to take anything for granted. Be confident that you will succeed, but keep your guard up too.

GEMINI (May 22 - June 21):

Do you ignore what your rivals are saying about you, or do you hit back and tell the world a few choice facts about them as well? On this occasion it might be wiser to keep a low profile. It’s unlikely that their misdeeds are lesser than yours!

CANCER (June 22 - July 23):

You may be full of energy and enthusiasm, but the planets warn you must not rely too much on other people, even those who have never let you down in the past. Just because someone is a friend does not guarantee they know what they are talking about.

LEO (July 24 - Aug. 23):

You have so much going for you at the moment, but don’t get sloppy and make silly mistakes. The planets warn if you overlook an important detail, especially on the work front, it could cost you dear before the end of the month. Do some serious research.

VIRGO (Aug. 24 - Sept. 23):

Focus all your energy in one direction and don’t let other people persuade you to start something new before your current project has been completed. No task or obstacle will be too much for you, but that does not mean you must do everything.

LIBRA (Sept. 24 - Oct. 23):

You may look calm and collected to the world at large but actually you fear the worst. No doubt there are good reasons for that but just because everything around you is in turmoil does not mean your life is going down the drain. You’ll be fine.

SCORPIO (Oct. 24 - Nov. 22):

Physically and emotionally this could be a rough and tumble sort of weekend, but chances are you will enjoy every minute of the challenges the universe sends your way. You are never more alive than when dealing with situations that terrify other people.

SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 23 - Dec. 21):

Anyone who thinks you will compromise on a point of principle is going to be disappointed. You don’t care how much it might cost you financially, you have never been one to back down when you know you are right, and you are not about to start now!

CAPRICORN (Dec. 22 - Jan. 20):

A sudden setback may catch you by surprise but the fact is you should have seen it coming. It is a universal law that the more expansion there is in one direction the bigger the deflation when the bubble finally bursts. You’re at that point now.

AQUARIUS (Jan. 21 - Feb. 19):

What happens over the next 48 hours will come as a reminder that the moment you reach a point where you think you are in full control the universe will start taking that control away from you. Change is the only thing that is certain in life.

PISCES (Feb. 20 - Mar. 20):

Resist the temptation to make a big deal of something that is of quite minor importance. The only reason it seems so dramatic is because you are feeling with your heart when you should be thinking with your head. Hopefully, common sense will prevail.

You have always been one for big ideas, and there is nothing wrong with that, but don’t let those ideas run away with you to such an extent that you set yourself targets that cannot be reached. Even Leos have limits – but within those limits greatness is possible.

ARIES (March 21 - April 20):

No matter how persuasive an Aries you may be, if others don’t want to take your advice there is not much you can do about it. In fact, the planets indicate you might be better off keeping your ideas to yourself. Why waste them on those who can’t understand?

Take extra care when dealing with people whose honesty you cannot be 100 per cent sure of. With Mercury, your ruling planet, under cosmic pressure today you must expect more selfish sorts to try to trick you. Make “Trust no-one’‘your motto.

CANCER (June 22 - July 23):

Certain individuals can be extremely persuasive, but just because they are good with words does not mean what they have to say is true. The more others weave pretty mental pictures of what they can do for you, the more distance you should put between you.

LEO (July 24 - Aug. 23):

Yes, you have problems like everyone else, but in the greater scheme of things you are one of life’s lucky ones, so stop fussing and fretting and find ways to enjoy your good fortune. Your cup is more than half full, in fact it’s very nearly overflowing.

VIRGO (Aug. 24 - Sept. 23):

The more others point out your faults and failings the more likely it is they just want to make you feel bad about yourself. Why? Because they cannot stand the thought that you might be happy while they find it so hard to smile. Misery loves company!

LIBRA (Sept. 24 - Oct. 23):

Under no circumstances try to bend the facts or be economical with the truth today. Even if you get away with it to begin with you are sure to be found out further down the line, and your reputation will suffer. Don’t give your rivals a free hit.

SCORPIO (Oct. 24 - Nov. 22):

Focus on what is positive in your life and ignore those who say you should be panicking like everyone else. You have never been one to let negative emotions dictate what you think, say or do, and there is no reason why you should change now.

SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 23 - Dec. 21):

Just because you have had a few short-term losses of late does not mean your long-term outlook is poor. On the contrary, the sun and Mercury in your fellow fire sign of Leo promise great things are on their way, so be patient and prepare yourself.

CAPRICORN (Dec. 22 - Jan. 20):

You should try to be a bit more tolerant of people whose outlook on life strikes you as wishful thinking at best and deluded at worst. You may be super rational by nature but not everyone can look reality in the face every day as easily as you.

AQUARIUS (Jan. 21 - Feb. 19):

There is no point trying to please everyone now because almost certainly that means you will end up pleasing no one. Do what feels right to you personally and limit your good deeds, for the time being at least, to those you feel closest to emotionally.

PISCES (Feb. 20 - Mar. 20):

You know you cannot avoid an unpleasant task, so get on with it now and get it over with before the week gets much older. Be tough with yourself and, where necessary, be tough with those whose mistakes have added another layer to your workload.

When historians look back at this time in our society, there will be volumes written about how the social media experiment was a failure. A remarkable and instantaneous communication method that was intended to bring us together, instead ripped us apart.

Hate is the No. 1 emotion being expressed across all mediums lately, and our peaceful, little slice of paradise here on the island is no exception.

Now, as someone who is often in the public eye for my work with Victoria’s homeless plus my earlier work at Monday magazine, you may think I’m used to being a target for online abuse.

But the truth is, passion makes one vulnerable. And I’m not alone in this. I also work alongside hundreds of compassionate people who work on the frontlines of two simultaneous pandemics (opioid poisoning and COVID-19) and expose their hearts every single day.

In a time when we should be coming closer together, when we should be looking at the exposed cracks in our society and working on solutions, too many people are eager to grab the keyboard and spew hate into the mix.

Recently, for example, I was told that I should “be fired” and “go back to Scotland” because I work with people experiencing poverty, homelessness, mental health struggles and opioid dependency. It is clearly hate speech, and I’m seeing it more and more.

“Go back to where you came from,” is the last gasp cry for racists who lack the intellect to rally for solutions.

Instead of wasting our energy disseminating hate, isn’t it possible to rise above it and look at our problems through fresh eyes?

There is passion in that hatred and fear, but it’s being wasted. And what the toxic online world is teaching us is that wasting time and energy attacking strangers and neighbours is perfectly normal.

It isn’t.

So let’s do something positive. Instead of being divided, let’s unite. Whether you work for a non-profit or local businesses, live in a downtown condo or a sea-view home, we all want the same thing: to see people given access to housing, treatment, and the dignity of not living in a park.

Let’s write to our MPs and our MLAs and say it is time for a national strategy to deal with the severe mental health issues that are leaving people to die on our streets. Our current solution is not working. We need a multi-pronged program that includes care facilities, supported care homes, and the compassionate professionals necessary to actually make changes in people’s lives.

I know a young woman in her 20s who smokes crystal meth to deal with the voices that swirl in her brain from schizophrenia. She lives in a transitional home and performs sex work to pay for her drugs.

All we’re doing at the moment is watching her slowly die. That is not good enough. If she were to be placed into a compassionate mental-health program, away from drugs and under professional care, there is a chance she could find a new lease on life.

Instead, she’s treated as disposable.

I want us all to do better, and the first step is looking deep into our own hearts, swallow down that knee-jerk reaction to spout hate, and rally for the good of all people.

Come on, Victoria, I believe in you.",549,0.9700849283172315,local

First Person is a daily personal piece submitted by readers. Have a story to tell? See our guidelines at tgam.ca/essayguide.

Like many others, my husband and I are working from home currently. I am aware that I am very fortunate to have a job that allows work from home, so I’m not complaining – much. However, my job very much depends on the ability for people to freely enter and exit Canada, so work has been up and down over the past few weeks. My day-to-day was becoming increasingly unproductive as the coronavirus wreaked its havoc throughout the spring. I needed a project.

Baking bread was not a contender, nor was a backyard DIY project, despite the Instagram posts that tried to convince me how satisfying these accomplishments could be. I am certain that all would be disappointed with the outcome of such experiments. With our youngest’s seventh birthday coming up in short order, and no prospect of a party with his friends, we came up with a plan. We would make a pinata – a pinata in the shape of a coronavirus particle. We had no intention of trivializing the disaster that affected so many people; we just liked the idea of children bashing the hell out of this thing that has caused everyone so much upheaval and stress.

I had never before made anything out of papier-mâché, but I was undeterred. With a general mistrust of well-meaning internet advice-givers, I blew up a balloon and set to work to figure it out myself. Precious flour that would never find its way into a loaf of bread was boiled with water, creating a gooey paste in no time at all. Strips of newspaper bearing the depressing headlines of the day were repurposed, covered up and transformed into a sphere that we could blast to smithereens. Ah, the symbolism. We were nailing this.

Three layers of bad news adhered, I left the balloon to dry thinking I’d wake up in the morning to find a hardened, perfectly formed orb. Alas, it was still sopping wet when I prodded it, coffee in hand. That’s okay, I can adapt and improvise, I told myself, just like the real virus is teaching me to do. I popped the balloon and watched it turn into a cratered moon as it collapsed. A hair dryer (sort of) did the trick (used on and off for a mere four hours) but its mottled appearance now gave it away as endearingly homemade.

Our pinata was now going to need stuffing. Here, I planned to shine. I wasn’t going to fill it up with run-of-the-mill candy for them to sit around and eat while cooped up in the house all day. Mentally nourishing trinkets like mini books and wooden science kits from the local independent bookstore were the ticket. However, I left nowhere near enough time for such supermom antics. Perhaps Walmart would suffice? Nope, the three-block-long lineup was too much to endure. The grocery store would be just fine. I left with half-price Christmas candy, packs of Mentos and Jell-O powder. For good measure, I stopped at a local bakery and bought the only two wrapped treats they had. More savoury than sweet, I knew they would not be popular, but felt I should do my part to support local business, however small the gesture.

During a video call that evening with family across the continent, my brother-in-law recommended we reinforce the top of the pinata and weaken another area so that the innards would actually fall out, avoiding the disappointment of the whole thing falling to ground after one swat. An engineer, he had honed his pinata-making skills while hosting annual Cinco de Mayo parties that conspicuously involved no children – they take their grown-up kid-style parties seriously in San Francisco. A coat hanger, cardboard and tape were strategically affixed the next day, the candy encased with more bad news and homemade glue. The pinata was now heavy, oblong, unsightly and moist. Was this really going to work?

My husband suggested we let the mess dry outside, in the sliver of sunshine we enjoyed that day after weeks of rain. It sounded like a good idea at the time. Unfortunately, the next morning we awoke to find that opportunist squirrels were undeterred by the multitude of COVID-19 warnings broadcast all over the pinata, leaving a damp hole in our masterpiece and candy wrappers stashed in all our plant pots. Muttering expletives, I began round three of papier-mâché adhesion to patch the hole, now enclosing just half the amount of candy originally planned. The headlines affixed to the craft were not getting any cheerier.

Two days later, the misshapen lump was fairly dry. We now turned our mind to aesthetics. How were we going to make the spiky bits of the virus particle? What colour was it going be? In the spirit of collaboration, I let my husband’s ideas prevail after some tense debate. They turned out to be good ones. Accepting advice often gets better results. I knew that rationally, but sometimes control is hard to forfeit – a lesson the past few months have only highlighted for me.

Our coronavirus pinata was completed just in time for the actual birthday. We Zoomed the grandparents to display it proudly, including them in the party as best as possible under the circumstances. They would have preferred a hug, but they appreciated the diversion and the story of the pinata to impart to their friends on their respective upcoming video calls, sharing the anecdote across continents.

We e-mailed a few neighbours with kids, suggesting they come to the nearby schoolyard that afternoon with their own bat or golf club in hand to take a swing while safely physically distanced. We had a few takers, and met on the soccer field, eliciting a few smiles and even a cheer from a few others out for their walks or runs around the track. It felt good to be making eye contact with strangers and sharing something with the community outside of our household, even if from a distance. With a swift and decisive blow, our eldest broke through the pinata, leaving the show-stopping explosive final wallop for the birthday boy.

Candy flew everywhere, to the delight of children and adults alike. The vanquished virus was left limp and spinning, cracked and enfeebled. The pinata was no longer the focal point as attention shifted to the candy below – a welcome reward for the time, effort and commitment it took to understand and then defeat it.

Our pinata forced our resourcefulness and co-operation. Invaluable advice from our international community (all the way from San Francisco) was key in making our efforts stronger and more effective, which is proof of the power of collaboration. The project took a lot longer than anticipated, and the process was more involved and complicated than we expected it to be. We demolished it together, turning a birthday party expected to be clouded with misfortune into an experience that we will remember fondly forever. Ah, the symbolism. We nailed it.

Since 1958, there have been 140 lunar missions, some intended to encircle the moon, others to land on it. Roughly half failed on lift-off or in flight, and nearly all of the remainder were, for the most part, trial runs aimed at developing more reliable technologies.

The issue revolves around diminishing marginal returns, the idea being that the more often you attempt a venture, relatively speaking the less you stand to gain.

That wouldn’t be true if all of the moon-shots so far had failed. In that case, it would still be worth another try.

But six manned missions (all American) have landed on the surface and returned safely. What is to be gained by a seventh, considering the miserable failure rates to date?

It’s been suggested that the moon could be mined for minerals that might in turn be processed on site as fuel for missions further afield.

No doubt one day this might be practical. But by 2024? Not a chance.

This is merely another placeholder in case Congress shuts down the space program completely.

The more obvious target is Mars. A recent stream of data from orbiters and landers, as well as Earth-based telescopes, has shown that without question water remains on that planet. Most of it will be underground — the atmosphere has burned off to such a degree that liquids don’t survive long on the surface.

Even so, there are photographs of water trickling down the sides of craters in the polar region.

To date, the robot landers sent to Mars have been miserably limited in nature. Their ability to search beneath the surface extends to only a few centimetres.

Clearly, that won’t do. If there is life on the red planet — the main reason for going there — it is likely to be far underground, possibly in subterranean caverns.

But the rovers sent to Mars have no chance of reaching these. At best they can test for atmospheric gases that might, conceivably, suggest the presence of living organisms.

And the emphasis here is on “conceivably.” There are numerous alternate explanations that skeptics will point to.

We’ve been conducting radio searches across various sectors of the galaxy since the late 1950s, looking for signs that someone is out there. So far, we’ve found nothing. Not that this has disheartened SETI researchers, who like NASA, need an excuse to stay in business.

The only realistic means of proving we are not alone in the universe is to visit the one planet in the solar system that has both a history of life-sustaining conditions, and which is within the reach of a manned expedition (if only just).

There is no question about the difficulties or risks involved. Given current rates of acceleration, it will take a ship about seven months to reach Mars, and the same to get back.

That’s a long time in a gravity-less environment. You could perhaps spin the ship to create the equivalent of gravity, as was done with the fictional Soviet spacecraft Leonov in the movie 2010.

But no-one knows the effect this would have on the human body over an extended period.

Then there is an unavoidable wait of 18 months on the planet’s surface until the Earth orbits back into the proper position. But the average temperature is -63 C, and radiation levels (again due to the thin atmosphere) are far above the lethal level. We’re talking mammoth hazmat suits.

Nevertheless, if we’re going to face the risks that manned space travel involves, we might as well do so for a purpose worth pursuing. Proof that we are not alone (and I’m betting that’s what such a mission would show), is the only purpose that meets this test.

GEMINI (May 22 - June 21):

Don’t worry that your plans seem to have come to a premature halt, because the breathing space it gives you over the next few days can be made to work in your favour. Travel and social activities are still well starred, so do something fun with your friends.

Enjoy.

To my dear AP English students,

article continues below

I wanted to contact you and tell you that I have been thinking about you and your families this past week. The first two days were kind of a novelty-like snow days without snow. The weather was beautiful, the daffodils and cherry trees were blooming, and things were coming back to life after a long, dreary winter.

When we got the call Wednesday and then Thursday about school closing, the novelty gave way to anxiety and worry. How long will this last? Will my students be OK? Will my elderly parents weather this virus? Everything seems even more amplified now. If you switch on the television, you might think the world is ending.

But, it isn’t.

One of the interesting things about getting older is that I have seen a lot of different things come and go. I haven’t seen as much as my grandfather — who was born into the Greatest Generation and saw so much tragedy on a global scale in his lifetime. However, I am a history nerd and I know that what we are experiencing is not completely unprecedented, historically.

What is unprecedented is the 24/7 news and social-media coverage of what they are now calling a “pandemic.”

Words really do matter, and I guess that the word “pandemic” is accurate — though I find it fear inducing and not necessarily helpful in quelling anxiety or helping people remain calm. It is an interesting word and when I first heard it, I thought of Pan — the Greek god of shepherds and flocks, woods and fields. “Pan” also means bread in Spanish. My mind wandered to the thought, if only “pandemic” meant “bread for all.”

Of course, “pandemic” is more sinister that either of those — an epidemic disease that has spread to “all,” the Latin root of the word. What is happening is terrible on a global scale.

So why I am writing to you this discourse about the word “pandemic”? Well, as you know, because I have been your teacher since August, I am a word geek who thinks very philosophically about things and can go down rabbit holes with that kind of thinking on a regular basis.

But, it is mainly because I miss teaching you and seeing you and talking to you about everything that is going on in the world right now, seeing your faces to see if you are OK and gauging your emotions to see how you are processing all of this.

When I was looking at social media yesterday, I saw a post by a young man that I thought I would share with you. He said: “I imagine all the closures and cancellations give people a sense of ominousness. But it’s really an amazing act of social solidarity: We’re sacrificing so we can give nurses, doctor and hospitals a fighting chance. Start from there and hopefully, we can figure out the rest.”

I thought that was a wonderful way to think positively about our current situation.

One of the best things about “all” of us in this together, is that we are “all” in it together! We can look out for one another and take care of one another until the virus (I feel like if I say the actual name, it is like summoning Voldemort or something …) settles down and runs its course.

Because it will run its course.

Because this will be over at some point.

So … in the meantime, we have extra time! Extra time to spend with family. Extra time to sleep. Extra time to read. Extra time to play games. Extra time to enjoy the beautiful spring weather that I am sure is just around the corner. Extra time to help others in need. Although isolation is not always fun, extra time is a tremendous gift!

So, even though for now, school and sports and public events have been cancelled, there are lots of things that are not cancelled!

Music is not cancelled!

Dancing is not cancelled!

Movies (at home) are not cancelled!

Conversations and discussions are not cancelled!

Reading is not cancelled!

Friendships are not cancelled!

Love is not cancelled!

Hope is not cancelled!

What we must cancel are fear, mass hysteria, too much screen time reading about the Virus that Should Not be Named, and the hoarding of toilet paper just to mention a few.

I hope you know that I am thinking of all of you during this time. I miss all of you and hope that you and your families are healthy and well.

I can’t wait to see you soon and get back to teaching you that “intricately patterned” masterpiece, my favourite novel in the entire world, The Great Gatsby. It truly is a wonder of a novel.

And, each of you is a “wonder,” and you are precious to me and so many others.

So, be safe, be reasonable and be kind.

Bruce Grierson is an author and journalist living in Vancouver.

Have you noticed you’ve been perceiving time differently since the world turned upside down in March?

Many people report that the first month of lockdown felt like it lasted about a year. But then the clock started speeding up. And now it’s whirring like a propeller.

Story continues below advertisement

If that’s been your experience, too, the question is why.

The short answer: because time isn’t real. It’s a social and psychological construct, a “rubbery thing,” as the Stanford neuroscientist David Eagleman puts it.

There’s often a pretty significant disconnect between the substantial “truth” of time – as measured by atomic clocks – and how it feels. Time seems to race or drag according to what’s going on around us.

What transpired in the early months of the pandemic was unprecedented in our lifetimes. Everything was novel. And novelty, psychologists have found, stretches time. Things that surprise us seize our attention, and gobble neural energy as the memories are processed. And that makes the weird episodes in our lives, as we reflect on them later, seem to have lasted much longer than they actually did.

Our brains are lazy – er, efficient. When they encounter something familiar, they kind of stop taking notes. Been there, done that. “See yesterday,” the brain jots in the margin, thereby preserving space for the next bit of real news – i.e., something different.

Those crazy, anxious early days of COVID-19 – the alarming numbers out of Iran and Italy, the chaos of everyone’s plans suddenly collapsing – were intense. And intensity of feeling, it turns out, pumps even more molasses into the temporal gears. It may have felt like a Michael Bay movie while it was happening, but in the brain’s director’s cut, it’s more like a Merchant Ivory film, the whole thing unfolding at the speed of a lazy river.

No wonder life B.C. – before COVID-19 – seems like eons ago.

Story continues below advertisement

But around late April or early May there was that shift. We started getting used to the weirdness. The shock of working from home and tracking the infection spikes and banging a pot in the evening began to wear off. Routine took hold (at least for those of us lucky enough not to be on the health care front lines). There were fewer unusual events to snag our attention and slow time, so the days started zipping by again.

This is all a fairly new discovery, this elastic property of the sense of time.

In the 1930s, an American physiologist named Hudson Hoagland was attending to his wife as she lay sick in bed with the flu. He nipped away from her bedside for a few moments and then returned, whereupon she remarked: “Where have you been? You’ve been away for ages!” Something was distorting her sense of time. Dr. Hoagland suspected the fever. Could it be there was some kind of clock in the human central nervous system – a chemical pacemaker that can be nudged by outside factors, like, in this case, heat? (Subsequent studies support Dr. Hoagland’s hunch that time slows as our core body temperature rises. So if you thought that Bikram yoga class would never end, now you know why.)

Today it’s clear there’s not just one internal clock governing our judgment of time; multiple systems work in concert. Dr. Hoagland’s original sleuthing sent us down a rabbit hole that is vastly deeper and windier than anyone suspected.

What’s interesting is that, while much of the variation in how we judge time is situational, some of it is not. One constant appears to be our age. Per the cliché, time actually does fly as we get older, studies suggests. This has always made me a little bit envious of kids, in their unleaky little boats. They never seem to lose whole days, let alone accidentally start writing the wrong decade on a cheque. It has been wild, during the pandemic, to think of our nuclear family holed up under the same roof, riding out this historical event together but experiencing it – the pace of it – quite differently.

Science cannot fully explain the generational discrepancy, but a few things may be going on.

One is, again, that novelty factor. Kids are relative newcomers to this planet, so they are still routinely surprised by stuff, and their brains work hard to sort it out. And since each passing hour is a larger proportion of a child’s short life, it may feel longer and more significant. Plus, kids’ attention and memory circuits are still growing, so the transmission of information may actually be physically slower, drawing time out even more.

Another possible ingredient in the mix: digital media. Gen Z is not exactly waiting on the pier for the next instalment of Charles Dickens’s new novel to arrive by boat. They have lived their whole life, as the writer Venkatesh Rao put it, “inside a cage of time made up of 32 satellites orbiting Earth.” What the young want – TV shows, songs, commodities – is available any time, and always has been. So: Less time spent reminiscing plus less time spent anticipating means more time moored in the present. We might guess – from other research – that this too puts the brakes on time.

In the early going of the pandemic, my wife and I got a wee inkling of what it might feel like to be a kid. We were jacked in to their time signature. Too bad it was mostly because we were overloading our circuits being stressed out and rolling the dice on what to do and which experts to believe; the lazy river was full of crocodiles. But as the weeks passed, and normalcy set in, the gulf between the generations began to open again. Time sped up as we calmed down, while they continued on their unhurried course. The kids seemed chill, for the most part – although much more was going on inside their heads.

There is a new word in circulation, hatched not from the neuroscience labs but from the jittery zeitgeist. The word is “shadowtime.” As defined by its creators, it is “a feeling of living in two distinctly different temporal scales simultaneously.” It’s as if two clocks are ticking at once – real time and existential time.

To use it in a sentence: “Kane was intently working on his presentation that was due the next morning, but as he looked up and saw the moon it occurred to him that the moon had been rising and setting for 4.5 billion years, moving ever farther away. He felt shadowtime for the rest of the evening.”

The word was coined by the Bureau of Linguistical Reality, a California-based conceptual art project, so it’s definitely more felicity than science. But it does capture the real and uncomfortable disconnect of having to navigate life, in its humdrum detail, while an environmental sword of Damocles dangles overhead. There’s some evidence that younger people sense the anxious doomsday countdown more acutely. They have more skin in the game, after all; it’s their future.

But there’s nothing like approaching one’s own personal expiry date to inject each passing moment with meaning. Gerontologists have found that older people, so long as they aren’t suffering, tend to positively cherish time. “The elders view time like a member of a desert tribe views water,” Karl Pillemer, a gerontologist at Cornell University, told me. “They can’t believe we would ever squander such a precious resource.” To younger people they counsel: “Think small.” Pay attention. Take delight in the hummingbird suspended outside your window. Relish your enchiladas – and the person who just laid them on the table in front of you.

To the extent that it stretches time, paying attention becomes a kind of investment plan.

Maybe the last reliable one we have left.

That’s not just about existing divisions in our society, but is more about those upon whom we rely upon for leadership and guidance in a time of crisis and upon whom the political, social and economic stability of our country’s future rests.

article continues below

That guidance and leadership influences the rest of us and our behaviour for better of worse.

“Mindfulness” gets a bad rap as some kind of hippy-dippy wannabe Zen Buddhism practice, but in fact mindfulness simply refers to a state of active, open attention to the present, the ability to live and accept the real world.

As we observe the words and actions of a variety of leaders during a crisis such as the COVID pandemic, the distinction becomes clearer.

To live mindfully is to live in the moment and to reawaken oneself and others to the present, as opposed to dwelling on the past.

Philosophers like Soren Kierkegaard describe this state as “existentialism,” meaning, in unpretentious terms, what happens when an individual is continually faced with diverse possibilities from among which the existent (i.e., the human individual) must make a selection to which he/she must then commit.

Big word, simple meaning.

Dr. Bonnie Henry is an example of a softly spoken person who simply relates the facts of the situation. She is a model of mindfulness. As Marshall McLuhan might have put it, she is both the medium and the message.

Mindfulness is the ability to link cause and effect or even action and consequence socially, economically, personally and politically.

Mindlessness, on the other hand, is not intended as a pejorative term but simply describes a state of being unmindful or heedless.

Mindlessness is toxic for a democracy.

As Costica Bradatan, Professor of Humanities at Texas Tech University wrote recently in the New York Times: “Democracy is for the Gods and it should be no surprise that humans cannot sustain a democracy,” adding that “world history, for the most part, is the story of excessively mindless self-assertive individuals in search of various sceptres.”

Bradatan points out that even in a steadily failing once-upon-a-time democracy such as the United States of America, it doesn’t help matters that a self-serving individual, despite all flags or warning, has been enthroned as leader. Others seem only too eager to mindlessly submit to his mindlessness.

After all, mindlessness is easier than thinking.

Interestingly, most academic articles about mindfulness relate mindlessness to an absence of emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence, unlike linguistic intelligence, logical or mathematical intelligence, musical intelligence, kinesthetic body intelligence or spatial-visual intelligence explains why the people we tend to admire and identify with most comfortably in life display other-centredness and kindness rather than cruelty in their interactions with others.

Mindlessness often dissipates with maturity, and sometimes, to the dismay and frustration of the mindful, is unintentionally common among young (and sometimes older) emerging minds. “Good judgment,” as the saying goes, “comes from experience and too often experience comes from bad judgment.”

All well and good, but what does any of this have to do with individual and cultural reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic?

Some people, it seems, are approaching the pandemic risks mindfully, while others, frustrated because they can’t gather in groups or do the familiar self gratifying things that provide them with immediate short-term pleasure, resist experienced fact-based advice mindlessly.

In this time of COVID-19, many of us can relate to the annoyance of having experienced a loss of control that has been replaced by a great sense of vulnerability for ourselves and others, along with a whirlwind of challenging emotions, including fear, guilt and grief.

In some ways, it feels like revisiting the uncertainties of adolescence, because with so many unknowns, we are left with no choice other than to live existentially in the present moment, one day at a time, which isn’t so easy for most adults.

Mindfulness then becomes an actual life-saving social imperative. The mindful are paying attention to present experiences with curiosity and compassion, and in doing so, learn to co-operate with experiences, rather than resisting or fighting them.

Simply being in denial about undeniable reality is mindlessness. Falling, as they say, feels like flying for a little while but then the illusion is brutally brought back to the inflexible uncompromising reality of landing “hard.”

As Bradatan concludes in his piece about the survival of a democracy through a crisis: “One element that is needed for democracy to emerge is a sense of humility,” and it seems reasonable to say that being mindful on behalf of our own safety and that of others during the COVID-19 crisis requires much more than a mere spoonful of humility.

I know what you’ve been going through these past five months; it’s the same thing we’ve all been going through.

Stripped both of structure and spontaneity, a day could feel like a week and a week like a month, yet two hours could evaporate in a puff of anxiety as you googled COVID-19 symptoms and compulsively streamed The Great British Bake Off. It was always 7 p.m. on a Sunday, no matter what day of the week it actually was. Confined inside for days on end, you came to loathe the colour of your bathroom, the texture of your carpet, the sound of your upstairs neighbour walking above you. No matter how essential the errand, leaving your home made you feel both anxious and guilty.

Now, the game is changing again. For better or for worse, things are reopening; Toronto, one of the hardest hit cities in the country, recently entered “stage three,” meaning bars, movie theatres and restaurants are open. Although everything still has a faint, palpable air of dread – the lull in a horror movie where the plucky teens foolishly believe they’ve escaped the monster and the viewer, helpless, is just waiting for it to come crashing back on screen – the stranglehold of total social isolation is loosening for many people. The fear and worry and loneliness are still there, but blunted by changing circumstances and normalization.

But that other thing, that quieter ache – that smouldering coal deep in your chest you fear would ignite and devour you if you dug it out and examined it – that’s still there. If anything, that pain might be sharper, more acute than before.

That feeling is grief.

We can go out and get a coffee, we can walk in the park, we can drink a beer on the patio, but it doesn't really matter.

The world we knew is gone.

The life you thought you were going to have is gone.

The lives we all thought we were going to have are gone.

And, maybe, that’s a good thing. A good – and very hard – thing.





Since COVID-19 first emerged sometime toward the end of 2019, more than 741,000 people have died and 20 million have been infected, with 121,000 infections in Canada alone. With people locked into their homes, sick or afraid of getting sick, the economy came to a grinding halt, a shockwave of lost jobs and reduced or redistributed consumer spending. Canada lost around two million jobs in April, with the hardest hit – outside of people who were already un- or underemployed – being low-wage workers, of which women and younger people comprise a large portion, groups that were already at an economic disadvantage in the Before.

Those jobs aren’t just going to just magically reappear as we reopen; COVID-19 has reshaped consumer demand and will continue to do so into the future. Many small businesses – restaurants in particular – are permanently closed, and it will take time for something to replace them, if such a thing will even be possible in the near future.

Things aren’t going to go back to “normal.” There’s no “normal” to go back to.

More importantly, this pandemic has kicked open the factory doors of our culture and allowed us to see how the sausage is made: on the backs of the people whose labour, time and bodies we deem to be worth at or around minimum wage, but without which we absolutely could not – cannot – make it through this crisis.

Current conversations around the “safety” of going back to work right now are simply not for the lower classes. While many middle and upper class people worked from home, working class wage earners – grocery store clerks, delivery drivers, food and agriculture folk – continued on as “essential workers,” dispensing and producing the goods and services on which our entire culture runs, all the while risking continuous public exposure. They went to work – and continue to go to work – because they have to, and will continue to have to, even as we see infections spike, something we should prepare to happen, given what we are seeing in other nations, such as Germany and Australia.

For the working class who have lost their jobs due to the pandemic, discussions around CERB – which some claim is a disincentive for people to return to work – and how some people, particularly millennials, spend that money, only serves to make the deep-seated class divide in this country more apparent. If $2,000 a month – about $12.50 an hour, or around $24,000 a year before taxes for a full-time worker – means that people are making more money than they were before, the problem is not CERB, but that workers are not fairly compensated for their labour with a living wage. Anyone who would weigh in critically on how that money is spent, moreover, should ask themselves if they believe that only the wealthy deserve financial autonomy, and the pleasure and dignity of human comforts, or if CERB is really just a subsidy for landlords.

That these are even conversations to be had demonstrates a tremendous failure of understanding – and compassion – about the realities of working class life, and the message it sends is clear: Get back to work, plebes.

The destabilizing effect of this pandemic has laid bare the economic inequality on which our society functions. Class disparity, the resistance to universal income, systemic racism, the militarization of the police and the rhetoric of the current political climate are not the result of the pandemic; they are the endgame of capitalism. We’ve merely paused the machine long enough to see them clearly.





This is my own tiny, selfish dream:

Story continues below advertisement

I want to meet a nice femme and get married and have a modest house with a little yard. I want to make my future wife coffee in the morning and kiss her goodbye, and go off to work writing articles and books, because it’s a useful occupation that makes me happy. I want to take my breakfast in a diner on Sundays while I read the paper, and make my wife laugh, and put butter on hot, fresh bread, and throw a ball for my dog. I want a couple fingers of whisky, clean sheets and a book when I go to bed at night.

My dream, in short, is to have enough, with the time to enjoy it. To have a life that has love and dignity.

It’s so small, when you say it like that, but for so much of my life it has seemed impossibly out of reach. At the beginning of March, things were finally starting to look up for me; that dream felt a little bit closer. When the pandemic hit, every certainty I had worked so hard to build for myself was swept from the table.

Now, here in August, that dream feels even further away than before. I don’t know what your own little dream is, but it probably feels distant – perhaps even unreachable – now, too.

I’m really sad about it, and I think we should be allowed to be sad right now.

Grief is a chance to get a hold of that hurting thing, to look at it fully and carefully, to take what’s left of what you’re grieving for and make it into a part of yourself you can take with you.

Story continues below advertisement

Grief isn’t about expulsion and denial. It’s about consumption and reflection.

Things are scary. We are allowed to be anxious and afraid right now.

We have lost a world. You’ve got permission to grieve.

But in doing that, we might ask if the world we have lost is really as good as we remember, if it was serving the life we hoped we would have. I’m working class. I’ve experienced homelessness and poverty. I’m queer. I’m non-binary. I’m female. I know – have known for most of my adult life – that in this world some bodies are worth more than other bodies. Some lives are worth more than other lives. Some happiness is worth more than other happiness.

What we are seeing, now, in this crisis, is a perfect distillation of that, of the ways the world before did not serve – did not care about – everyone equally. This is a chance to rethink that; perhaps not only can we not return to the world before this, but maybe we don’t really want to.

Capitalism demands constant, accelerating growth; a black magic trick that flies in the face of nature, in which no such thing exists. Even SARS-CoV-2 – itself a phenomena of nature – must adhere to these rules, and in many ways the virus is a metaphor for capitalism itself. It seeks perpetual increase without regard for the host organism, and eventually it will reach a point where it can no longer continue its present rate of infection; either it will use up all its resources (all the host organisms are all already infected or dead) or it will be contained or even eradicated by adaptations on the part of the host (that’s us).

Story continues below advertisement

That we see, plainly, how fragile and unfair our way of life really is, is part of the collective grief. Even if we did all agree to go back to the way things were, they can never actually really be that way; the illusion has been dispelled.

So go ahead and grieve now. Think carefully. Fill in the holes the world before has left.

Adapt.

Be good to your neighbours and friends. Take care of them as best you can. Don’t let them go without, if it’s possible. We’re going to need each other more than ever.

It will take a lot of hands to build a new and better world with new and better lives for each of us.

Not only is there a new moon on your birthday but Saturn is strong as well, which suggests you possess the ideal combination of self-belief and stamina. Whatever you start this year you won’t stop until it is completed. You’ll make hard work look remarkably easy.

ARIES (March 21 - April 20):

If you want something enough you will find a way to get it. A new moon in the most dynamic area of your chart means your confidence is at such a high level that failure is simply not an option. You won’t BE a success, you ARE a success.

TAURUS (April 21 - May 21):

Someone needs your assistance and you must drop whatever you are doing and run to their rescue. You have never been one to ignore a cry for help and your willingness to sacrifice your own needs to assist others won’t go unnoticed or unrewarded.

GEMINI (May 22 - June 21):

Stay calm and don’t let people with opinions you profoundly disagree with get under your skin. There should be room for all shades of opinion in your deliberations – and, who knows, something you are told might actually get you thinking along different lines.

CANCER (June 22 - July 23):

If you make a decision you must stick with it. The moment you start chopping and changing is the moment when it all starts to fall apart – and could also be the moment when your rivals sense you may not be as confident as you like to appear.

LEO (July 24 - Aug. 23):

Today’s new moon in your sign means that even though the Sun will shortly be leaving Leo a new beginning is both possible and desirable. You may have to go off in a direction that others do not approve of but that’s fine – you enjoy being different.

VIRGO (Aug. 24 - Sept. 23):

By all means speak your mind today but be aware that even if other people agree with what you say it won’t necessarily mean they are going to follow your lead. Your arguments may be perfectly logical but some people enjoy being perverse.

LIBRA (Sept. 24 - Oct. 23):

Today’s new moon will give you the courage and the confidence to take on a new task and also to take the kind of risks that make success more likely. You don’t have to be secretive about your ambitions – in fact the more people know about them the better.

SCORPIO (Oct. 24 - Nov. 22):

You don’t lack for fighting spirit but you do need to channel it in the right direction. No matter how much someone in a position of power annoys you today DO NOT take them on. Use your energy purely for creative purposes – and keep your lip zipped!

SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 23 - Dec. 21):

The plans you made earlier in the year are beginning to pay off, if not financially then certainly in terms of power and prestige. Don’t allow yourself to be distracted by people who don’t share your drive and determination – there’s still lots you need to accomplish.

CAPRICORN (Dec. 22 - Jan. 20):

If you want to start something of a business nature then now is the time. Today’s new moon will make it easy for you to approach people who can pull financial strings and make it happen for you. But remember, their assistance won’t come for free.

AQUARIUS (Jan. 21 - Feb. 19):

You have your suspicions that someone is up to no good and what happens today will help you prove it. It may, however, pay to keep what you discover to yourself for now. The value of that information is likely to grow with time.

PISCES (Feb. 20 - Mar. 20):

You may not have quite as much energy in your tank as you think you do, so pace yourself sensibly and make sure you are never in a situation where you have to rely on other people to get you over the finishing line. Choose your races wisely.

The whole world is involved and grappling with it is a new deal for most of us. A spiritually oriented person for most of my adult life, I thought initially that I would find this change an opportunity to dig deeper. Well, that quickly became sheer necessity! I had no idea how wired I was into the physical patterns of attachment to dear ones. Being brought up in a large family, with hugging, arm-in-arm walking, and affection being the norm, I’m learning to ‘hug’ from a distance, to fill the six feet between me and others with warm love.

So how to go deeper, to find that wellspring of comfort and love that we in ECKANKAR call the ECK or Spirit?

article continues below

We have some tools. Sacred words, the most universal being an ancient name of God, ‘HU’ (rhymes with you), can express the vibration and the sound of Divine Love. Sung on a single note on the outgoing breath, HU can be used aloud or silently, as a single utterance or as a song or chant for as long as needed or desired. Lately I have needed to sing it a little longer to calm myself and gain entry into the Light and Sound of God. But once I arrive there, I am filled with gratitude, relaxation and a desire to go further. Of course, I cannot spend my whole day sitting quietly chanting HU. However, I can pause in the supermarket when someone scowls at me or I accidentally turn into the wrong aisle, and inwardly sing a few HUs to regain my balance. Or when I get back in the car after a hyper alert visit to the hospital to drop my husband off for surgery, I can take a moment and sing HU to bring myself into harmony with life. I find it helps with the acceptance of what is going on.

So, our inner being is getting a real workout. We are, perhaps, finding areas that we thought we had put aside forever or no longer needed to resolve. Deep questions may arise. Answers are found when we can access profound love and gratitude for this experience called life. In ECKANKAR, we have a living master, a guide and support who not only teaches us through talks and books, but is also available for personal guidance in contemplation and dreams. His inner being, the Mahanta consciousness, embodies Divine Love to such a degree that he uplifts those with whom he comes into contact, physically, or in the inner realms. To reach him in your contemplations, it is helpful to focus on love, a beautiful idea or quote, or to visualise his face or that of someone you love. Sometimes this consciousness can be seen within as a blue light or ball of light. You may hear a voice or the sounds of the inner planes. If you receive direction from a voice in this state, it will only direct you to kind, loving thoughts and actions. Anything negative or hurtful is not a manifestation of the Mahanta, the Living ECK Master.

If we are to grow and benefit from this worldly experience of isolation, deprivation, and worldwide awareness, we need to dig deeper, to find the key that dwells in our hearts, and practice living in the Love that comes from the essence of life. Some call it God, Allah, Brahma. In ECK, we call It Sugmad, the Ocean of Love and Mercy. It can be found by using the HU sound to go within.

Whether he’s unboxing the latest smartphone, giving fans a tour of his new studio or vlogging about his latest trip, Conrad gives off the grinning aura of a six-year-old boy let loose in the action figure aisle.

And why wouldn’t Conrad enjoy himself? He gets to play with the newest gadgets, wear the freshest gear and travel to far-flung locations. Not bad for someone who only started making YouTube videos as a hobby in 2012.

If all that sounds impossibly glamorous, then it should be some comfort to know that keeping it real is a big part of Conrad’s personality. After growing up in Toronto and briefly playing professional soccer in the Netherlands (Conrad’s father is Dutch), he studied kinesiology and did a master’s in health informatics. He happily admits to holding down a regular, full-time job as a manager at a Toronto mental health hospital. He shoots and edits his videos in the evenings and on weekends.

Charlie, a colleague and leading expert in organizational transformation, was sharing observations on how he saw people faring throughout dozens of video meetings he had participated in over the past eight weeks; the consequence of a world forever changed by the COVID-19 pandemic. He wryly observed that 40-plus hours of video chat per week was driving a new behaviour where, despite significant effort, he was unable to make eye contact with anyone except himself. Disquieting but also fascinating.

I was also witnessing something. Our team members were working together, remotely from home, across four cities. In the process, they built new cultural dynamics for the entire company. Working remotely was improving team cohesion and, in turn, performance.

I believe that remote meetings can be a great tool for change, but it’s not a given that the change will be good. So how do we make sure we can work past our default behaviours to enable shared outcomes? How do we take advantage of this opportunity to redesign how we collaborate, for the better? How do we literally look past ourselves on screen to enable collaboration with other people?

Why meeting culture fails

Meetings are too important to be poorly designed. They involve the precious time of participants and they require patient, rigorous co-ordination. At best, a failed meeting wastes everyone’s time. At worst, it leads to incredibly stupid decisions, the likes of which can bring down a government or bring a company to the brink.

Most remote experiences are awful right now because we have not designed them to be great. Meeting hosts are focused on who to invite and what to present, instead of designing a process that enables participants to collaboratively produce the best outcomes. It’s the equivalent of hiring great cooks and buying terrible ingredients. You can hope for the best, but the laws of probability aren’t in your favour.

Too many of us are treating remote meetings as a temporary inconvenience until this is “all over” and we’re back in a room together. This is crazy. Teams will need to solve large complex problems long before it is safe to physically bring people together. And we will be using remote meeting technology for a long time to come.

I think we can generally agree that our in-person meeting culture wasn’t terribly great to begin with. We have a very hard-to-change set of behaviours and underlying assumptions about how we convene that we’re now applying to online spaces. There’s an opportunity now for us to create new meeting norms.

I think most people believe that meetings are perfunctory obligations to onboard many people to an idea despite it being designed by only a few. This comes at the cost of actual collaboration or multilateral problem solving. The outcomes are predetermined, creating winners who implement their ideas and losers who sit through meetings feeling an increased lack of association to the mission at hand. That’s why meeting culture fails.

Good meetings should cede control to enable collaboration

Good leaders know that a successful meeting is called with a purpose and designed to serve that purpose. Good meetings facilitate shared understanding, build cohesion and trust, and create a sense of shared intent. Most importantly, they enable powerful game-changing insights. They require ceding control to enable collaboration.

Story continues below advertisement

A well-designed meeting lets us see past what others want us to see into what we actually need to see so that genuine trust can manifest. Trust allows us to understand people and problems in all their contextual complexity. Meetings that enable trust are the ones worth showing up for. This is what meeting culture will need to be if we are genuinely preparing humanity for the challenges ahead.

There are a lot of crappy behavioural norms that come with traditional meetings that do not need to be emulated. Meetings are institutional by nature – and it’s important to confront an institution that no longer serves its intended purpose. Based on where things are at, what do we have to lose?

The sooner we acknowledge remote meetings as being both our reality and our opportunity, the sooner we will be able to successfully calibrate to our new circumstances. Then we can replace bad meetings with good ones.

We start asking our youth this question almost as soon as they can speak. It’s usually asked with the best intentions, and followed with encouragement to keep working toward their stated career aspirations. However, as we examine the future of work and the transformational role that technology will play in it, this question may be setting an identity trap for our youth.

Technology will shape every single job that exists today. Studies show that technology may also replace up to 800 million of those jobs all together. Therefore, technology will likely augment or even replace the jobs associated with whatever career aspirations a primary schooler may have by the time they enter the work force.

Linear career paths, as we once knew them, will become a thing of the past. According to the Foundation for Young Australians, young people in school today are expected to have 17 jobs across five careers in their lifetimes. This has implications in North America – the same study was cited in leading U.S. future of work strategist Heather E. McGowan’s book, The Adaptation Advantage. In fact, 65 per cent of children entering primary school today will ultimately end up working in completely new job types that don’t yet exist.

Because of this, we need to prepare them for a complex and changing world and a life of continuous learning. Therefore, we should not impose on our youth the socially constructed belief that one’s career identity is static and anchored to a singular profession. Instead, we need to encourage children to explore what they love to do, figure out what they love to learn, and think of problems they would love to solve.

This is what this could look like in practice:

Repositioning our education systems around experiential learning, problem-solving, and learning how to learn;

Prioritizing digital literacy;

Teaching soft skills such as emotional intelligence and adaptability; and

Introducing age-appropriate real world problems during play and encouraging children to use what they have learned in school and at home, in combination with their imaginations, to solve them.

I engaged in real-world problem solving with my nieces and nephews during a recent video chat. My nieces and nephews (all under nine years old) have started growing vegetables in their garden. They beam with excitement at every vegetable harvest. I used this opportunity to discuss the problem of climate change and plastic pollution. I asked them how their gardening skills could help the planet. Their responses included solutions like “No longer needing to drive to the grocery store” and “No longer needing to wrap up food in plastic packaging.” I showed them photos of vertical farming structures and 3D printers. By the end of the conversation they were jumping with excitement about the idea of turning their porch into a “vertical farm” and “printing lunches and snacks” for their neighbours.

It’s impossible to predict how the technological revolution will unfold, including the jobs and industries that have yet to be invented. We can, however, support our youth to thrive in this complex and changing future by encouraging them to lean into their curiosities, explore their passions, and use what they are naturally endowed with: an imagination.

It’s tough to do so because right now everything seems to funnel back to the worldwide pandemic.

There is a lot of uncertainty in our world right now and as we watch public spaces, businesses, and institutions close their doors to the public for the near future, it only reinforces what we are going through is real.

article continues below

When I was born, my Grandma Bessie was around 70 years old. She was always an old grandma who was very short with brown eyes and curly white hair.

When I was too sick to go to school, I would go to my grandma’s house and watch The Price is Right and make boats out of egg cartons and make them float in her bathtub.

My grandmother was very frugal and made sure not to be wasteful. Every time I would visit her at her apartment, my Grandma Bessie would give me a small handful of pennies. For my birthdays and on Christmas I would get a bag with a small collection of pennies inside.

As I got older, I realized that every time my Grandma Bessie received a penny in her change, she would put it away for me. She had many grandchildren, and today, it makes me feel special that whenever she had a penny, she thought of me.

I did not have this realization until later in life. I remember being a very unimpressed 15-year-old one Christmas, unwrapping a bread bag with pennies and breadcrumbs in the bottom when my older brother was gifted movie passes.

My grandma lived during the Great Depression and it was an experience that really moulded the woman she became. When she was a young teenager, I think about 14 or 15, her parents told her they couldn’t afford to keep her in the home anymore and she would have to leave home and start taking care of herself financially.

Being sent out into the world on her own, she found work taking care of people with disabilities and making bombshells for the war. Making bombshells was something that haunted her for her entire life. She never escaped the guilt that she felt, even though her friends and family tried to comfort her and reminded her of her circumstances at the time.

Bessie searched for peace through religion and doing her best to be the kindest person she could. She lived to be 94 years old.

This experience shaped her frugal ways, her refusal to waste anything and her determination to ensure food never found its way into the bin. Valuing each and every penny she collected must fall into their, somewhere, too.

I was told about my grandmother’s experiences during the Great Depression many times over in my life. I always knew this happened to her, but I could never really comprehend how the world could turn upside down so fast.

Over these past few weeks, we’ve all seen it happen and our perceptions and thoughts have changed dramatically as we see how quickly things are happening now. We are living in a time of uncertainty. People are losing their jobs and self-employed people are losing contracts. There is no doubt that this is a hurdle for all of us.

There are many vulnerabilities right now that include our health, our finances and our families.

As a community we are working together toward social-distancing and flattening the curve. Scientists are working toward a vaccine.

I don’t know what the future holds. I hope that we can try to step outside of our own experiences and make sure that our friends, families and neighbours are being taken care of mentally, emotionally and financially.

There are bound to be many lessons we learn and experiences that shape who we become as we age. This is a reminder to us all that life can turn upside down at any moment. We need to find ways to be more understanding and compassionate, because there will always be someone having a harder time than us.

The young folks reading this are probably asking themselves: “What are pennies?”

Harleen Puaar Shukla remembers the moment Sault Ste. Marie first felt like home. She’d recently arrived from New Delhi, where she grew up, to study public relations and events management at Sault College. A friend of a friend invited Shukla to a dinner party with other members of the city’s Indian community. “I did not know that there was a [sizeable] Indian population here,” she says. “So that, I think, was the moment where I felt okay.”

Still, Shukla wondered if she’d have an easier time building her career in a bigger city. She ended up moving to Toronto—but after a couple of months, she realized that it wasn’t where she wanted to be.

“It was so different living in Sault Ste. Marie, because I wasn't used to [the pace],” she says. “When I was in Toronto, I felt like I was back in New Delhi. It's the same lifestyle. And I think that's why I made that choice to come back to the Soo.”

As a vibrant community of 73,000, Sault Ste. Marie has all the amenities of a larger Canadian city, with the safety of a smaller one. Locals have always recognized the city’s adventurous charms, including world-class fly fishing, kilometres of cross-country ski trails and easy access to canoe tripping—but now a growing number of adventure enthusiasts and even less outdoorsy city folk are relocating to Northern Ontario.

With real estate prices rising in cities like Toronto and its surrounding suburbs, Sault Ste. Marie has become an attractive option—it’s affordable, welcoming and laid-back. What’s more, home ownership is achievable in the northern city; the Canadian Real Estate Association reported that the average cost of a home in the Sault in March 2019 was $184,810. And these transplants are sticking around. According to a 2019 report¹ from Public Policy Forum and Pathways to Prosperity, 73.4 per cent of the immigrants who arrived in the city between 2007 and 2011 were still living there five years later.

Shukla isn’t the only millennial putting down roots in Sault Ste. Marie. Dr. Jenna Rebelo moved to Sault Ste. Marie from Hamilton, Ont. in Jan. 2019 with her husband, Mike, and their one-year-old son, Felix. The couple had been living in their hometown while she finished her last year of residency for medical school at McMaster University. One day while on mat leave, she got a text message about a job opportunity in the Soo.

“My initial thought was, I’ve never been to Northern Ontario ever. I am not outdoorsy. So, you know, sure, I’ll look into it, but I didn’t think too much of it,” she says.

That is, until she spent two weeks visiting Sault Area Hospital. “The longer I was there, the more I got this sense that I needed to come back,” says Rebelo, an ears nose and throat specialist. “I felt like, I can't imagine that I'm not going to see these people again. I already feel like I belong here.”

That feeling didn’t go away when they actually moved to the Soo. In fact, Mike says the community made his own transition much easier. “It's a bit of a leap of faith, [ moving to a ] place that you don't know anybody,” he says. But people went out of their way to make him feel welcome, including the car salesman who sold the couple a second vehicle—and invited Mike to join his softball team.

Rebelo also knew moving to the Sault would be the right move for her career. It can be difficult to attract doctors to the North, but she knew working in a smaller city meant she’d get a chance to do more, sooner. “The neat thing about practising here is that you really can explore the full depth of practice and not just the breadth,” she says. “People are so happy when I tell them that they don't have to go down south for their ear surgeries—I can do it right here.”

Like Rebelo, Teni Araba, director of human resources at Algoma University, says she also fell for the city before she even knew she’d be living here. At first, it was about the Soo’s natural beauty—and abundant space. “It is serene, it is naturally beautiful, picturesque. I always say you can’t take a bad picture in the Soo; it just can’t happen,” she says. And when she realized that you can get anywhere in the Soo in 15 minutes or less, she was thrilled to spend less time commuting than she used to in Regina, Sask.

But it took actually moving to the Soo with her husband Gabriel and their three kids—14-year-old Romi, six-year-old Jola and four-year-old Fami—to understand how great the city is for young families. “[We have] the opportunity to raise our kids in a friendly, welcoming place,” she says. It’s not just about access to the outdoors; the family attends the United Baptist Church, and take lessons at the Algoma Conservatory of Music.

They all stress how warm and welcoming the city is. For Shukla, who met her now-husband at that first dinner party and has now lived in the Soo for almost six years, there’s no place she’d rather be. “It's an ideal place because you get the real Canadian experience here. And you're not spending hours on commuting. Instead, you're spending time with family. I think it’s a great place to put down roots.”

The California Independent System Operator (California ISO), which manages the power grid, declared an emergency Friday evening and directed utilities around the state to shed their power loads.

The state’s three biggest utilities — Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric — turned off power to more than 410,000 homes and businesses for about an hour at a time until the emergency declaration ended 3 1/2 hours later.

The move came as temperatures around the state hit triple digits in many areas, and air conditioning use soared.

The power grid is mostly stressed during the late afternoon and early evening due to higher demand and solar energy production falling. The state tried to prepare for the expected rise in electricity use by urging conservation and trying to buy more power but a high-pressure system building over Western states meant there was less available.

The state remained gripped by the heat wave Saturday and the power grid operator will decide whether to continue the rolling outages on a day-to-day basis, said California ISO spokeswoman Anne Gonzales.

“We’re dealing with weather, clouds, wildfires … these are quickly evolving situations, quickly changing,” Gonzales said.

The last time the state ordered rolling outages was during an energy crisis in 2001. Blackouts occurred several times from January to May, including one that affected more than 1.5 million customers. The cause was a combination of energy shortages and market manipulation by energy wholesalers, infamously including Enron Corp., that drove up prices by withholding supplies.

Counties up and down the state reported scattered outages, although the city of Los Angeles, which has its own power generating system, wasn’t affected.

The heat wave brought dangerously high temperatures, increased wildfire danger and fears of coronavirus spread as people flock to beaches and parks for relief.

Temperatures were expected to peak above 110 degrees (43 Celsius) in inland regions of state Saturday. The sweltering weather was expected to continue into Wednesday across greater Los Angeles, the Central Valley, Sierra Nevada foothills and parts of the San Francisco Bay Area.

Santa Clara, Alameda and Contra Costa counties opened cooling centres that will welcome people this weekend from the afternoon to the early evening. San Francisco officials said the city is recommending people stay home and that if the heat indoors gets intolerable to go outside to a shady place where they can stay cool and distant from other people.

“Congregate indoor sites are not safe necessarily during COVID-19. It is better to follow other instructions during this heat wave,” said Mary Ellen Carroll, executive director of the Department of Emergency Management.

Carroll encouraged residents to check on family, friends and neighbours, especially older adults and those in frail health, and reminded people to always wear a face mask when in the vicinity of people who don’t share their household.

“We know it’s going to be beautiful out this weekend but we just want everyone to remember that we are in a very serious response to this COVID-19 virus,” Carroll said.

Several cities opened cooling centres, but with limited capacity because of social distancing requirements.

The scorching temperatures are a concern for firefighters battling blazes that have destroyed several homes and erupted near rural and urban foothill neighbourhoods, driving through tinder-dry brush.

In addition to the possibility of heat stroke and other hot-weather illnesses, health officers were concerned that people will pack beaches, lakes and other recreation areas without following mask and social distancing orders — a major concern in the state that has seen more than 613,000 coronavirus cases.

In early April, about a month into the COVID-19 lockdown, Daniel Rotsztain, an artist, writer and cartographer living in Toronto, built what he calls a “social distance machine.” Imagine a giant hula hoop, jutting two metres in all directions, worn around the neck like an Elizabethan collar, minus the Shakespearean ruffles.

As Rotsztain filmed, his friend Bobby Gadda donned the contraption and tried to walk around downtown streets, sidewalks and parks. Invariably, his device bumped into just about everything – people, construction hoarding, the sides of buildings. Absurd? A little. But the resulting YouTube video, viewed nearly 385,000 times, illustrated an important point. “We were being told to stay two metres from other people,” Rotsztain says. “Often, that involved stepping into the road, into a live lane of traffic. That’s not safe.”

Canada’s cities, with their narrow sidewalks and car-clogged roads, were simply not designed for physical distancing. As COVID-19 continues to force us apart, designers are looking for ways to rethink the spaces and places where we live with wellness in mind. But not just with new bike lanes and car-free roads (both of which increased in Toronto after Rotsztain made his video): The inside of our homes, parks and playgrounds are also getting a health-focused rethink.

“Extreme situations sometimes bring about innovation,” says Maya Mahgoub-Desai, senior urban designer for Moriyama Teshima Architects and chair of the environmental design program at the Ontario College of Art & Design University. “I recommend a book called The Ghost Map. It basically details how our modern sanitary sewer systems emerged from a tragic cholera outbreak. Public infrastructure can be used to mitigate public health crises.”

If cholera led to the invention of the modern sewage system and, by extension, the toilets that link into it, COVID-19 might lead many North Americans to finally embrace bidets. California-based bidet-maker Brondell has seen a 300-per-cent jump in interest since March. Many clients of Toronto interior designer Nora Voon have been asking for them, freaked out by the prospect of toilet paper shortages. “Copper handles, faucets and fixtures are particularly popular,” says Voon, adding that copper is naturally anti-microbial, killing viruses, including COVID-19, faster than other metals, plastics and glass.

Beyond bidets, Voon, founder and principal of Noda Designs, says “a lot will change” in our homes as a result of COVID-19. Some of the shifts will be small, yet practical. Pantries might get larger, to cut down on the need for extraneous grocery runs. Extra bathrooms can help if someone in a house becomes infected, making in-home distancing easier. “People want more sinks in general,” Voon says. “There’s increased attention to handwashing. I’m being asked for sinks in mud rooms, so people can scrub down as soon as they come home. I was never asked for that before.”

Outdoors, the concept of the Victory Garden is making a comeback. The idea throws back to the Second World War, when Canadians grew their own backyard produce so the gas and oil used by farms could instead by sent to the front. According to Martha Kantorczyk, a member of the Mississauga Master Gardeners, an association whose mandate is to give free, useful advice to amateur green thumbs, one of the upsides is that space needn’t be a constraint.

“You can grow just about anything in container planters and hanging baskets on a condo patio,” she says. And it’s not too late for vegetables. Whereas tomatoes, peas and cucumbers are typically planted in early spring, “there are fall vegetables that can be started inside now and moved out as the weather gets cooler. Kale, for example, does really well in colder weather.”

For homeowners with lots of space and big budgets, Voon is planning elaborate garden revamps, including outdoor kitchens and alfresco living and dining set-ups. “Swimming pools are becoming more popular,” she says. “People are looking for ways to entertain themselves and friends outside, while keeping a distance. The trend used to be to bringing the outside in. Now, it’s bringing the inside out.”

Some designers are trying to facilitate such backyard hangs with extreme precaution. Multinational architecture studio Scott Brownrigg, based in England, has designed something called the Social Contact Pod. It’s basically a prefab box that can be trucked to someone’s lawn and set up in a day. It works a bit like a prison visitation room, albeit a fancy one, lined with big windows and blond woods. Each party enters through separate doors and are kept apart by a plexiglass divider, ensuring no one shares the same surfaces, let alone the same air.

If space is tight, the thought of gathering in a public park might be tempting, although it can also be anxiety inducing. It is hard to know, just by eye, whether friends and family are keeping their two-metre distance. Some municipalities have tried to help by painting circles, six feet apart, on park lawns. For where that doesn’t exist, London-based designer Paul Cocksedge has released something called Here Comes the Sun. It’s a free DIY pattern, downloadable through his website, for a picnic blanket that marks out exactly where to sit to stay six feet from others. It’s like the anti-Twister board, with spread out dots.

Equally daunting while in a park: where to go to the washroom. Many public toilets are locked for the foreseeable future. A Dutch company called, fittingly, Lapee, has invented a moveable, outdoor urinal – specifically for women. The pavilions could easily be mistaken for a swirling, pink Richard Serra sculpture, all folding, overlapping walls. There are no doors. Women need only walk in, squat over an ergonomically positioned receptacle and clean their hands with built-in bottles of sanitizer.

Among the more upsetting signs that COVID-19 has disrupted modern life, especially the lives of children, is the site of yellow caution tape draped across so many playgrounds. “I can only imagine how distressing that is to a child,” says Nathan Schleicher, a playground designer at Ontario’s Earthscape Play. “I respect the need for quarantine. I also know that kids need to play, and to play with each other.”

Two German designers, Martin Binder and psychologist Claudio Rimmele, have envisioned a playground that keeps children at least two metres apart, separated in shallow, lily-pad-shaped platforms, each with their own individual entrances. Some activities span pad-to-pad, such as see-saws; others are solo, such as sandboxes connected by a network of speaking tubes (like cans on a string, but nicer looking) to encourage conversation, if not direct contract, during play.

Schleicher has a simpler suggestion: Build more playgrounds to help prevent overcrowding, and follow public-health recommendations for cleaning shared equipment. “Many playgrounds will be worth going back to after the pandemic,” he says. “They don’t all need to be redesigned. We may just need added protocols to keep them safe.”

Mahgoub-Desai points out that there are lots of underutilized spaces in our cities that could be turned into additional parkettes and small play spaces. “Because of the pandemic, we’ve seen parents bring their kids to bike around parking lots,” she says. “There’s no reason those spaces can’t also be beautiful, can’t also have this wonderful, extra purpose to them.”

The dry lightning came with little moisture and after record-breaking weekend temperatures that left forests tinder dry, said Dorthe Jakobsen, spokeswoman for the B.C. Wildfire Service’s coastal region.

High temperatures are expected to continue until Thursday and the wildfire risk is considered extremely high.

Most of the fires, including blazes at Mount Healey and the Sooke Lake Reservoir area where Greater Victoria draws its water supply, were about one to four hectares in size on Monday afternoon. By late Monday, the Wildfire Service was reporting eight small wildfires around Sooke.

The Capital Regional District said residents may see smoke and air tankers in the vicinity while B.C. Wildfire and watershed protection crews “contain and supress two small wildfires” on a ridge top around the reservoir.

The CRD said there was no threat to water quality or infrastructure. “Multiple crews and aircraft are busy assessing,” a statement said. “Though smoke may be visible, the wildfires are currently small … the largest is four hectares.”

Initial response crews were travelling to the sites to assess the fires and fight them, Jakobsen said.

All of the new fires are south of Nanaimo, including a 2.5-hectare blaze at Meade Creek and four other fires north of Lake Cowichan, including Holland Lake. One of the blazes is close to Laketown Ranch in Youbou, site of the Laketown Shakedown music festival. The owners were on high alert as the fire was only about six kilometres away.

A lightning strike is believed to be the cause of a blaze near Muir Creek, west of Sooke, while there is a fire of unknown cause near Shirley. Lightning also sparked a blaze in a remote area of the San Juan Valley and the Bear Creek Reservoir north of Jordan River.

Several mid-Island fire departments worked on dousing a small brush fire in the Ladysmith area that was reported Sunday.

The fire is in a forested area near where Oyster Sto’Lo Road and the Trans-Canada Highway meet. The fire is believed to be a minor one, as the affected area of the forest is estimated less than one hectare.

“If it went unmanaged, of course it could become something significant,” said Mike Primrose of Ladysmith Volunteer Fire Department. “But they were on it pretty quick.”

The North Cedar Fire Department, Ladysmith Volunteer Fire Department, and the B.C. Wildfire Service all responded to the mutual-aid call.

Jakobsen said attack crews from the North Island, where there are no new fires, could be called south if the fires grow in size.

Environment Canada estimates there were about 1,600 lightning strikes across the province over the 12-hour period starting at 5 p.m. Sunday.

The B.C. Wildfire Service said there have been 415 fires across B.C. since April, burning a total area of 910 hectares. That includes 76 fires in the coastal region scorching 272 hectares.

The forecast calls for several more days of high temperatures before a large weather system brings rainfall on Thursday and Friday through much of the southern areas of the province, Jakobsen said.

Heat warnings remained in place Monday night for the Fraser Canyon, as well as the Okanagan, North and South Thompson, Cariboo and 100 Mile regions.

Environment Canada said 13 temperature records were broken or tied across southern B.C. on Sunday. The Fraser Canyon community of Lytton was the hot spot in Canada at 41.2 C, which broke the old record of 40.4 set 12 years ago.

One Island location set a new record on Sunday. Estevan Point on the Hesquiat Peninsula on the Island’s west coast hit 23.7 C, slightly higher than the previous mark set in 2012.

Low-rise and mid-rise projects allow different entry points for prospective home buyers to upsize or downsize

When considering buying a home in the Greater Toronto Area, you may want to consider a segment of the market known to developers and planners as the missing middle.

That’s the gap that exists between home types that are either single, detached houses or towering condos. It’s where semi-detached houses, townhomes, and low-rise and mid-rise buildings are choices for young adults seeking to grow a family or empty nesters who may want to downsize but stay in their neighbourhood.

The problem? Traditional zoning regulations and building policies in the GTA haven’t made it easy to build this kind of housing in the past, even though buyers are seeking it.

“Various folks have used the missing middle as a term in different contexts,” says Bill Gairdner, president of Gairloch Developments in Toronto. “It was meant to describe everything from semi-detached [homes] to townhomes to walk-up apartments to mid-rise, which would be the top of it.”

Rules created more than a century ago to prevent walk-up apartment buildings from encroaching on established residential neighbourhoods in Toronto have not kept pace with the times.

A National Housing Innovation Series hosted by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) and The Globe and Mail last year heard that moving just one per cent of single-family dwellings in Toronto to the “missing middle” segment would result in 44,000 new units, which would be the capacity of 140 new high-rises.

“The missing middle provides different entry points to upsize or downsize,” Gairdner says, who has a passion for creating mid-rise boutique projects in Toronto.

“The more supply that we can deliver in the development industry, the better chances we have to tackle the affordability issue.”

It’s not just the zoning regulations, but also a degree of NIMBY-ism (Not In My Backyard) attitudes in traditional neighbourhoods that prevents the missing middle housing stock to grow.

“My projects are in well-established neighbourhoods or ones that are up-and-coming,” Gairdner says. “You want to make it as easy as possible for developers to acquire land and build the kind of product that people want to live in.”

There are green shoots showing, however, as politicians and policy makers understand that a greater diversity of housing is needed to help Toronto and region advance in a way that expands affordability.

“Basically, you need strong progressive politicians who are confident enough to help advance reasonable mid-rise development, in spite of the fact that their constituents may be objecting to the change with typical NIMBY concerns,” Gairdner says.

American architect Daniel Parolek is credited with launching the term “missing middle” a decade ago. He described it as a range of multi-unit or clustered housing types compatible in scale with single-family homes that help meet the growing demand for walkable urban living.

Gairloch’s 1414 Bayview project is an eight-storey luxury condominium development in Toronto’s Leaside neighbourhood. One month into sales, 20 of the 44 units (one, two and three-bedroom suites with pricing from $650,000) had been sold.

The 1414 Bayview project was designed specifically to fit into the neighbourhood, Gairdner says, and it retains several rental units that expand affordability in accordance with city guidelines.

Another Gairloch condo project, the eight-storey, mid-rise Junction Point with 111 units at 2625 Dundas St. W. is scheduled to break ground in early 2021. Just north of High Park and 20 minutes from downtown, sales are expected to ramp up in September.

While the pandemic has made the sales process slower, prompting one-on-one appointments rather than big sales events, demand remains strong, Gairdner says.

When the Canadian Urban Institute and Evergreen Housing Action Lab examined missing middle housing in Toronto in 2017-18, the resulting report noted that, as rental housing is harder to find, and housing becomes more expensive, younger and middle-aged households have difficulty accessing the ownership market.

The report recommended options to add “gentle” density to Toronto’s neighbourhoods and consider zoning alternatives, as well as options to reduce development costs for mid-rise and other missing middle housing types.

More developers are beginning to add mid-rise development to their portfolios, Gairdner says. “It’s getting more competitive for the missing middle and there are fewer sites in Toronto, so now larger developers are taking on mid-rise projects, whereas before they’d look at the scale being too small.”

The missing middle housing segment is typically not attractive to foreign investors, who might otherwise buy units as investments and hold them or rent them out from afar.

The pandemic has shone a light on urban density, prompting questions about whether now is the time to trade big city living for more wide-open spaces.

“I can see the logic of wanting to escape to the country, but there is the commute situation and you’re still dealing with trains or subway or cars, so there is no silver bullet,” Gairdner says.

“Our business model aligns well with having larger, more customizable units without sharing an elevator with hundreds of people or having six levels of underground parking.”

Looking beyond the city, the 130-home Riverside Estates project by Ambria Homes, situated in the Peterborough area along the picturesque Otonabee River, gives the nod to living in wider spaces. The distance between Toronto and Peterborough is 137 km.

“The project has walking trails, a boat launch, ponds and it’s on the river, so it is a good combination of estate homes and nature,” says Lily Lancia, a management executive at Ambria Homes.

“You can feel like you are part of the landscape.”

Both first-time home buyers and retirees are looking to enjoy a lifestyle beside a river, she says. The pedestrian walkways wind past green spaces and ponds with places to relax and just soak up being in nature.

Trent University, Fleming College and Trillium College are all nearby, as are a full range of education choices in Peterborough.

“People are willing to go a little farther beyond the city for nature, especially given that Highway 407 has been extended and the project is really not that far from Toronto,” Lancia says.

Pet owners are looking for spaces that have all the amenities for their furry companions

With more people owning pets, real estate developers are having to make sure pet-friendly amenities are front and centre when planning projects.

That’s especially true when looking at the millennial generation, the next big wave of condominium buyers. According to a large, recent study by Rover.com, a Seattle-based, international network of pet sitters and dog walkers, traditional family habits are shifting to better cater to such pets as cats and dogs, and that is affecting purchasing decisions such as buying a home.

“With millennials waiting longer to have kids, many are turning to pet parenting, which we’re now seeing is having a major impact on their home-buying decisions,” says Debbie Soon, head of Rover Canada. “We’ve found that 42 per cent of pet parents factor their pets into their home-buying decisions and, with pet ownership growing in Toronto, we only anticipate that number to grow.”

Also according to the study, 40 per cent said pets affect their decisions when it comes to buying a car, and 37 per cent when choosing furniture.

According to Statista, the pet food market in Canada is worth approximately $1.9-billion. The Canadian Animal Health Institute said there were 8.2 million dogs and 8.3 million cats in Canadian households in 2018, with 41 per cent of households having at least one dog and 38 per cent having at least one cat. For developers, that means accommodating pet owners is top of mind.

At Riverbend Estates, a project by Ambria Homes in Peterborough that features grand country manors, homes come with large 70-foot lots. Ponds and walkways are designed in a natural way within the community site plan, creating countless opportunities to enjoy pet-friendly outdoor living.

Accommodating pets is also very much the focus for Menkes Developments through their various projects in and around Toronto, says Mimi Ng, senior vice-president of residential sales and marketing.

“We don’t actively track the number of buyers with pets, but anecdotally I can definitely say that we have noticed an increased number of purchaser enquiries about pet facilities and policies or rules around pets in our projects,” she says.

“Generally speaking, Toronto condo developers have become more cognizant of pet ownership and many are incorporating pet-friendly features and spaces in the design of indoor and outdoor amenity areas.”

Specifically, with their earlier projects, Menkes built basic pet-washing stations, usually situated near the building entrance, so residents could rinse off their dog’s paws.

“Our current projects build on that, with expanded pet-washing facilities, which would be appreciated by anyone who has ever tried bathing a large dog in a condo,” Ng adds, “as well as outdoor dog runs and play spaces.”

In their upcoming Festival condominium community in Vaughan Metropolitan Centre (VMC), there will be a dog park on the outdoor terrace, with play areas and a dog relief zone complete with a fake fire hydrant and drainage infrastructure.

Like with the numerous dog parks that have become such an integral part of downtown Toronto living, these will no doubt become popular places for residents of the building and help to foster a sense of community.

In the end, with these types of amenities, not only will the pets be thankful, but the pet owners will likely be thanking developers as well.

The BC Wildfire Service said crews are responding to the fire on Christie Mountain about six kilometres north of the community of Okanagan Falls, on the east side of Skaha Lake.

The fire is estimated at 250 hectares and firefighters on the ground are being supported by air tankers.

The service said the situation was ""rapidly evolving"" and asked everyone to stay clear of the area to avoid interfering with the operation.

The order asks residents of the Heritage Hills area to leave with pets and critical items.

""We anticipate we will see further growth once we are able to get a more accurate track of the fire,"" the service said in a tweet.

The fire is among dozens the BC Wildfire Service is fighting but was the only one upgraded to a ""fire of note"" on Tuesday.

Ten wildfires in the Pemberton area north of Whistler were burning but not threatening any properties, the service said.

A 10-hectare fire southeast of Lillooet, B.C., was smouldering with no open flame but was considered out of control. The service suspects it was human caused, unlike most of the others.

Ground crews, air tankers and helicopters attacked it Monday and multiple crews and heavy equipment stopped it from growing overnight.

Twenty-two firefighters and one helicopter remained on site Tuesday.

Firefighters have tackled dozens of wildfires after weekend thunderstorms left a trail of hot spots.

Figures from the service show that among 109 active fires in the province, 95 were started in the last few days.

Most are burning in the southeast district, where the service says crews have been battling 25 fires primarily around the Arrow and Kootenay lake regions.

Two fires were visible from Canal Flats and Wasa, north of Cranbrook.

Hot, dry weather has been a key factor in the new fires and most were caused by lightning.

Crews are assessing all of the fires by ground and air and will continue to strategically fight the fires, the service said.

The daycare operator could not be reached to comment on whether the delay in opening the doors was due to the residential tenancy dispute, but the landlord says that’s the case.
A daycare is zoned for residential use, not commercial use, so it has just as much right to the common spaces as other tenants, Cox said.
He said prior to leasing to the daycare, the common spaces were hardly used by tenants.
He offered to cover the moving costs and the tenant’s rent would remain the same even if the unit was slightly more expensive.","The laughs and cries of children playing is the source of a dispute between tenants of a downtown rental building and their landlord.

Some tenants of a 134-unit purpose-built rental building on the corner of Cook Street and Pandora Avenue are upset that a new daycare, set to open next month, will take over some of their common space during weekdays and are worried about the noise of children playing on playgrounds. The landlord says the daycare is part of his goal of creating a family-friendly rental building in a city where new child-care spaces are desperately needed.

A recent residential tenancy board decision was split down the middle, finding that sharing the common space does not impinge on the tenants’ ability to live in their suite, but that the landlord did not give proper notice or a rent reduction to the tenants about the new restrictions to the common areas.

Danica Jeffery and her five-year-old son have lived in a two-bedroom apartment at 1488 Cook St. for two years, drawn by the fact that the 13-storey building is pet-friendly and has a large sun deck on the 11th floor and a playground just steps away. Jeffery pays $2,100-a-month in rent for a second-floor apartment.

Jeffery said she’s fine that a daycare has moved into the building’s 4,400-square foot commercial space on the ground floor, but she’s upset that, for six hours a day Monday to Friday, kids will be playing on equipment that takes up a large chunk of the second floor and 11th- floor common patio spaces. “It’s 100 per cent unnecessary that [the daycare] has use of residential common areas,” she said.

Jeffery, a communications specialist in her early 40s, works from home. She worries that when groups of kids are in the playground, she’ll have to keep her windows closed and blinds drawn to get peace and privacy.

“It will be a constant stream of fresh lungs, yelling and laughing, and that’s great, but not right outside my home,” she said. Maple Tree Children’s Centre, which signed a 10-year lease for the 76-space daycare, was expected to open in July, but its opening has been delayed to September. The daycare operator could not be reached to comment on whether the delay in opening the doors was due to the residential tenancy dispute, but the landlord says that’s the case.

Mands Burnette, who lives on the second floor with her husband, Andrew Poucher, and their six-year-old son, Arlo, said she’s upset by the lack of consultation with tenants about the daycare.

During parent tours of the daycare and construction of new fencing, there was a steady stream of people passing by her patio windows, taking away her privacy, she said.

“We’re all reasonable people, we all get it, I don’t think anyone has a problem with the daycare occupying the commercial space,” said Burnette, 36. “It’s good that Victoria is having more daycare spaces, but I don’t think using the residential spaces is good for anybody.”

Both tenants say they’re in the dark about the daycare’s COVID-19 safety practices, such as where parents will pick up and drop off, and whether they will use the elevators.

Landlord Steven Cox of Cox Developments said he did not anticipate the backlash to renting the ground-floor commercial space to a daycare or letting the daycare use the second- and 11th-floor common spaces as play areas. “I love families. I love kids laughing. To me that’s the most beautiful sound in the world. So it kind of shocked me that young people would be so concerned,” he said.

Standing next to the building’s giant chalkboard where tenants can leave messages and kids can doodle, Cox said he wanted to design a rental building focused on families. He estimates there are 30 kids living in the building.

Cox said the people living closest to the play areas have a “legitimate beef,” but he’s asking tenants to wait until the daycare opens to make a judgment on noise. “I don’t think a bunch of four-year-olds will be that noisy,” said Cox, noting he had three boys who are now adults.

A daycare is zoned for residential use, not commercial use, so it has just as much right to the common spaces as other tenants, Cox said. He said prior to leasing to the daycare, the common spaces were hardly used by tenants. Cox has plans to add an outdoor barbecue and more seating to the patio areas so, he said, the common areas will be enhanced, not diminished.

Burnette and five other tenants filed a dispute with the Residential Tenancy Branch, arguing that they weren’t given proper notice about the daycare and that they should be given a rent reduction for losing access to common spaces when the daycare is in operation.

Burnette surveyed tenants about the daycare and said of 44 who replied, a majority expressed concerns about potential noise and lack of consultation.

According to the Residential Tenancy Act, a landlord may restrict a service such as a common area as long as they give 30 days’ written notice and reduce the rent in an amount equivalent to the reduction in value of losing such service. In a July 30 decision, the arbitrator found that the tenants continue to have access to the common spaces when they’re not being used by the daycare.

“I find that the landlord’s restriction on the tenants’ access to these common areas does not make it impossible or impractical for the tenants to use their rental units as a living accommodation,” the arbitrator wrote. “Should the landlord wish to continue with their intent to restrict the facilities, they are still required to ensure that the tenants’ right to quiet enjoyment is not impacted.”

The arbitrator found that the landlord’s written notice on June 3 about the daycare was not given on the approved form. Cox reissued the notice form at the end of July and gave tenants a rent reduction of between $15 and $30 a month depending on how close they are to the playground.

Cox said he has tried to accommodate any tenants who are upset, offering to move them to another unit farther away from the play areas. He offered to cover the moving costs and the tenant’s rent would remain the same even if the unit was slightly more expensive.

Burnette said she declined the offer to move to another suite because she would have to sign a 13-month lease. She’s now on a month-to-month lease which allows her to move if the noise from the daycare is too much.

Jeffery said as a single mother, she can’t afford to move to another building if the daycare proves too disruptive. “I just feel like my hands are tied and I just have to sit down and suffer.”

Cox has urged tenants to be patient and said if there are any issues after the daycare opens, he will address them. “I honestly don’t think anyone is going to be hurt by it. I hope this building gets a reputation of being a family-friendly building.”

Burnette and Jeffery both expect they’ll be back before the Residential Tenancy Branch again if their fears around noise are realized.

“If I pass 80 I’m going to call it Nudging 90.”kderosa@timescolonist.com","Anne Patton, 78, has done more things in the last year than most people have done in a lifetime. She endured -40C temperatures while dog sledding in Churchill, Man., trudged through waist-deep snow while snowshoeing, zoomed across a zip line and glided across — and fell into — a calm lake while stand-up paddle boarding.

Her list of adventures will unfold over the next two years as the Saanich-based children’s author aims to do 80 new things before she turns 80. Her personal project, dubbed “Embracing Eighty” and chronicled on her Facebook page, is about getting the most out of life and staying young at heart.

“I figure that as long as you’re living on this earth, you should be alive,” said Patton, who moved to Victoria with her husband in 2011 after a long career as an elementary school teacher in Regina. “My idea as a teacher was to instill passion for life. I want to be an example of living in the moment and enjoying the moment.”

Patton was inspired by a fellow writer who was trying 60 new things before she turned 60. Patton started last year just after her 77th birthday. “I thought to myself: ‘If I’m doing 80 things, I better start now.’ “

Many of the activities are done with her grandsons Seamus, 12, and Jasper, 10, who have watched her pull crabs from a crab trap, float in the ocean on a giant swan and traverse a metal tight rope and rope ladders while harnessed high up in the trees at the aerial adventure park Wild Play.

Patton doesn’t have a set list of 80 things, she’s just embracing experiences as they come to her. And she’s open to suggestions.

Some of her plans, for example taking a hot air balloon ride or going on a Segway tour, have been scuttled because of COVID-19 travel restrictions.

“I was planning to go to Scotland, you know, have some far out adventures, but I’m stuck here on the Island,” she joked. Nonetheless, new adventures seem to find her, often unexpectedly. During a family trip to Cowichan Bay in July, Patton told the on-site manager of her rented beach house that she was running out of ideas for her project.

His first suggestions — skydiving and bungy — were quickly shot down by Patton, who says she has her limits.

“He said, ‘oh, well how about a Harley Davidson ride?’ Well, that sounded so tame in comparison to skydiving that I said ‘oh sure.’ “

Patton worried she didn’t have “any of the right clothes to look bad ass.”

The man’s wife stepped in and outfitted Patton in black leather boots, a black motorcycle jacket and black helmet. “I looked like Darth Vader and sounded like him too.”

Patton jumped on the back of the Harley and was whisked away to Bowser and back. She pitched the idea of carrying on to Port Hardy but her escort had to get back to work.

Patton’s friends told her she was crazy when she said she wanted to go to Churchill, Man. in early March. Undeterred, she ticked off at least six adventures up there, including snowshoeing, dog sledding, and visiting Sloop Cove where 18th century Hudson’s Bay fur traders etched their names into some of the Earth’s oldest bedrock. There, she describes giant ice ridges pushed up by the tide “like grotesque sea monsters trying to crawl out from under the water.”

That sheltered nook on the west side of the Churchill River will be one of the settings in Patton’s upcoming young adult novel about the forced evictions of people living in the Scottish Highlands, called the Highland Clearances, beginning in the mid-18th century.

Patton said her spontaneity and try-it-all-once attitude keep her young and close to her five grandchildren, aged 12 to 21.

“They’re young, spunky people. I don’t want to look like an old fogey. I want to be someone they remember fondly.”

Patton hopes that after she dies, her grandkids will laugh as they share memories and say: “Remember how crazy Nana was?”

Patton turns 80 on March 1, 2022. She’s not worried if she doesn’t find 80 things by then.

She figures she’ll have to keep going anyways because she wants to see the solar eclipse which is set for October 2023. “If I pass 80 I’m going to call it Nudging 90.”

Pandher, who lives near Whitehorse, has been dancing and travelling his way across Vancouver Island over the past week trying to spread a message of positivity during COVID-19.

""(The pandemic) created a lot of pressure and stresses. Some people are sharing it, some people are not, but everybody is feeling it ... I'd like to say be happy, be hopeful, even though it's hard,"" Pandher said in an interview.

He rose to fame with a series of viral videos showcasing his bhangra skills, dancing alongside members of the Canadian Armed Forces, local politicians and first responders.

Bhangra is a lively form of dance to music, originating from the Punjab region in India and characterized by leaps, kicks and arm movement.

""Bhangra has a lot of elements of positivity and happiness, and it's very high-energy,"" Pandher said. ""It's a workout dance, it's a happy dance, it brings people together.""

Pandher has been practising bhangra most of his life, punctuated by small breaks every now and then, but he's recently turned it into a full-time job, teaching it online to help those feeling cooped up due to the pandemic.

""Many professionals, doctors, high commissioners, politicians, they were taking these classes. I was quite touched,"" he said.

Yukon imposed COVID-19 border restrictions when the pandemic first hit, but opened its border to B.C. in July, prompting a vacation idea from Pandher.

""Vancouver Island is kind of like the Yukon. It's known for its wilderness, its natural beauty, the people and also the great thing is that both areas are remote,"" he said, clarifying that while not as remote as Yukon, Vancouver Island still had an ocean separating it from its mainland neighbours.

That separation was part of the reason for the holiday choice, as Pandher believes it helps protect it from COVID-19 outbreaks.

It's not the dance instructor's first visit to the island.

He previously visited the Canadian Armed Forces base in Esquimalt, leading 15 members in a bhangra session.

He said he's been stopped and visited by fans during this most recent trip, with a particular highlight being a visit and dance session with firefighters in Nanaimo and an attempt to surf at Tofino.

""It's just like dancing bhangra,"" Pander said of surfing. ""In bhangra you need to co-ordinate a lot of movements to put it together — same with surfing: balance, co-ordination — and just being on the beach and in the water was awesome.""

Pandher is scheduled to leave B.C. on Sunday but hopes to come back again in the future.

One of the most important milestones in the growth of a grape vine is taking place in vineyards across the country and throughout the northern hemisphere. Véraison is when the vine turns its energy to ripening the grape clusters. Prior to this transformation, grapes are hard, green, and bitter. In a few months, they’ll be ripe and ready.

It’s hard to miss véraison’s effect on the vines as the grapes grow in size, soften and change colour. Berries in red wine varieties shift from green to purple, while white wine selections turn yellow-green or golden. The fruit of all grape varieties will transform into something more sweet, aromatic and pleasant to taste.

Aided by warm, sunny and dry weather, véraison can start in some regions as early as July.

In the wine-growing areas of Ontario and British Columbia, it’s just under way. From this point, it can take a month or two until the grapes are ready to harvest for wine production. The time from véraison to harvest differs for each grape variety, depending on how much sun and warmth they require to fully ripen.

Sparkling wine producers in the Napa Valley received their first grapes last week, marking an early start to that region’s 2020 harvest. Grapes for sparkling wine are harvested with higher acidity levels, which helps create the desired crisp and refreshing style of wine. Grapes for Napa’s famous cabernet sauvignons and chardonnays remain on the vine.

Elsewhere, véraison is a signal to winemakers to gear up for harvest.

By the time véraison is nearly complete, grape growers can see which clusters are lagging behind. Those clusters are often removed to promote more even ripening and ensure the remaining bunches receive as many nutrients and sugars from the vine as possible.

Growers may also decide to trim leaves off of the vine to expose the fruit to more sunlight, which aids ripening.

Usually one of the most anticipated times of year in the vineyard, véraison comes with its own unique set of challenges in 2020. Many vineyards face decisions that go beyond ensuring ripe grapes and wine quality this year.

Story continues below advertisement

Mounting economic uncertainty in the wake of lost sales and marketing opportunities due to the pandemic has led to cancellations of grape contracts in Canada and beyond. The grape glut in California and throughout the European Union has only gotten worse due to COVID-19.

Many wineries are cutting back production to manage inventory issues. So-called “crisis distillation” is being practiced in France and elsewhere to reduce the surplus of wine. There are a number of grapes on the vine that don’t have a buyer in place and are looking for a home.

Canadian growers and wineries also face added pressure after having lost a federal tax exemption that was challenged by Australia at the World Trade Organization. Australia successfully argued the excise exception for Canadian wine producers was a trade restriction to wines made down under. As a result, there’s an expected 50-cent per bottle price increase to Canadian wines as of June 30, 2022. That’s right around the time many of the best wines made this year will start appearing on shelves.

One fire crew from Saanich’s Vernon Avenue fire station currently operates out of the recreational centre.

The District of Saanich said it hopes to work with community partners to offer alternate services for youth in the Tillicum neighbourhood in the fall.

“We are well aware of the impact the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent social and physical isolation has had on youth in the community,” said Chris Filler, youth programmer for the municipality. “Teens are disproportionately affected by the social impact of COVID-19 and as a result of the disruption to school, social connections, music, art and sport routines, youth have had a hard time connecting with each other as well as meeting their own needs of self-care and well-being.”

Other recreation centres offering youth programs include the Upside Teen Centre at Saanich Commonwealth Place and the Backdoor Teen Centre at Gordon Head Recreation Centre.

Programs including Red Cross babysitting, judo, pottery, home alone, Aikido and some organized sports. In addition, the Backdoor Teen Centre offers specialty programming such as an outdoor club, LGBTQ2+ social program and crafters club.

West Shore RCMP arrested one person who were taken to the station to sober up and on Sunday nabbed an impaired driver after bylaw officers saw the person stumbling to the parking lot.

View Royal Fire Chief Paul Hurst said the main measure of success is that there were no calls for services relating to injuries in the park.

“This was a proactive initiative instead of a reactive measure,” Hurst said. “Having all three agencies there was a success.”

Don Brown, the CRD’s chief bylaw officer, said the focus was on educating people about the rules and preventing people from doing risky things like cliff jumping while intoxicated.

Bylaw officers issued 12 written warnings, mostly for smoking or having open alcohol, and handed out four bylaw tickets for open alcohol.

Having View Royal Fire’s zodiac patrol the water was a major deterrent for people thinking of risky behaviour, Brown said.

Brown said many families thanked the officers for patrolling and keeping the park safe. West Shore RCMP said Friday they will be working with CRD bylaw officers and View Royal Fire to patrol popular parks for the rest of the summer.

Hurst said there were hundreds of people in the water on Sunday, despite the CRD’s advisory that people and animals shouldn’t swim because of a blue-green algae bloom. The poisonous algae bloom produces cyanotoxins which can be lethal to dogs if ingested and for humans can results in symptoms such as headaches and abdominal pain.

Brown said people in the water were warned about the health impacts of the blue-green algae.

Hurst has been calling for enhanced safety measures at the park after a series of concerning calls in July, including one involving an unconscious and apparently intoxicated person on a trail and another where a man who was drinking injured himself while jumping from a cliff into the lake.

“The obvious concern we have is the alcohol consumption coupled with jumping off the cliffs,” he said. “Those two behaviours don’t go well together.”

Hurst has suggested closing the back side of the park in the summer months to prevent people from cliff jumping, or even sending the emergency response bill to intoxicated or careless people who injure themselves while jumping.

“Currently there’s nothing prohibiting people from jumping off the cliffs other than common sense,” he said. “Why is it the responsibility for the View Royal taxpayer to foot the bill for people who are making conscious bad decisions? These are conscious decisions to put yourself in harms way.”

Hurst said once the summer is over, he will meet with CRD officials to talk about longer term safety strategies for Thetis Lake Regional Park. According to CRD statistics, Thetis Lake has become increasingly busy with 500,000 visits to the park in 2018 compared to 350,000 in 2010.

When I was a girl, my brother and I spent the last few weeks of our summer vacation with my grandmother who lived in a small town south of Montreal. By mid-August, I’m sure most other kids were thinking about going back to school. But at Grandma’s house, all I could think about was corn – sweet, crunchy corn.

The town was surrounded by cornfields, and by that time of the year, the stalks were “as high as an elephant’s eye,” to borrow the famous lyric from Oscar Hammerstein.

My family ate corn at other times of the year but it came from the freezer or a can. In August, we got to eat corn in its perfect form – freshly picked, boiled and eaten right off the cob.

Story continues below advertisement

During the short corn season, my grandma would often drive us around to the farm stands at the edge of the fields where she would carefully inspect a few ears. Any more than a few hours off the stalk, and she would declare the corn too “old” to eat. But if she approved of what was available, we would pack three, four or five-dozen cobs (or more) into big paper bags. The amount depended on how many relatives would be joining us for the feast to come.

Corn on the cob brought our family together in a way no other food could. It was also a lot of fun to eat.

Back at the house, my great-grandmother, who was in her early 90s at the time, would be waiting in the kitchen to bring several huge pots of water to a boil. My brother and I had the job of shucking the corn. Cousins, aunts and uncles who lived nearby would start to arrive as we sat on the steps of the back porch violently separating husks from cobs then carefully removing the silk. If I discovered a live worm wiggling between the kernels, I’d squeal in horror. This usually brought an adult to the screen door, a bottle of beer or Coke in hand, to check on our progress. If we were working too slowly, they’d come out to help.

Once the shucking was done and the corn was boiled, we were ready to eat. Grandma brought big plates piled high with steaming cobs to the kitchen table, set simply with two large blocks of butter and shakers of salt. We all sat tightly together, elbow to elbow. Sometimes, if there were too many of us, I’d have to sit on an adult’s lap. Back then, we could never have imagined the need for physical distancing.

The wait for the cobs to cool enough to grasp with my hands was almost unbearable, but my family were purists. We would never think of using those silly little yellow cob-shaped plastic forks. There is nothing more satisfying than gripping the real thing between your fingers.

When the corn had cooled, everyone fought for their turn at the salt and butter. Then there was a kind of hush as everyone took their first bite. There was an urgency to our enjoyment. Each of us was aware, I think, that eating sweet corn this fresh was a glorious but fleeting pleasure.

Eating corn on the cob is messy business. That was another thing that made it special. I could eat with my hands, my fingers crusted in salt and my face flecked with kernels, and nobody scolded me about table manners.

After the first round of cobs had been devoured, everyone began to relax. We’d race each other to see who could finish a cob first. We’d debate about the correct way to eat corn on the cob. Do you spin the cob like a wheel, gnawing around the circumference? Or do you run your teeth back and forth, like an old typewriter, nibbling the kernels horizontally? Even my usually stern great-grandmother, with butter glistening on her chin, grinned like a kid.

The conversation during these meals was always lively. The adults would compare the quality of the current year’s crop with previous harvests. This inevitably led to family stories from the past like how, as children, Grandma and Aunt Ilene accidentally ran over Uncle Bernie with the horse and buggy on their way to school one day. Another favourite was one about an unfortunate cat that got killed when a bolt of lightning shot straight through the old farmhouse from the front to the back screen door during a summer storm.

Although I believed them completely at the time, I know now that these stories had only a kernel of truth to them – pardon the pun. Listening to my family try to outdo each other with exaggerated tales taught me that the veracity of some stories is not as important as the enthusiasm put into telling them to entertain the people you love.

I have no idea how many cobs we actually ate in one sitting, but there were rarely more than a few left over. Eventually, we’d haul ourselves up from the table and head to the front porch of the house. In a state of happy lethargy, we quietly enjoyed the warm, gentle dusk that settles over Quebec’s Eastern Townships in late summer.

I moved away from that part of the country a long time ago. Many of the corn-eaters I sat with around my grandma’s kitchen table are gone now. But, every year around this time, when the corn is high in the fields, I remember what they taught me. Savour the end of summer. Enthusiastically devour the bounty it brings. And never, ever eat corn on the cob alone.

Ottawa is an active city that takes four-seasons outdoor fun as seriously as its love for lively local arts and culture, excellent restaurants and craft brewing.

Ottawa resident Andrew Szeto is passionate about Ottawa’s sports and recreation scene. It’s just so easy for locals and visitors to be active in the city, he says. In summer, he can often be found canoeing on the waters around Ottawa, using one of the stunning hand-crafted paddles he makes.

While visitors from other cities may have to endure long drives to reach hiking trails and dedicated cycling paths back home, so many things that truly elevate an active getaway can be done either right in walkable Ottawa, or within a short drive.

It’s hard to be bored in and around New Brunswick’s historic capital city. Located just a foot trail away from the great outdoors, Fredericton offers a wide range of ways to spend a day with the whole family. Home to the highest number of craft brewers per capita in Canada, you’re just as likely to stumble upon a museum or market as you are a microbrewery in this east coast town. And with the Radisson Kingswood Hotel & Suites so close to the action of the city, kicking back and relaxing has never been easier.

Here are seven ways to spend your next vacation in Fredericton.

Shop local food, art and more

Thanks to its lively arts scene and proximity to organic farms, Fredericton is renowned for its many markets. The iconic Boyce Farmers Market, the Food Market at the Ex and the newly relocated Cultural Market are all open for business with social distancing regulations in place. Launched in 2020, the ECO Market promotes sustainable living with environmentally-conscious arts, crafts and fresh produce. The city is also filled with galleries dedicated to Canadian artwork and products, such as Gallery on Queen and the Beaverbrook Art Gallery.

Find fun for the family, indoors and out

Fredericton is home to an expansive 120 kilometre network of hiking and biking trails, 20 kilometres of which surround sandy beach and tranquil lake at Killarney Lake Park. Step out for a hike with the kids or float down the Nashwaak River on an inner-tube with Nashwaak Tubing. Go on an aerial adventure course, available for all skill levels, at Treego in Mactaquac. Or, spend a family day at Kingswood Entertainment Centre, the largest indoor entertainment facility in Atlantic Canada with 30 lanes of bowling, laser tag and arcade games (social distancing guidelines and meticulous cleaning procedures are in place to ensure safety.)

Golf on some of New Brunswick’s best greens

Named the best new golf course in Canada by Golf Digest in 2003, Kingswood Golf Course continues to rank as one of the county’s best courses and is a destination in itself. This award-winning 27-hole golf course designed by Darrell Huxham and Graham Cooke attracts golfers from around the world to its magnificent greens. “Masterfully bunkered, with wide-open fairways, Kingswood focuses on its unique surroundings utilizing the natural rock outcroppings and marshlands, which creates a challenge for the expert player without being overly taxing on the novice,” says Chris Billings, Kingswood’s director of golf.

Living up to Fredericton’s reputation as “Atlantic Canada’s Brewing Capital,” the hotel’s Bistro Brew Lounge offers a wide selection of local Maritime brews on tap, including their own signature cider, the BBL Pomegranate. Radisson Kingswood has special travel packages available, including a “Stay and Play for Two” golf getaway, which includes overnight accommodations, breakfast and green fees for two. New Brunswick residents can apply for an additional 20 per cent rebate as part of the Explore NB Travel Incentive program.

Indulge in Atlantic Canada’s best eats

You can’t go wrong dining out in Fredericton. At 11th mile, chef Peter Tompkins and wife Jennie Wilson showcase their Maritime roots through an ever-changing menu of down-home twists on globally-inspired sharing plates and delicious cocktails. The Cabin Restaurant is a roadside institution and the best place to get a classic diner-style lobster roll. Sam Snead’s Oak Grill and Tavern at the Kingswood Lodge is a go-to culinary destination for foodies and golfers alike, thanks to its open flame wood grill. The only Sam Snead’s location in Canada, it’s located inside the Kingswood Golf Course and is consistently ranked as one of the city’s top restaurants.

Pour down a pint (or three)

Well-known as a craft beer hub, Fredericton has something for just about every brew-lover. As the microbrewery that put the city on the map, The Picaroons Roundhouse is a must-visit for British-style ales. Or, try the New England Cider at the hip Queen Street location of Red Rover Cider, the first cider house in the province. Pair brews with wood-fired pizzas on the spacious patio at RustiCo and King West Brewing, or try the weekly rotating experimental cask at Trailway Brewing on the north side of the city. Microbrewery enthusiasts can challenge themselves to take the Fredericton Taproom Trail, which features stops at 11 of the city’s celebrated craft beer producers.

The CRD is developing new management plans for East Sooke and a joint plan for Roche Cove and Matheson Lake, which are in close proximity.

As part of initial engagement, the CRD said the surveys will help CRD Regional Parks gather background information on how members use the parks.

CRD is also seeking input from First Nations, government agencies and stakeholder groups.

“These plans will provide strategic and specific management direction and will guide environmental conservation, cultural heritage management, visitor use and park development over the next 15 to 20 years,” the CRD said in a statement.

Matheson Lake Regional Park is a 156-hectare property in Metchosin acquired in 1994. It features the lake and small beach, forested hills and several kilometres of trails.

Roche Cove Regional Park was established in 1985 and comprises 162 hectares around a sheltered cove in the Sooke Basin. The park has trails through cedar forests, along Matheson Creek and to mossy hilltops.

East Sooke Regional Park, established in 1970, is the third largest park in CRD system at 1,457 hectares.

One of the fires on Mount Healy grew to about eight hectares overnight and is listed as “out of control” by the B.C. Wildfire Service. However, a statement by the Capital Regional District on Tuesday morning said the fire was about 40 per cent contained.

“It is anticipated that the fire will be 100 per cent contained [Tuesday afternoon] as it is exhausting its fuel source,” the CRD said.

Lightning strikes Sunday night, after days of extreme heat, sparked more a dozen fires on the South Island. High temperatures and steady winds continue today and more resources have been added to fight the fires.

The CRD said the other fire, near Horton Lake, is in an isolated area and is approaching about five hectares in size.

Aircraft dropped fire retardant and water over the most of the day on Monday and are continuing today.

At least seven skimmer aircraft are filling pontoons on Shawnigan Lake and helicopters with water buckets arebeing used.

The CRD said ground crews were hiking in this morning to set up a containment perimeter.

A fire control specialist from the B.C. Wildfire Management Branch is the commander on the fires and is working with the CRD’s watershed protection wildfire staff.

The CRD said there are 18 CRD watershed protection staff and two water tanker trucks working on containing the Mount Healey wildfire.

“It appears that the nature of the terrain and fuels in the area should reduce the potential for further spread,” the CRD said.

The B.C. Wildfire Management Branch has committed two 20-person crews, 16 contract firefighters and four helicopters with water buckets to the fire today. Provincial staff will be working on both fires. The focus of the helicopter water drops will be on preventing the spread of the fire near Horton Lake.

The CRD said there is no impact to operations or water quality at this time.

However, because the fires have burned areas in the catchment of Sooke Lake Reservoir, CRD staff have started preparations for an assessment of impacts and erosion potential after the fires have been suppressed and are developing plans for minimizing any post-wildfire erosion this winter.

With communities on Haida Gwaii adapting to increased travel restrictions after a recent COVID-19 outbreak, staycations have taken on a new importance in the remote islands. The 20-person outbreak is believed to have occurred after residents who travelled off-island returned home. So now, in addition to new provincial restrictions banning all visitors to Haida Gwaii, Carla Lutner, chief operations officer of the Gwaii Trust Society, says local leadership is encouraging residents to stay on Haida Gwaii whenever possible.

To help, the Gwaii Trust is offering up to $250 in grants for Haida and residents of Haida Gwaii (Haidagwaii’an) for staycation expenses. “The grant helps locals explore and provides assistance for local tourism businesses,” says Lutner.

Lutner says the grants have been well received. They’ve also provided some much-needed distraction on the hard-hit islands. “A popular topic of conversation is people asking each other, ‘What are you going to do with your staycation money?’” she says.

Families can pool their money, and so far requests for the funds have ranged from cabin rentals on North Beach to cultural tours in Gwaii Haanas to fishing charters for entire families.

A Tourism Industry Association of Canada report predicts that without further support, some 61,000 tourism businesses in Canada, or 57 per cent, are projected to fail, putting 1.66 million Canadians out of work. To stem the losses, government programs have been offering emergency wage subsidies and other grants. Meanwhile, professional organizations have been teaching tourism businesses enhanced cleaning techniques and offering marketing tips to entice locals. But there’s still a need to find innovative ways to get people out exploring safely and spending money locally.

New Brunswick recently announced a $3-million staycation rebate program for residents. The province’s grant encourages locals to stay and spend in nearby communities, and offers a 20-per-cent rebate of up to $1,000 per person. Eligible expenses include travel costs like fuel and car rentals; accommodation including hotels, motels, inns, B&Bs and campsites; restaurant meals; and activities like museum fees and outdoor tours.

Local travel must include a paid overnight stay in the province up to Sept. 30. According to a statement by Tourism, Heritage and Culture Minister Bruce Fitch, “the rebate will not only encourage New Brunswickers to travel and discover the natural beauty and diversity of the province,” but support tourism businesses when they need it the most.

PEI is also exploring ideas that will spur in-province travel. Internationally, Ireland has recently announced its own program. Ireland’s staycation voucher offers citizens a refund of 20 per cent on restaurant and hotel bills in the form of a tax credit. The rebate, which begins in October and is expected to run until April, 2021, is good for individual expenses up to €625 (with the rebate worth up to €125, or roughly $195), and double that for couples. Regionally, 56,000 households in Kerry are receiving an additional €100 that can be used for a range of registered county accommodations, in an effort to keep them even closer to home.

James Cowpar, co-owner of Haida Style Expeditions, which specializes in cultural adventure tours, says for businesses, the $250 individual grants are a lifeline. The Indigenous-owned company, which normally hosts travellers from around the world on its daily tours, had been expecting a banner season. Instead, as trips were cancelled and deposits returned, the company initially fell through the cracks of the federal stimulus funding.

Now, Cowpar says they hope to run two to three tours a week for August and September. “The benefits will help to keep local businesses alive, and will give people an opportunity to visit Gwaii Haanas and enjoy outdoor recreation,” he says.

Destinations that don’t have financial incentives to encourage locals to visit are still hoping travellers bust out their travel savings and splurge on local experiences.

Maya Lange, vice-president of marketing at Destination BC, says local support is going to be crucial to the long-term survival of many tourism businesses: “When you support tourism businesses, you support your friends, families and neighbours, and the small businesses that make up the foundation of our industry.”

Equally important, says Lange, is the fact that tourism businesses contribute to a region’s identity. “Tourism plays a positive role in preserving, sharing and celebrating the rich culture and history of B.C.‘s diverse communities and people,” she says. “Think about the things we enjoy that would not be as viable without the tourism engine: museums and galleries; festivals and sports events; air, highway and coastal transportation; dining and wine touring; and parks and recreational facilities.”

An essential building block for many classic cocktails, from martinis to manhattans, vespers to negronis, vermouth continues to enjoy a welcome resurgence. It’s such a staple for mixology that it’s easy to overlook that it doesn’t need to be mixed with other spirits at all.

Traditionally produced in Italy and France, vermouth is made from wine that’s been fortified with neutral grape spirit (unaged brandy) and bottled between 16 and 18 per cent alcohol. Its real character, however, comes from flavour enhancement by various herbs, botanicals and spices, and whether it’s made in dry (typically white) or sweet styles (red or white).

Story continues below advertisement

Mildly bitter red vermouth is usually sweet and more closely associated with Italy: Carpano Antica Formula represents the high end, while Cinzano Rouge and Martini & Rossi hold forth as brand champions. Floral and fragrant white vermouth was popularized by French brands, such as Dolin and Noilly Prat.

Eight innovative spirits to up your summer mixology game

Purists would insist that I explain how the honeyed and citrus-flavoured Lillet Blanc, the fortified wine brand made popular by James Bond’s Vesper Martini order from Casino Royale, isn’t technically vermouth. It contains citrus liqueur and doesn’t include wormwood, which is one of vermouth’s key botanicals and the inspiration for its name. Wormwood in German is “wermut.”

The cocktail boom and rise of craft distilling has created room for an increasing array of vermouths and other wine-based apéritifs to come to market. New and more strongly flavoured styles, including barrel-fermented examples as well as rosé expressions, have joined the ranks and added greater variety for mixologists and consumers to appreciate and explore. Because of the wide assortment of botanicals and selection of wines used in production, vermouth comes in a range of styles based on the producer’s recipe.

In Italy, Spain and France, traditionalists enjoy vermouth served chilled, on the rocks or with soda water with a twist of orange or lemon. (Having occasionally reached for the wrong can in haste, I can attest tonic water works, too.) That’s how I propose you embrace vermouth as summer rolls into fall.

Keep it simple. Keep the bottle in the fridge. (That’s always good practice as vermouth starts to oxidize after a month’s time). Leave mixing cocktails for another day.

Over the years, I can safely say I’ve had every kind of wine opener in my possession. For a tool that’s built for one purpose, there is an incredible variety of designs that range in price from cheap to extravagant.

A few models were prized for their ease of use, a couple were most effective for a specific task – say, opening older wines with a natural cork – and countless others have been passed along to students, family and friends or seized at the airport, having been forgotten in carry-on luggage over the years.

Aging well: These eight wines are here for a good time or, should you choose, a long time

The best corkscrew is whichever style you’re comfortable with. I’m not fond of electric corkscrews, but know how essential they can be for wine lovers with arthritis or limited hand strength.

For ease of use, many look to the wing or winged style devices. Lever models are even simpler to handle – two swift motions: worm goes in, cork pulls out – but are a significant investment.

A number of family members and friends swear by their continuous pull corkscrews, popularized by the Screwpull brand, which is now sold as Le Creuset. These call for a bit of pressure and clockwise turns that drive the worm into the cork and gently remove it. They are pricey, but really effective. I’ve given a number of these as gifts over the years.

The two-pronged cork extractor, which goes by the name Ah-So or butler’s thief, is a specialized piece of equipment. Its best use is for opening aged wines. There’s no worm, just two thin blades that you wiggle back and forth down the neck of the wine bottle before pulling the cork up. They’re not for the faint of heart, as it’s easy to push the cork into the wine by mistake.

If I had to single out one essential model, I’d default to a double-lever waiter’s friend corkscrew. These are the industry standard for good reason. Durable. Affordable. Functional. Pulltap’s or Koala are the brands to look for. Knock-off versions tend to break easily.

It may take you a few attempts to get the hang of it, but once perfected that technique will serve you for life. Widely available for less than $20, these corkscrews last and free up your disposable income to spend on what really matters – bottles of wine to open and enjoy.

“You’re going where? In February? At your age?”

Friends’ voices rang with disbelief when I announced plans for my first-ever solo holiday – a two-and-a-half-week jaunt from balmy Victoria to snowbound Churchill, Man. I listened to dire pronouncements about vicious polar bears, frigid temperatures, shut-down tourist facilities and expensive air-ambulance evacuation.

Story continues below advertisement

Having thoroughly researched my trip, I shared none of these qualms. I explained that polar bears are not skulking around town in February. They are far out on Hudson Bay, hunting seals on the ice. In late winter, the average temperature in Churchill is -20 C, familiar to me after 45 years on the Saskatchewan Prairies. February/March is the aurora borealis season, so services would be open for tourists. Not as many as summertime but, on the plus side, there wouldn’t be black flies or mosquitoes.

“At your age?” There was only one answer to this rebuke: “I won’t be younger next year.” I have embarked on a campaign called “Embracing 80,” doing 80 new things before I reach that venerable age. The occasion of my 78th birthday seemed an ideal time to visit Churchill. And just in case – Churchill has comprehensive hospital facilities.

Besides, this was a research trip. I’m writing a novel about Scottish Highlanders evicted from their land in 1813 and forced to immigrate to the New World. Unforeseen circumstances caused them to spend the winter near the small Hudson’s Bay Company (HBC) outpost at the mouth of the Churchill River. Obviously, I needed to experience Churchill in winter to fully imagine their ordeal. This argument convinced my family there was a compelling reason for my madcap adventure, other than incipient dementia.

Before embarking, I showed my walking group my new waterproof hiking boots, guaranteed to protect to -40, Celsius or Fahrenheit. “Those won’t be warm enough,” admonished well-meaning friends recently returned from Mexican beaches. “I’ll wear thick socks,” I countered.

I did feel a twinge of anxiety about being lonely, travelling on my own. That concern was quickly dispelled. From my first phone call to the Churchill Chamber of Commerce, I felt warmly welcomed. When I chatted with Bill, the proprietor of the Iceberg Inn, he promised to arrange personalized tours. In addition, he offered to bake a birthday cake. A woman I met on the plane ride north gave me a scenic tour of the area before dropping me off at my cozy lodge.

After checking in, I donned my borrowed winter gear – snow pants, down-filled coat, fur-lined mitts – and took my first walkabout. My new boots were perfect for crunching over the dry snow that squeaked with every step. That sound reminded me of winter in Saskatchewan. As I strolled down the main street, the wind stung my cheeks. Pulling down my hat flaps, I carried on to the edge of town, about 10 minutes away. The snow-swept flatlands extended to a line of trees far off on the horizon. I felt right at home.

On the way back I stopped at Polar Bears International House, the destination Bill had suggested for my introduction to Churchill. The instant I stepped inside, I was offered tea and cake. The curator and I bonded and spent the next hour play-fighting with polar bear skulls. Did I mention I was the only visitor?

Back at my hostel, Eva, a 25-year-old traveller from Germany, had prepared supper for herself, Bill and me. Did I feel lonely? Not for a second. Eva became my close companion for restaurant meals and strolls about town. The age difference didn’t matter. We recognized the same curiosity and exuberance in each other, and shared the same awe for the barely touched northern terrain. I quickly realized that wilderness outposts like Churchill attract free spirits who think outside mainstream cultural constraints.

I threw myself into each new adventure. With snowshoes on my feet, I sank down mid-calf into fresh snow, as opposed to floundering waist-deep without them. Yes, I could waddle adequately on a hard-packed trail, but I wanted to experience the challenge of travelling through deep drifts. Each foot had to be drawn straight up with bent knee and carefully placed a step ahead. It required mental concentration to teach leg muscles this new way of walking, not to mention these same muscles protesting for several days. Now I have some understanding of the struggles my poor Highlanders faced on their 150-mile snowshoe trek to York Factory.

Bill arranged an excursion across the Churchill River, about two miles wide at its mouth. My guide, Steve, took me in his side-by-side Ski-Doo. He assured me he was a Northern Ranger, so I was safe with him. Focused on the forthcoming adventure, I hadn’t worried for an instant about my welfare. But just in case, the rifle slung on his back instilled confidence. Near both shores ice ridges erupted from the frozen surface like grotesque sea monsters. I yelled “Stop!” several times to take photos.

On the far shore, Steve took me wherever I wanted to go. The first stop was Sloop’s Cove, an extended area of flat rocks where various HBC employees from the past had carved their names. This was where my characters had been dumped off their ship, instead of at York Factory where accommodation awaited them. At the ruins of Fort Prince of Wales the only other footprints had been made by an Arctic hare. Another advantage of the off-season – I fully experienced the isolation of the desolate, treeless tundra.

When the wind was still, the silence of the snow-shrouded tundra was overpowering. There was no sound except my own breathing. If I moved, I heard my footfall on the creaking snow. On the frozen water near shore, I heard ominous groaning as the ice shifted with the flowing tide. At night, the Northern Lights evoked body-tingling awe no photograph could duplicate. These memories will enliven winter-survival scenes in my novel.

The railway station is a two-minute walk from the Iceberg Inn. During my birthday dinner, two French guests started getting restless about missing their 7 p.m. boarding time. At 6:45 p.m., Bill and Eva were just lighting candles for the cake. Well, who should emerge from one of the bedrooms but the train engineer after an afternoon nap. Problem solved. We invited him to share some cake, knowing the train could not leave without its driver.

Story continues below advertisement

When my own departure date arrived, I was torn between reluctance to leave and giddy anticipation of riding the rails. The train crew was another cast of quirky characters who pampered me for the next two days. Munching treats in the dome car, I watched tundra slip into forest and signs of human habitation emerge bit by bit. When I couldn’t stay awake another minute, I snuggled into my own private sleeping cocoon.

At no point did anyone in Churchill imply that I was too old to be there. We were all busy exploring the environment and the history. The next time I have an opportunity for some offbeat adventure I’m going to take it. And so should you. You won’t be younger next year.

Suppli are similar to Sicilian-style arancini; orange-shaped (arancia is the Italian word for orange) balls of crumb-coated risotto rice fried until golden. Suppli, though, are egg-shaped, Roman-style rice croquettes stuffed with mozzarella cheese.

When you pull the cooked suppli apart, the strands of melted cheese in the middle resemble old-fashioned telephone wires. It’s why this dish is playfully called “suppli al telefono.”

Suppli are delicious and went very well with my summer tomato sauce. But they do take a bit of time to make and my step-by-step photos will guide you.

You can serve the suppli as an appetizer or as a main-course, with a side salad or grilled summer vegetables.

Suppli al Telefono

Italian-style rice croquettes, stuffed with cheese and basil, coated in breadcrumbs, then fried until golden and very delicious.

Preparation time: 60 minutes

Cooking time: about 50 minutes

Makes: 16 suppli

4 1/3 cups chicken or vegetable stock, plus more if needed

2 Tbsp olive oil

2 cups risotto rice (see Note)

1/2 medium onion, finely diced

1 large garlic clove, minced

2/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese

2 large eggs, beaten

• salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

16 medium fresh basil leaves

16 (3/4-inch square) mozzarella cheese (about 125 to 150 grams)

3/4 cup dried breadcrumbs

• vegetable oil, for frying

• warm tomato sauce, to taste (see recipe below and Eric’s options)

Place stock in a pot and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. When simmering, turn heat to it’s lowest setting.

Heat olive oil in a second pot set over medium, medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook and stir until tender, about five minutes. Add rice and garlic and cook and stir two minutes more.

Pour in 1 cup of the stock, lowering the heat as needed so that it very gently simmers.

Simmer until that stock is almost fully absorbed by the rice. Slowly add remaining stock in 1/3-cup increments, cooking and stirring until it’s almost fully absorbed by the rice before adding the next 1/3-cup. It should take about 20 minutes to use up all the stock and at that point the rice should look thick and creamy and just be tender (al dente), with a tiny bit of firmness when bitten into.

Remove rice from the heat and stir in Parmesan cheese. Spread rice out on a baking sheet and cool to room temperature. Thoroughly mix the beaten eggs into the rice and season with salt and pepper.

Line a second baking sheet with parchment paper. Put the breadcrumbs into a shallow bowl.

To make suppli, divide the rice into 16 portions, each about 1/3 cup. Dampen your hands with cold water, lift up a portion of the rice and set a basil leaf and piece of cheese in the centre of it. Shape rice into an egg-shaped ball, ensuring the cheese and basil is completely encased by the rice. Fill and form the remaining portions of rice into suppli as you did the first one. When you do, occasionally dampen your hands with water again to help prevent the rice from sticking.

Coat suppli in breadcrumbs and set on the parchment paper-lined baking sheet (see Eric’s options).

Pour three inches of vegetable oil into a deep pot (see Eric’s options). Set over medium-high heat and warm oil to 350 F, or until a small cube of bread fries gold brown in about 15 seconds when dropped into the oil.

Preheat oven to 200 F. Working in batches of three or four, fry the suppli about three and a half to four minutes, until rich golden brown and hot in the centre. Drain on paper towel and set the cooked suppli on a clean baking sheet and keep warm in the oven while you fry the rest. Serve the suppli with tomato sauce.

Note: Rice for risotto is sold at most supermarkets. Bags of it are sometimes simply labeled “risotto rice” or “Italian rice.” You’ll also find specific varieties of rice that are good for risotto, such as arborio, carnaroli or vialone nano.

Eric options: You can make the suppli many hours in advance. Cover and refrigerate until ready to fry. The suppli can also be frozen. If you do that, thaw them before frying.

The suppli could also be fried in a deep fryer. If you don’t want make your own tomato sauce, serve the suppli with a store-bought one, such as passata di pomodoro (strained tomatoes).

Summer Tomato Sauce with Basil

In-season, ripe, red tomatoes cooked and then blended into a sauce you can serve with suppli al telefono and other Italian-style dishes, such as pasta. It yields more sauce than you’ll need for the suppli, but the leftover sauce, once cooled, will freeze well.

Preparation time: 25 minutes

Cooking time: About 20 minutes

Makes: About 3 1/2 to 4 cups

2 1/2 lbs. ripe red tomatoes (see Note 1)

2 Tbsp olive oil

1/2 medium onion, diced

• pinch or 2 fennel seeds, coarsely crushed (optional; see Note 2)

• pinch red pepper flakes

16 medium fresh basil leaves, or to taste

• salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cut stem end out of each tomato; mark a shallow X at the top of the blossom end. Plunge tomatoes, a few at a time, into the boiling water for 60 seconds, or until the skins start to loosen. Use a slotted spoon to lift tomatoes out of the water, set on a wide plate and cool a few minutes, until safe enough to handle.

Pull the skins off the tomatoes. Cut each tomato in half. Set a fine sieve over a bowl. Squeeze or pull out the seeds from each tomato half into the sieve. Use a whisk to push out as much liquid as you can from the tomato seed mixture. Compost the seeds and skins.

Set the seeded tomato halves on a large cutting board and coarsely chop. Set the chopped tomatoes and the juices on the board in the bowl with the strained tomato seed liquid in it.

Heat oil in a medium pot set over medium heat. Add onion and garlic and cook until tender, about five minutes.

Add the chopped tomatoes to the pot. Bring to a simmer and cook, uncovered, until the tomatoes are very tender and falling apart, about 10 to 12 minutes. Stir in the basil.

Purée the tomato sauce in the pot with an immersion (hand) blender. The puréeing could also be done in a food processor or blender. Taste and season the tomato sauce with salt and pepper and it’s ready.

Note 1: Ripe, deep red tomatoes good for making sauce include an heirloom variety called oxheart, beefsteak tomatoes, ultra sweet tomatoes and/or roma (plum) tomatoes.

Note 2: You can coarsely crush the fennel seeds in a spice grinder, or by placing them in a thick plastic bag and hitting them with a kitchen hammer.

As he explored and ate his way around that city-state, it brought back tasty memories of my travels there many years ago.

I, too, ate my way around Singapore and what I was most fond of was their many hawker centres. They are outdoor food courts with numerous stalls each offering a different Southeast Asian-style dish, such as chicken rice, fish-head curry and chili crab.

article continues below

But what I remember most vividly is the satay. Threading small, marinated pieces of chicken, meat or fish, or prawns, on bamboo skewers is how satay is made. When you see them cooking on a grill in Singapore at night time, the combination of the sultry tropical air, the orangey light from the charcoal-fuelled flames, the alluring scent of the bamboo and the appearance of the mouth-watering, sizzling satay all combine to make you want to eat them, now.

Just thinking of them again made we want to have some and, with no current plans to visit Singapore, I made my own. You’ll find the recipe below along with one for peanut sauce, for dipping.

Before threading on the marinated chicken, you need to soak the bamboo skewers in water to help prevent them from catching on fire when set on the grill. But even when you do that they still can ignite. That explains why in Singapore you see grills with a long narrow strip of metal about 10 to 15 centimetres wide on one side. When the satay is set on the grill, the meat portion is placed over the fire. The wood portion rests on the fire-insulted strip of metal, preventing the exposed part of the skewer from catching on fire.

As noted in a previous story on satay, to recreate this on my propane barbecue, I set a double thick strip of aluminum foil of similar width on the front portion of my grill. I then heat the grill to medium-high and set the meat portion of the skewer over the flame, and the meatless end on the foil. This technique, along with soaking the skewers in water, should prevent the exposed parts of wood from igniting.

Chicken Satay

Small cubes of chicken, spicily marinated Southeast Asian-style, are threaded on skewers and then grilled until charred, succulent and delicious. Serve the satay as an appetizer, or as a main-course, with rice and stir-fried vegetables.

Preparation time: 40 minutes, plus marinating time

Cooking time: about six minutes

Makes: Four servings (five satay each)

2 Tbsp vegetable oil, plus some for grill

2 Tbsp brown sugar

2 large garlic cloves, minced

1 tsp salt, or to taste

1 tsp finely grated fresh ginger

1 tsp ground coriander 1/2 tsp ground cumin

1/2 tsp ground turmeric

1/4 tsp ground cayenne pepper

1 medium lime, finely grated zest and juice of

700 grams (about 10) boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into small, about 3/4-inch, cubes 20 bamboo skewers (see Note)

cilantro sprigs or mint sprigs, sliced cucumber and onion, for serving (optional)

• peanut sauce (see recipe below)

Combine the 2 Tbsp vegetable oil, sugar, garlic, salt, ginger, coriander, cumin, turmeric, cayenne and lime zest and juice in bowl large enough to hold the chicken. Add the chicken and turn to coat. Cover chicken and marinate in the refrigerator four hours.

While chicken marinates, soak the skewers in cold water until needed. When chicken has marinated, thread four or five pieces of it on one end of each skewer (see Eric’s options).

Preheat your barbecue or indoor grill to medium high. Lightly oil the bars of the grill. Set on the satay and cook about six minutes, turning occasionally, or until cooked through. Arrange satay on a serving platter and garnish, if desired, with cilantro sprigs (or mint sprigs, cucumber and onion. Serve satay with the peanut sauce, for dipping.

Note: Bamboo skewers are sold at many supermarkets and stores selling kitchenware.

Eric’s options: You can skewer the chicken many hours before cooking the satay. Keep satay refrigerated until ready to grill. Any satay you won’t eat now could be frozen, uncooked. When needed, thaw and grill as directed. Small cubes of beef sirloin, pork leg or lamb leg could be used instead of chicken.

Peanut Sauce

Rich, savoury, peanutty sauce you can dunk the chicken satay in.

Preparation time: Five minutes

Cooking time: a few minutes

Makes: about one cup

1/3 cup peanut butter (see Note 1)

1 (5.6 oz/165 mL) can coconut milk (see Note 2)

1 medium lime, juiced and zested

3 Tbsp soy sauce

1 Tbsp brown sugar

1 Tbsp water

1 tsp finely grated fresh ginger

• pinch ground cayenne pepper

Place the ingredients in a small pot. Set over medium heat, bring to a simmer and whisk until smooth. Simmer two minutes. Serve sauce warm or at room temperature (see Eric’s options).

Note 1: I used local Island Nut Roastery peanut butter when testing this recipe. For more information about it, including stores that sell it, go to their website islandnutroastery.com. I’ve also made this sauce with smooth styles of peanut butter.

Note 2: You’ll find smaller sized cans of coconut milk for sale alongside the larger cans of it at some supermarkets. I you can’t find it, buy a larger can, use a scant 3/4 cup of it for the peanut sauce, and save the rest for another use or freeze it for another time.

Eric’s options: You can make the peanut sauce up to a day before needed. If you do, cool it to room temperature and then cover and refrigerate unto needed. When you do need it, warm it up, until fluid again. Thin sauce with a little more water, if you find it thick.

Brought to you by At Home is a five-part series that asks Canadians to share what home ownership means to them from the perspective of the head and the heart. Contemplating making upgrades to your home? Advice from an HSBC mortgage specialist can help make it happen.

When Heather and Wesley Corbett bought their home in New Westminster, B.C., 13 years ago, they weren’t gardeners.

With two young sons at the time, the couple wanted a yard, but they didn’t imagine it would become their sanctuary.

“The garden is really what we’ve put our hearts into. I don’t think either my husband or I knew that we would get so much joy from the effort we put in,” says Heather, 44.

“We regularly take a drink and go on a tour of the garden. It sounds funny, but we just go and see how the plants are doing and we walk around and observe what’s growing and what’s blooming, and it really is something we love doing together.”

The garden has also been a relaxing place for the family to spend time during the pandemic.

“We’ve done a lot of work on the garden,” Heather says of the past few months as COVID-19 health measures have forced people to stay home.

Before renewing their mortgage in May, the Corbetts considered whether it was time to move into a bigger home.

“Every time we come back to the fact that we don’t really want to leave the area or the garden. So, we said, ‘no, let’s not,’” Heather says.

Public health guidance encouraging people to stay home has also allowed time for her husband, 51, to build a basketball hoop with one son and a lawn game with the other.

“They had fun doing that together,” she says. “I’ve certainly been very grateful for the fact that we have our house and our yard.”

Heather grew up in Vancouver. When the couple moved back home after a stint in the United Kingdom, they realized they couldn’t afford a house in that city, so broadened their search to the suburbs.

New Westminster appealed to them because of its history, small-town feel and location on the banks of the Fraser River.

They found a house with “good bones,” a good school nearby and a ton of potential. They took possession in the fall of 2007.

“We maybe didn’t know it at the time, but our community is a huge factor for us. We really appreciate where we live and the tight-knit, close community that we are a part of,” Heather says.

The house needed work, though. In 2010, spurred by low-interest rates and big ideas, the Corbetts refinanced their mortgage to be able to take on an extensive renovation. They added a two-storey addition to the back of the house and a deck.

Even after paying the penalty for getting out of their five-year mortgage early, the rates made the investment worthwhile.

“We went from quite a high-interest rate to a really low-interest rate,” Heather says.

The house that cost about $460,000 in 2007 has since more than doubled in value. While it was a big investment at the time, the Corbetts have never second-guessed their decision to buy in the Metro Vancouver market.

Wesley is a graphic designer who has worked from home for many years. Heather is a committee clerk for the City of New Westminster. With the entire family now at home during the lockdown, there’s enough room for everyone to have their own space.

The Corbetts’ lenders have also provided the couple very favourable lines of credit over the years, along with the mortgage.

“It has come in handy,” she says of the lines of credit, “to get us through some tight spots [and with] different things we wanted to do to the house.”

Having a home-equity line of credit (HELOC) is a good idea and can be used for a wide-range of uses, from home renovations to helping with the cost of a child’s education, says Matt Mercer, Head of the Mortgage Centre at HSBC Bank Canada in Toronto.

“A HELOC is one option to finance expected and unexpected expenses at a low-interest cost,” Matt says. “The benefit of a HELOC is that it allows you to use your hard-earned equity without having to requalify each time, and because you are not breaking your mortgage early, there is no penalty.”

He recommends homeowners discuss their wants and needs with a mortgage specialist, who will help them find the best solution to match their unique circumstances.

“The mortgage specialist will review your full situation, including your current mortgage rate, other obligations that you have, and any future plans and financing needs,” Matt says.

The garden is really what we’ve put our hearts into. I don’t think either my husband or I knew that we would get so much joy from the effort we put in. HEATHER CORBETT

What advice to the Corbetts have for other homeowners?

Heather recommends they start by making a list of what will make them happy. For instance, she and her husband knew they didn’t want the hassle of traversing any bridges or tunnels on their daily commute.

“That was our rule. We stuck to it and have never regretted it,” Heather says.

And put some time into researching potential neighbourhoods, she says. You may not be able to afford your first choice, but you can make sure you’ll be happy in an area you can afford.

“I drove around a lot of areas to get a feel for what the community was like and also what kind of future it had,” she says.

When they moved in, there were very few amenities nearby, but before they bought, she found out there were plans for a retail development nearby. They now have a grocery store, drug store, restaurant and Starbucks within walking distance.

“Make sure you’re going to be happy there and there’s going to be the ability to work and play,” Heather says.

Matt of HSBC cautions that everyone’s situation is unique.

“What worked for the Corbett’s might not work for you,” he says. “That’s why it’s important to work with a bank – like HSBC – that has a team of mortgage specialists that can help you understand your current situation and put a plan in place to turn your dreams into a reality.”

Firefighters struggled to contain three wildfires near Los Angeles on Saturday as forecasters warned that the risk of new fires was high with temperatures expected to spike and humidity levels to drop across California.

A huge forest fire that prompted evacuations north of Los Angeles flared up around noon, sending up a cloud of smoke as it headed toward thick, dry brush in the Angeles National Forest. Although it was burning into forest land, evacuation orders remained in effect for the western Antelope Valley because erratic winds in the forecast could push the fire toward homes, fire spokesman Jake Miller said.

Fire crews managed to stop the fire’s movement down to the desert floor when it flared up Friday afternoon. In one dramatic moment, several firefighters ran to safety when a longhorn bull that was apparently escaping the blaze charged at them.

The Lake Fire was just 12% contained as of Saturday morning, and after threatening more than 5,400 homes, it had charred more than 23 square miles (59.5 square kilometres) of brush and trees. Fire officials said 21 buildings had been destroyed, including at least five homes.

Firefighters were struggling in steep, rugged terrain amid scorching temperatures. The National Weather Service warned temperatures could hit 111 degrees (44 Celsius) in the Antelope Valley Saturday, and winds gusting 15-20 mph (24-32 kph) was expected later in the afternoon.

“In addition to that, we have a very unstable air mass over the Lake Fire that’s going to allow for a pyrocumulus (cloud) development later today so that will create extreme fire behaviour,” meteorologist Matt Mehle said.

Record-breaking heat is possible through the weekend, with triple-digit temperatures and unhealthy air predicted for many parts of the state. There also was a chance of isolated thunderstorms worsening the fire threat by creating dry lightning and strong downdrafts, fire officials said

There was no containment of a blaze that blackened foothills above the Los Angeles suburb of Azusa. It churned through 2.3 square miles (5.96 square kilometres) of brush on Thursday and was moving away from homes. Evacuation orders issued to residents were lifted early Friday.

Azusa police said they were looking for a homeless man suspected of starting the fire. He was identified as Osmin Palencia, 36, and was last known to be living in a riverbed encampment near the site where the fire started.

Police said Palencia was believed to be violent and urged people to use caution if they see him.

Lounging on the leather couch, positioned in front of a 12-foot high window, we watch the summer thunder storm, and its accompanying winds bustle through the tree tops. As I take a slug of my local IPA, the rain whips at the window, coming horizontally in bursts and the tops of the surrounding pines thrash violently, “but see, no movement, totally stable,” Cam Green says. “You wouldn’t know that we’re in a tree house, would you.”

Yes, kind of like Tarzan, we are at home in the trees. Thirteen feet above ground, we’re sat in the main living space of a splendidly luxurious tree house. At 370 square feet, with an additional 210 if you include the outdoor deck space, this home-on-high, this tree fort for grown ups, is the brainchild of Mr. Green and his partner, Lauren. Costing a cool $300,000, the structure, near Minden, Ont., includes a full bathroom with flushing toilet and shower. There’s a king-size bed high in the mezzanine, and the aforementioned living space, which is climate controlled with a heat recovery ventilator, includes sofa, coffee table and propane stove, plus a kitchen area complete with fridge and space for food preparation.

Mr. Green has been fascinated by building in trees since his childhood. “Borrowing” materials from the burn pile behind his parent’s cottage on Balsam Lake, he and his buddies would knock together tree houses in the bush, much like many other kids. But, while others grew up and forgot about their aerial construction projects, Mr Green’s interest in architecture and the potential for building in trees blossomed. In 2014 he took a course in sustainable tree house design and construction, at the Yestermorrow Design Build School, in Waitsfield, Vt. “We learned how to build the specialized foundation structure that you need to support a tree house in a growing tree,” Mr. Green says. “I’d always wanted to turn my dreams into a reality and now I had the skills to do it.”

But, time has a way of getting away on you and it wasn’t until 2019 that the couple could begin their build. The design, by Mr. and Ms. Green, and overseen by B.C. architectural designer Lindsay Duthie of Lindsay Duthie Design Studio, is a tale of two parts. Mr. Green focused on the structural and engineering aspects, while Mrs Green undertook the interior and aesthetic design of the building.

Most critical was the attachment to the two red maple trees, which support half of the building’s weight. Specially engineered for the project by Oregon-based tree house guru, Charlie Greenwood, the tree house attachment bolts (TABs) are a dynamic fixing that runs right through the heart of the tree. The rod and bolt system supports two steel arms that carry heavy I beams, on which the main structural members of the wooden floor system sit. Additionally, three steel posts support the rear of the building, keeping it totally stable.

“The most important element on this kind of project is, of course, the trees,” Mr. Green says. “And with that in mind you must work clean. By that I mean that no dirt or foreign bodies can be allowed to get into the wound that you create in the tree while installing the TAB because they have the potential to infect and damage the tree.”

To this end every cutting and boring tool was sanitized, holes were cleaned out and sanitized as soon as cut and a paint-on sealant that helps the trees heal applied as soon as the TABs were in place.

“The tree is kind of your reason for building a tree house,” Mr. Green says, “so protecting it is paramount. Even the ground under it was covered with wood chips and plywood while heavy construction took place. We wanted to be sure not to damage or compact the roots.”

The deck on which the building is constructed is massive. Three large 13-inch-by-7-inch glued laminated timbre beams form the foundation, upon which Douglas fir joists, each 4 inches by 12 inches are laid. All “float” 13 feet above the forest floor. From here on up, to its 33-foot tall peak, the tree house is a fairly conventional stick frame build.

“The only differences are the corrugated steel structure of the wall around the big window, to stop deflection, and the fact that we used screws instead of nails so that they wouldn’t pop due to any unforeseen movement,” Mr. Green says.

Aesthetically, the vibe is all clean, modern lines with a “woodsy” twist. This is where Ms. Green comes into her own. Cedar is the predominant material externally: the deck, penny joint siding and privacy screens for the outdoor shower, all hewn from the hard wearing wood. Invisible glass handrails border the deck, giving a real sense of being truly among the trees. Inside, the cool grey of the straw and clay floor – a super environmentally friendly product, laid by a local artisan – is complimented by Baltic birch plywood paneled walls and ceiling.

“Lauren has a great eye for this kind of design. I just do the grunt work,” Mr. Green says with a laugh.

Signature pieces, such as the mini propane stove and ladder to the mezzanine, are black, adhering to a minimal colour pallet informed by the window and door frames. The bathroom, too, is all dark tones; the hexagonal floor tiles and almost mirror-like black wall tiles contrasting nicely with the quirky, black trimmed white enamel sink.

A chunky leather couch and woollen throw rug soften the aesthetic and add a cozy feel to the living space, which will be especially welcome in winter months, when the family is really looking forward to living amidst the snow blanketed forest.

The Greens have managed to successfully turn a life long ambition into a reality, and a burgeoning business opportunity, as their new tree house building company, Fort Treehouse Co., gets off the ground (if you’ll pardon the pun) with the completion of this wonderful build.

As for the couple’s two boys – Arlo, who is two, and Sidney, just weeks old – as they grow up they’ll have the best tree house in town. But, it’s a safe bet that dad will be helping them build their own, something more rough and ready like those from his childhood, soon enough.

The sky turned orange before filling with heavy white smoke above John Green’s home in British Columbia’s Okanagan region Tuesday afternoon.

He was among hundreds of people ordered to immediately evacuate from the Heritage Hills area near the community of Okanagan Falls as a rapidly growing wildfire threatened the residential neighbourhood.

The fire on Christie Mountain was among nearly 100 that have ignited in the past few days following a heat wave and thunderstorms in southern B.C.

The fire was estimated at 250 hectares early Tuesday evening but the service warned that figure was likely to rise.

“We anticipate we will see further growth once we are able to get a more accurate track of the fire,” the service said in a tweet.

The evacuation order asked residents of the Heritage Hills area to leave with critical items like medication and eye glasses only if they were immediately available, and to register at muster point in Penticton.

British Columbia’s Interior has seen record wildfires in recent years, so Green said he was prepared with emergency boxes ready. He said residents had expressed gratitude that amid a year of tragedy, B.C. had thus far avoided major wildfires until now.

“We were very thankful we didn’t have forest fires this year on top of COVID so this is pretty devastating for most people and especially people who are a lot closer to where their houses may be in danger,” he said.

At the same time, he said he had received 50-odd calls and texts from friends offering to help, so the community was coming together.

The fire is among dozens the BC Wildfire Service is fighting but was the only one upgraded to a “fire of note” on Tuesday.

Figures from the service show that among 109 active fires in the province, 95 were started in the last few days.

Ten wildfires in the Pemberton area north of Whistler were burning but not threatening any properties, the service said.

A 10-hectare fire southeast of Lillooet, B.C., was considered out of control but smouldered with no open flame. The service suspects it was human caused, unlike most of the others.

Ground crews, air tankers and helicopters attacked it Monday and multiple crews and heavy equipment stopped it from growing overnight. Twenty-two firefighters and one helicopter remained on site Tuesday.

Hot, dry weather has been a key factor in the new fires and most were caused by lightning, after weekend thunderstorms left a trail of hot spots.

Most are burning in the southeast district, where the service says crews have been battling 25 fires primarily around the Arrow and Kootenay lake regions. Two were visible from Canal Flats and Wasa, north of Cranbrook.

Crews are assessing all of the fires by ground and air and will continue to strategically fight the fires, the service said.",645,0.9433262935270899,local

“Some couples should not share a double kayak,” said the guide who came up beside us as my husband wildly waved his paddle in the air.

My husband and me were fighting in the double kayak.

Story continues below advertisement

It was 2005, and we were kayaking with a group in Desolation Sound, up the B.C. coast from Vancouver. The rain was dripping into the water; a seal came up behind the kayak and then disappeared. It was beautiful, but we had missed a part of it while we were arguing. I had volunteered us for the double kayak, dreaming of a romantic shared experience, while my husband looked leery about my expectations. In retrospect, my husband and the guide were right – we would have enjoyed our time better together while each paddling our own boats.

The guide’s comment reminded me that I’ve tended to make assumptions and control experiences rather than enjoying the moment and letting the current flow. I have often pondered that moment since. After that trip, I realized the trick to our relationship was in how we could balance shared experience with personalized autonomy – how we could move in parallel without being too tightly coupled on our path.

We never fit the cliché of a traditional relationship. We met in 1999, when I was sleep-deprived after a night shift as a neurology resident. He was a chef, and served me a coffee. As a pickup line, he told me he was a man of the 90s, able to cook; I told him I was a woman of the 90s and couldn’t. He then told me his favourite medium to work with was chocolate – almost too much to bear. The rest was history, as they say.

We had some idyllic months while first dating, until reality struck. As we settled into our relationship, I told him he needed to change his cooking habits because I was exhausted from trying to run off the calories. I was too focused and found him to not be focused enough. I liked to plan, he preferred spontaneity. We repeated these criticisms, not always seeing the strengths in the other’s approach. While we sparred, life happened. Our relationship dynamics appeared to follow a pattern: first careening through challenges like unplanned pregnancy and rushed marriage, followed by my deliberate deceleration of our lives, buckling down to study and pass my neurology fellowship exams within the same year. We’ve always gotten to our destinations and goals, but our marriage has never smoothly glided over the waves.

We moved to Vancouver, and he became the caregiver for our two children. On the surface, he was the “househusband” stereotype: cooking, nurturing and maintaining our home. However, I never thought of him in the traditional domestic role. In fact, he wasn’t much of a “housewife,” instead contributing to a chaotic and messy home. He held multi-course dinners for his friends, keeping our children up late while music blasted and dishes piled up. But I began to see the beauty in this different type of household, watching our children being soothed by hairy, muscled arms. I learned to not expect a Martha Stewart-style home. The children were cared for, and I was the family breadwinner with a full-time medical practice. Somehow, our unusual relationship dynamic kept us afloat, and I learned to love the swirling whirlpools of my husband’s currents in the otherwise slow-flowing routines of our lives.

At times, I chafed at the responsibility of being the primary earner; he chafed at the need to feed a toddler three times per day, when humdrum routine interfered with adventure. It was during these ruminations that we stepped into the double kayak in Desolation Sound. In a way, our guide rescued our marriage when he saw our distress flare across the water. He altered our relationship’s trajectory with his uncomplicated advice that day. After that day, we began to learn to communicate about where we each wanted to go together, charting a course back to each other’s priorities and values. After that day, I resolved to hold my husband’s journey and goals front and centre as I knew he would hold mine, tacking our relationship’s course as a co-ordinated team.

Since then, despite our best efforts, there are still some times of tumult. We have each made mistaken assumptions about what was best for the other. I don’t know what I was thinking when I decided he should perform yoga each morning before starting his 7 a.m. baking shift. The yoga video would advance from the first lying-down corpse pose while he stayed supine on the ground, snoring. And he’s been similarly deluded at times. I took up cycling to support his interests, dreaming of meandering aimlessly in sync. Our relationship temporarily hit a speed bump after he exhibited his coaching fervour, yelling at me to sprint for badges on the Strava activity app. Each time, a clarifying conversation has reoriented us.

This year marks our 20th year of marriage. Each new year, he humours me as I seriously ask whether we should stay the course for another year. We converse about our individual and shared intentions for the upcoming year, strategizing about how to integrate his adventures into my plans. This planning has helped us to reach further destinations than we would have ever achieved individually. I feel comfortable with the scheduling, and he doesn’t feel constrained in pursuing adventures. Feeling confident in my husband to serve as an anchor if needed, I have sailed further than I ever imagined: becoming a physician, an associate professor, an associate dean, a mother and a wife. I think our sustained enthusiasm for our relationship is in the thrills of surfing over shared waves of family drama balanced with the joys of gliding over still seas of routine while we remain tethered on our individual paths.

We’re charting new territory as a family; our eldest is in university, and she’s drifting down her own tributary. Unexpectedly, my husband has wished to moor the boat, encouraging my daughter to stay. I see his pride in what he built for our family, and his joy in memories of school trips and lunches. Conversely, I wish to see her move forward, having observed her elegant navigation toward her own success. Maybe I’m recalling my own ambitious career path as a woman – I want her to experience the same thrills in life’s ups and downs. And now, I want to provide a base for my husband to launch renewed career goals and exploits.

Through this journey, I am secure in knowing that after we steer through this fork in the river, my husband and me will paddle down the new passage together. However, despite where we have come to and where we have come from, I still won’t step back into a double kayak with him. Instead, I would rather take my own kayak and float down the river, buoyed by him cresting the rapids. That kayaking guide’s advice has never steered me wrong.

That’s because as juveniles, the fish experienced warmer-than-average river temperatures in the Fraser River.
But this year, especially and similar to last year, marine survival has been very low,” Michielsens said.
The Fraser River in good years has seen tens of millions of sockeye return, sustaining First Nations and commercial and recreational fisheries and their coastal communities.
A total 30,000 salmon have been counted above the slide, about 30 per cent of which are expected to be sockeye, Michielsens said.","The good news for this year’s troubled Fraser River salmon stocks is that high levels of freshwater run-off have been dropping in recent days, giving returning fish a better chance of making it past the Big Bar slide and to their home streams to spawn. But that boost is unlikely to offset the historically low return of 283,000 sockeye forecast for the run this year.

“Overall, the situation is quite dire. The run is returning at low levels,” said Catherine Michielsens, chief of fisheries management science for the Canada-U.S. Pacific Salmon Commission.

“We have now seen enough of the run already to not expect any major surprises in terms of numbers being very different.”

It was already known that survival rates for this year’s Fraser River sockeye stocks would be below average, Michielsens said from Vancouver Thursday. That’s because as juveniles, the fish experienced warmer-than-average river temperatures in the Fraser River. They also faced above-average discharge levels in the river, making it more difficult to reach the ocean, she said. In the ocean, poor environmental conditions affecting their prey in the northeast Pacific hurt their survival rates as well.

“There’s a substantial decline in salmon productivity and that’s been occurring for quite a while. But this year, especially and similar to last year, marine survival has been very low,” Michielsens said.

The Fraser River in good years has seen tens of millions of sockeye return, sustaining First Nations and commercial and recreational fisheries and their coastal communities.

But there are no fisheries this year for Fraser River-bound sockeye because of conservation concerns.

The current low forecast follows last year’s previous historic low return of 485,900.

In 2018, a dominant cycle year for sockeye, which are on a four-year cycle, close to 11 million returned to the Fraser River, allowing for a total catch of 5.9 million fish.

So far this season, 65,000 sockeye and chinook salmon have been counted in the river below the Big Bar slide, 64 kilometres north of Lillooet.

A total 30,000 salmon have been counted above the slide, about 30 per cent of which are expected to be sockeye, Michielsens said.

The slide, reported in June last year, resulted in more than 85,000 cubic metres of rock shearing off a cliff into the river, where salmon were trapped below a five-metre tall waterfall. A natural fishway was built over the winter to allow salmon around the slide area.

Because discharge levels have dropped substantially in the past few days, the new fishway has been “successful at this point at allowing both sockeye and chinook to migrate above the side,” Michielsens said.

As well, a new salmon cannon will carry salmon past Big Bar. About 5,300 salmon have used the cannon this season and another 1,500 have been carried by truck, Michielsens said.

Riley Brandt/The Canadian Press

Village Brewery, which describes its blond ale as crisp, dry and slightly fruity, is looking to persuade beer lovers that a new batch made from reused waste water tastes just as good.

The Calgary beer-maker has teamed up with University of Calgary researchers and U.S. water technology company Xylem Inc. to brew up a limited 1,600-can batch.

The goal was to show that dirty water – even that flushed from toilets in a major city – can be made safe to drink while helping conserve the globe’s dwindling potable water supply.

“Certainly we do expect some eyebrows raised and the yuck factor is real,” said Christine O’Grady, project co-ordinator at Advancing Canadian Wastewater Assets, or ACWA.

“Part of this project … is to start the conversation about how this can be done, why it should be done and that water is a resource that we need to protect.”

ACWA is a research partnership between the University of Calgary and the City of Calgary that involves the Pine Creek Wastewater Treatment Facility by the Bow River in the city’s southeast.

Municipal waste water normally runs through a complex system involving screens, filters, microbes and ultraviolet light to make it clean enough to return to the river.

The ACWA team took partially treated water from the plant and ran it through more advanced purifying to make it drinkable. That involved ultrafiltration, ozone, ultraviolet light and reverse osmosis.

The idea of making beer from waste water started out as a joke around the boardroom table while Xylem and ACWA were discussing ways to collaborate.

“Then we said, ‘Well, we can make beer,’” Ms. O’Grady said. “We have all the technology. We have the capacity on all sides.”

ACWA approached Village Brewery.

“They’re so progressive and cool. They were all in,” said Ms. O’Grady.

Jackson Stuart, the brewery’s marketing manager, said Village was excited to take part in a project that put sustainability front and centre.

He said he’ll be interested to see how keen customers are to sip suds brewed from repurposed waste water.

“The big thing for us was to try to make sure that the beer tasted the exact same as our other normal Village Blonde and we achieved that,” he said. “We’re confident.”

The only difference in making the beer is that the water didn’t come from the tap, but arrived in tanks.

Alberta Health Services helped the partners develop a safety plan and tested the treated water to make sure it met drinking-water standards.

“With the right measures in place, alternative water sources – such as waste water, grey water, rooftop-collected rainwater and stormwater – can be made safe for many potable and non-potable end uses,” said public-health inspector Jessica Popadynetz.

Bob Sandford, Global Water Futures Chair at the United Nations University Institute for Water, Environment and Health, said he believes the “yuck factor” can be overcome.

“The science is absolutely sound and is very convincing. The brewery, too, has done a really good job of explaining this,” he said.

Natural systems have been purifying water to a drinkable standard for hundreds of millions of years, Mr. Sandford said.

“We’re drinking water that’s passed through dinosaurs.”

In a changing climate and an increasingly populated world, high-level tertiary treatment technologies such as those used by ACWA will be crucial, he suggested.

“Because of the numbers of emerging contaminants of concern, we need to have ever more sophisticated water treatment systems and this is what it’s pointing to.”

It’s not just the foreign-looking and strange-sounding words that make Italian such a challenge. It’s the attitude, and it’s difficult to fake. Until now:

First, touch all the fingertips of your right hand together. Now rapidly open and close your fingertips above your palm. OK, you’re almost there, just add a little wrist action. The last step is to yell loudly into a face — anybody’s face — the name of your favourite pasta and/or soccer team, over and over. That’s it! You are speaking like an Italian.

Eventually, I came to realize that not all Italians are extremely angry all of the time. They just sound that way. The Italian language, accompanied as it always is with wild arm gesticulations and finger jabs, is not meant to convey tender mercies so much as naked fury and soccer-match results. For example, the taxi driver I was convinced was threatening to murder me and my extended family was just turning left.

My wife, who is afflicted with a condition doctors describe as “smarter than me,” actually learned the Italian language prior to our trip. I was going to do that, too, but there were quite a few interesting programs on Netflix, and also there was sleeping, and beer. Anyway, my point is that learning even the basics of a language really helps in pronouncing place names, asking for directions, and choosing the right pasta for hand-to-hand combat.

A short-cut to learning Italian is to simply -—but angrily — employ one or more of the following phrases:

• Ahhhhh, now that’s Italian! (appropriate for food, traffic, leaning towers)

• That’s a spicy meatball! (appropriate for meatballs, bowel movements)

• Mama mia! (appropriate for calling your mother, Abba concerts, the Vatican)

By the way, “Garfagnana” describes the condition when you blink, and the gentle hills of Tuscany turn into the imposing wall of the Apuan Alps. Probably.

Garfagnana

The Garfagnana is gorgeous in a region that is already gorgeous. Small towns dot nearly every high spot above lush hillsides bursting with grapes, olives and everything else that’s green and growable. It’s like biking through a big salad.

In the far distance, a black dot on the ridgeline will later turn out to be a massive fortress, the Verrucole Castle.

We’re still too far away to make out the crenelated battlements high above the green valley, but we each know, deep in our thighs, that this ride will fully justify tonight’s wine, pasta and more wine.

The castle is 600 metres above sea level. It makes sense to pick a high spot for your fortress.

When bad people come to take away your stuff, such as your livestock and/or daughters, you can escape to the big impregnable castle and drop rocks on their heads until they go away.

As a plus, they might die on the seven-kilometre climb up from the valley below.

The Verrucole Castle was built between the 10th and 13th centuries by the Gherardinghi family to help keep nearby Lucca’s feudal ambitions in check.

Over the years, it has been accurately restored by a team of mostly volunteer historians, archeologists, architects and teachers, each passionate about faithful historical reconstruction.

This is the best kind of time travel: you wander around and learn how rooms and gardens were organized in the 12th century, but you get to keep your shoes and vaccinations against communicable diseases.

Well, I got to keep my shoes. A few in our group, wearing the kind of expensive cycling shoes that cause Achilles tendinitis and plantar fasciitis, had to leave them at the bottom of the steep hill you must walk up to enter the castle.

The spectacular view of the Garfagnana is worth the blisters.

The bad news is that today’s ride is 87 km long. The good news is that the first 17 km of it is all downhill. The, uh, other bad news is that the downhill begins at the top of the Apuan Alps in the rain. The temperature this morning is a crisp 4 C, and most of our group wears yesterday’s socks on their hands, not having packed for Outer Hebrides-type weather.

Despite — or possibly because of — the cold, the ride is exhilarating. We are the only ones on the road, zipping down the asphalt at automobile speeds. The narrow road precipitously drops off to the right, as the valley expands and expands and expands until we can almost see the mists of the Tyrrhenian Sea to the west.

We are the only ones on the road, right up until the moment when we suddenly share the road with large trucks burdened with giant blocks of marble, barrelling past us in what must be a concerted effort on the part of the drivers not to use up any expensive brake pads.

Italian marble — the good stuff, we are told — is quarried from these mountains, and it is cut and shipped out from the towns on the coast far below. You know you’re in one of them by the marble sidewalk curbs and public drinking fountains.

Lovely Lucca

Garfagnana has a massive hilltop fortress, whereas Lucca — on the plains 50 kilometres to the south — has a massive wall. The 4.2-km Renaissance-era wall that still encircles the old town is actually Lucca’s fourth wall, the first of which was built by the Romans when they founded Lucca by stealing it from the Etruscans in 180 BC. It outlasted the Romans by a thousand or so years, until 1118, when Lucca became a commune, or self-governing city state. The wall was expanded in 1300, and then again in 1504.

Why so many walls? You guessed it: so many wars. When gunpowder became a mainstay of Western military conflict at the end of the 15th century, high walls became an expensive liability. High walls are great for thwarting climbers, archers and biting monkeys, but they are absolutely crap against cannons. This is why the grass- and tree-topped walls around Lucca are wide enough to play a game of rugby.

Lucca was an independent city state for 700 years, becoming rich from the silk trade and good diplomatic relations with the Pope. The only army to ever breach the walls and conquer Lucca (in 1805) was that of our old pal, Napoleon Bonaparte, who — I’m mostly not making this up — began his military career as an artillery specialist and monkey handler. Today, the walls remain intact, a broad pedestrian and cyclist promenade encircling a truly beautiful city. Lucca boasts gorgeous cathedrals, offices, museums and the suspiciously amphitheatre-shaped Piazza dell’Anfiteatro, built around a Roman amphitheatre.

Outside our hotel is a large, bronze statue of a moustachioed-man lounging cross-legged in a chair, smoking and looking bored. This is Giacomo Puccini (1858-1924), born in Lucca to become the greatest Italian opera composer after Verdi.

I don’t know if that “after Verdi” bit refers to Giuseppe Verdi’s chronologically first appearance in Italy (1813-1901), or to his being a better opera composer than Puccini. I have no way of judging the quality of opera music, which sounds to me like a whole lot of hollering and dramatic shrieking held together with pretty arias, the acoustic equivalent of duct tape. I only know two things about going to the opera: first, you are supposed to wear pants; and second, you must shout, “Thar she blows!” when the soprano lets fly in Act I.

What’s opera, doc?

The Italian word for opera turns out to be opera, which means “work” in the sense of the labour done (the mental and physical exertion), the result produced (This opera is my greatest achievement!) and the effort required to sit there and listen to it (I need a drink!).

No, opera is not for everybody. Most people typing these words right now (me) recognize opera as great music, but that doesn’t mean they (me) necessarily like it.

There are a few good reasons for people’s reluctance to embrace this form of classical combat theatre:

1. Opera does not come cheap.

2. Opera does not come short.

3. While it is true that opera finishes when the fat lady sings, it also begins that way, and is that way in the middle, too.

The good people of Lucca might have fixed those issues (well, two out of three ain’t bad). Every night of the year — for more than 40 years — a short evening concert is offered in the Chiesa e Battistero dei SS Giovanni e Reparata, a magnificent decommissioned church originally built in the 12th century.

It features a hauntingly beautiful interior with very hard chairs, all the better to keep you from falling asleep and taking a grievous elbow to the ribs from certain other audience members, by which I mean my wife.

The concert, which is different every night of the year, only lasts an hour, and only costs 25 euros. On the night we attended, the set list contained an enjoyable mix of arias by both Puccini and Verdi, and for the life of me, I can’t tell you which guy is better.

Who cares? Sitting in that beautiful Renaissance church, listening to talented musicians play and sing, I admit opera doesn’t seem like work at all.

Next week: Our tour winds down by winding up the many stairs of a certain wobbly tower, and then it’s many, many more stairs in beautiful Cinque Terre.

Rolling along the blessedly flat plain between Lucca and Pisa, under bright blue skies and with a gentle breeze at our backs, I have time to ponder some of life’s big questions, like what’s for lunch?

article continues below

Also, exactly what kind of black magic or, possibly, mathematics, is involved in keeping that tall tower on the horizon from tipping over? We’re at least five kilometres from Pisa, but we can clearly make out the iconic building with the significant tilt. From this first look, I would go so far as to call it a “leaning tower.” The closer we get, the more obvious — and dangerous-looking — is the lean. Seriously, what is keeping that thing up?

Lean into it

To answer that question, we have to first ask why it’s leaning at all. Back in 1160, Pisa had more than 10,000 towers (if you define “tower” as more than several dozen blocks piled on top of each other). Interestingly, none of those towers included a campanile, or bell tower (if you define “interestingly” as not at all interesting). Anyway, the lack of a bell tower was a problem until 1172, when local bell-tower enthusiast Berta di Bernardo died and left 60 pieces of silver to the city for the construction of a campanile.

Work began on the bell tower in 1173, led by Bonanno Pisano, a name I did not make up but wish I had. Signore Pisano was a very good sculptor, but a very bad geotechnical engineer. He did not know that beneath Piazza dei Miracoli’s lawns lay a 40-metre-deep mix of sand and clay, which is about as suitable a substrate for 56-metre-high marble buildings as banana-cream pudding.

After five years of construction, when the tower was just three storeys high, it had already started to tilt. So, in the spirit of all good municipal projects, work was put off for another 100 years.

When work resumed in 1272, the tilt was compensated for by building upward with a slight curve. The tower was eventually completed another 100 years later, in 1372. Somehow, the tower never got around to falling over — seven bells inside the tower, each sounding a different musical note, were rung from the ground by a team of 14 probably deaf men from 1370 until 1950.

Every year it leaned a little more, and by the 19th century, it was generally believed that the tower was deliberately built to lean.

In 1990, the tower was closed to the public while 1,000 tonnes of lead ingots were placed on the north side to counteract the building’s lean, and giant steel bands were wrapped around the second storey to hold it together. It didn’t work.

In 1995, the tower slipped 2.5 millimetres, prompting the insertion of more steel braces and cables while engineers removed 70 tonnes of earth from the high side of the foundations. Happily, this did work. In fact, it might have worked too well.

Not only is the tower stable, it is correcting itself toward the vertical. The latest measurements suggest that the tower’s iconic 43.8-centimetre lean might one day decrease to zero. Warning: you only have until the year 2300 before this happens.

Climbing the tower is a must-do, not just for the spectacular view of the Romanesque cityscape, but also to learn new appreciation for how good your body is at sensing when all is not plumb with the world. Climbing the well-worn 251 steps to the top floor provides a bizarre sensation of both falling forward and climbing backward as you circumnavigate the inside of the tower. The 3.9 degrees of tilt may not sound like much, but it’s very obvious to your toes.

The Leaning Tower is not the only beautiful building to explore in Pisa — or even the only one within the grounds of the Piazza dei Miracoli, which also contains the Duomo di Santa Maria Assunta, a striking 11th-century church and baptistry, and the Camposanto, said to contain soil from Calvary taken during the Crusades.

Unsurprisingly, all those famous buildings bring in the tourists, more than one million of them every year to a city of just 89,000. Such an overabundance of prey, in turn, brings in the predators, which means the usual cadre of pickpockets, North African cheap-crap-from-China merchants, and overpriced restaurants.

A day spent avoiding fistfights with all of the annoying above left me exhausted and a little glad that our cycle trip across Tuscany was officially over.

Of course, saying goodbye to the bikes and our cycle group doesn’t mean this is the end to overindulging in pasta and Chianti. We have one more stop to make before leaving Italy …

The Five Steep Lands

The Cinque Terre (Italian for “five lands”) is a string of centuries-old villages on the rugged Italian Riviera coastline: Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza and Cleveland, Ohio. Wait, that’s a typo, it should read Monterosso al Mare.

The most difficult thing about getting to the Cinque Terre is admitting to your wife that you are completely turned around, and have no idea where the Pisa train station is. Once this wee difficulty is sorted out (“I am almost nearly 100 per cent certain it’s over there, or possibly somewhere else. Yes, dear, yes of course, dear. By all means lead on if you think you know better”), it requires just two easy train rides, the latter of which takes eight minutes and drops you off at the bottom of the first village, stunning Riomaggiore.

When I say bottom of the first village, I refer to the mildly unpleasant fact — from the perspective of my knees — that our Airbnb is located at the top of the first village, at an elevation roughly equivalent to the base camp at Mount Everest.

This isn’t just a Riomaggiore thing; all five villages are tucked into the steep cliffs above the Mediterranean. It accounts for the stunning views, both from the bottom looking upward to the colourful homes and businesses stacked one on top of the other with vineyards and olive groves in the background; and from the top looking downward to the deep blue sea. Another plus of the steep main street (there is only one) and the myriad steep stairs and pathways, is that the farther you go up, the fewer tourists there are.

There are a lot of tourists here, naturally. The Cinque Terre is a national park and a UNESCO World Heritage Site, famed for the rugged landscape that draws hikers and sightseers from as far away as the Andromeda Galaxy.

However, it’s not actually very touristy. In fact, one of the many things I like about this place is the lack of predators looking to sell junk to the punters. This is the opposite of Pisa and Rome — it feels more like an outpost on the edge of the world, rather than the hub of an empire.

For example, there are no SPQR symbols on statues and manhole covers (also, there are no statues or manholes to cover), which are found all over the city of Rome. SPQR stands for the Latin Senatus Populusque Romanus, which means: “The senate and the people of Rome welcome your tourist dollars.”

Each of the five villages is connected by railway, water taxi and a network of hiking trails, so it’s easy to get from one to another.

Each village is unique, with its own restaurants and shops and overall atmosphere, despite the fact that they are only separated by a few kilometres. When you visit, just choose one village as your base — you can’t pick wrongly — and day-trip to the others.

We spend three days exploring the Cinque Terre, which was not nearly enough for some parts of my body, and way too much for others. Leaving this quiet, beautiful part of the world is as easy as arriving — just two train rides and we are back in in the hustle and bustle of Rome.

Ciao Italia!

Only it isn’t that easy, not really. Leaving Italy proves to be oddly disquieting. On the eve of our departure, I can’t help but wonder what just happened. Did we really spend two weeks cycling the length and breadth of Tuscany with those crazy people from all over the world?

It seems as though I have been living in a dream, as do all my adventures. Sitting alone on a whitewashed bench under a fig tree, I ponder how travel demands such good questions about the way we work and live and eat and sleep and fight and love back home.

A few bittersweet lines in Alfred, Lord Tennyson’s sublime poem Ulysses always come to mind when I am about to leave an adventure overseas for home:

For always roaming with a hungry heart

Much have I seen and known; cities of men

And manners, climates, councils, governments,

Myself not least, but honour’d of them all;

And drunk delight of battle with my peers,

Far on the ringing plains of windy Troy.

I am a part of all that I have met;

Yet all experience is an arch wherethro’

Gleams that untravell’d world whose margin fades

For ever and forever when I move.

This isn’t the windy plains of Troy, nor am I honour’d for battle here, but I do well know that I am a part of all that I have met, for ever and forever when I move.

Ciao Italy.

Michael Bryant is the executive director of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association and a former attorney-general of Ontario. The CCLA is a co-claimant in Kim Taylor’s legal challenge of Newfoundland and Labrador’s COVID-19 travel ban.

There is a monumental Canadian issue currently before our courts at the Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador, situated a stone’s throw from the coastline of St. John’s Harbour on the very edge of Confederation. It’s an issue that’s always hiding in plain sight amid important national conversations about racism, reconciliation, and COVID-19. It’s about the space between that courthouse and the westernmost edge of Victoria and Haida Gwaii, running north to Iqaluit.

Regionalism has always been what Canada was about, according to many historians, for most of our history. The taking of First Nations, Metis and Inuit lands was overshadowed throughout most of our legal history when, as a bulwark against the balkanization of those regions, Indigenous lands were misappropriated into a union of the British North American colonies of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and the Province of Canada (what is now Ontario and Québec). Later, Confederation would encompass territories west and north, and – inspired by the spirit of a Mari usque ad Mare – its sea-to-sea ambitions were completed when Newfoundland and Labrador joined in 1949.

So it was that the Constitution Act, 1867, guaranteed mobility “as if provincial boundaries did not exist,” according to the Supreme Court of Canada’s interpretation. That’s because we were a single nation, a confederation, not a socioeconomic union of sovereigns or colonies, nor a transnational union of member states like the European Union. Canada was one state, with an international border, over which sovereignty was exercised.

But then, during the COVID-19 crisis, 153 years later, provinces and territories began to behave as if these subnational jurisdictions were sovereign themselves – effectively erasing Confederation not with a bang, but with the whimper of a seemingly sensible public health order containing a travel ban against non-residents of suddenly sovereign provinces. And as a result, you and I are not allowed to travel to various provinces, including the famously hospitable Rock, simply because we lack the requisite address or emergency-management credentials to make our mobility “essential.” Since the start of the pandemic, travel bans have launched border patrols in Quebec, the territories, and several Atlantic provinces.

To be sure, advising me against Toronto-to-St. John’s travel is one thing. But legally barring my entry is another. When powerful regional feelings are ignited by laws dividing us from “them,” Canada is balkanized for the worse. We’re no longer raising each other up. Our rights are no longer universal, but dependent on where we come from. That becomes even more troubling when one views those travel bans through the lens of reconciliation.

If nothing else, it’s certainly counter to the popular narrative. The popular musical Come From Away tells the story of how the town of Gander, Nfld., welcomed, with profound kindness, a group of people whose flights were rerouted there after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. That’s a true story; Operation Yellow Ribbon sent 38 planes’ worth of travellers for Gander to band around, despite the global anxiety and fear in the immediate aftermath of 9/11. But little of that munificence has been on display during this latest crisis. Interprovincial/territorial co-ordination is nowhere to be seen.

If “Stay Away” is to be the pandemic sequel to “Come From Away,” it will come at the cost of constitutional guarantees to mobility rights for all Canadians and permanent residents. That’s why we argue that politicians who are seeking to establish a fearful order out of chaos with travel bans are merely bootstrapping dubious public-order efforts onto public health pronouncements. It damages the rule of law, threatens our Constitution, and ignores the very purpose of our mobility rights – that is, to do more together than we can apart. This also foments fear of COVID-19, which can then devolve into fear of outsiders – who may reciprocate, deepening divisions.

But such leaders are getting their marching orders from their anxious electorates – which means you can make a huge difference. One person at a time, we can resist the forces of fear and anxiety through our own individual behaviour. This is not to say that one should be obnoxious about the health concerns of others; escalating the tension doesn’t help. But it wouldn’t hurt to safely engage in a little Canadian hospitality, and urge your local and provincial/territorial government to do something for, not against, another Canadian region. That kind of reciprocity was the original rationale for Canada’s confederation of outsiders, and it’s a needed tonic for the cruel new logic of COVID-19 regionalism.

With the pandemic still raging worldwide, Ontarians looking to travel this summer are focusing more on road trips within their own home province.

Whether you and your family are hopping in the car, or the RV, there are several precautions to keep in mind to ensure road trip travel is as safe and stress-free as possible.

Here are some best practices, according to CAA South Central Ontario.

Story continues below advertisement

Plan properly

When looking for places to stay, search for hotels with free or flexible cancellation policies. Check the website of your destination, or call them, for updates on COVID-related closures or restrictions in the area. Get educated before you leave on safety-related requirements and guidelines such as mask usage, distancing, elevator usage and seating for wherever you are going so there are no surprises.

Check health updates

Stay tuned to the news for COVID-19 public health updates for the areas you are planning to visit.

Pack your own PPE

Bring plenty of masks, gloves, disinfectant wipes, paper towels and cleaning supplies for both you and your vehicle.

Pack extra snacks

Don’t assume there will be restaurant stops or convenience stores along the route. If there are restaurants that are open, they may have reduced capacity. Bring along a picnic lunch or snacks on the go.

Plan for washroom breaks

“Check where restrooms are open” along the way, says Niagara-on-the-Lake Chamber of Commerce president Eduardo Lafforgue, who has many tourists driving in from considerable distances. “This is important to consider, especially if you are travelling with children.”

Make a reservation

If your plan is to stop at a restaurant along the way, call ahead to make sure they are open, and make a reservation to hold your spot.

Wipe down your table

If you and your family choose to eat in a restaurant, bring along those disinfectant wipes and clean off the table and chairs. Use hand sanitizer after interacting with servers and cashiers.

Story continues below advertisement

Use gloves in the restroom

If you need to use a restroom along the way, try to touch as few surfaces as you can and use gloves, paper towel or even a plastic sandwich bag as a barrier between such surfaces as taps and doorknobs and your skin.

Bring the supplies you need

Try to bring as much as you think you might need to avoid contact with surfaces, such as towels, blankets and life jackets if you have them.

Prep your vehicle

You want to make sure vehicle is in top form to avoid any surprises on the way. Check the headlights, brake lights and turn signals to ensure they are operating properly. Make sure the oil and fluids are topped up. Check your tire pressure, clean the windshield and replace worn wiper blades, and make sure the car battery is strong. Thoroughly sanitize all surfaces you touch in your vehicle before and after your trip.

The more prepared you are, the more safe you’ll feel.

“That means you will better enjoy the experience of the trip you are taking,” says Natalie Wakabayashi, director of culture and entertainment tourism at Tourism London.

The endemic species report identified 308 of them, most being vascular plants and invertebrates (bugs and slugs, if you like). In B.C. we have 105 of these endemic species, 76 of which are unique to B.C. (the rest overlap with other provinces or the United States), with many found only on Vancouver Island, Haida Gwaii and other islands. Ten of them are “critically imperilled” and 13 are “imperilled.” But this is only a small part of the picture.

There are more than 50,000 species of plants and animals in B.C., according to the Royal B.C. Museum — more than in any other province. Of them, 1,807 species are at risk of extinction, according to an opinion piece in The Narwhal last year by a group of prominent academics, most from B.C., who conduct research on endangered species. Overall, 784 species present in B.C. are “red-listed,” meaning they are extirpated, endangered, or threatened in B.C.

The lead researcher on the third report, on old-growth forests, was Dr. Rachel Holt, a conservation biologist and the principal of Veridian Ecological Consulting, based in Nelson. In the past she has served as vice-chair of the B.C. Forest Practices Board.

Shockingly, she and her colleagues found that “many old-growth management areas, created to protect old-growth forests, do not actually contain old forest,” but that “government information was either misleading or not making it out to the public,” hence their independent report. They agree with the information on the website of B.C.’s Old Growth Strategic Review (due to report about now) that old-growth forests comprise about 23 per cent of forested areas in B.C.

But the bulk of this old-growth forest, they write, is not the iconic old growth with big trees that we think of when we hear the term “old growth.” Instead, they report, “the vast majority of this forest (80 per cent) consists of small trees,” including “black spruce bog forests in the northeast, subalpine forests at high elevation and low-productivity western red cedar forests on the outer coast.”

In fact, they note: “Sites with the potential to grow very large trees cover less than three per cent of the province,” and of this small amount, only about three per cent is old forest. Large tree old-growth forest ecosystems, they say, “are almost extinguished and will not recover from logging.”

And yet, they note “little human effort is tasked with protecting old forest values, while much is focused on harvesting.” Similarly, the endangered species researchers note “B.C. is still one of the only provinces in Canada without legislation dedicated to protecting and recovering species at risk.”

The harsh reality is that communities that rely on the over-exploitation of natural systems such as old-growth forests or salmon fisheries, or that are affected by the actions of others that have seriously damaged those ecosystems, are indeed threatened with extinction, because their natural-resources base is heading for extinction.

So when we talk about predator control, let’s be clear what predator we are talking about. We are the planet’s apex predator, and so the predator we need to control is us. Because as the 19th-century Duwamish elder, Chief Seattle, is recorded saying: “We are part of the web of life, and whatever we do to the web of life, we do to ourselves.” We forget that wisdom at our peril.

This too shall pass. After winter, spring.

At least spring has been steadily creeping up on us. Birds have been gathering dried grass and twigs for nests. First leaves have lit up the Indian plum shrubs. The sun shines hot, even if the wind blows cold, with summer in the light and winter in the shade.

The days are lengthening. Blossom by blossom the spring has been unfolding, with snowdrops, crocuses, daffodils, and blooming quince and cherry trees.

Many of these signs are daylight and temperature dependent. They arrive with some consistency every year, with leeway of a week or three or four, as inevitable as the planet circles the sun. Yes, hold on — life will get warmer.

Other local signs of spring are less sure this year. The bass-note cruise-ship hoots and toots will be missing from Victoria’s springtime soundscape. Due to concerns about COVID-19, Transport Canada has banned boats and cruise ships carrying more than 500 people from docking at Canadian ports until July.

The 290 ship-visit season had been set to begin in Victoria April 3, with the arrival of the Grand Princess.

Almost 115 cruise-ship arrivals will not take place this spring — and almost 300,000 passengers they would have brought to the city won’t be visiting.

That’s not what Victoria city council had in mind last year when it passed a motion to limit the number of cruise ships allowed to dock in the city each year until the industry takes significant steps to be greener. It’s not what council had in mind in January when it passed a motion to possibly increase cruise ship waste-dumping fees in the region.

Yet the result will be the same. In James Bay this year, signs of spring will not include diesel exhaust from ships in port running their generators to power their facilities, the sound of those engines rumbling day and night, nor the usual cruise-related traffic.

And while the days grow longer and warmer and the cherry blossoms peak, then wane, local businesses and people who rely on tourism will feel a deep, lingering winter chill this year. The cancelled cruise visits alone could mean at least $50 million less economic activity in the region.

Government directives to postpone non-essential international travel, bans on non-Canadians entering the country from overseas, restrictions on where international flights can land, cancellation of large events and public gatherings, increased social distancing and self-isolation — these and other changes to how we go about our lives will delay the gearing up of activity and industry we normally see at this time of year.

An economic Lent is advancing, and a financial winter, with its hardscrabble, hunker-down discontent, is extending its reach into April, May and June.

No Times Colonist 10K run, provincials hockey, Capital City Comic Con, or performances will occur until further notice. The University of Victoria has cancelled many classes, with some courses switching to delivery methods that don’t involve in-person gatherings. Brick-and-mortar schools are closed indefinitely. Bars and pubs are shuttered, and restaurants are advised to apply the government’s social distancing directives.

It’s a crisis. But this too will pass. A month ago, health officials were hoping to eliminate the COVID-19 virus, much as happened after the 2003 SARS epidemic. Now, they’re seeking to slow its spread and delay its peak until after flu and cold season — all to relieve pressure on the health-care system, give health authorities time to prepare and give scientists time to develop a workable vaccine or find anti-viral medications that slow the virus’s advance.

They’ve accepted that the virus will eventually establish itself throughout populations around the world, much as influenza and cold viruses have.

We will adapt, one way or another.

No winter and no pandemic lasts forever. Spring — however we define it and by whatever signs we characterize — will come. What it will look like is another question.

Many people are thinking about making changes to how and where they live these days, as working from home, a healthier lifestyle and more space become more important to them.

Norfolk County, a 90-minute drive from Toronto, is increasingly attracting new residents, both as part-time and full-time property owners. A large region best known for being on the shores of Lake Erie, the area encompasses charming lakeside towns like Port Dover, and stunningly beautiful parkland like the Long Point National Wildlife Area.

Cindy Pichette, broker of record for Gold Coast Real Estate, has lived in the county for more than 25 years. “I came here on a day trip over two decades ago and I fell in love with it,” she says. “I found a real sense of community – one where people really care about one another.”

Others looking for cottages or a new permanent residence are likely to discover that as well, plus so much more. For vacationers, Norfolk County is an ideal alternative to northern locales such as Muskoka, Haliburton and The Kawarthas.

“Things don’t close up here for the winter,” explains Pichette. “We’re an affordable, four-season destination. You can get lakeside properties for much less than you would in other places. And a short commute means you won’t be stuck in traffic for hours trying to get there.”

There are some great properties available for sale, she adds, whether you’re looking for a homey cottage or a family compound spacious enough to accommodate guests. Notable listings worth considering include:

Outside, the landscaping may remind you of Muskoka, but this area offers greater affordability for lakeside living without the crowds or the traffic, ideal for families and for those who desire a more leisurely pace of life, including sitting back with an ice-cold beverage and taking in the glorious sunsets.

“People come to Norfolk County for the lifestyle it offers,” says Pichette. “Those who are tired of big cities like the abundance of space, peace and security, and the ability to enjoy an active life.”

That could include birdwatching at Long Point (home to more than 400 species), boating, golfing, year-round fishing, walking on the beach, ziplining, festivals, farmers’ markets, biking and hiking on converted rail trails, and touring artisan studios. “Life here is reminiscent of a simpler time,” she adds. “I call it ‘small-town adorable.’”

Although the pre-pandemic allures of Toronto are not too far away, many people in this picturesque region can find everything they need locally, including topnotch food and drink options.

Norfolk County is also known as Ontario’s Garden; thanks to the sandy soil and longer growing season, it produces most of Ontario’s asparagus, tart cherries, strawberries, pumpkins and squash. For people who appreciate everything from craft beer to free-range eggs, homemade pies and field-fresh produce, it’s a foodie’s paradise. It’s also becoming more of a well-known wine region, with nine booming wineries and the popular “Toast the Coast” wine trail.

With that in mind, why not give yourself a treat and take a day or two to explore the possibilites.

A long-stalled addition to the Château Laurier is closer to being built following an agreement between the historic hotel’s owners and a heritage group that fought initial plans.

Heritage Ottawa says a new design for the addition would preserve a picturesque view of the landmark’s rear courtyard and better mesh with the adjacent Rideau Canal.

The group is also applauding the use of Indiana limestone cladding and copper and bronze elements that reflect defining elements of the early 20th-century structure near Parliament Hill.

Original plans for the addition were widely panned by critics, variously described as resembling a giant air conditioner, shipping container or radiator tacked on to the regal building.

Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson tweeted he was pleased to see the parties had worked collaboratively and agreed on a new design.

Going stir crazy after five months in lockdown? Finding ways to get out of the house can help. Why not take a staycation?

A staycation is the perfect remedy for the lockdown blues; it combines the convenience of staying in your own city with the glamour and excitement of a vacation. Better yet, do it in Canada’s liveliest urban hub: The Radisson Admiral Hotel Toronto-Harbourfront offers serene lakeside views and proximity to all that downtown has to offer.

It’s the ideal stay “for people that are really curious about the city,” says the hotel’s general manager Nathalie Lalonde. So, get out of the house, and visit a Radisson hotel to begin your next urban adventure.

Explore Toronto by bike

The Radisson Admiral’s proximity to Toronto’s harbourfront makes it easy to explore the southernmost region of the city. Wander the boardwalk and feel Lake Ontario’s fresh breeze before hopping on a Toronto Bike Share bike and taking the Martin Goodman Trail west of the downtown core. On weekends, look out for road closures along Lakeshore Boulevard – the stretches of highway are currently reserved for bicycle use only on Saturdays and Sundays. The vast, open road offers plenty of space for first-timers and avid cyclists, alike.

Wine and dine

Toronto’s harbourfront boasts a wide range of restaurants and cafes, many of which have continued offering takeout throughout the pandemic.

As you head out of the hotel, visit Cafè Locale, located adjacent to the hotel’s main lobby for a delicious cup of coffee or a salad and sandwich. A menu of fresh brews and baked goods is accompanied by a range of iced teas, smoothies and gelatos, ideal for hot summer days. The café also sells Flying Hound pupsicles for four-legged friends. In fact, you might spot Lalonde here picking up her morning chai latte or mid-afternoon matcha. “Cafè Locale is a really nice place to be,” Lalonde says.

For excellent views of the lake, head to Boxcar Social for a cortado or latte overlooking the water. Beer lovers should check out Amsterdam BrewHouse, where fresh, creative beers are crafted and served from its on-site brewery. Both spots are open for takeout and patio dining.

Adventure through Ripley’s aquarium

Families and staycationers of any age will appreciate spending a day wandering through Ripley’s Aquarium of Canada. Recently reopened with a new set of safety protocols, the aquarium is home to over 20,000 aquatic animals. See sharks up-close in the lagoon gallery – a conveyer belt that runs through a tunnel-shaped tank – and pet four species of stingray in the Ray Bay gallery. This immersive aquarium is unlike any other, and it’s just a seven-minute walk from Radisson Admiral Hotel Toronto-Harbourfront.

Head outside the city

Those looking for a getaway from the city can easily venture to the beaches of Toronto Islands by ferry or Tiki Taxi – small, private cab-style boats that cost around $10 each way. Recently reopened to the public, the stretch of 15 islands offer relaxing beaches, toe and bike paths and canoe and kayak rentals. Take the kids, a few drinks or a good book and spend the day in the sand.

Rest and rejuvenate

After a long day exploring the city, return to Radisson Admiral Hotel Toronto-Harbourfront for a home-away-from-home experience. Squeeze in a run along the harbourfront, or dip into the Lakeview Pool Lounge, the fifth-floor outdoor pool that offers ample lounging space, cocktail and bottle service, weekend barbecues and impeccable views of the lake.

Those planning trips for cooler days can look forward to seeing the Radisson Admiral Hotel Toronto-Harbourfront with a whole new look. As it converts to an upscale Radisson Blu later this year, the waterfront hotel is ushering in new amenities across all 157 of its rooms, including new corridors, mattresses, bedding and wall art. “We have pictures of Toronto to match the beautiful views of the CN Tower and Lake Ontario from our rooms,” Lalonde says.

Additionally, Radisson Admiral Hotel Toronto-Harbourfront has implemented the Radisson Hotels Safety Protocol program in partnership with SGS, the world’s leading inspection, verification, testing and certification company. The in-depth 20-step cleanliness and disinfection protocols ensure guest safety and peace of mind from check-in to check-out. So, leave the worrying to Radisson Hotels and enjoy your time away.

Please note: Due to COVID-19, the hours and availability of food service, pools, fitness centres and other amenities may be disrupted — contact Radisson Admiral Hotel Toronto-Harbourfront directly for specific details.

Hydro says the number of electric-vehicle drivers using EV charging stations has rebounded to near pre-pandemic levels.

In February, before the COVID-19 pandemic hit B.C., there were more than 21,000 charging sessions at B.C. Hydro’s 70 stations across the province.

However, the company says the number dropped by nearly 20 per cent after residents began to work from home, and were down 30 per cent by April to 12,700.

Since then, charging sessions have increased by almost 50 per cent since the lowest point in April, according to a B.C. Hydro report Friday, and there were 20,000 charging sessions in the month of June.

B.C. Hydro says the most popular charging location is at the Superstore on Grandview Highway in Vancouver, likely due to its proximity to Highway 1.

Other popular charging stations near major roads or highways include Colwood Park on Vancouver Island, Britton Creek Rest Area in the Fraser Valley and Tournament Capital Centre in Kamloops.

The company says the frequency of charging at its highway stations indicates more people are commuting or taking road trips in an EV.

B.C. Hydro is encouraging EV drivers to charge at home as much as possible during the pandemic, but says it recognizes many customers rely on public charging infrastructure.

During those 30 years one thing has never changed for Bos. She has always dreamed of one day owning lakefront — specifically land on the west side of the lake that looks directly across the waters to Mt. Baldy. Her ideal property is located in front of her main residence, which is tucked away in the woods behind a country road lined with large cedars. Bos’ home, while close to the lake, doesn’t have lake access or an unobstructed waterfront view, while this preferred property has both.

article continues below

Besides its great outlook the property has two small cabins on it, which were built during the early days of Shawnigan Lake’s cottage history. They were owned by a Victoria lawyer, who bought them in 1957 and only used them in summer.

“I used to walk down in the winter months to this spot and wish I could buy this place,” says Bos, standing near a picnic table with a gorgeous view of the lake and an arbutus tree near the water’s edge.

Getting to realize her dream of owning her “piece of paradise” didn’t come easy for Bos, who had to do it on her own as a single woman. She was separated in January, 2017 and finances were tight.

But she was determined. When Bos heard the owners planned to sell the property she was able to secure a private mortgage in order to make the deal happen quickly before it hit the MLS.

While many others would have torn down the humble cabins to build something modern that didn’t happen with Bos. “Necessity is the mother of invention I couldn’t afford to tear them down and rebuild so the only option was to fix them up. And then it became a story of ignorance is bliss and hindsight is 20/20. I’m not sure that I would do it again but then again, seeing the result, I can’t imagine not,” she says.

Bos took possession of her beloved lakefront property, becoming its third owner, in November, 2019. Although she finally had her lakefront a new desire was born. Bos wanted to create a unique vacation rental, which helps the property pay for itself.

As Shawnigan Lake continues to gain popularity, with many of the old-time cottages torn down and replaced by new builds, there are few opportunities for vacationers to experience life at the lake in the “good old days”- albeit with modern-day amenities, like wifi and air conditioning.

After acquiring the property Bos immediately began fixing up the cabins in order to welcome her first guests this summer on July 4th. Help came from many friends who Bos calls her “Shawnigan Angels.”

“Because of COVID no one could get away on vacation. I think for some I was entertainment value. They would come around to see what I was up to and offer help. Some would bring me food to keep me going, offer to paint furniture, fix items, bring me give gifts,” she says.

One friend, who wanted to be a professional water skier, gave Bos her wooden slalom water ski, dating back to 1950. It’s now on display in the larger cabin.

Since Bos’ background is in marketing, she put her skills to good use and created a vision for the cabins starting with the name, “Vintage Cabins, where life is, still.”

“Vintage Cabins also indicates that it is a place with history, not a 5-star accommodation but a place where you take your shoes off, a ‘muck-about’ space where you come in off the lake dripping wet and run into the cabin to grab a snack with the screen door banging behind you. The screen door was rebuilt and kept just for this reason,” she says.

Bos also drew on the history of the first home owners, calling the larger cabin, at 750 sq. ft., The Tailor’s Cabin since it was built by tailor William Cuzner in 1912. Her logo is a needle and thread in honor of the tailor.

According to his granddaughter, Cuzner came to Shawnigan Lake, by train, then rowed across the lake to this spot to build a home so his two sons could study at Shawnigan Lake School. He logged some of the trees on the property, to build the cabin then ran his business out of a small nook in one of the corners.

That nook was repurposed by Bos as a small games space, with a card table, vintage children’s book and toys, and in another nod to Cuzner, an old sewing box and wooden measuring stick. These are just a few of the curated vintage items in the cabin, adding to the cabin’s relaxed ambience.

The story goes Cuzner also wanted his two sons to learn construction so he taught them how to build the smaller of the two cabins in 1945. That cabin, called The Birdhouse, is appropriately decorated with vintage birdhouses and carved wooden birds. On its outdoor porch is a sheltered office with a display cabinet made from old water skis.

The decor of both cabins shows Bos’ keen eye and smart design choices.

“It’s easy to junk up a space so I’m trying hard not to have too much stuff,” she says.

Many of the pieces she has brought in are not only beautiful in their form but serve a function. For instance, Bos took an old suitcase and repurposed it as a side table, used a vintage, wooden shoe form as a doorstop and turned an old hat mould into a unique mirror.

But before she could have fun decorating the hard work needed to happen to get the cabins in good working order, since they were in rough shape after years of deferred maintenance.

“I had to gut the kitchen [of the Tailor’s Cabin]. When the ceiling was ripped out it snowed insulation and rat fees. The rafters were chewed from carpenter ants so it had to be all cleared out. I let it air out literally for a couple of months,” she says.

The kitchen now is full of country charm with bead board, vintage red cabinets and a gleaming white sink, from a kindergarten classroom and cleaned up. She was also able to reuse the appliances after giving them a good clean.

Another big task was ensuring the cabins were structurally sound. In the case of the Tailor’s Cabin one of its main corner posts rests on an old log stump. The cabin still stands on the stump, but its structural support has been reinforced. A happy result of shoring up the house was one of the original windows that didn’t open for decades now functions properly.

That cabin still has the original bottle glass, dating back to the early 1900s, so the lakeside windows here provide a charming “looking glass” view of the lake and Mt. Baldy beyond.

Other necessary property work that had to be done included a new septic field, new driveway, upgrading the plumbing and electrical and doing the landscaping, which meant removing decades of Salal, and rotten trees found on the property.

Then there was the business of building new decks to take advantage of the view, and bringing in two docks -one private for guests and the other Bos shares with them so she can continue to get out on the lake and enjoy water skiing.

“This has been my passion project. I just feel so blessed now that it’s done,” she says.

Or is it? Bos is considering converting an old shed on the property into either a sleeping cabana or a place of stillness.

Most travellers to southern France’s Provence region will visit Arles and Avignon, but ignore nearby Nîmes. While those two towns have name recognition and greater touristic appeal, Nîmes feels richer and more authentic. A visit to this thriving town rewards you with impressive Roman monuments and peaceful, pedestrian-polished streets that feel like a secret between its well-heeled residents.

Born a Celtic city about 500 BC, Nîmes joined the Roman Empire in the first century BC Emperor Augustus made it a regional capital whose importance merited fine architecture, one of the longest protective walls in the Roman world, and a nearly 50-kilometre-long aqueduct to bring water to its growing population.

The core of Roman Nîmes was a temple called Maison Carrée (“Square House,” named before they had a word for rectangle). The temple rivals Rome’s Pantheon as the most complete and splendid building that survives from the Roman Empire. Maison Carrée survived in part because it has been in constant use for the past thousand years — from a temple to a church, to a city hall, to a people’s art gallery after the Revolution, and finally, as the monument travellers see today.

Nîmes also had an impressive amphitheatre for entertaining residents. Today, this arena — one of the best-preserved of the Roman world — is a superb example of Roman engineering, with its perfectly symmetrical oval shape, seating for 24,000 spectators, 60 passageways to prevent bottlenecks, a system of underground rooms and a lift used to hoist animals up to the floor for gladiator games. Touring the place provides an interesting history lesson, and climbing to the top offers the rare opportunity to enjoy city views from the nosebleed seats of a Roman arena.

Facing the arena is the Roman World Museum (Musée de la Romanité), with its high-tech interactive stations that help show off 5,000 artifacts from Roman Nîmes (plus a few from pre-Roman and medieval times). A highlight is its rich collection of Latin-inscribed stones and mosaics — some of which were discovered when digging the garage for the site.

As one of ancient Europe’s privileged cities, Nîmes needed a reliable water supply. So in about 19 BC, the Romans built a 50-kilometre-long aqueduct. While most of the aqueduct is on or below ground, one stretch is especially impressive: the Pont du Gard. About 30 minutes northeast of Nîmes, this bridge stretches over the Gardon River and is one of the most remarkable surviving Roman ruins anywhere.

Throughout the ancient world, aqueducts heralded the greatness of Rome. Even after many visits here, I’m forever impressed by the skill of ancient Roman engineers. This structure, built with perfectly cut stones fitted together without mortar, was designed to slope ever so slightly — less than an inch every hundred yards — to let water flow effortlessly into Nîmes.

There are many ways to enjoy the Pont du Gard. Visitors can hike to viewpoints, join a guided walking tour through the top channel of the aqueduct, and see its fine museum, where exhibits show the immensity of the undertaking. Summers are a great time to visit, as you can enjoy a picnic by the water, swim or canoe in the river and stay into the evening, when a light show is projected on the monument.

After seeing the Pont du Gard, it’s especially interesting to visit the castellum of Nîmes, the distribution tank marking the end of the aqueduct. Examining the castellum’s water-distribution holes, you can appreciate them as evidence of Roman Nîmes’ social compassion. The lower channel served top-priority needs, providing water via stone and lead pipes to the public wells that graced neighbourhood squares. The higher holes — which got wet only when the supply was plentiful — routed water to the homes of the wealthy, to public baths, and to nonessential fountains.

While Nîmes is most notable for its Roman sights, the city offers other things to enjoy, such as the carefully preserved old centre and thriving market hall. Another fine activity is strolling the Jardin de la Fontaine, a lavish park filled with Baroque sculptures and an ornate network of canals and paths. Finished just 50 years after the construction of Versailles, the Jardin de la Fontaine has special significance to the French, as these were the first grand gardens not meant for a king, but for the public.

Perhaps the most appealing part of Nîmes is its mellowness. It’s a great place to slow down and enjoy the inviting café scene, wander the traffic-free lanes, and savour a tranquil, less-touristed slice of southern France.

Iceland, with cinematic scenery showcasing nature in its rawest form, thrills outdoorsy travellers. Known for the midnight sun and northern lights, this fascinating island is equally famous for its magnificent glaciers and volcanoes.

Among the country’s unforgettable experiences is a tour into a dormant volcano. The Thríhnúkagígur volcano, a half-hour drive from Iceland’s capital city Reykjavík, last erupted about 4,000 years ago. When its magma drained out, a cavity big enough to hold the Statue of Liberty remained.

Today, via a pricey six-hour Inside the Volcano tour (which includes three-kilometre hikes to and from the volcano), you can ride a lift through a squeezy opening at the volcano’s top, then 122 metres down into its vast chamber. Inside, lamps bring out the chamber’s pastel colors, and water, seeping through its ceiling, rains down lightly as you explore the bouldery floor.

For a shorter (one-hour) and much cheaper volcanic experience, you can visit Raufarhólshellir, billed as The Lava Tunnel — a 40-minute drive from Reykjavík. This 5,000-year-old lava tube was carved by a river of molten rock that was forced to burrow deeper after its surface had hardened. When the lava drained out, it left behind an extensive tunnel covered in colourful formations.

After passing beneath a few “skylights” where the ceiling had collapsed, you enter the intact lava tube — as big as a railroad tunnel in places. Subtle lighting brings out the tube’s soft colours and fanciful features. At the turnaround point you can experience a few minutes of utter darkness when the guide shuts off the lights.

Above ground, glacier hiking is a quintessential Icelandic experience. About 10% of Iceland is covered by glaciers, and the Sólheimajökull glacier on the South Coast is one of the most accessible.

There, several companies offer excursions of varying lengths and difficulty. A half-day outing with Icelandic Mountain Guides starts with a walk past an iceberg-filled lagoon to the foot of the glacier. Then the guide helps attach spiky crampons to your boots for the climb up spooky-looking canyons of ice and black ash.

Once on top, Sólheimajökull is smoother and whiter. As you crunch across the ice, the guide explains how the glacier moves, where those mysterious cones of black ash come from, how gaping sinkholes appear, and how climate change is melting the ice so rapidly that Sólheimajökull could disappear within a century.

Even on regular land, Iceland is a wonderland for hikers. Tórsmörk — “Thor’s Woods” — is a top destination, with well-marked trails leading to thrilling views over volcanoes, glaciers, and valleys.

Since it’s accessible only on gravel roads that require fording rushing rivers and streams, most visitors get there aboard specially equipped, jacked-up buses.

The main reason to visit Tórsmörk is the glorious hike to the top of Valahnúkur mountain. Starting from the visitors complex in Húsadalur Valley, the hike to the summit is less than two kilometres, but it’s staircase-steep in stretches and gains 275 metres in elevation.

On top, your sweat earns you a commanding view of three glacier-topped volcanoes, including the notorious Eyjafjallajökull, whose 2010 eruptions choked European air travel. Far below, the wide Markárfljót river valley sprawls to your north and the Krossá river valley to the south, their glacier-fed torrents rushing toward the sea.

For those who prefer that someone else do the hiking, horseback riding in Iceland is a special experience.

The descendants of ponies brought here by Viking settlers, Icelandic horses are small, strong and docile.

They’re renowned for their five gaits: Along with walk, trot and gallop, they have two extra “gears” — the tölt, which is fast and extremely smooth, and the high-speed “flying pace.”

A whale-watching cruise offers a more leisurely experience and a chance to spy the elusive whales of the North Atlantic. You can expect to see dolphins, porpoises and midsize minke whales (seen on local menus) rather than big humpback or blue whales.

Several tours depart from Reykjavík, but locals say the best whale-watching is in North Iceland, from the towns of Húsavík and Akureyri.

For all its ruggedness, Iceland also has its comforts — an abundance of thermal baths heated by the island’s geothermal energy. From touristy “premium” baths such as the Blue Lagoon to municipal pools favoured by locals, a thermal bath is only a short drive. Imagine wrapping up a vigorous day of exploring Iceland’s magnificent outdoors with a soothing soak in 38 C water. Aaaaahhh!

From volcano chamber explorations to geothermal pool plunges, Iceland offers adventures and activities that you can’t easily do anywhere else.

The state Department of Natural Resources said Thursday that it intends to negotiate with the University of Alaska’s Museum of the North to display the bus, which was popularized by the book ""Into the Wild"" and a movie of the same name and flown from its location near Denali National Park and Preserve last month.

""Of the many expressions of interest in the bus, the proposal from the UA Museum of the North best met the conditions we at DNR had established to ensure this historical and cultural object will be preserved in a safe location where the public could experience it fully, yet safely and respectfully, and without the spectre of profiteering,"" Natural Resources Commissioner Corri Feige said in a statement.

The bus became a beacon for those wishing to retrace the steps of Christopher McCandless, who hiked to the bus in 1992. The 24-year-old Virginia man died from starvation when he couldn’t hike back out because of the swollen Teklanika River. He kept a journal of his ordeal, which was discovered when his body was found.

McCandless’ story became famous with author Jon Krakauer’s 1996 book ""Into the Wild,"" followed nine years later by director Sean Penn’s movie of the same name.

Over the years, people from around the world have travelled to the bus, located about 25 miles (40 kilometres) from the town of Healy, to pay homage to McCandless.

Two women have drowned in the Teklanika River on such visits to the bus, one from Switzerland in 2010 and the other from Belarus nine years later. There have been 15 other search-and-rescue missions since 2009, state officials said, including five Italian tourists who needed rescue last winter. One had severe frostbite.

The draw of the bus became too much for state officials, who arranged for the Alaska Army National Guard to remove the bus with a helicopter last month as part of a training mission.

The former Fairbanks city bus is sometimes called Bus 142 or the Magic Bus. It was later used to house construction workers building a road in the area. It was abandoned in 1961, and became a shelter for those using the backcountry to recreate or hunt.

The department received dozens of suggestions for use of the bus that came from individuals, museums and institutions nationwide, with varying plans to preserve, exhibit, monetize or memorialize it, Feige said.

The department decided to consider the university’s proposal, which had several advantages. It’s just one of three official state repositories, and the only one in the Fairbanks area able to accept and curate state-owned historical items. The museum also has the staff to restore, curate and display the bus.

This proposal also allows the Department of Natural Resources to retain ownership of the bus, and decide future uses, including whether to lend it out for display and where.

""I believe that giving Bus 142 a long-term home in Fairbanks at the UA Museum of the North can help preserve and tell the stories of all these people,"" Feige said. ""It can honour all of the lives and dreams, as well as the deaths and sorrows associated with the bus, and do so with respect and dignity.""

The report by the Themed Entertainment Association and the Economics Practice at AECOM said that overall attendance at the 10 biggest theme park operators in the world grew by 4% last year and climbed to 521 million visits, according to the report.

The report only looked at attendance in 2019 and didn't take into account the disruptions in the industry this year caused by the spreading coronavirus, which forced parks to close for months at a time. Parks that have reopened are operating with limits on attendance so guests can maintain social distancing. Attendance at the parks could be anywhere from a third to half of normal business volume, according to the report.

""However, it may take one to several years to return to pre-COVID operating levels, and the investment horizon of many owners may be altered due to cash flow loss,"" the report said.

Attendance at Disney theme parks around the world fell less than 1% in 2019 from the previous year. Disney is the largest theme park operator in the world by attendance.

Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World in Florida kept its title as the world's most visited park last year, with 20.9 million visits, a half per cent increase over the previous year. It was followed by Disneyland in California with 18.6 million visits, Tokyo Disneyland with 17.9 million visits and Tokyo DisneySea. All of those parks were flat from the previous year.

The flat attendance is likely due to an effort by Disney to limit entry, while charging higher prices, so that visitors have a more enjoyable experience, though in Hong Kong, a 15% drop was the result of tourism disruptions caused by protests for political reforms, the report said.

Competing in many of the same markets as Disney, Universal Parks and Resorts had an attendance jump of 2.3%, with 51.2 million visits. Most of that growth came from Universal's Islands of Adventure in Florida where attendance grew by 6%, powered by the addition of the Harry Potter-themed steel coaster, Hagrid’s Magical Creatures Motorbike Adventure.

Rides based on Harry Potter intellectual property continued to drive growth at the Universal parks, the report said.

Among domestic U.S. operators, Cedar Fair Entertainment Co. had the strongest growth, with a 7.8% jump in attendance, driven by investments in new rides.

Chinese operators grew rapidly in 2019, with attendance at parks owned by the Fantawild Group increasing by 19.8% and visits at parks owned by Oct Group growing by 9.4%.

The report noted that the theme park industry has survived disruptions in the past over health and security concerns.

""While acknowledging the serious nature and consequences of the current pandemic, history shows us that people’s behaviour, with some exceptions, largely returns to normal once the threat is removed,"" the report said.

On the one hand, the lack of crowds means more opportunities to go on rides without long waits. On the other hand, Connecticut and Florida have implemented pandemic-related quarantines for each other's residents and visitors, and the Barkers worry whether the Disney ""magic"" will get lost with mandatory mask-wearing for visitors and workers, temperature checks and no parades, fireworks shows or up-close ""meet-and-greets"" with costumed characters.

""We keep going back and forth. It's such a hard decision to make,"" Barker said last Tuesday.

Two weeks after Disney World started opening its theme parks for the first time since closing in March because of COVID-19, the Barkers' quandary affects not only Disney World's future but that of central Florida's tourism-reliant economy.

More than 75 million visitors came to Orlando in 2018, mostly due to its reputation as a theme park mecca, which also includes Universal Orlando and SeaWorld Orlando. But the coronavirus has upended Orlando's status as the most visited place in the U.S.

In the week that Disney World's Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom started welcoming back visitors, occupancy of hotel rooms in the Orlando area was down more than 60% from the previous year, a much deeper drop than the state as a whole, which declined more than 41%, according to STR, which tracks hotel data.

Less than half of Disney World's 43,000 unionized workers have been recalled to their old jobs, contributing to two Orlando-area counties having the state's highest unemployment rates last month — Osceola at 22.9% and Orange at 17.2%. Disney World has an overall workforce of 77,000 employees, the nation's largest single-site labour force.

Many of those still-furloughed workers are about to lose federal benefits at the end of the month.

""This is an extremely difficult moment,"" said Paul Cox, president of the local union that represents stagehands and show technicians at Disney World. ""There are still a majority of workers who are staying at home and they’re about to lose support. Things are going to get bad.""

Union officials estimate the Disney parks are no more than a third full, but that may be more by design to maintain social distancing. Disney World doesn't release attendance figures, but in pre-pandemic times its four parks and two water parks could host around 150,000 visitors a day.

Florida has had a surging coronavirus caseload recently, and other Disney parks around the globe have run into coronavirus-related roadblocks. Hong Kong Disneyland Park was forced to close earlier this month following the city’s decision to ban public gatherings of more than four people, and Disney's California parks delayed reopening while they awaited state guidelines.

Cowen Inc. estimated recently that Disney's parks and resorts won't return to pre-pandemic profitability until fiscal year 2025, and there is a ""meaningful"" probability that Disney World could close again because of the pandemic.

Leaders of the Disney World workers' unions describe the virus-related safety measures Disney has taken as ""exemplary.""

After workers complained about patrons walking around with their masks pulled down while eating food like turkey legs, Disney World updated its mandatory mask policy, requiring visitors to eat in one place while maintaining social distancing.

In response to other worker concerns, Disney has distributed personal hand sanitizer containers for workers to wear on their belts, added additional break rooms to limit the number of workers in them and reduced the number of riders on buses that shuttle workers from parking lots to the parks. Performers dressed as Disney princesses being driven in a horse-powered carriage through the parks now sit individually in rows separated by clear-plastic window partitions.

""Singing their praises seems so strange,"" said Julee Jerkovich, an official with a United Food & Commercial Workers union, which represents Disney merchandise and banquet workers. ""As far as this grand experiment, I would have to say Disney has done a really good job.""

But not all unions are happy. The union that represents actors and singers has filed a grievance with Disney World, saying their 750 members were locked out of returning to work after they complained about Disney ignoring their demands for getting coronavirus tests since they can’t wear masks while performing. Some performers, though, are eager to return to work and are pushing the union to reach an agreement with the company, as they worry about Disney replacing their shows with temporary ones featuring non-actors.

Actor's Equity Association fired a new salvo against Disney over the weekend by tweeting a re-edited version of a welcome-back video produced by the company featuring workers preparing the park for visitors. In Equity’s version, a rolling count of Florida’s coronavirus cases runs on the screen.

There have been isolated cases of workers and visitors connected to the theme parks getting sick with COVID-19, ""but we haven’t seen any large number of positive cases that come from any of the parks,"" Dr. Raul Pino, health officer for Florida's Department of Health, said last Monday.

Disney's policy of granting sick workers with paid time off so they can quarantine has made a difference, said Eric Clinton, president of Unite Here! Local 362, which represents Disney World park greeters, attractions workers and custodians.

But Clinton wonders if the current operating model can last until the pandemic is over, given that just over 20,000 of the 43,000 workers represented by unions have returned to work, only half of Disney World's 30 onsite hotels currently are back open and several in-park restaurants still are closed.

""Disney is a strong brand. They have a great product, but does the novelty wear off? Do people want to go to a theme park now? Is it more appealing with less crowds?"" Clinton said. ""I’m hopeful but nervous.""

Here’s a reminder of the fun that awaits us in Europe at the other end of this crisis.

I love exploring the world of ancient Rome, with its grand architecture, fascinating culture, and stories of larger-than-life leaders. But since many of the 2,000-year-old empire’s landmarks are reduced to ruins, it can be hard to make sense of the stones and rubble left behind.

To get a clearer picture of what everyday life in ancient Rome was really like, visit the well-preserved (and unlucky) city of Pompeii. Located just south of Naples, Pompeii was founded in 600 BC and eventually grew from its Greek and Etruscan roots into a bustling Roman trading city and port.

Neither rich nor poor, Pompeii was a typical middle-class town. To serve its 20,000 residents, the city boasted more than 40 bakeries, 130 bars, and plenty of public baths. Being a port, it also had brothels, restaurants, and entertainment venues that catered to sailors from all over the Roman world — many of whom didn’t speak a lick of Latin. Most of Pompeii’s buildings were covered in brilliant white ground-marble stucco, making it an impressive sight. And from its richly decorated forum, people had a postcard-perfect view of the looming volcano, Mount Vesuvius.

Then on Aug. 24, AD 79, everything changed. At about 1 p.m., Vesuvius sent a mushroom cloud of ash, dust, and rocks 20 kilometres into the sky. It spewed for 18 hours straight, as winds blew the cloud south toward the city. The white-grey ash settled like a heavy snow on Pompeii, its weight eventually collapsing roofs and floors (but leaving walls standing). Though most of Pompeii’s residents fled, 2,000 stayed behind.

A bad move, because the next morning a red-hot pyroclastic flow struck Pompeii, dealing a fatal blow to those who had remained, and burying the city under nine metres of volcanic ash.

After the eruption, people from nearby towns tried in vain to find the buried city. Because Pompeii was a major port, people naturally searched for it near the sea. But the eruption had filled in the harbour and pushed the coastline out, meaning Pompeii now lay inland — and its location would remain a mystery for more than 1,500 years.

In 1599, Pompeii was accidentally rediscovered during construction of a canal. Serious excavations began in 1748 and are still ongoing, making Pompeii the longest-continually-excavated site in the world.

Ironically, the ash that had destroyed Pompeii also ensured its preservation, leaving it frozen in time. As a result, its ruins offer the best look anywhere at life in an ancient Roman town, with its gridded street plan, villas and homes, commercial buildings, public baths, and colourful frescoes left remarkably intact.

Pompeii also exhibits small signs of everyday life. In the town’s many “fast food” joints, holes in the counter show where containers once held food for hungry customers to grab as a quick meal. Public drinking fountains still stand along the city’s main streets, many of which would have been lined with stalls and jammed with customers from sunup to sundown. And if you look closely at some of the walls, bright red graffiti pops out exclaiming that Julius was here.

Of course, the most compelling scenes in Pompeii are provided by its (permanent) residents. While excavating, modern archeologists detected hollow spaces in the volcanic debris that were created when victims’ bodies decomposed. By gently filling in the holes with plaster, the archeologists created molds of the Pompeiians who were caught in the disaster. The plaster casts show remarkable details — the folds of togas, the straps of sandals, the pained expressions on victims’ faces. Signs of animals have also been found, including a saddled-up horse that appears ready to carry its master to safety.

To complement your Pompeii visit, stop by the National Archaeological Museum in Naples. The museum is home to Pompeii’s finest art and artifacts, including a display (in the “Secret Room”) of erotic frescoes that were considered so bawdy that by the time they made it here, in 1819, they could be viewed only with permission from the king. (From Naples, Pompeii is easily reached via a CitySightseeing bus or the handy — but shabby — Circumvesuviana commuter train.)

Excavations at Pompeii experienced a renaissance in 2018, when new artifacts and skeletons were discovered in a section of the city yet to be fully unearthed. With fresh secrets sure to be revealed over time, evocative Pompeii will be worth visiting again and again.

But the mayor of Gaspe, Que., a popular tourist destination on the Gaspe peninsula's eastern coast, is concerned some visitors are camping anywhere they find space, harming the environment and upsetting locals.

""We're seeing a lot of tents on public beaches, in forests, on private land without the approval of the owners of that land,"" Mayor Daniel Cote said in an interview Thursday.

Cote said he had high hopes tourists would come to the Gaspe this summer despite the pandemic. Authorities had closed off the region to outsiders earlier this year to stop the spread of COVID-19.

But Cote said he was caught off guard by the number of tourists who arrived without hotel or camping reservations. ""People invaded public beaches and decided that that's where they would set up camp,"" he said.

A series of photos posted on Facebook Wednesday showed tents and camping chairs lined up along a beach, as well as empty beer cans and other garbage littering the sand. The Canadian Press could not independently verify the photos, which purportedly were taken at Haldimand Beach in Gaspe.

The post was shared nearly 600 times as of Thursday afternoon and garnered over 300 comments, many of which criticize the tourists and demand the town take action. Cote said public beaches are under provincial authority, so the municipality has limited means to intervene.

But he said Gaspe intends to hire people to patrol busy public areas and inform visitors of the rules, which include a ban on driving vehicles on public beaches and to safely dispose trash.

The town is also working with Quebec provincial police and the nearby Mi'kmaq Nation of Gespeg to protect the area, Cote added. ""As a municipality we don't have coercive power to force people to leave the areas ... so we're going to go with raising awareness.""

In a statement Thursday, officials with the Mi'kmaq Nation of Gespeg said unregulated camping in the area had gotten ""out of control"" and was negatively affecting local wildlife and ecosystems.

""On the beaches, washed up wood, which is important for slowing erosion, is being burned without knowledge of its consequences,"" the statement reads. ""Migratory birds are being disturbed on their nesting grounds. We cannot even keep track of the amount of waste that litters the waters, the beaches, the parking lots, and rest areas.""

The regional public health authority launched an awareness campaign this month to prevent the potential spread of COVID-19 in the Gaspe region amid the wave of tourists.

Small teams are being deployed across the region to make sure people are respecting public health guidelines, explained Clemence Beaulieu-Gendron, a spokeswoman for CISSS de la Gaspesie. She said several local mayors have asked the public health teams to come to their towns.

So far, a team of four outreach workers is working in the area of Sainte-Anne-des-Monts, on the south shore of the St. Lawrence River, while others have been sent to Gaspe, Perce, and Carleton-sur-Mer.

""They're not police. It's important to say that,"" Beaulieu-Gendron said about the workers, in an interview. ""It's really to raise awareness to avoid a second wave, or in any case, to decrease the risk of spreading the virus in the region during summer vacation.""

Lily Gang, the owner of Motel-Camping Fort Ramsay in Gaspe, said this summer seems just as busy as in past years. Her business counts 32 motel rooms and 42 camp sites, which normally can accommodate both trailers and tents.

But Gang said she chose not to take any reservations for tent camping this year because she felt uneasy with clients using the communal restrooms and showers during the COVID-19 pandemic. She said she also feared campers could put her cleaning staff at risk.

""I don't know how to handle so many people together,"" Gang said in an interview.

Cote said the region typically receives 800,000 visitors every summer, but this year he expects more. He said he intends to speak to the provincial government this fall to make sure the public beaches aren't overrun again next year.

In the meantime, he encouraged tourists to plan their trips to the region ahead of time — and only visit if they have reservations. ""It will make us very happy to welcome you, as long as you behave respectfully towards people in the area.""

The passes will be required for the Berg Lake trail at Mount Robson Park, the Chief Peaks trail at Stawamus Chief Park, upper mountain trails at Cypress and Mount Seymour parks, parts of Garibaldi Park and all trails and day-use areas of Golden Ears Park.

Garibaldi Park, which has remained closed due to the pandemic, will fully reopen Monday with the introduction of the day passes at the Diamond Head, Rubble Creek and Cheakamus trailheads.

Although the parks have wide-open spaces, the government says in a statement that most visitors are confined to trails that can become crowded in areas like viewpoints.

It says overuse can have environmental impacts like trail widening, soil erosion, altered hydrology and damaged vegetation.

""People in B.C. love the outdoors, but some of our most popular parks are experiencing a high number of visitors, resulting in crowded facilities, packed parking lots and safety issues, such as parking along the highway,"" Environment Minister George Heyman says in the statement.

The passes will be released each day on the Discover Camping website for same-day bookings. The number of passes available vary.

They range from vehicle passes for Golden Ears Park and the Berg Lake Trail at Mount Robson Park to individual trail passes at other parks for morning, afternoon or full-day bookings.

Bruce Passmore, executive director of the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society's B.C. chapter, says the organization strongly supports reopening the parks while working to manage visits and conserve nature.

""With many people staying home this summer, the demand for outdoor recreation continues to surge, putting more pressure on our park system. We welcome solutions that will help manage overcrowding in certain areas and strengthen our opportunity to protect vital ecosystems,"" he says.

Backcountry campers with camping permits are not required to reserve a day-pass but should carry proof of their camping permit if they use any of the trails that require a pass.

Visitors can download passes on their mobile devices and park staff will check them upon arrival.

Some parks remain closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and a full list showing park status is available on the BC Parks website.

But that will change on Saturday when regular weekend boat tours begin, Halifax MP Andy Fillmore announced Thursday.

Parks Canada says the island will be open for guided tours for the next five weekends. A tour boat will leave the Cable Wharf every 40 minutes until the last run from the island at 5:10 p.m.

The island was fortified by the British military in 1750 and served as a detention centre during the deportation of Nova Scotia's Acadian population between 1755 and 1763.

Its military installations include Fort Charlotte, which is known for housing two seaward-facing artillery batteries and a spooky underground tunnel complex. The lower battery on the south side of the island includes several massive canons from the 1860s.

Georges Island is also the site of one of Canada's first fully automated lighthouses.

""For generations, Georges Island ... has remained out of reach to Haligonians and visitors alike,"" Fillmore said. ""Access to this emerald gem in Halifax Harbour will immerse visitors in the diverse history and ecology of this iconic landmark, while enjoying Halifax from a whole new vantage point.""

In late 2019, the federal government spent more than $2 million to build a permanent wharf with floating docks. In the future, the floating docks will offer access to water taxis and recreational boats.

Upon arrival on the island, visitors can expect to walk up a gravel path to Fort Charlotte, where interpreters will present the island's history and provide short tunnel tours through the lower level rooms and halls of the lower battery.

Visitors will be required to wear non-medical masks or face coverings and to follow public health recommendations including physical distancing.

Tours can be booked online at visitgeorgesisland.com or by phone at one of the Ambassatours waterfront kiosk.

Tom Lindberg, the 76-year-old skipper of the vessel, and another fisherman died Aug. 11 after the boat capsized about 136 kilometres offshore of Cape Flattery, which is just south of Port Renfrew. The third fisherman was found alive in a life boat by U.S. Coast Guard officers responding to the vessel’s distress call. The name of the sole survivor and the other man who died have not been released.

“I know my dad just did everything he could for that young man,” said Paula Lindberg, breaking down into tears. “He would 100 per cent put that young man’s life in front of his own. It sounded like a chaotic, devastating, fast night.”

Paula Lindberg was told there was only 20 minutes between when the mayday call was put out around 2 a.m. and when the boat went down which is “incredibly fast.”

Paula Lindberg said she hasn’t spoken directly with the family of the sole survivor but she’s heard some of the details of what happened from the company that owns the vessel, Teague Fishing Corporation. The company’s owner, Larry Teague, has known Tom Lindberg for about 50 years, as the two were in the Canadian Armed Forces together. Teague is Paula Lindberg’s godfather and Tom Lindberg is godfather to both of Teague’s children, she said.

“They trusted each other implicitly. Larry would never put my dad in harm’s way and he would not put his business in harm’s way,” said Paula Lindberg, addressing the allegations by Raymond Dixon and his twin brother Anthony, who say they were recruited as deckhands but left the ship in Victoria because they had safety concerns.

The Arctic Fox II, a wooden troller built in Scotland in 1947, underwent a full inspection a few weeks before it set sail, Paula Lindberg said. The boat left from Cowichan Bay on Aug. 2. “You can’t insure an unsafe boat,” she said.

Dixon recalled that Teague told him and his brother that they had to keep an eye out for boats because the skipper was blind but Paula Lindberg said while her father wore reading glasses, his eyesight was fine. She thinks they mis-heard and that Teague was warning them about watching the boat’s blind spots while the skipper was at the helm.

She disputed Dixon’s characterization of rotting beams in the galley, saying the entire wheelhouse was re-built in 2016. Dixon said the boat stopped in Victoria because a hydraulic pump had burst but Paula Lindberg said it was a freezer pump that wouldn’t affect the structural integrity of the boat.

Paula Lindberg said the twin brothers had never been on a commercial fishing expedition before so they wouldn’t know what to expect on the boat. For example, Dixon thought waxing the zippers of the survival suits meant they were old but Paula Lindberg said that’s a routine task before going out to sea.

“He was trying to teach them,” she said. “He could be a tough captain because he wanted to be safe, he wanted to keep everyone alive.”

The B.C. Coroners Service, the Transportation Safety Board and WorkSafe B.C. are all investigating the capsizing.

In October 2006, Lindberg and another crew member survived after their boat, the Silver Bear, capsized 220 kilometres west of Cape Disappointment, Washington. The two were rescued by the U.S. Coast Guard after spending two hours floating in a life raft in five-metre swells.

In that incident, the deckhand credited the skipper with saving his life.

“I know the deckhand at the time, praised my father for saving his life and just being so prepared,” she said. Tom Lindberg praised the U.S. Coast Guard for their amazing response.

“He was a tough cookie. He didn’t have a lot of fear around the ocean,” she said.

His daughter and his wife of 45 years, Angela, wondered when the life-long mariner would retire from the dangerous and unpredictable job. Paula Lindberg said her dad retired for one year but he was miserable. He’d go down to the Cowichan Bay wharf and watch his friends head out to sea.

“He was still mobile and active and sharp,” she said.

Tom Lindberg was born in Sweden and moved to Canada with his family at age seven. He spent seven years in the Canadian Armed Forces working as an engineer which included a deployment in Germany in the late 1960s. He worked as a commercial deep sea diver and in the 1970s, started his career as a commercial fisherman. In 1993, the family moved from the Lower Mainland to Cobble Hill and Tom Lindberg started fishing out of Cowichan Bay.

As a child, Paula Lindberg said her dad taught her to fish. He would take her out sometimes for 10 days at a time and give her small tasks such as throwing back the dogfish. She said her father instilled in her a love of the arts and would take her to the ballet and the theatre. Paula Lindberg now works in Los Angeles as an actor but she returned to Cobble Hill in May when her sister was sick with breast cancer. Her sister and Tom Lindberg’s stepdaughter, died last week so the family is struggling with a double loss.

Paula Lindberg said being a mariner isn’t always something you can learn, but comes with having an innate sense of the ocean which her father always had. “He would talk about the struggle of man versus nature and he’s really passionate about it,” she said. “He was one of those men who just got it.”

Tom Lindberg was previously the president of the B.C. Tuna Fishermen’s Association and a longtime board member with the Cowichan Bay Fishermen’s Wharf.

“He was a passionate seaman,” his daughter said. “He loved being on the ocean, he loved his community of fishermen. He dedicated his life to it.”

“We have a large number of families and a lot of younger kids in our area, so these cougars are definitely a concern,” said Chris Burger, who runs a general store at the centre of the rural community of about 700 houses about 15 minutes north of Qualicum Beach.

“Our kids play in the forest. They don’t have a playground like in the cities. They’re on the trails and in the woods — that’s life in a rural area.”

Dan Eichstadter of the B.C. Conservation Officers Service said the small pony was killed inside its pen by a cougar on Saturday. The attack was considered bold and unusual because the small horse was killed in its paddock in close proximity to a family’s home.

“For a cougar to kill an animal that is contained [in a pen], that’s elevated behaviour,” Eichstadter said. “The husbandry practices of securing animals are there to protect them.”

He said conservation officers have stepped up patrols after several sightings in the area.

“We are seeing increases in sightings and [the cougars] are being more active on the fringe hours of dusk and dawn seeking protein.”

Eichstadter said cougars normally prey on deer, raccoons and rabbits, but could be looking at pets such as cats and dogs.

It was unclear if the two cougars are a mother and older cub as some in the community have suggested. Residents say the cougars don’t appear to be hiding and look quite calm around people.

The Conservation Officers Service said that is not normal behaviour for a cougar.

Burger’s store is a gathering place where residents drop in and share information, and the rural area of about 2,000 has been abuzz with talk of the cougars. He said people in the community have reported three missing cats over the past two weeks.

“I get calls from people continuously saying they saw a cougar in their backyard or on a street,” he said, noting that a cougar was seen watching the fifth-wheel trailer his mother lives in from a few metres away.

“We’re teaching our kids to make sure they understand what to do if you see one or come close to one — don’t run, back away slowly.”

Berger said residents are used to living in a rural, forested area with corridors where wildlife travels frequently. “But this is different. These cats are hanging around here, and then the little horse was killed and pets are missing. People are very concerned.”

Conservation officers are asking people to call the provincial Report All Poachers and Polluters line at 1-877-952-7277 (RAPP) to report any sightings.

In mid-July, the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto announced it was reopening its doors after being shut down for months because of the pandemic.

The hall has now reduced its capacity by 70 per cent and is providing personal protective equipment (PPE) for guests and employees.

For a hockey nation, that was a significant announcement, even symbolically, after months of cancellations of pro leagues, and amateur and local sports around the world. Pro sports leagues have slowly begun to resume play, although stadiums and arenas remain shuttered to fans.

However, there are plenty of options across the province for people needing to get out of their homes after months of self-isolation to help fill that sports void.

Sports halls and museums, golf courses, tennis courts, bike and jogging paths, softball fields and more are opening up, albeit with varying restrictions to help stop the spread of the virus.

“We are starting to have lots of families coming now, with kids,” says Scott Crawford, director of operations at the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum, located in St. Marys, Ont., which is about 170 kilometres southwest of Toronto.

The hall is on a 32-acre site that celebrates Canada’s deep connection to the game, and includes the Harry Simmons Memorial Library, four baseball fields and walking trails. There are currently 133 inductees in the Hall of Fame, ranging from World Series-winning players to grassroots pioneers.

The hall, which opened in 1998, is in St. Marys for a reason – the first recorded game of baseball was held in nearby Beachville on June 4, 1838.

Open this photo in gallery Avid golfers can tee up on hundreds of courses across the province, including the London Forest City National Golf Club in London, Ont. TOURISM LONDON

Crawford says all the safety protocols are in place: A smaller number of people are allowed in the building, social distancing is being observed, masks are mandated, arrows and markers are on the floors, and thorough cleanings are done by staff throughout the day.

With the United States border closed, Crawford says they are counting on more people travelling to the hall from across the province and there is plenty to do for non-baseball fans as well. Visitors can enjoy more than 13 kilometres of walking and cycling trails, as well as swim, canoe, kayak, paddle board and play golf.

“It’s a good way to get out and have a fun day,” he says.

Avid golfers might also want to take a trip to Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ont., says Chamber of Commerce president Eduardo Lafforgue. The Niagara-on-the-Lake Golf Club, North America’s oldest golf course, is located right on Front Street within walking distance to the main street of downtown. It’s a rarity to find a golf course that close to downtown hotels and restaurants.

“The fact that you can play and see the old houses, the lake, these huge maple trees is unique and special,” Lafforgue says.

Another popular summertime activity, Lafforgue says, is bike riding from the downtown to the wineries in the area for tastings on the winery patios. In the nearby Niagara Falls region, cyclists have 56 kilometres of bike trails along the Niagara Parkway on which to ride.

Niagara Falls also boasts two of the best golf courses in the country – Legends on the Niagara and the Whirlpool Golf Course.

In picturesque London, Ont., golfers have a number of courses to choose from, says Natalie Wakabayashi, director of culture and entertainment tourism at Tourism London and an avid golfer herself. A favourite among locals is Thames Valley Golf Club, which is situated along the Thames River and just 10 minutes from downtown. Other popular courses include FireRock Golf Club in nearby Komoka, Ont., and the Forest City National Golf Club.

“There is a great selection of courses here, with picturesque holes along the river and lake,” Wakabayashi says. Hiking, biking and walking trails are other popular reasons why sports enthusiasts come to the city.

The Central Counties region of the province – which encompasses the Headwaters, York and Durham regions – is another popular spot for both seasoned and beginner golfers.

Mayfield Golf Club in Caledon East, Ont., offers a selection of programs for the increasing number of people who want to learn the game, says Susan Boyle, director of tourism for Central Counties Tourism. There you can learn about golf etiquette, basic biomechanics to help play the game and ways to improve your short game, which is key to scoring well.

Other destinations that will tempt golfers to toss the clubs into the back of the car and make the drive to Central Counties are such world-class courses as Angus Glen north of Toronto in Markham, Ont., and Wooden Sticks and Royal Ashburn in Durham Region.

Ontarians have so much available in their own backyard for active pursuits after months of lockdown. Grace Sammut, executive director of Resorts of Ontario, says that with the announcement that most regions of the province have moved to Stage 3, which allows for more places to reopen and larger gatherings of people, more sports activities are now available, such as tennis, volleyball and basketball.

Summer has always been a favourite season for Canadians, and after months of being cooped up because of the pandemic, people are eager to get outdoors and get active. Vacations farther afield still aren’t possible so there’s no reason to not make this summer the one in which to explore more immediate surroundings

“Ontario is made for adventure,” Sammut says.

“It is really all right here, a short drive away. Sports fans can get as active as they wish in resort country.”

When considering what to do to stay cool during what has been one of the hottest summers on record, Canada’s largest freshwater outdoor swimming pool at the family-friendly St. Marys Quarry may be your best bet.

A two-hour drive westward from Toronto to the town of St. Marys, Ont., gets you to a place where you can slip into water that’s deep and deliciously crisp, curl your toes on a cliff jumping ramp that’s safe for kids or laze in the shade on the grass while soaking in the leafy scenery.

“It really is a gem,” says Town of St. Marys aquatic director Andrea Slade. “Our swims have been at capacity most days and we’ve been getting beautiful weather.”

Story continues below advertisement

The limestone quarry’s history as a hot spot for summer seekers wanting to take a cool splash stretches all the way back to the early 1930s. Some 20 years later, the municipality was running it as a public swimming facility, and today it continues to attract locals as well as tourists who take day trips to the town or stay for an overnight or two.

Nowadays, the COVID-19 pandemic has prompted the town to put measures and precautions in place to ensure everyone who visits the quarry is safe. The town works with Huron Perth Public Health to consistently assess the situation and adapt its response. For example, you are required to wear a mask when entering the quarry and while using washrooms.

“People will find the experience is a bit different this summer with our protocols, but we’ve found everyone has been amazing,” Slade says. “We’ve had nothing but positive feedback from our swimmers.”

The biggest change from last year starts right at the beginning of the quarry experience.

To ensure physical distancing and help with contact tracing, you need to register and pay for your swim online. You can make your booking on the town website (townofstmarys.com). It’s worth checking the website for updates, too, before you go.

When you get to the quarry, you must show the receipt you were emailed when you registered for your swim. There is free parking right across the street.

The quarry is allowing 70 people in for each swim to meet physical distancing requirements, which has reduced the quarry capacity by 75 per cent, Slade says.

“We want to ensure that everyone is safe.”

There are three swims a day, seven days a week until the quarry closes for the season on Sept. 7. The daily swim times are posted on the website.

“Though our change room and washrooms are open, we’re suggesting that you arrive at the quarry with your swimsuit on,” Slade says. Due to physical distancing, only five people are allowed in the change rooms at a time.

Follow directional arrows to the grassy area at the quarry and you are asked to practise physical distancing by at least two metres between yourself and others.

Aside from the procedures to help protect visitors to the quarry during the pandemic, swimming safety is top of mind, too.

Water depths at the quarry run from three to 10 metres. You must be at least eight years old to use the cliff jump. Children aged 11 years and older who can complete a swim test can be admitted unaccompanied by a parent or guardian.

“We can supply a life jacket at no cost, but you can bring your own if you want,” Slade says.

“You might also want to bring a lawn chair or blanket for the grassy area.”

The canteen is closed this year, so you’re encouraged to bring your own non-alcoholic drinks and snacks.

In addition to the quarry, St. Marys offers scenic streets, parks and trails for walking, running and biking, including the two-kilometre Grand Trunk Trail walkway, a trestle bridge that is a former CN rail line.

The Sarnia Bridge affords a panoramic view of the town and countryside.

“The trestle bridge is one of my favourite sites to visit and it’s a great way to take in the entire town,” Slade says.

More options to cool off within a few hours’ drive

The Thousand Islands Region, about a three-hour drive east of Toronto, has a number of swimming spots. The beaches in the area are on some of the most iconic waterways in Ontario, including the mighty St. Lawrence River and the spectacular Rideau Canal.

Joel Stone Park is perfect for families as it has a wonderful sandy beach right on the St. Lawrence River. There are washrooms and change rooms, and the park includes a splash pad for children. The beach itself has a dock for people to jump from for deeper water and a wheelchair accessible ramp, so everyone is able to enjoy a day at the beach.

Kendrick’s Park is a great spot to bring the family for a day at the beach in Lyndhurst, Ont. There is a small fee for those visiting from outside the township, but it features many amenities such as barbecues and covered pavilions. A sandy beach with shallow waters is ideal for young children.

Gray’s Beach is located just about a two-minute drive from Gananoque on the Thousand Islands Parkway. The park is free of charge and features a small sand beach and some picnic tables for those looking to enjoy their lunch along the river.

Halstead’s Bay is farther down the parkway across from the Landon Bay Centre, part of the Thousand Islands National Park. This swimming spot features a natural sloping rock entrance to the water and ample parking for visitors. It’s a popular place to go after hiking along the many trails in the Landon Bay Centre across the road.

Brown’s Bay is located near Mallorytown along the Thousand Islands Parkway. The park offers ample picnic tables, a large sandy beach and even boasts views of Singer Castle out in the river. Brown’s Bay is typically open until the beginning of September.

Foley Mountain Conservation Area is the perfect stop along the Rideau Canal in Westport. It features a natural swimming area with a sandy beach, picnic tables and some barbecues so that you’re able to make the most of your beach day.

Niagara Falls, Ont., located between Lake Erie to the south and Lake Ontario to the north, is a drive of just over an hour south from Toronto. This famous tourist destination offers many options for some splashy fun, including:

A rooftop pool at the Sheraton Hotel with incredible views of the Falls;

Oversized, themed splashpads at Safari Niagara and Marineland;

Waterslides and wave pools at Fallsview Waterpark and Waves Indoor Waterpark.

Summer is a short season in Canada. Why not pack the car and head out for a wet and wild day trip or overnight stay?

Victoria’s lush gardens, heritage buildings and vibrant waterfront have long made it a mecca for visitors to Canada’s most temperate city. But British Columbia’s capital has also been transforming its historic downtown into dynamic neighbourhoods where residents can enjoy all the benefits of being on holiday within walking distance from their home.

“It’s the most glamourous cottage country on earth,” says Jessica Pryde, who grew up in Victoria and loves its vibrant urban scene mixed with easy access to nature’s beauty.

“You can explore the coastline in the morning and spend your afternoons discovering your new favourite café. If you want to venture out even farther, you can jump on a harbour plane and be in Vancouver or Seattle in a matter of minutes.”

Pryde is the director of sales and marketing for The Pearl Residences, one of the few harbourfront communities in the city. Inspired by boutique hotels, its concrete-and-steel design offers 133 luxury homes that have been curated with stylish, timeless interiors that offer all the modern conveniences while maintaining a sense of privacy and comfort. Studio, one-bedroom, two-bedroom and two-bedroom-with-den floorplans give owners the space and flexibility they desire. Whether they seek a wintertime pied-a-terre or year-round family home, The Pearl provides the perfect lifestyle choice.

“We’ve built in long-term strength but the details are very refined,” Pryde says. “The building is angled in way that provides a magnificent view of the water from many of our balconies.”

The Pearl also offers a fitness centre and lounge that’s perfect for entertaining. “There’s a sense of a boutique hotel experience from the comfort of your own home.”

As tempting as it is to stay indoors, it’s what awaits outside that makes The Pearl unique.

“You walk out your door, and it’s pristine, yet you also have access to world-class restaurants and entertainment. The city is so well suited to people who like all kinds of activities — on water or land. Whether you love to walk, run, paddle your kayak or ride your bike, there are incredible trails that are accessible throughout the city. Tea at the Empress is only a 10-minute walk away, while for the more adventurous, the Galloping Goose is a beautiful 55-kilometre rail trail to Sooke.”

As an added feature, The Pearl connects two portions of the five-kilometre David Foster Harbour Pathway.

With grocery stores and retail amenities all within walking distance, people can leave the car at home. “Not having to use a vehicle totally transforms your active lifestyle and sense of community,” Pryde says. “It’s really freeing.”

As owners of the land and developers of the property, the Farmer family has a deep commitment to the city. Deeply involved in the local construction industry since 1953, The Pearl is their legacy. It’s not just a building for them; it’s their contribution to the city’s resiliency while honouring its charm.

Their attention to detail and commitment to excellence give homeowners peace of mind. This, combined with the enviable location, is even more important in the wake of the pandemic, which has given people time to re-evaluate what they want in life. With the presentation centre open again now that stay-at-home protocols have been eased, Pryde has noticed “there is a renewed sense of ‘what do I want my life to look like’ and ‘what is of value to me.’ We can provide the lifestyle they’re seeking. For them, having everything at your backdoor is transformative.”

Residents also appreciate having all the benefits of home-ownership without the worry and responsibilities of owning a house.

“Single-family homes are a big commitment, and when you can lock-and-leave your home at The Pearl, the entire city becomes your playground,” Pryde says.

As it happened, my pot luck group met for the first time since before COVID, on one of the warmest evenings of the summer, two weeks ago. We agreed to meet early, at 6 p.m., on my back lawn.

I arranged six chairs and small tables, spaced a little more than two metres apart, in an arc facing the garden with a table at the centre for placing food. For safety, everyone brought her own plate, utensils, and drink. I supplied paper serviettes and a supplementary “drinks” table with water, wine, and hand sanitizer. The downstairs bathroom, just off the carport, was sanitized and supplied with small, individual towels.

Everyone contributed take-out food in the form of pizzas and sushi, and they all brought their own tongs or chopsticks for serving themselves. For dessert there were individual tarts from a local coffee shop.

It was a perfect evening, warm and fragrant. Some of the women strolled through the garden and returned with questions. One wanted to know the names of the flowers in a patch of wildflowers and bee-friendly blooms in one of the plots. She saw many of them as perfect for a small flower garden next to one of her apartment windows.

She began growing flowers in the site this year. Among the most promising ones Marilyn saw were alyssum, candytuft, cornflower, clarkia, and baby blue eyes (Nemophila).

Pat remarked on the hydrangeas in the garden and asked about a problem with her sister’s white hydrangea: Why were the blooms turning pink? The most likely reasons: It is common, as the blooms age, to take on pink tones. The acid-alkaline balance (pH) of the soil can also affect hydrangea flower colour. Alkaline soils foster pink and red. Acidic soils help to keep blue hydrangeas true blue. A soil that is very slightly acidic is probably best for white hydrangeas.

As the light was starting to fade, on came the evening entertainment — The Raccoon Show. A family of raccoons, a mother and four babies, began disporting themselves close by, in a big fir tree next to my side fence and very close to the house. The babies were trying to overtake each other along the branches as the whole lot of them made their way down the tree. They tumbled over the fence onto a slope beside the house, where we were able to observe their antics further.

That raccoon family has been the talk of the neighbourhood as it travels about. I often see them crossing the patio on their way back to their tree. One morning I watched the mother shepherding the little ones down my driveway toward the street.

Not my favourite wild animal, but part of the scene around here.

That was not the end of the evening’s entertainment. With the departure of my friends around dusk, I’d gone to bed and had just fallen asleep when a mighty noise jolted me awake. Thunder, as I’d never heard it before, followed repeated flashes of sheet lightning in a continuing “Sound and Light” exhibit that must have been a massive collision of weather systems — or a dog days show.

Tale of two clematis vines. A surprise this summer has been strong growth and flowers on two clematis vines that have, over the years, come close to disappearing into the landscape.

I first planted a Barbara Dibley on a trellis alongside the carport. When the trellis was removed, I transplanted the vine beside a flowering quince shrub a neighbour had given me. The vine lives and blooms, minimally, in a bed I tend only occasionally, but this summer, it proceeded to dot the top of the shrub liberally with its impressive mauve-pink, carmine-striped flowers.

I thought the Clematis durandii that I planted at the base of a Rosa rubrifolia (R. glauca) had disappeared, but it wound its way up the spiny rose canes to produce gorgeous indigo-blue flowers. Perhaps it was the severe renewal pruning of the rose in late winter, and the compost mulching that followed. Anyway, the flowers were a welcome gift.",717,0.9526125613928146,local

Here’s a reminder of the fun that awaits us in Europe at the other end of this crisis.

While food might be an art form in Italy, it’s more like a religion in Sicily. Even if you know Italian food well, Sicilian cuisine will surprise you with its complexity — a legacy of successive waves of settlers and invaders who influenced the cuisine.

The first time you find yourself choosing between fish couscous and spaghetti Bolognese on the same menu, you know you’re at a crossroads of cultures. Thanks to centuries of North African and Middle Eastern influences, Sicilian cuisine includes distinctive ingredients such as couscous, almonds, ginger, apricots, cinnamon, and lots of citrus. Arabs who came here popularized fried foods, which is why so many Sicilian street food classics — and even some pastas — are deep-fried. Sicilian cooking also comes with Greek and Spanish touches.

The Sicilian diet relies on Italian staples such as pastas, olives, and tomatoes, but with a local twist. The island’s warm temperatures and fertile volcanic soil mean that everything from citrus to nuts are available home-grown. Produce is fresh, cheap, and plentiful — and sold at markets that more closely resemble an Arab souk than a European marketplace. Seafood is abundant.

One of the most memorable ways to eat in Sicily is also one of the cheapest: street food, especially in Sicily’s capital, Palermo. Ballarò Market, dating to the 10th century, is the most authentic. Vendors here still maintain the Arab tradition of calling out to passersby in a singsong way, like auctioneers. Food carts are scattered among the stalls, selling panelle (chickpea fritters), sfincione (fluffy pizza with anchovies), potato croquettes and lots of other eats.

The most popular items are the arancine, deep-fried rice balls with meat sauce inside, which are flavoured with vivid yellow saffron and contain no tomatoes. (Sicily’s second city, Catania, and mainland Italy call this dish arancino and add tomato to the filling — two things a Palermo native wouldn’t be caught dead doing.)

For a small island, Sicily has an remarkable range of local specialties. Trapani, on the west coast, is geographically and culturally the island’s closest point to Africa — and the best place to try couscous al pesce, couscous served with a side of fish broth that you ladle on to taste. Fancier variations are topped with shellfish and other seafood.

In Modica, in the southeast, try the grainy, bittersweet cioccolato di Modica.

Sicily was under Spanish rule just as explorers were returning from the New World with exotic new foods, including cocoa beans. Modica mastered this new ingredient, crushing it on basalt plates and adding local sugar, creating an early version of chocolate bars.

In Catania, on Sicily’s eastern shore at the base of Mount Etna, quench your thirst with a seltz e limone (seltz, for short) — fresh-squeezed lemon juice with seltzer water. They’ll ask you “sale?” to see if you want salt added. (It might sound strange, but a little salt makes this brew exceptionally thirst-quenching.)

Sicily also has its own pasta dishes. Anelletti al forno is ring-shaped pasta, baked with tomatoes, meat, eggplant and cheese. Busiate alla Trapanese is a twisty noodle topped with red pesto made from almonds, tomatoes, garlic and basil.

Pasta alla Norma, named for an opera by Catania-born composer Vincenzo Bellini, is made with fried eggplant, tomato sauce, basil and salted ricotta cheese on top. A top-end choice for those who enjoy a taste of the sea is spaghetti ai ricci, spaghetti topped with sea urchin.

Wine has been produced on the shores of Sicily since the time of the Greeks.

The island, whose various grape-growing areas have their own distinctive characteristics, is one of Italy’s biggest wine producers.

Some of the grapes grown here, such as the red nerello grape, can be found only in Sicily. Western Sicily is best known for its Marsala wine, and the Mount Etna area has become a magnet for boutique wine producers for its the rich volcanic soil and old vines.

Wineries cluster around the north slope, like a Sicilian Napa Valley.

Sicilian desserts are also distinctive and delicious, most made with a combination of sugar, almonds, citrus and ricotta. The island’s most famous and best sweets are cannoli.

A crispy fried pastry tube is filled with sweetened ricotta, then dusted with powdered sugar.

The mark of a high-quality cannolo is one that’s filled right when you order it — otherwise, the shell gets soggy and loses its crunch.

After tasting cannoli at a Sicilian pastry shop, I know why they say: “Holy cannoli.”

One thing is certain about Sicily: For locals, the food can be a religious experience.

Whether you’re a couple looking for a quiet getaway or a family seeking kid-friendly fun, now is the time to take a road trip.

A little planning can go a long way to making your vacation go smoothly. Here are a few tips:

Story continues below advertisement

Plan ahead

The first step in planning a road trip is shopping for essentials that will leave you prepared for your journey’s many twists and turns. Don’t forget a first-aid kit that includes items such as bandages, hand sanitizer and Gravol. You don’t want nausea or upset stomachs to put a damper on your road trip.

Gravol offers effective relief of nausea, vomiting and dizziness due motion sickness to make sure your road trip remains uninterrupted. Gravol is available in an Immediate Release and Long Acting caplet that provides up to 12 hours of nausea relief. If you are travelling with little ones, Gravol Kids offers great-tasting and convenient chewable tablets. For those who are looking for a natural option, Gravol Ginger is made with certified organic ginger for non-drowsy relief from nausea and upset stomach.

And while the open road beckons, it’s best to leave with a route in mind.

Many provincial and regional tourism agencies have suggestions for driving tours, with all of the activities and adventures mapped out.

If you have a destination in mind, a quick online search of the route may uncover some unexpected stops along the way that will make the drive even more worthwhile.

If you’re travelling with children, some of the magic can be found in the little stops along the way. At the very least, it helps to cut down on the number of times the kids ask ‘are we there yet?’

If you’re travelling with older children or teens, it’s good to involve them in the trip planning, so they have stops that pique their interest.

And while planning is good, so is the freedom to expect the unexpected. It’s okay to change plans midway when a new opportunity arises.

Be ride-ready

It’s a good idea to take your vehicle in for a check-up a few weeks ahead of your trip. Have the oil changed, check the fluid levels, get the battery tested and the tires inspected.

You do not want to have to pull over on the side of the road.

Make sure you have a spare set of keys that one of your co-pilots can carry in their purse or backpack, if yours get lost.

Also, take an inventory of the emergency supplies in your vehicle. Make sure you have a flashlight with extra batteries, a basic tool kit with a wrench and jumper cables, emergency flares or reflectors and extra windshield washer fluid.

Pack right

When packing for your trip, don’t forget to keep Gravol handy in your glove box to make sure you and your family have a nausea-free road trip!

Bring a cooler for drinks and snacks on the road, especially if you’re travelling with kids whose food cravings can be unexpected.

It’s also wise to check the weather reports and pack appropriate clothing for cool or rainy days.

Driving time is a great opportunity for some family fun. Pack card games and activities for kids and download some podcasts for times when you want everyone to sit still and listen.

Or, consider making a family playlist: Turn up the volume, and hit the road.

Read full packaging directions before use. Gravol relieves nausea, vomiting and dizziness due to motion sickness.

The 101 crashes at the almost completed McKenzie and Highway 1 project is somewhat predictable, but still a little odd. One would think the increased scrutiny throughout the construction phase would be cause for pause. The sheer volume of traffic of all types must have something to do with it.

article continues below

The McKenzie-Highway 17 (Pat Bay Highway) merge area is No. 2 on the list, with 68 crashes. There are some not so obvious differences in this seemingly simple configuration. It is really a double merge and therefore not just a single lateral move that drivers must negotiate when heading west and entering from McKenzie.

The third highest number of crashes are at the Boleskine and Douglas intersection. This location has been a perennial top 10 contender. It is really the Highway 1 corridor with 62 crashes, but is rather seen to be a city street, as opposed to a provincial responsibility. Left-turn cheaters and a far-lane timing move might be the cause of so many incidents at a very standard type of intersection.

Sixty-one crashes were recorded at the five-headed monster, better known as the Hillside-Douglas-Gorge intersection. This is also a perennial placer in the not-where-you-want-to-be category. Let us all hope this returns to a giant traffic circle, asap, as in days long since gone by.

At least everyone would be going the same direction, eliminating the requirement for a left turn and the potential dreaded head-on collision.

Millstream and the Trans-Canada highway takes a tie for fourth (61) as a relative newcomer to the yearly tally. Westshore makes the big time, in a not-so-envious way. This is partly because of the amazing development as of late. It is possibly the fastest-growing place in Canada. The outsiders looking for a big-box fix can probably be blamed for the entry into the top 10 bumper-car type of collisions.

The sixth most common crash site is a mystery to me. After moving the bus stop at the Pat Bay Highway and Sayward Road, it was believed all was well in hand. The crash rate was significantly reduced, and we all thought this location would never again darken these pages. Well, it only took a few years and here we go again. The crash incidences at this location not only defy logic, but also make a mockery of the large capital expense thought to have solved the problem. Blame it on ferry traffic! Maybe visitors! Who knows?

No. 7 is a golf shot from No. 3. Blanshard and Saanich is an odd member of the top 10. It is a one-way location of Highway 17. One-way street locations are generally safer places. This one stumps me, unless it is once again the fault of the left-turn cheaters turning from Saanich.

Nos. 8 and 9 are in Nanaimo, namely the Island Highway at Bowen and at Mostar. Of all the disappointing locations to make the list, these two are the most difficult to understand.

They are on the same bypass road. Left-turn lunacy? Non-synchronized traffic lights? This is a total mystery to me. I am stumped. How about you? Wide open and lots of room! I never have any problems at these intersections.

No. 10 is a newcomer. Wale Road and the Island Highway is a non-right-angle intersection. What is it doing on the list? It just does not belong. Any thoughts?

Last week’s column about Richardson assumed the first iteration of a shared lane was the preferred option. This was incorrect. A non-through street barrier option was chosen instead, matched with two opposite flow lanes. Thanks to readers for pointing it out.

With public health measures easing in most provinces and many businesses reopening amid the pandemic, Canadians are eager to hit the road and leave lockdown life in the rearview mirror.

Non-essential travel outside of Canada is not an option for most Canadians, making ‘staycations’ a renewed trend. Thankfully, there’s no shortage of places to go and things to do within our borders.

From the surf beaches of Tofino, B.C. to the sweeping coastal views of Cape Spear, Nfld., Canada is a massive backyard full of adventure. There’s a dream trip within driving distance from most dots on a Canadian map.

Not sure where to go first? Here are three hidden gems to consider just outside of some of Canada’s largest cities, from east to west:

Hit the beach outside of Halifax

The sand-and-cobblestone shore of Lawrencetown Beach Provincial Park, about 30 km east of Halifax, is popular with surfers and beachcombers alike. The beach is part of the Cole-Harbour-Lawrencetown Coastal Heritage Park system, offering stunning vistas along vast stretches of walking trails that are part of the Trans Canada Trail network. Several surf schools offer lessons and there are supervised swimming areas during summer.

Travel beyond Toronto

Petroglyphs Provincial Park, about 200 km northeast of Toronto, is home to the largest known site of Indigenous rock carvings in Canada. “Teaching Rocks,” some of which are about 1,000 years old, depict the natural world and wildlife as told by the Nishnaabe people. At the visitor’s centre, interpretive guides tell Indigenous stories of the region. The park is also home to McGinnis Lake, a rare meromictic lake, meaning the layers of water don’t intermix. The park has scenic walking trails and serene picnic spots, so bring your lunch.

Vacation just outside of Vancouver

Just a short drive north and a 20-minute ferry ride from Vancouver, Bowen Island is a pastoral retreat hidden in Howe Sound. A haven of quaint galleries and coffee shops, the largely residential island also has a host of spa and wellness offerings and ample shopping and restaurants. For a small island, Bowen offers big nature. Kayaking, paddle-boarding, hiking and biking are just a few of the outdoor experiences available. There’s even a golf course. Crippen Regional Park has well-maintained trails and the 10-km hike up Mount Gardner rewards the adventurous with a glorious panoramic view from the Sunshine Coast to Vancouver Island.

Be prepared for the ride

The key to any good road trip is readiness. Don’t miss out on making lifelong memories due to nausea or the unexpected. Map your route, check the weather and pack appropriate clothing. Remember to travel in small groups and keep physical distance from others. Pack hand sanitizer and wash your hands regularly.

Make a loose itinerary of must-stops and maybe-stops. Bring plenty of water, as well as some snacks, and double check you have a basic first aid kit in the car. And make sure you have Gravol in the glove compartment and in your purse or backpack so nausea doesn’t ruin your trip.

Gravol offers effective relief of nausea, vomiting and dizziness due motion sickness to ensure your road trip remains uninterrupted. Gravol is available in an Immediate Release and Long Acting caplet that provides up to 12 hours of nausea relief. If you are travelling with little ones, Gravol Kids offers great-tasting and convenient chewable tablets.

That’s largely due to two provincial ministries moving lock, stock and stapler to the Capital Park development in James Bay, according to Colliers vice president Tristan Spark, who noted 80 per cent of the 70,000 square feet of newly available office space downtown resulted from the moves.

Spark said new projects, like the $250 million mixed-used Capital Park development, offer new Class A office space and spur on a flight to quality, which tends to leave older Class B and C buildings vacant or available at lower rents to other businesses or ripe for redevelopment.

The report suggests the vacancy rate will remain fairly stable for the rest of this year, likely getting to 6.3 or 6.5 per cent by the end of the year.

Spark said it could climb to about seven per cent at some point before things normalize, but he points out even at that point the city will be in good shape as its 10-year average occupancy is about eight per cent.

The reason the vacancy rate is expected to remain stable, according to Spark, is the success the province has had in dealing with the pandemic.

“It didn’t really affect offices too much,” he said.

It did result in many government offices and Crown agencies directing their staff to work from home for the foreseeable future, while high-tech firms and other companies that could did the same.

The move to work remotely drastically changed the traffic pattern and sheer number of people on the street in the downtown core, but it didn’t translate into much office vacancy.

Spark said that’s down to companies and government still needing space for employees who can’t or don’t feel comfortable working from home.

“There will always be a need for office space,” he said, noting it may be fine for people working at home now, but that is bound to change in the winter or after the novelty wears off after a year or two. “I don’t think the office is going anywhere.”

He said from what he’s seen government is sticking with more or less the same footprint, but having fewer people in each floor plate to allow for social distancing.

Some companies that had expanded are now considering sub-leasing their extra space and maintaining their current size.

“Over the last 10 years the trend has been to have open concepts and increased employee density. That’s over,” said Spark, adding there will now be more options on the table including working from home for employees. “There will be a return now to traditional offices and more private offices.”

According to the province, which occupies a massive footprint in the downtown, public service workplaces are expected to continue operating with reduced occupancy capacity to allow for social distancing.

Ministries will continue to find a balance of in-office and remote work, and will support employees who choose to work from home where the nature of their work allows for it.

At the same time, some offices have been expanded and reconfigured to allow more workers to return to the ministry buildings while having space for social distancing.

The Colliers report points out there is still plenty of space on the way to market, with 204,000 square feet of office space currently under construction and another 419,000 square feet in various planning stages, like the massive Telus-Ocean building planned for the Apex lot downtown.

Spark said as those developments come to the market, the new space is likely to be snapped up and the older space taken over by the burgeoning tech sector or other businesses and in some cases bought by developers to add more residential units.

“Historically that’s what happens,” he said.

In the short- and medium-term, however, the retail space is expected to feel the squeeze in the downtown especially.

Spark said retail has certainly taken more hits than office space so far, and he’s had some clients opt to downsize their current locations to find more affordable retail space downtown.

“Retail will suffer more and I’d expect to see more of that space on the market in the third and fourth quarter of this year,” he said.

GMC Projects has the green light from Victoria city council to build a five-storey commercial and rental apartment block in Fairfield and will name it after Alick Thomas Bentall Charlesworth, who died May 30, 1917, while flying a DH4 bomber over the battlefields of France.

The Charlesworth building will feature a large mural on an exterior wall of the young corporal, the bomber he flew and the 88th Battalion in which he served. It is being built adjacent to another GMC project, the refurbished Bell Apartments, where Charlesworth and his new bride lived before he left for war.

Charlesworth was 23 when he was killed. He had been married just a year and a half earlier to Elizabeth Rosina May Price on Salt Spring Island.

“It became apparent to us that it would be fitting to acknowledge someone’s sacrifice,” said GMC chief executive Jordan Milne. “It’s a great opportunity to tell his story through mural art.”

An older 21Ú2-storey home at 1015 Cook Street will be dismantled and many of the materials such as doors and stained-glass windows will be salvaged and used in the Charlesworth, a 7,200-square-foot building which will have 28 market rental units and three live/work spaces at the ground level.

The Charlesworth will be set back from the Bell Apartments so a mural on that building of Lady Bell — which pays homage to the suffragette movement — can be seen by people walking or driving along Cook Street between Meares Street and Rockland Avenue. Plaques on the histories of both buildings will be installed for passersby, said Milne.

Lydia Beauregard, who painted the Lady Bell mural, has also been commissioned to do the mural on the Charlesworth.

Construction is expected to start in January and take about 18 months, said Milne.

Milne said initial concept plans from Beauregard won’t only incorporate images of Charlesworth, his bomber and battalion, but also some “whimsical elements” of the period around the turn of the last century.

The 106-year-old Bell Apartments building was damaged by a fire in February 2017. GMC bought the building in 2018 and completed most of the renovations in 2019. Some finishing touches still remain, said Milne. Building permits have been submitted to the city by GMC to convert an old warehouse in the back of the Bell into two townhouse units.

The Charlesworth will also feature a rooftop space with an outdoor kitchen with two gas barbecues, an eat-in bar, formal dining space, artificial turf games space, a chaise lounge and sectional seating areas.

Milne said the space is designed to increase social interaction and will be shared with residents of the Bell Apartments.

“It is basically going to be a game-changer for south Nanaimo,” Ian Porter, Seacliff Properties’ director of development, said Wednesday.

Seacliff intends to build Sandstone over 20 years. Investment “will easily be in the billions,” Porter said.

“It’s going to create employment opportunities on the south side of Nanaimo that are not there not there now. It is going to create shopping opportunities.

Sandstone is at the junction of the Trans-Canada and Duke Point highways.

When Seacliff bought the land in 2018, it came with a previous blueprint for a planned community.

The new version includes a business park expected to generate 5,500 permanent jobs once the project is complete.

Seacliff’s other Vancouver Island properties include Royal Beach land in Colwood, where it plans a mixed-use development, and the Fairwinds golf and residential community at Nanoose Bay.

“We fully believe that Vancouver Island is going to continue to grow,” Porter said. “More people are going to live there. More people are going to want to do business there.”

Nanaimo city hall is reviewing Seacliff’s application for its updated plan and zoning amendments. “Staff are targeting the autumn for council introduction of the amendment bylaws,” said city planner Brian Zurek.

Sandstone would be developed in four precincts: a business park-employment zone, an urban town centre and expansion of two existing neighbourhoods, Chase River and Cinnabar.

If approved this fall, work could start on some residential and the business park in 2021, Porter said.

Seacliff estimates that construction would create more than 1,200 jobs per year.

Property taxes would total $17.67 million annually once the project is completed, with development cost charges adding up to $51.9 million for the project’s lifetime total, Seacliff’s submission states.

Sandstone could eventually have up to 3,200 homes in a range of single-family, duplexes, townhouses and apartment style homes. Some would be rental. Smaller lots and suites would contribute to affordability, the submission said. The developer is proposing a formula to contribute to the city’s affordable housing fund.

The town centre would have 2,000 residential units, some in towers, which could be up to 20 storeys. The town centre would include 550,000 square feet of commercial, offices and service uses.

In the Cinnabar neighbourhood, plans call for up to 600 detached homes and attached/townhouses, with space for a future elementary school.

The Chase River (Cedar Road) area would allow for up to 600 lower-density homes, and for a 100-acre reserve of riverfront land.

About half the lands in the Chase Valley and Cinnabar neighbourhoods would be allocated for parks, open space, and trails.

In the business-employment area, a maximum six million square feet could be constructed.

Mike Parker, Chase River Community Association chairperson said, “Generally I think there is a lot of support for the project from residents and from the association as a whole. It has been an ongoing process with numerous players saying they are going to develop that section of land over 30 years.

“It finally looks like somebody is going to come through and actually start developing it.”

The population is booming in the south end of Nanaimo and residents are eager for more services, Parker said. “We need more retail … we need jobs, we need affordable housing, we need rental units — all that stuff.”

Sandstone has taken into account much of what residents are seeking, Parker said. He is pleased with the proposed amount of green space.

A major existing concern for area residents is heavy traffic, especially along Extension Road and additional development could add to that, he said.

Nanaimo Mayor Leonard Krog said the project offers an opportunity for the community to get together, in conjunction with B.C. Transportation Ministry, to work out long-term solutions around traffic and active transportation.

Krog welcomed the business area portion of the project, saying “Nanaimo is very short on industrial land of any kind.”

Sandstone could bring major changes to the city’s southern area, he said. “It is also has potential to provide amenities that we might not otherwise see there for a number of years.”

Not all development proposals come to fruition, Krog noted, but in this case, “a substantial developer with deep pockets is working with the community to try and create a development that will hopefully have strong community support, particularly that part of town.”

The other morning at sunrise, I looked out the window and saw a couple who live across the street pull a badminton net into the middle of our road. They then used a tape measure to mark out the boundaries of the court. The husband served to his wife, and the game was on – not just as an idle volley of the birdie, but a fierce competition for points.

“There’s no wind early in the morning,” they explained to me, when I went out to watch their game. As for the net, “$50 at Canadian Tire.” It helps that, with most people working from home and summer camps closed, there is scant traffic.

I like our Toronto neighbourhood during this COVID-19 pandemic. The sense of community has never been stronger. Another couple has taken to walking the sidewalks in strong strides with great purpose. They wear T-shirts, shorts and matching ball caps. They have a circuit; they pass our house several times in an hour before breakfast. My wife and I call them “the power couple.” For months, when gyms were closed, two young women rolled out their mats in our park and fired up a laptop to lead them on their workout routine.

The world is quiet right now. How quiet? We now have some idea: The equipment that researchers use to detect earthquakes can also rate less dramatic events, such as the “seismic noise” we humans make in our cities. In July, Thomas Lecocq, a seismologist at the Royal Observatory of Belgium, and 65 other researchers, including William Minarik from McGill University, co-authored a paper in Science magazine titled Global Quieting of High-Frequency Seismic Noise Due to COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown Measures.

As the world shut down to battle the virus, Dr. Lecocq’s group found the “length and quiescence of this period represents the longest and most coherent global seismic noise reduction in recorded history.” The University of Auckland, who helped in the study, calls this peaceful period the “anthropause.”

The anthropause is great news for kids who want to learn to ride a bike on our street. Cars are rare.

I often work in the backyard near our WiFi modem. Parents walk by with their offspring. Our dog barks when other dogs pass. Laughter trickles over the fence. It helps that the aroma of sugar, milk and toffee wafts from the chocolate factory across the way. An invasive renovation of a house nearby, leaf blowers and transport trucks filled with cocoa butter sometimes blemish the serenity.

The coronavirus has upended routines. Typically, during the summer, I would hop on my bike and fight traffic on my way to an office near Union Station – and not really think about my street until after work. Now, I am here all the time with everyone else. We get to know one another a little bit.

Micro-performances in front yards break up the quiet. A young couple moved into a house across the way, and the man dragged his table saw onto the front lawn. Every afternoon for weeks they toiled there, building the perfect front porch. The scent of cut pine filled the air.

Story continues below advertisement

Another day, as I worked inside, the power went off. My wife and I went out the front door. All the neighbours appeared on their porches and we exchanged the news – everyone had been inside on their devices. The power returned, and people disappeared.

In the evening, our neighbours shut their laptops and go outside. In a phenomenon repeated across Canada, almost every family on our block has acquired a puppy. There’s a stretch of lawn and trees in front of a police station down the street that we call “Police Park.” There, every night, locals assemble for an hours-long romp we call the Puppy Party – Mac, Ruby and Pepper, the youngsters, meet older dogs such as Coco and Flint and Oscar, the big floppy Newfoundland.

COVID-19 has taken the lives of thousands of victims across Canada. Front-line workers have died from the virus. Unemployment has skyrocketed. Parents juggle kids and jobs at home. (My wife and I got lucky, since our kids are older. Our son graduated high school in a virtual ceremony that, despite the students being apart, had its sweet moments, too.) For most, this pandemic has brought challenges. Still, it feels okay to celebrate the anthropause.

The coronavirus has separated parents from their co-workers and kids from their classmates. The generations now spend more time among one another. Dave McGinn noted in The Globe and Mail last month that this pandemic has had the effect of returning us to the summers of the 1980s, when kids played with the other kids in their neighbourhood. That’s nice.

One evening I took the dog to the park. Couples worked, at a reasonable physical distance, to erect a volleyball net and mark out the perimeter in flagging tape. Their kids played in a wooded thicket, blissfully free, for a few minutes, from the hawk-like parental eye. As the net rose, women began a friendly argument about whose team an Australian dad on our block would join. He is tall and sculpted like a model from GQ. He just laughed. Everyone is on stage right now, and some enjoy the attention.

The chimney project — costing hundreds of thousands of dollars — is part of an overall upgrade of the 1892 heritage building at 2110 Store St., purchased from B.C. Hydro by developer Chris Le Fevre.

article continues below

It’s one of two projects Le Fevre is working on at the northern edge of Old Town. The other is his new Ironworks development, with 85 condominiums plus commercial space at Store and Chatham streets, across from Capital Iron.

The Powerhouse’s chimney was wrapped up for safety reasons and scaffolding has been installed. Le Fevre said it hasn’t been touched for decades, so a “substantial portion” of the masonry is being rebuilt.

He would not be specific, but said the cost to remediate the 20,000-square-foot building is several million dollars.

The former industrial building is now rented by Metropol Industries, which specializes in printing and marketing. Le Fevre said work on the exterior of the Powerhouse, and “cleaning the building up,” has been ongoing for nearly a year.

Le Fevre first built an access road into the property, required by the city for the Powerhouse to be subdivided from the adjacent B.C. Hydro lands.

The Powerhouse was constructed to a high industrial standard. Le Fevre calls it the most rugged heritage building he has worked with. “The reason is that it was built originally as a blast-proof building because it was generating power with generators.”

It was designed by architect and former mayor John Teague — who also designed Victoria City Hall — and is listed on the federal-provincial register of Canada’s historic places.

“The value of this building lies in its solid purpose-built form, simple Romanesque detailing, and large, open interior spaces,” says the register. “This powerhouse is an edifice in the Upper Harbour industrial area, and contributes to the diversification of Victoria’s architectural heritage.”

Built as a steam-generating plant, the Powerhouse provided power for the city’s newly electrified street lights and the city’s early trams, the register says. “It facilitated the modernization of the city as it grew in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.”

Just to the south, Le Fevre’s five-storey Ironworks development at Store and Chatham streets has been completed. It is the first phase of Ironworks, with a second stage of a similar size planned.

The name and the rust-coloured corten exterior of Ironworks were chosen to reflect the area’s industrial past.

The former Albion Iron Works was on Chatham Street and the Capital Iron building across the street was originally a marine-scrap business. Le Fevre said he spotted rusted metal on the landscape when he was riding his motorcycle in the high desert in California, and decided that kind of look would suit the exterior of his Ironworks project.

The first occupants move into Ironworks in early August. The project was 60 per cent pre-sold and remaining units are going on the market in a couple of weeks, he said.

Commercial space will likely be taken up by a restaurant, coffee shops and smaller food-service outlets.

Le Fevre has redeveloped more than 10 Old Town buildings, repurposing often rundown structures for residential and commercial uses.

After 17 years, he is nearing completion on his Railyards development on the north side of the Point Ellice Bridge. Construction starts next year on the final building, featuring townhouses and micro-sized affordable units. Once that’s finished, about 400 homes will have been constructed in the Railyards.

Le Fevre has other projects underway, including townhouses in Ucluelet, as well as townhouses and commercial space in Revelstoke’s historic district. He has also purchased more than 600 acres in Landers and the Joshua Tree area in California, where he plans to build small homes.

The CRD sold the building for $11.1 million to a Vancouver real estate investment firm — named only as 836 Viewfield Limited Partnership — which has agreed to a long-term lease for the entire 59,000-square-foot facility with the brewery.

article continues below

“This is really exciting for us,” said Driftwood partner Gary Lindsay, noting that, once the space has been renovated, they will be able to consolidate all three of the brewer’s operations in one location.

The warehouse was one of two massive spaces the CRD purchased on Viewfield Road in 2014 for $17 million. The four-acre site was considered for a sewage-sludge plant.

An outcry from neighbours killed the proposed plant scheme, and the CRD put the two properties — 808 Viewfield Rd. and 836 Viewfield Rd. — up for sale.

Spinnakers Brew Pub, which had been leasing space in one of the warehouses for three years, purchased 808 Viewfield Rd. for $11.25 million last year.

Lindsay said Driftwood considered purchasing the 836 Viewfield property, where it had been leasing about 20,000 square feet of space for its bottling and canning operation, but realized it would be too expensive to buy the lot and move the brewery as well.

“This will be quite a change for us as we have been operating out of three locations — the brewery on Hillside [Avenue], our distribution warehouse and sales office on Ellery Street and the packaging space,” he said.

Lindsay said demolition and renovations are expected to start soon, with hopes that they will move the brewery over and open in spring 2021.

The new space will allow the brewery to play a bit of catch-up with the times. When it started in 2008, there were no tasting rooms attached to breweries, and the Hillside Avenue location never had enough space for them to expand.

“Part of this move will mean having a customer experience like Phillips Brewing has here and like most craft brewers in Vancouver,” Lindsay said.

“It’s an opportunity to be at a place where people can come and spend a little time, COVID permitting.”

Lindsay said the success of Driftwood, which rode the second wave of craft beer expansion when it started in 2008, has paved the way for such a move.

“We were the victims of our own success in a way. It was the problem we always wished for — not having enough space,” he said.

That is no longer a problem, though he said they are still trying to navigate their way though the pandemic.

He said while the volume of alcohol being sold might have increased overall, local brewers report sales to bars and restaurants are way down. That has improved slightly as more venues open.

“People forget the tourist piece in Victoria and downtown Vancouver is huge and that has not been filled,” he said. “At the same time, the local market has been fantastic for us.”

He said they have reaped the reward of starting their canning lines two and half years ago.

The move to Viewfield Road creates something of a craft beer hot spot as it will now sit across the street from Lighthouse Brewing and connects to the Four Mile Pub via the Galloping Goose Regional Trail.

The CRD has done well in the real estate game with the two warehouses, which will in turn benefit taxpayers.

Apart from the $3.7-million net profit expected from the combined sales of the lots, the warehouses had been covering their costs via lease agreements over the past few years.

“This is good news for taxpayers, as this positive return on investment will be credited to the Core Area Wastewater Treatment Project participants,” said Susan Brice, chairwoman of the CRD’s governance and finance committee.

“CRD staff did an incredible job managing the property, generating positive cash flow and securing tenants that are remaining in place after the change in ownership. Taxpayers will end up benefiting from the improvements and sale of this asset.”

The mixed-use project will help transform the municipality, says Mayor Rob Martin, who expects neighbouring developer Seacliff Properties to seek rezoning this fall.

Approval for Latoria South, “allows us to move forward from a bedroom community to a more dynamic economy,” Martin said.

Colwood’s commercial base is about to grow now that developer Gablecraft Homes intends to build an 80,000-square-foot retail village with a grocery store, other shops and services.

“We are really trying to build a liveable community and this really feeds into this,” Martin said.

New commercial development such as this will help ease the tax burden on homeowners, he said.

Gablecraft’s mixed-use project went to public hearing this week and council voted Wednesday in favour of rezoning to allow the project to proceed. Martin expects that the fourth and final reading of the bylaws will come up at council’s August meeting.

Royal Bay is the name given to the former site of a gravel pit on either side of Metchosin Road, south of Royal Roads University and north of Albert Head.

Gablecraft has already built about 300 single-family houses and townhomes on its Latoria North property, which is on the water side of the Metchosin Road, along with its Latoria South lands.

It is building out Latoria South with two neighbourhoods, the Commons and the Quarry. A range of housing types will go up with the market dictating the pace of construction. Plans include parks, trails, an elementary school, a satellite fire hall and a transit exchange. Other possibilities include seniors care and cultural uses. The tallest buildings would be six storeys.

Martin anticipates that buildings, such as the supermarket, will feature an interior design suited to a post-virus world.

He figures that the Seacliff lands, which include the waterfront at Royal Bay, will present a mixed-use plan similar in scope, creating a major hub of homes and commercial uses.

Colwood’s population is slightly more than 17,000. Projections say it could reach 35,000 in the next 25 years, Martin said.

Two organizations represent residents, the Royal Bay Community Association and the Royal Bay/Colwood Homeowners Association. The homeowners group has expressed concerns about losing privacy and views and contending with a noisier environment because of Gablecraft’s multi-storey building plans. They fear that traffic will be heavier and that issue needs to be looked at more closely.

The community association is keen to see the new amenities, particularly the commercial area and a supermarket, go ahead. That group praises the transportation plan, which has a transit exchange, cycling paths, sidewalks, and parks and trails.

A mix of opinions was expressed at the public hearing. One resident called Gablecraft’s plan a “thoughtful balanced development” with homes, waterfront and amenities such as coffee shops, and is looking forward to the project being constructed.

Another speaker said that while the project is a tremendous opportunity for Colwood, he fears that too many homes are going up on the space available. He worried that would lead to smaller lots and reduced street parking.

He recommended that the height of the buildings be restricted to four storeys, instead of six.

On the east or waterfront side of Metchosin Road, the former Producers Pit gravel operation was purchased in 2012 by B.C. Investment Management Corp., which sold it to GableCraft and another developer, Seacliff Properties, in 2017.

All of the waterfront portion of the property is owned by Seacliff, which hopes to obtain a rezoning in future for commercial and residential development on its 134 acres, which it is calling Royal Beach.

GableCraft has most of the upland portion of the property, where it’s seeking a rezoning to allow up to 2,100 homes, as well as alterations to Colwood’s Royal Bay plan, which is within the municipality’s official community plan. Approval would include design guidelines specific to Latoria South, which would govern things like building heights and features.

Council will also decide on whether to approve a site-specific comprehensive development zone for these lands, outlining allowed uses.

Before the vote, council will hear from citizens in the hearing via an online link.

Some nearby residents have written to city hall to express concern about the plans.

The Royal Bay/Colwood Homeowners Association is unhappy with what it described as a “wall” of attached housing replacing earlier plans for single-family housing. They fear taller buildings will result in a noisier environment.

They are also concerned about a loss of privacy, views and view corridors.

The association says it is not satisfied with a traffic report that was carried out, saying its scope was not broad enough and that it is likely to worsen, not alleviate, traffic problems in the area.

GableCraft said its proposal follows extensive community consultation, with three open houses staged in the past year and a half attended by hundreds of people.

The area dubbed Quarry would include 800 ground-oriented homes, either single-family or townhomes, Floer said. It would include seven acres for a 500-student elementary school, and a half-acre for a future satellite fire hall, plus parks.

The neighbourhood called Commons, a little over 40 acres, is planned as the commercial and mixed-use core of Royal Bay, Floer said. It would become another urban centre for the municipality, beyond Colwood Corners.

“For us, the centrepiece of that will be an almost 80,000-square-foot retail village that has the potential to expand over time as the community builds out,” he said. A 35,000-square-foot grocery store, coffee shops, cold beer and wine stores and a pharmacy are among uses envisioned.

The retail village would be located on the southeast corner of the intersection of Ryder Hesjedal Way and Latoria.

Other uses included in the rezoning application include seniors care, cultural and institutional uses, and a potential civic precinct if that’s something the municipality wants, he said.

The Commons would include construction of up to 1,300 homes, largely apartment-style condominiums, he said. There could be some purpose-built rental, as well.

“Obviously there will multiple parties who will eventually be constructing buildings,” Floer said.

“Our group will build the retail village and the first mixed-use residential as well.”

Most buildings would be six storeys at their tallest, with some four-storey buildings to the west of Ryder Hesjedal Way.

GableCraft’s proposal includes close to 17 acres devoted to parkland — neighbourhood parks, natural areas and trails — as well as a transition area between the two neighbourhoods.

A key feature of the entire Royal Bay development is creating connectivity for residents, whether via a linked trail network or cycling and driving links, he said. A transit exchange is in the plans.

The aim is to develop housing for middle-income buyers who would use the retail centre for their everyday needs, Floer said.

By the time the entire north and south sites are built out, the total population on GableCraft land could top 6,000.

If the rezoning application is approved, along with a subsequent development permit, construction of the retail village could start in early 2021, he said.

The residential component of the development will be market-driven, Floer said, and would likely start in the next couple of years.

About 353,000 square feet of buildings are envisioned, Peter Laughlin, Omicron’s director of development on Vancouver Island, said Thursday.

The proposal covers four development parcels. Omicron and Lotus will own two and Omicron will be the development manager of the other two.

Applications have been submitted for employment centre zoning on two of the parcels to attract businesses, add services and provide local jobs, which would help address local transportation issues, Laughlin said. The West Shore is known for its slow traffic during rush hours.

“One of the things that we were looking at, and we knew from past experience - there was a need for industrial lands. The Island is growing. We have an extremely solid economy here. The economy needs support. So we were looking for industrial land for quite a while,” Laughlin said.

The Allandale District is located on both sides of Veterans Memorial Parkway and along Allandale Road.

Colwood Mayor Rob Martin said the community has called for more commercial and light industrialdevelopment.

These kinds of uses will broaden the tax base, he said, adding that, as a bedroom community, Colwood has been relying on residential taxpayers to cover most of the municipality’s bills.

To have tax revenue from commercial uses is “huge for us,” Martin said.

Colwood is passionate about adding well-paying new jobs, held by people who live in the community, Martin said.

“In a very small way, it begins to address the issues around transportation as well. One of our solutions to this is that we need to begin to create more jobs here in the West Shore.”

He welcomes projects which will redevelop existing brownfield sites in Colwood, as in this case.

Half of the development lands are on an old gravel pit and the remainder on a rock bluff, Laughlin said.

Rocks were blasted out of the bluff to create flat areas for development. More than 200,000 cubic metres of blasted rock was relocated to become infill on the former gravel pit, making the entire area usable, Laughlin said. “Land that was seven-eight-nine metres below the road level is now at road level and usable. So it’s a good example of brownfield development.”

Ridley Bros. has been the owner of the four parcels, Laughlin said.

Rezoning applications for two lots, one immediately to the west of the Parkway (Lot B) and another to the east (Lot C) and north of Allandale Road, have been submitted to pave the way for mixed-use employment centres. The applications are expected to come up on the city’s Aug. 24 agenda.

Omicron and Lotus Capital will own the southern and most westerly lot, Lot A, as well as Lot C, north of Allandale and east of the Parkway.

Lot A already allows a range of industrial uses. Colliers International is carrying out market research on what would be the best use for Lot C.

Lot B, immediately to the west of the Parkway, will be owned by local company Sherringham Holdings Ltd.

“The plan right now is for approximately 100,000 square feet of development on that site,” Laughlin said. Of that, about 60,000 square feet will be built as mini-storage, with 40,000 used for commercial-retail.

“The interesting innovation that Sherringham is bringing to the mini-storage market is it is a multi-floor mini-storage,” Laughlin said.

Plans call for a four-storey building, serviced by industrial elevators.

The fourth parcel, Lot 3, east of the parkway and south of Allandale, will be developed on behalf of the Carson Auto Group for a new Ford dealership, Laughlin said.

Surrounded by the ocean, views of neighbouring mountains, bountiful forests, beautiful rivers and falls, and places of wonderful solitude. What it has lacked is a multi-day, inn-to-inn trail that brings this all together in one long-distance hike. Until now.

With the opening of the Sooke Hills Wilderness Trail in the summer of 2017, it is now possible to hike from the Mount Wells parking area in Langford to the town of Lake Cowichan over three days — all on trails — and all without needing a car to get back to Victoria.

The first day, over the Sooke Hills Wilderness Trail with its amazing views from the Malahat, ends at a B&B halfway up the west side of Shawnigan Lake.

The second day, up the Cowichan Valley Trail and over the Kinsol Trestle, ends in Duncan.

The third day, partly along the Cowichan River and with more amazing views, ends in Lake Cowichan. The return from Lake Cowichan to Victoria can be done that same evening or the next morning via a combination of B.C. Transit and the Tofino Bus.

The three legs of the hike range from 25 to 28 kilometres. The first day is the most challenging, with a long and relatively steep ascent, followed by a long stretch of undulating trail.

The second and third days are easier, mostly following old rail tracks (except a few optional but desirable stretches by the Cowichan River on the third day).

Because breakfast and dinner are available at all locations, hikers need only carry the clothes they will need for the three days, some food for lunch and water — so backpack weight is manageable (unlike, say, Cheryl Strayed’s “Monster” from her book Wild).

This hike is certainly challenging and shouldn’t be done without reasonably good conditioning, but the rewards are amazing. The hike winds its way through some of the finest scenery that Vancouver Island has to offer and provides all sorts of time to unwind and enjoy nature.

I did this hike on my own (in late January) and met no more than 10 people on the trail during the entire trip.

If you seek solitude, then this hike is for you. The only sounds I heard were the wind through the trees, birds and rushing waters. Well, I also heard the sounds of logging at times, but accepted this as one of the reasons that some forest trails even exist.

While long-distance walking is a novelty for many Canadians, it has long been popular in Europe: Miles of established paths criss-cross the continent, and in England, they are often clearly marked and cared for. If a path unravels across a farm, the farmer is the caretaker of that expanse. Many enthusiasts belong to the Long Distance Walkers Association, based in England. Founded in 1972, the association is a clearinghouse for information and organizes long-distance walks.

Long-distance walkers aren’t necessarily campers. Even when they do go on adventurous multi-day excursions, they’re just as likely to spend the night at a bed and breakfast where they can take a shower and have a beer. There are even businesses that will carry your gear for you. Long-distance walkers go solo, but they also go in groups.

The wonderful thing about long-distance walking is that there’s a low barrier of entry. It is not as physically daunting as, say, running a marathon. But it is, of course, hard work. After a number of kilometres, one’s feet can definitely start aching.

Blisters are often the bane of the long-distance walker. Several threads on the association’s forums are devoted to how best to combat, treat and drain blisters. Methods discussed include an absorbing plaster called “Compeed,” duct tape, and immersing sweaty feet in a bag of corn flour. But the bodily toll is worth it!

Studies have shown that long-distance walking can facilitate relief and disengagement from common stresses and problems in life and can help people find ways to resolve their issues. Moreover, long-distance walking can build confidence and a sense of purpose and provide opportunities for reflection. Studies also show that “forest bathing,” a practice that originated in Japan in the late 1980s, increases immunity, decreases the risk of cancer and helps you to recover from illness faster.

Keep all this in mind as you contemplate the hike, day by day.

Day 1: Langford to Shawnigan Lake

The hike begins at the Mount Wells parking lot on Humpback Road. B.C. Transit (Route 65 from downtown Victoria) will get you about 1.5 kilometres — a 20-minute walk — from the trailhead. The other alternative is to take a cab.

The first 2.5 kilometres of the trail are beautiful, passing the Waugh Creek Falls and crossing the Goldstream River Suspension Bridge. At 2.5 kilometres, the trail passes a gate and becomes a service road (for the Victoria watershed) and climbs steadily for the next seven kilometres. At 9.5 kilometres, the service road ends at another gate and morphs back into a true trail.

For the next four kilometres, which are the highest elevations for the trail, there are great views of Mount Baker to the east and the Olympic mountains to the south. The last kilometre of this stretch is a wonderful piece of single-track trail through a forest up to Stebbings Road.

Now you are on the Cowichan Valley Trail, dropping down into a forest, often running by a creek, crossing the lovely little Shawnigan Creek Bridge at the 20-kilometre mark. This stretch ends at Sooke Lake Road at the 22-kilometre mark.

From here, it is a flat six kilometres, with glimpses of Shawnigan Lake to the east, to the night’s destination — the delightful Stonekroft Guest House (just east of the trail, across Shawnigan Lake Road at 2021 Marble Rd.).

Day 2: Shawnigan Lake to Duncan

Resuming the trail where you left it the day before, cross the small McGee Trestle at the two-kilometre mark and the magnificent and historic Kinsol Trestle at the 9.5-kilometre mark.

In contrast to the first day, the trail on the second day is generally flat, with more wide-open vistas.

About the 21.5-kilometre mark (about four kilometres west of Duncan and 200 metres after crossing Shawnigan Road), there is a small trail branching off the right/east toward Duncan, the night’s destination. This trail ends after about three kilometres at Glenora Road.

From there, it is another one or two kilometres on roads to Duncan, where there are several accommodation options (I stayed at McLay Guest House).

Day 3: Duncan to Lake Cowichan

Rather than retracing your steps to the fork in the trail west of Duncan (which makes for a very long day of more than 30 kilometres), take a taxi from Duncan to the Glenora Trails Head Park (which shaves eight kilometres off the day’s hike). From that point, it is about 25 kilometres to Lake Cowichan, including time spent on some of the smaller trails running beside the Cowichan River.

The trail crosses the Holt Creek Trestle, the 64.4 Mile Trestle, the 66 Mile Trestle and the 70.2 Mile Trestle.

Highlights of the day include the five kilometres of trail by the Cowichan River just past the Holt Creek Trestle (there is a sign for this just past the trestle, where a small trail branches off to the right and initially follows Holt Creek) and the North Side trail that is accessed just past 66 Mile Trestle (on the left-hand side).

The latter trail takes you along spectacular bluff tops high above the river, until the Horseshoe Bend Group Campground, at which point the trail becomes more bucolic and travels alongside the river until reaching Skutz Falls.

From there, the trail is relatively flat and straight, eventually spilling out in Lake Cowichan, where there are several options for accommodation if you want to overnight before heading back to Victoria.

The details

What to bring

Definitely look at the weather forecast to determine clothing needs. Smartwool tops are great because they can go several days without needing to be washed. Bring a change of clothes to relax in during the evenings.

For food, bring some energy bars for snacks and lunches for Day 1 and Day 2 (lunch for Day 3 can be bought in Duncan).

Depending on the temperature, plan to bring two to three litres of water each day (there are no places to pick up water during the day).

A 25- to 30-litre backpack should be fine to carry clothes, water and food.

Hiking poles aren’t really needed — the trail is not technical except for some mildly technical stretches alongside the Cowichan River.

For the same reason, hiking shoes aren’t really required — running shoes will suffice for the most part (though hiking shoes will keep feet warmer in winter).

Where to stay

Following Day 1, the only option is the Stonekroft Guest House, which is just off Shawnigan Lake at 2021 Marble Rd. The hosts, Jude and Tom, are very considerate and make a wonderful breakfast.

Dinner at the end of Day 1 can be obtained from Sarpino’s Pizzeria, which will deliver to Stonekroft and which makes great pizza (there are no restaurants within walking distance of the Stonekroft).

Following Day 2, there are several accommodation options in Duncan. There are places in southwest Duncan that are closer to the trail, but it is still necessary to walk into town for dinner and to buy provisions for lunch on Day 3.

Following Day 3, there is accommodation in Lake Cowichan or the possibility of returning to Victoria by bus.

Transportation

The Mount Wells parking lot, the start of the trail, can be accessed by taking a cab or by B.C. Transit (the nearest stop, on Route 65, is about 1.5 kilometres from the trailhead).

From Lake Cowichan, the end of the trail, there is a B.C. Transit bus (Route 7) to Duncan.

From Duncan, Tofino Bus travels to downtown Victoria. However, while the Tofino Bus runs that route daily, its only evening runs are on Fridays and Sundays.

If you are arriving in Lake Cowichan on any other day, it is necessary to overnight there and then take the Tofino bus from Duncan the next morning.

When to go

With the right clothing and footwear, this hike can be done year-round (except after heavy snowfalls). The trail will generally not get too muddy in the rain (except the branch trails running by the Cowichan River).

Which direction to go

Either direction is possible, but the advantage of south to north is that it will mean not walking into the sun.

Longer and shorter alternatives

This can be shortened to a two-day hike by either ending in Duncan or by doing an out-and-back to Shawnigan Lake. Alternatively, it can be made a four-day hike by hiking back from Lake Cowichan to Duncan.

Alone or with others?

Hiking long-distance trails on your own can provide the opportunity to enjoy the sounds of nature, go at your own pace and better reflect and meditate. On the other hand, hiking with others provides the opportunity to share a wonderful experience and can help the time go by faster.

Maps

While the trail is well marked and maps aren’t really required, the following maps are useful:

• Sooke Hills Wilderness Regional Park Map

• Cowichan Valley Trail, Malahat Connector Map

• Cowichan Valley Trail Map

• Cowichan River Provincial Park Map (particularly good for noting the trails leaving the main trail to go by the Cowichan River)

It is also a good idea to bring a smartphone, which can be used to determine where you are on the trail (though cell coverage is spotty in some areas) and to provide maps of Duncan and Lake Cowichan.

Landslide Lake caught the face of one the Island's tallest mountains when a magnitude-7.3 earthquake shook it loose in 1946.

""The northeast slope of (Mount) Colonel Foster fractured off and fell into the lake. And the lake subsequently had a tsunami, or a big wave, that hurdled down the whole valley and took a whole bunch of trees or vegetation with it,"" said Marlene Smith, co-founder of Friends of Strathcona Park.

Today, hikers can climb up the smooth rock face left by the wave's path to reach the lake's icy, teal waters.

Vancouver Island is well known for its coastal trails, but the alpine peaks and mountain valleys at its centre are also lined with day and overnight hikes in Strathcona Park, British Columbia's oldest provincial park.

The journey to Landslide Lake begins at the Elk River Trailhead off Highway 28, between Campbell River and Gold River.

Hikers can stop at the nearby volunteer-run Strathcona Wilderness Institute for information about the park.

While experienced hikers can do the 26-kilometre round trip hike in about nine hours, Smith recommends packing a tent and making it an overnight adventure. An average hiker will take four to six hours to reach the campsite, which is another hour or two from the lake.

""It's a beautiful trail, which is hikeable for almost all ages, although you have to be reasonably fit, because it's quite long,"" Smith said.

From the trailhead, a wide path meanders through old-growth stands of Douglas fir, hemlock and cedar. The toughest parts of the trek are its first and last sections, with a total elevation rise of 600 metres.

The trail mostly parallels Elk River, which is prone to gush when there's too much rain, snow or glacial melt. There is also an avalanche risk in winter and early spring.

That makes July and August — the driest months — best for a visit, although hikers often make their way through between late spring and early fall.

""Bridges and parts of the trail are prone to flood, so I always recommend people check to make sure it is not flooded, but accessible,"" Smith said.

Matthew Lettington, president of Island Mountain Ramblers, also warned hikers to plan their trips before they start, since cellular and satellite reception is spotty in the park.

He first visited the trail about eight years ago.

""I was surprised how deep between the mountains we were. There are sections in there, still, where we'll lose our GPS signals because the mountains are so tall. It's called a 'box canyon,'"" Lettington said.

For those interested in extending the adventure, a more rugged trail along the eastern edge of Landslide Lake leads to another turquoise, glacial lake known colloquially as Berg Lake.

Little icebergs may float at the surface or it may be frozen over, depending on the time of year.

Ice caves also form along its edge, but enter at your own risk, as they're prone to collapse.

""Those aren't there every year. Sometimes you have heavy, heavy snow and hard winters that persist into September. Other years, there may be no snow accumulated in those place, so it's always changing,"" Lettington said.

When you arrive at Canfield Estate after a picturesque jaunt along the country roads of rural Ontario, the first thing you’ll notice is the serenity. You can hear the birds chirping and the rustle of the leaves in the wind as the sounds and frenzy of city life slowly fade from your mind.

The estate, a one-of-kind private retreat, is on the market for an owner who is looking for natural beauty and a diverse range of amenities; from a games room and a cigar lounge, to a swimming hole and a ’50s-style diner outfitted with ice-cream makers, a popcorn machine and retro bar stools.

Located in the heart of Haldimand County, a 90-minute drive from Toronto, the sprawling 200-acre property includes 14 structures, including the stunning main lodge with five bedrooms and seven bathrooms, a versatile outdoor pavilion perfect for country dinners and four cottages for hosting friends and family for generations to come.

“It’s a place that people don’t want to leave,” says owner Blair McKeil, president and chief executive officer of Breakwater Investments. “Whether people arrive in a pick-up truck or helicopter, they want to stay longer. It’s a secluded sanctuary.”

Once used as a hunting lodge, the extraordinary estate can serve as an all-year family estate, a corporate retreat, a countryside resort, or a rustic wedding venue.

It’s easy to see why it has become a beloved getaway for so many guests since it was built in 2012. In the summer, there are plenty of activities to fill in the gloriously long days: fly fishing, paddle boating, skeet shooting, swimming, following the bevy of swans as they paddle through the pond, dining at a 50-foot harvest table, enjoying drinks outdoors as the sun sets, and later, catching a movie at the on-site drive-in theatre with a 20- by 30-foot screen.

“Canfield Estate brings people together to share and care,” says McKeil. “It offers a sense of community where you can feel safe and secure, like a bird’s nest.”

Come fall, activities shift to hiking through the golden-leaved forest, more fishing in the fully stocked pond and roasting marshmallows under the bright stars of a clear night.

In winter, it’s time for skating on a frozen pond, a friendly game of hockey, snowshoeing, cross-country skiing or tobogganing. Pamper yourself with a steam in the sauna and then cozy up next to the fireplace with a good book and a bottle of wine from the cellar.

The overall look of Canfield Estate is rustic modern luxury that’s warm and welcoming. Every room of each building of the complex has been thoughtfully designed with comfort in mind. The talent of local artisans can be seen in the details of the décor – hammered copper sinks, a pair of canoes hung from the ceiling and turned into light fixtures, birch bark accents and photos on the wall from the archives of Hudson’s Bay.

Haldimand County is one of Canada’s most liveable communities, according to a 2019 report by Maclean’s. It’s home to a growing wine scene and a wide range of local producers, offering everything from fresh turkey to organic fruits and vegetables. The sandy shores of Lake Erie are just a 15-minute drive away, handy for boaters and fishermen.

Canfield Estate is much more than a large piece of property. It represents a lifestyle, a more leisurely pace and an appreciation for things that really matter, like spending quality time with family and enjoying the finer things in life in a private space that feels like it’s a world apart. As McKeil points out, “You can do so many wonderful things here that many people have never experienced. It’s a very special place.”

For more details on Canfield Estate, refer to its real estate listing.

“Thursday’s ceremony was a huge milestone for the project,” said Ken Milbrath, president of the Vancouver Island Trail Association, who is overseeing the trail’s creation.

The association, formed in 2009, has been steadily linking existing backcountry hiking routes through public land. The trail winds through forests as well as rugged coastlines.

Only 140 kilometres of trail, all sitting in private land owned by two forest companies, remain to be added to complete it.

The main blockade is two sections around Cowichan Lake and Port Alberni. The two sections — essentially old logging roads — have been closed to public access over concerns regarding liability.

With regional governments signalling that they would be open to classifying the trail as an easement, the last sections could join the trail in “a couple of years,” Milbrath said.

“When complete, the Vancouver Island Trail has the potential to become an economic driver for the region.”

Liz Bicknell, president of the Outdoor Club of Victoria, agrees.

“The opening of the trail can be a boon for smaller communities that are now just dependent on the forestry industry,” said Bicknell, who is also the fundraising director for the Vancouver Island Trail Association.

“Hikers will need food, accommodation and other ancillary businesses so vital for smaller communities.”

A hike along the trail in its entirety would take between two to three months; Milbrath said people are already taking day trips and overnight trips on existing portions of the trail.

One of the most famous hiking routes is the Camino de Santiago, which is nearly 800 kilometres in length. The path, an UNESCO World Heritage Site, was once used by pilgrims to visit a religious shrine in Spain.

“I like to tell people that a trip along the Vancouver Island Trail is no less spectacular, with hikers encountering 49 separate First Nations along the way,” Milbrath said. “All have different history of art, culture and language to tell.”

The opening will be followed up with the planned erection of a kiosk in Anderson Hill Park, with plaques giving information on the trail.

The society is accepting donations to help cover the cost of trail construction.

I’m thinking of a lacy wild arugula plant at an edge of a vegetable plot this spring, a dainty ruff of white sweet alyssum blooming around its base. Both plants self-sow freely in my garden.

Several years ago a donkey-tail spurge appeared beside the greenhouse door. I cut back the flowered stems in summer to retain the evergreen plant’s neat form as its blue-green, succulent foliage peeks out of a companion (volunteer) carpet of bigroot geranium.

To keep that plant duet conveniently compact, I occasionally pluck out tufts of the geranium and pass them along to a neighbour who is establishing a mass planting of the weed-suppressing ground cover.

And the tall, flamboyant peony poppies are back in abundance this year — in beautiful coral and peach shades, white and pink, lilac, and one with finely fringed, burgundy-black petals. Most have fully double, frilly flowers. The smooth, blue-green leaves have wavy edges.

These poppies (Papaver somniferum) are welcome points of dramatic colour throughout the garden, and the dried pods yield seeds that can be used in baking. For that reason they are called breadseed poppies. The plants are frequent “volunteers” in gardens.

Early in the month, beside the cucumber vines, I found a lovely lilac poppy blooming together with the lacy flowers of cilantro. For a while I stationed myself in front of the bloom, watching a bee darting in and out of it. As I stood there, a hummingbird arrived to whir away at my right elbow for a while before darting off.

Gardens. Places to pause, and allow delight to happen.

July pruning. I aim to prune wisteria, kiwi and grape vines, and fruit trees this month. Summer pruning of fruit trees helps to keep them compact, while “dormant season” pruning in late winter promotes an abundance of new growth.

On my apple trees, I shorten the new growth back by at least a half, often leaving just three or four leaves on that new, lighter-coloured growth. Cut right above an outward-pointing leaf, to direct new growth away from the centre of the plant.

At the same time, remove any dead, broken or awkwardly positioned growth. Ideal is an uncongested tree that allows free circulation of fresh air and optimum exposure of ripening fruit to sunlight.

Shorten new growth also on kiwi and grape vines. I make the cuts just a few leaves beyond forming fruit. On both vines, opening up “windows” of sunlight onto the developing kiwi fruit and grape clusters helps to promote their development and ripening.

On wisteria, shorten the long shoots of new growth to between 10 and 15 cm. Cut main, framework stems back where they have grown beyond the vine’s support structure. Prune again in January, leaving three or four buds on shoots produced since the summer pruning.

Cats, revisited, with bells on. In a recent column I shared my adventures chasing neghbours’ cats away to protect quail families making their way through the garden. The last time I ran after beefy Blaze as he headed for his home fence, I rounded a corner too fast, slid on a rock pathway edging, and toppled over onto a large, cushy clump of chives. I was fine. The chives, not so much.

It appears I’m not alone in attempting to foil the felines. Jean has written: “We have also had a problem with cats. We used to see the quail all the time and now never do. The neighbours’ cats do have bells, but they (the cats) soon learned to walk in a way that keeps the bells silent.”

Another reader admits to “having a serial killer of a cat.”

In search of a solution, she “talked to the staff at Wild Birds Unlimited, who advised me that birds are highly colour sensitive. On their recommendation my cat now wears a very bright fabric clown-style ruff. Now, she is catching one bird a month at most, compared to one almost every day.”",699,0.9540247828245281,local

Want to take a peek into homes where plants rule? It’s a mindset that Hilton Carter, passionate lover of all things green and author of Wild Interiors, Beautiful Plants in Beautiful Spaces, CICO Books 2020, explores and practises on a daily basis.

After surveying restaurants, hotels, and public spaces as well as the countless homes he has visited and styled, Carter notes that “filling spaces where people gather with greenery has become a new way of life. To so many of us, the need to surround ourselves with plants is just that: life.”

As Carter takes us on a journey through 12 very special plant-lovers’ homes, he offers styling tips.

Artist Alina Fassakhova has amassed 80 plants that happily grow in clusters throughout her loft apartment. In part they act as living screens demarcating spaces in an open plan design.

Shown here, Philodendron and Alocasia separate Alina’s kitchen from the rest of the space making the transition feel natural and not blocking out light as a screen would do.

It’s not easy for her to pick a favourite plant, but Alina does choose the variegated Monstera because every leaf has a unique, abstract pattern.

Carter has laced his book with valuable information on a wide variety of plants including plant descriptions and instructions on light requirements, temperature, watering and repotting. There’s even a section on trending plants.

In Antwerp, Belgium, when plant store owners Sofie and Yannick renovated a townhouse built in 1905, they had two things in mind, “finding more space for our cats and plants and finding new ways to integrate plants into different rooms and lighting conditions.

In the room that opens out to a patio they built a beam and added a skylight so they could hang plants and a hanging chair.

Carter calls this a plant throne, a place to sit and survey all the beautiful greenery in your kingdom.

Prominent plants in this photo are Monstera deliciosa, rubber plant and fiddle-leaf fig.

The jungle vibe is all around but balanced in rooms where smaller plants sit on side tables.

Carter has a few words for pets vs plants.

Acknowledging that plants can be toxic to pets he suggests hanging climbing or trailing plants up high, grouping small plants along a window sill leaving no room for jumping felines, and choosing larger tree-like plants that have tall trunks, which keeps the foliage out of reach.

Plants require the right “outfits” to sit in. Another point of style for Carter is how the plants are presented.

Choose a selection of pots and hangers that suit the size and growth patterns of your plants.

In Sara’s duplex cottage in L.A., her living room has an intriguing display of plants.

A fiddle-leaf fig, a bird of paradise, sword fern and golden pothos thrive in comely pots and a large open weave basket.

Carter offers a guide for plant selection according to the available light in each room as well as which plants suit specific rooms.

Understand your light and space requirements before you bring home these new friends.

It is a great source of happiness tending to the plants and watching them thrive under your care.

The standard rose campion species is a familiar plant with dense clumps of velvety, silver-grey foliage and multi-branched stems bearing bright magenta-pink blooms. Like most species, L. coronaria doesn’t always produce flowers in a common, uniform colour. Seed growers over the years have selected certain variations and propagated them to produce a distinct strain.

Most of the flowers on my self-sown boulevard plants this year are white, some with vestiges of the pink blushing characteristic of my original Angel’s Blush seeding. One plant bears the usual deep magenta pink blooms of the species.

One man stopped his truck beside the boulevard and asked permission to photograph the white-flowered rose campion for his mother, a keen gardener. They’d never seen rose campion with white blooms.

Most mainstream catalogues no longer list this historic Mediterranean flower. Two more sources are Brother Nature Seeds in Victoria and Florabunda Seeds in Ontario.

Abundance. Until almost mid-month, cool temperatures and frequent rains created waves of lush green in our gardens. Everything grew profusely. I’ve never had such plump, juicy lettuces. The frilly endive has been flavourful, with no bitterness.

Potato tops grew uncommonly long. Spinach and beet greens were luxuriant. Cabbage family vegetables grew wonderfully robust in the cool weather. And the peas have been magic.

My first double row of peas, seeded mid-March, produced a mass of pods on thick-stemmed vines. A first picking, on July 1, yielded seven cups of blanched peas for the freezer. After a series of follow-up pickings I had frozen 25 cups of the peas. That did not include the ones I’d consumed fresh.

Now those vines are lifted, chopped and composted, and the second double, four-metre row has begun to yield filled pods. That first double row grew, like the second one, on wire fencing in a space one by four metres. The same space delivered around 10 lettuces that developed from transplants placed along the pea vine bases. That’s a fairly substantial yield of food from the limited space.

Along the south side of the same rectangular plot, another four-metre length of wire fencing supports a dozen staked tomato plants and two cucumber vines, with sweet potatoes growing in a strip on the south side of the tomatoes.

That space, four by 1.2 metres, promises a good yield of food if the weather warms sufficiently.

Delayed development. While cool growing plants flourished through late spring and early summer, others did not. Fruit set has been delayed on open garden tomatoes. Two of my three Sugar Baby watermelon transplants shivered into oblivion. The one remaining began expanding earlier in the month atop a partially “finished” compost heap, but it might be too late now for fruit set and ripening.

With warm, sunny weather, tomatoes should begin to develop fruits more normally, but varieties requiring a long, warm summer to ripen may prove disappointing this year. My Big Beef, Arbason and Japanese Trifele Black plants have swelling fruit.

There are plenty of small tomatoes on the potted patio varieties, though the plants have grown larger than they usually do. Fruits are developing on the potted miniature peppers.

The regular, full-sized cucumber plants have struggled, and bear only tiny fruits, but the two mini-cucumber varieties I’m growing have been more than gratifying.

I ate my first 13-centimetre cucumber from a Picolino (West Coast Seeds) vine on July 13 and the first from Green Light (T&T Seeds) the next day. The trained (upward) Green Light vines are as tall as I am. The vines are robust, with large, deep green leaves.

H.L.

That’s been a common issue this year. One of my neighbours pulled up and composted all her cauliflower plants because the heads had taken on purplish tones. Too bad, because they were perfectly safe to eat.

Cauliflower is highly heat-sensitive. Most plants thrived in our long, cool, moist spring and early summer, but the sudden onset of heat and strong sunlight has caused in some plants the common reaction of purple colouring.

Certain varieties, such as the popular Snow Crown, are more susceptible than others. I’ve had Snow Crown heads become tinged with purple or purplish-pink in hot, sunny weather.

Dear Helen: I was interested in your descriptions of dense, close-space planting to make the best use of a limited area. I have experimented with planting like this and found watering can be challenging. The dense foliage canopy of substantial plants such as tomatoes, broccoli and pea vines tends to divert water away from the plants’ roots. How do you manage to keep the root areas of closely spaced plants moist?

A.T.

Soaker hoses laid between the rows is one way to keep the sheltered soil watered. I use a more hands-on method.

To reach in and give a gentle but thorough dousing of the soil between two four-metre pea vine rows and between a pea row and another of staked tomatoes, with just a one-metre space between the rows, I’ve used a long-handled watering wand with an on-off lever.

That first pea planting is finished and removed now and I’m picking the second planting, but the narrow alley between the peas and tomatoes is easily kept well moistened, at ground level, with my handy extra-long watering wand.

To some, such a method might seem antiquated and inefficient, yet the time spent wielding that wand is somehow easeful.

I treasure such blessedly undemanding tasks. They are sublime opportunities let the gaze wander, listen to the bees humming, and rest the mind.

Dear Helen: Quite a few years ago, you shared a recipe for lavender cookies. I used that recipe so much, my copy has become unreadable. Could you repeat it? I love these cookies and they are a favourite of my family and friends.

T.W.

Lavender shortbread

1 1/2 cups butter at room temperature

2/3 cup sugar

2 Tbsp chopped lavender florets

1 Tbsp chopped fresh mint

2 1/3 cups flour

1/2 cup corn starch

1/4 tsp salt

Cream butter and sugar. Add lavender and mint. Mix until light and fluffy, about three minutes. Add flour, corn starch and salt. Beat until combined.

Divide the dough in half, flatten into squares, and wrap in plastic. Chill until firm. On a floured board, roll or pat out each square to a thickness of 3/8 inch. Cut the dough into 1 1/2-inch squares or rounds, and transfer to baking sheets that are covered with parchment or brown paper. Space them one inch apart, and prick each cookie several times with the tines of a fork.

Bake 20 to 25 minutes at 325 F, until pale golden. Do not allow the shortbread to brown.

Cool slightly, transfer to a rack, sprinkle with lavender powdered sugar if you wish, and store in sealed containers.

Lavender powdered sugar is made by putting a few lavender flowers in a sealed pint jar of powdered sugar for a day before using the sugar.

Instead, change usually comes from the bottom up.

Occasionally — when faced with intransigence — that change has to come through violence and revolution, but more often, it happens relatively peacefully and in an evolutionary manner, although not without the need for anger, determination and confrontation on occasion — witness the Black Lives Matter movement.

Other recent examples include the growing acceptance of gay marriage and the youth climate strikes.

The concept of Conversations for a One Planet Region — a non-profit community organization we established in November 2019 after almost three years of working as a loose network — is rooted in this understanding that all politics is local. We believe that before we can take effective action we need to learn about, discuss and understand both the global and — importantly — the local level implications of the massive and rapid global ecological changes we have created.

The word “conversation” is key: We believe our discussions about these issues must be local and in person, face-to-face to the extent that is possible in the present circumstances. A second important reason for keeping the conversations local is that it is an important form of community building.

Thus, we use only local speakers/conversation leaders, because we believe we have more than enough knowledge, expertise and experience right here in the Greater Victoria Region to create a One Planet region.

Local change and local action are important, indeed vital, but they need to be rooted in a very different set of values to those that drive decision-making today, not just in our own Western democratic society, but globally. In our work, we have come to see what we are doing as encouraging a form of cultural evolution, looking for ways to accelerate the change in the deep cultural values that lie at the heart of our problems.

In his recent book, The Patterning Instinct, which explores “the deep historical foundations of our modern worldview,” Jeremy Lent identifies what he calls root metaphors.

They include the notion of “nature as machine” and our belief in “conquering nature”; the idea that indefinite growth is both possible and desirable, and the idea that it is normal to be selfish and pursue our own self-interest rather than the welfare of the group or community.

Lent is clear that if we are to achieve the deep transformation of civilization that is needed, we must change these root metaphors and establish new core values. He has identified three sets of values as “foundational principles for our major decisions”: An emphasis on quality of life rather than just how much wealth and “stuff” we have; a sense of shared humanity where we are part of and have responsibilities to other people; and a commitment to environmental sustainability rooted in a sense of connection to nature and other species.

So in our next series of monthly Conversations starting in September — necessarily online at present — we will begin by exploring how values shift, how we can identify or stimulate key social tipping points and accelerate social and cultural evolution locally toward a commitment to becoming a One Planet Region.

Then, in the following three months up to the end of the year, we will explore in turn each of the three core values that Jeremy Lent has identified.

Clearly, understanding our situation and recognizing the values shift that is necessary has to be widespread, and not confined to a small group who get it already.

So we are committed to both broadening and deepening the rather narrow base of those who have been engaged in the Conversations we have been having. We urgently need a region-wide Conversation about the core values that are required and their implications for the individual and collective decisions we must make if we are to successfully make the transition to a healthier, more just and sustainable future for our children and the generations beyond them.

North Cowichan is unique in Canada in that it possesses some 5,000 hectares of its own forest land – the Municipal Forest Reserve, also known as the Six Mountains – property it has been logging for profit, with an annual allowable cut set at 20,000 cubic metres per year.

Problem is, the Forest Reserve falls within the “coastal douglas-fir” biogeoclimatic zone, which is the rarest of 16 such zones in the province. The range of this ecological zone is small and thin, but includes southeastern Vancouver Island and the Gulf Islands and has been heavily impacted by private land ownership and logging.

Higher elevations in the Forest Reserve merge into the “very dry maritime coastal western hemlock” zone, which is also at risk for the same reasons, says Andy MacKinnnon, co-author of the best-selling reference book, the Plants of Coastal British Columbia.

Coastal douglas-fir represents the “smallest and most at risk zone in B.C.,” confirms the Coastal Douglas-fir & Associated Ecosystems Conservation Partnership. It is “home to the highest number of species and ecosystems at risk in B.C.” and “less than one per cent” remains in old-growth forests,” says the Partnership, which is a vast coalition that includes the B.C. government, municipalities – but not North Cowichan – and conservation organizations.

The municipality has for months been promising a public consultation on the future of the Forest Reserve, one that is open, broad, deep, fair, robust and transparent process.

So far, nothing could be further from reality.

On July 17, the municipality announced it is pausing the public consultation for 60 days to allow a separate consultation with First Nations to proceed.

The public hasn’t a clue what government-to-government talks with First Nations are discussing. And public consultations to date have generated criticism of unnecessary secrecy and pro-logging bias.

The consultant, Lees and Associates, and the municipality have ordered that meetings of the citizens’ Working Group – appointed to guide the consultation process – remain closed, even after a clear majority of the Working Group voted in favour of openness.

To shed some much-need light on the issue, I posted a short video (through my sixmountains.ca blog), The Unseen Forest: youtube.com/watch?v=XqU6h2OZRos.

The video employs drone footage of municipal clearcutting atop iconic Mount Prevost, which is also a place of cultural significance to First Nations. I wanted to refute a statement the municipal administrator made to council: “We do not clear-cut as a harvesting practice.”

I also wanted residents who cannot make it to the top of Mount Prevost to see for themselves what’s happening.

The video has generated a lot of discussion, some of it unhealthy.

Pro-logging advocates have been ordered to stop their abusive on-line remarks against those seeking a conservation vision for the Six Mountains. The administrator of the Facebook Maple Bay Neighbour to Neighbour public group, posted the following warning: “As we are in a very small window of opportunity where we can have a say in the future of our … forests, I really would like this discussion to continue. However, I will not allow for bullying and personal attacks to continue.”

There is another way forward for the Six Mountains.

University of B.C. forestry experts recently appeared before council to not only encourage greater protection for the coastal Douglas-fir zone, but to report that the Municipality stands to earn as much or more from selling carbon credits and leaving our endangered forests standing.

The forestry program has earned an annual net profit of only $132,000 over the long term – a figure that has been padded in recent years by inclusion of $86,000 in cell-tower rentals.

The jobs argument also does not carry much weight, since as few as about 10 direct jobs – two of those municipal administration staff – are created by cutting these rare forests. The final kicker is that 63 per cent of the timber removed from the Forest Reserve was exported as raw logs last year.

The case for conservation is being made daily in the Forest Reserve. I only wish I could say that North Cowichan council is listening.

Lucky you is right. Furnishings and accessories that we inherit don’t always suit our style. But sometimes they teach us something about ourselves that we might not have known.

Instead of thinking about how the turquoise chair doesn’t work, ask yourself if you like it. That’s the key. If so, experiment with ways that it could fit.

It is natural for most of us to be timid about colour. Especially strong colour. That chair demands to be noticed. Just like a red dress or bright yellow shirt says here I am, look at me. There is nothing wrong with strutting your colour. And it can be done in such a way as to not overwhelm you or your space.

That red dress would be more flattering with a pastel pink scarf to soften the effect. What about white pants with the yellow blouse? And for your chair, in a cheerful and stylish bedroom, pale tones of buttery yellow on the walls and cool shades of green on the bed soften and balance the strength of the turquoise as shown here from thespruce.com.

Decorate around a bold colour with neutrals taking most of the wall space. The bedlinens are also neutral, but the glorious turquoise pops up as part of the design on the curtains and a throw cushion.

Until you are used to the chair, drape a light yellow or green blanket over the back. Or add a cushion. Enjoy your inheritance. I bet it will soon be your favourite piece.

Dear Debbie: I am a bit of a hoarder, not crazy yet but I do have difficulty finding ways to make my rooms look reasonably neat. My partner has just moved in and I feel a crisis coming on. How do I manage the mess?

Lillah

Choose a bookcase that will enhance your room as well as the items you have selected to display.

You know what I’m going to say: To begin with, do a purge. Painful at first but once you take a good look at what you are saving you will discover that you just don’t need or want all that stuff. And what a perfect way to welcome your partner.

Next is to create places for storing and viewing what you really do care for. A good set of shelves, one for each room, will get you started. Group together collections that tell your story like the pieces you have saved for a reason. Whether it’s books, miniature cars, old perfume bottles or postcards, display them so you can enjoy the memories.

If it’s something larger like posters, paper a wall with them. Is it shoes? Line them up along the bedroom wall. I’ve never understood the need to hide away what we hold dear no matter what it is. Then ask your partner to do the same.

Choose shelving that enhances your stories. Floating shelves promote an airy feeling, good for a minimalist vibe. Wooden shelves with wrought iron brackets are country style. Built-in bookshelves garner a more formal façade offering a feeling of permanence. Next pick a colour to paint the shelves if they aren’t already finished.

Bernier said last summer was the team's most successful visit ever, excavating cabins and a steward's pantry on Erebus, and bringing 355 artifacts to the surface for restoration and study. Robot cameras were used to probe inside the HMS Terror for the first time since it was discovered four years ago.

The plan was to return again later this month, when Arctic conditions are normally best for this kind of work, and keep going.

But because of COVID-19, access to the wrecks of HMS Erebus and HMS Terror in waters off King William Island in Nunavut, is closed to all but local Inuit Guardians keeping watch on the sites, and those with harvesting rights in the surrounding waters.

""It is quite disappointing,"" said Bernier, the manager of underwater archaeology.

The two ships, with 129 men on board, left England in 1845 to pursue the dream of finding and mapping the Northwest Passage. They would never return.

The whereabouts of the ships were a global mystery until 2014, when Parks Canada divers, helped by Inuit guides, located Erebus in 2014, and then Terror two years later, about 100 kilometres further north, in the coincidentally named Terror Bay.

While missing one more year of exploration when the wrecked ships have already lain in their watery graves for more than a century and a half may seem like no big deal, every year that passes brings more risk that some of the secrets contained within may never be revealed.

""We are concerned about Erebus,"" said Bernier.

That ship, the only one divers have been inside of as yet, is close to the surface, and sometimes if the waves are high enough, the top of the ship is fully exposed. Some years, said Bernier, they return to find extensive damage already done to the ship. Others they come back and nothing has changed at all.

The break, said Bernier, could give them more time to research and begin preservation and restoration work on the objects already recovered. Like a pair of epaulets left in a box under the bed of the cabin belonging to Lt. James Walter Fairholme, and a brush with hairs still in it that can be analyzed for DNA.

But that work too has been delayed by COVID-19.

The archaeology team was sent home in mid-March when most federal buildings were closed. The date of return to their labs is still not known, said Bernier.

The team has been able to use the photos and videos taken on both ships to work on mapping them out. Terror, which is more protected than Erebus because it lies in deeper water, hasn't been mapped fully at all yet, so that work is underway this summer. Diving into the ships takes precision and the maps are needed to do it properly.

Dives to Erebus can last as long as three hours but the deeper, and much colder waters around Terror will limit exploring that ship to about 30 minutes a day, said Bernier.

Bernier said the information gleaned from every object, every trip below the water, helps fill in gaps in the story. Since Fairholme's epaulets were found in his cabin but none of his clothes, Bernier wonders whether he decided they were expendable when he packed to leave the ship forever.

There are other questions. Why were the belongings of a Terror crew member found on Erebus? Did Terror get abandoned first and the remaining men move to Erebus before it too got trapped in the ice and sank?

Bernier said on Erebus, the plates in the pantry were still neatly stacked in their racks, a coffee pot still in it place, pencils and pencil boxes remaining on their shelves.

It suggests the ship was neither abandoned quickly, nor did it sink suddenly, since a sudden influx of water would have caused more damage.

""That's what we have to do now, is try to make things fit,"" he said. ""That will help us understand what happened, what's the timelines.""

For the archaeology team, they're just biding their time now until next year when they hope the pandemic is over and they can once again return to the North for the exploration that will make their careers.

""For an archaeologist, this is a once in a lifetime,"" he said.

Your “volunteer” plant is Nicandra physalodes, commonly known as shoo-fly plant but also called “Apple of Peru.” It’s a vigorously bushy annual, 60 to 150 cm tall depending on the growing conditions, with handsome, wavy-edged leaves and summer-long sky-blue, bell-shaped flowers followed by attractive, papery pods that are used in dried arrangements.

Native to Peru, Nicandra is an old-fashioned garden favourite, grown for its decorative qualities and also for its possible fly-repelling qualities. It used to be grown commonly around farm homes for that purpose, and in greenhouses to help control whiteflies.

I acquired seed years ago, and the plants have made a modest return appearance every year since. From its popularity in years past, Nicandra has become modestly naturalized.

Currently, few catalogues list the seeds. One that does is Brother Nature Seeds, located in Victoria. Their listing of Nicandra suggests a possible reason for the plant’s fly-repelling reputation: “We believe the pods, when dry, resemble small hornets’ nests.”

The J. L. Hudson catalogue, a source for many unique and unusual vegetable and flower varieties, lists the regular Nicandra as well as ‘Nigra,” a form with deep purple-black stems and pods flushed with purple. I’ve seen that variation from time to time in my self-sown plants.

Seeds for a Nicandra with variegated leaves used to be available. I’ve grown that one too, but I don’t see it listed in any of my sources now.

Dear Helen: My three-year old Eucryphia tree is shedding leaves. They turn orange and drop off. Is this normal? — M.N.

The young tree in your photo looks healthy. It is normal for a broadleaf evergreen to shed up to a third of its leaves at a time. That’s the way the plants keep themselves renewed.

My long-established Eucryphia tree is sprinkled only sparingly with orange-brown leaves that the tree will discard, but I notice that a star jasmine (Trachelospermum jasminoides) is dotted far more thickly than usual at this time of year with orange leaves, just like your Eucryphia.

This evergreen leaf shedding is commonly most pronounced in late autumn through early spring. I’m thinking that the oddly cool temperatures through June and early July may have triggered an unseasonal discolouring and shedding of leaves. On many of those days I heard people commenting that the weather felt distinctly fall-like.

Eucryphia is a broadly columnar tree with white flowers in late summer. To grow and flower well it needs a neutral to slightly acidic soil that is kept consistently moist but drains efficiently of excess moisture.

For good flowering, the body of the tree needs to be in sun, while the roots are in shade. My own tree illustrated that need when, for years, it grew well but never flowered — until a neighbour removed a coniferous evergreen grown to giant size next to a nearby side fence. The exposure to sunlight that followed brought on a flush of lovely blooms.

Dear Helen: The tomatoes in my greenhouse already are distorted by monkey face. What can I do? I don’t want to lose the crop.

G.P.

I suspect you are referring to a deformity in the fruit known as catfacing, a physiological disorder causing puckered surfaces and bands of scarring across the far (blossom) ends of the tomatoes. It is caused by stressful growing conditions that interfere with good pollination and fruit development.

In unheated greenhouses this spring and early summer, the cause of the catfacing was probably the abnormally cool weather interspersed with a few sunny, warm days. This would have caused stressfully wide temperature fluctuations between day and night temperatures.

In the outdoor garden, flying insects and breezes usually take care of pollination, other conditions being congenial. In a greenhouse, the necessary shifting of pollen in the flowers can be accomplished by a gentle shaking of the plants late in the morning, when any dews have evaporated and the pollen is sure to be dry.

As the weather settles into a more summer-like pattern, fruit development will very likely normalize. But as temperatures rise, be aware that extremely hot temperatures in a greenhouse can cause enough sterilization of the pollen to also cause catfacing. The pollen can become sterile at around 32 C. Ensure enough ventilation to moderate the temperature.",708,0.9453284078638854,local

There are several sure indicators of the seeds being ready for harvesting. First, the plump, upright seed capsules should be fully dry. Holes should have opened up immediately below the neat little disk that tops the capsule. The final sign is a free rattling of the seeds within the capsule when it is shaken gently.

I harvest the capsules by cutting them off carefully and depositing them into a paper bag, which I then store in a dry, dark, cool place until I’m ready to extract the seeds. This is done by upending each capsule and shaking it, as you would a salt shaker, over a clean, dry container.

Dear Helen: What were the rusty markings on my garlic plants? The bulbs themselves seem all right, though they are smaller than those I harvested last year. I did not compost the tarnished tops.

B.D.

Cool, wet weather through early July made our garlic plantings (and many other plants) highly vulnerable to an array of diseases. One of them is garlic rust, a fungus that causes rusty orange specks on the foliage. Upon digging the bulbs, you made the right choice to destroy the infected leaves.

Effects of the disease on the harvested bulbs are minimal. They should store well. The infection can reduce the bulb size, but this year’s home garden bulbs have generally been smaller than the supersized bulbs many of us harvested last year.

Watch for rust on other onion family plants in the garden. Leeks and chives are examples. Get rid of any infected plants by late autumn, before they can transfer disease spores to any extra-early green garlic shoots, which sometimes appear early in the winter.

Another key disease prevention measure is to wait four years before planting garlic or any other onion family plant in a space. Dormant disease spores eventually die in the absence of a host.

Every year, in late summer, I make a rough sketch of the vegetable garden with all the major plant types positioned on it. I keep them on a clipboard for easy access to individual planting sites over recent years. Those pages are a helpful guide to keeping plantings moved carefully around from year to year.

Dear Helen: For two years now, paper wasps have built nests in my greenhouse. They are not at all aggressive and their small nests are interesting. Are they native insects, and beneficial?

W.S.

That depends on the kind of paper wasp you have. The European paper wasp is considered invasive, and damaging to fruit and berry crops. It builds small, papery, umbrella-shaped nests on eaves, porch ceilings and similar locations as well as in trees and shrubs. These insects have black and yellow stripes similar to yellow jacket wasps, but the bodies are more elongated with a narrow, pinched-in waist.

Native paper wasps are more golden in colour, with more elongated, thinner waists. They are considered beneficial as pollinators and pest predators.

You will find descriptions and colour photos of European and native paper wasps, and of yellow jackets, at beefriendly.ca/paper-wasp-nests/. The nests of all three are also pictured.

Dear Helen: Why did all the early flowers on my strong and healthy heirloom tomato plants dry up without any fruit forming?

A.M.

Tomatoes and other warmth-loving plants did not fare well in the unusually cool and wet, almost fall-like late spring and early summer weather this year. I’ve heard from many gardeners whose melon plants expired in the daunting conditions, which also made successful pollination of tomato flowers more than challenging.

Many, but not all, heirloom tomato varieties need a long season of sun and warmth to yield a successful crop. And they demand near perfect conditions for a good fruit set.

Having said that, I should note that my heirloom Japanese Black Trifele tomato plants developed fruit from the very first blossoms, low down on the plants. Those first fruits ripened a week ago. This variety is an unusually easy-growing, prolific producer of tomatoes with a rich flavour.

Your tomatoes most likely began forming fruit with the arrival of warm weather, but because of the late start some of our plants may prove disappointing this summer.",701,0.9569116618527159,local

R.M.

Fragrance will vary with the weather, the age of the blooms and the time of day. I often sniff-test the petunias on my patio. I grow the most fragrant ones I know of, and place them by the screened patio door that I open on summer mornings and evenings. They are at their most fragrant in warmth, and the fully opened flowers are more perfumed that newly opened and fading ones.

Dear Helen: How can I tell whether the raspberries in the garden of a house I bought are summer-bearing or “everbearing”?

K.P.

Several of my neighbours have recently asked me the same question. Gardeners often pass along raspberry canes to friends without informing them about the variety. “Summer bearing” raspberries have one harvest season, in July. The berries are borne on canes that developed in the previous year. Canes that have finished producing berries are cut down to allow the new canes that will bear the next year’s crop to mature well. Crowded canes are thinned out.

Everbearing raspberries give an early summer crop and another in late summer to early autumn. They will have wound up their first harvesting period now, and will have begun developing flower buds at the tips of this year’s new canes for the second crop.

That’s how you can identify the two-crop “ever-bearers.” Flower buds begin developing on the new canes in late July and early August.

Managing ever-bearers: Cut down the old, browning canes that produced the early summer berries. When the late-season crop on the new canes has been harvested, cut those canes back to just below the tops that produced berries. Next year’s early raspberries will be produced on the cane portions below where you have cut.

Many people simply cut down all the everbearing canes at winter’s end. That eliminates the early summer berries. New canes that grow in the spring will give only the one, late-season crop.

I don’t do that because I prize the early summer berries and the late-season crop often coincides with early autumn rains that turn the berries mouldy.

Dear Helen: I would like to try growing winter vegetables this year. I’m not sure what I can start from seed or transplants at this time. Are transplants widely available?

G.W.

You will find some winter vegetable transplants at most garden centres. They usually begin arriving in late July or early August. A few phone calls to your favourite local outlets should unearth sources.

You will find transplants of cold-hardy lettuces, kale, winter cabbage, and over-wintering cauliflower and sprouting broccoli. Seeds can be planted outdoors now of spinach, winter lettuces, arugula, mizuna (a spicy Asian green with feathery leaves) and corn salad.

Dear Helen: This is going to seem crazy, but as I was digging over a previously uncultivated patch of ground last month, I heard a distinct hissing sound coming from the soil. A bit of poking around unearthed a large beetle with lines on its back. More hissing emanated from the beetle. Have you ever heard of anything like this?

A.D.

Over the years, I have dug up many beetles similar to the one you describe, in varying stages of their maturity. The creature is a tenlined June beetle. The adult beetles usually emerge from the soil in June to mate and lay eggs. The cold weather delayed most of the emergence until July this year. Not long ago I dug up several that were just on the verge of taking flight — the precise stage at which they seem to make that odd bellows-like wheezing sound when disturbed.

Favoured egg-laying places are in the roots of grasses. The eggs hatch to produce plump, C-shaped larvae that live in the soil for three to four years before reaching the adult stage. They are found in the greatest numbers where lawns and grassy fields have been dug up to plant gardens. Then, they can cause some damage to plant roots and potato tubers.

I watch for the whitish, curved grubs and remove them as I dig plots. Turning over the soil a few times before planting helps to expose larvae that you miss to birds and other predators.",713,0.9596446867026871,local

For example, it can be pretty basic, made by stirring hot, just-cooked macaroni into a pot of tangy, simmering cheese sauce. You can also bake mac and cheese, topped with more cheese and other toppings, until bubbly and delicious. You’ll even find recipes where cold mac and cheese is formed into balls, coated in seasoned breadcrumbs and deep-fried, until crispy and golden on the outside and molten in the middle.

A wide range of ingredients can also be added to mac and cheese to make it even more divine. The many possibilities include specialty cheeses; fresh herbs; roasted, grilled and other types of vegetables; seafood, such as lobster, crab and shrimp; smoked chicken and turkey; and meats, such as ham, pulled pork and shreds of barbecue brisket.

In today’s rather sumptuous recipe, I cooked mac and cheese in a skillet on the barbecue and flavoured it with three types of Island-made cheese and bacon.

If I now have your mouth watering and you’ve developed a big-time craving to try different types of mac and cheese, but don’t want make your own, you’re in luck.

Our Place Society, which provides support to Greater Victoria’s most vulnerable people, has organized a special event that, from Aug. 8 to Sept. 8, will see numerous restaurants serving up their own special version of mac and cheese. So far, the restaurants include 10 Acres Bistro, Aura Waterfront Restaurant and Patio, Boom & Batten, Boondocks, Chuck’s Burger Bar, Courtney Room, Crooked Goose Bistro, Frankie’s Modern Diner, Heron Rock Bistro, Il Covo Trattoria, Irish Times Pub, Smuggler’s Cove Pub, Spinnakers and Virtuous Pie.

Steven Seltzer, Our Place Society’s special events and corporate giving manager, says the idea of the event is to show support for our local culinary industry — businesses negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic that, over the years, have helped raise much-needed funds for Our Place Society.

Beyond getting to purchase and try many splendid versions of mac and cheese, whether you eat it at the restaurants noted above or get it to go, this event is also a culinary competition that will determine who makes Greater Victoria’s best mac and cheese.

To have your say, after you have tried some of the different types being offered, go to the Our Place Society website and vote for the restaurant you thought made the best mac and cheese. (Voting is open Sept. 1 to 10.) The winner will be announced at Our Place Society’s virtual Hungry Hearts fundraiser on Saturday, Sept. 12, at 5 p.m. More information about that event, including how to tune in, will also be on the Our Place Society website.

Skillet BBQ Mac and Cheese with Island Cheese and Bacon

This Vancouver Island-style mac and cheese is rich with three types of local cheese and crispy bits of bacon. Make a summer meal by serving it with a green salad adorned with cut, raw local vegetables, such as cucumbers, tomatoes, radishes and bell peppers.

Prep time: 40 minutes

Cook time: About 45 minutes

Makes: Four to six servings

2 cups elbow macaroni

4 strips of Vancouver Island bacon, cut into small cubes (see Note 1)

3 Tbsp butter, plus some for greasing

3 Tbsp all-purpose flour

2 cups warm milk (see Note 2)

1/2 cup sour cream

1/2 tsp smoked paprika

100 grams Little Qualicum Cheeseworks Qualicum spice cheese, grated (divided; see Note 3)

100 grams Natural Pastures Cheese Company aged farmhouse cheese, grated (divided; see Note 3)

• salt and white pepper, to taste

2 green onions, thinly sliced (divided)

75 grams Salt Spring Island Cheese Company goat cheese (see Note 3)

2 Tbsp panko or other dried breadcrumbs

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil to cook the macaroni. While it’s coming to a boil, place bacon in a skillet, set over medium to medium-high heat and cook until crispy. Drain fat from these bacon bits. Transfer bacon bits to a plate lined with paper towel and set it aside for now.

When water is boiling, cook macaroni until just tender, about eight to 10 minutes, depending on the brand.

While macaroni cooks, place 3 Tbsp butter in a medium-to-large-sized pot set over medium heat. When butter is melted, mix in flour and cook, stirring, two minutes.

Very slowly, while whisking, dribble and mix in 1/2 cup of the milk. Cook until the mixture becomes quite thick, and then slowly whisk in the remaining milk and sour cream.

Bring this white sauce to a simmer, stirring frequently so it does not scorch on the bottom. Simmer one minute to thicken. Remove sauce from the heat. Mix in paprika and three-quarters of the grated spice cheese, and three-quarters of the aged Farmhouse cheese. When cheese has melted, season the sauce with salt and pepper.

Preheat your barbecue until the temperature in the chamber is 375 F to 400 F (see Eric’s options).

When macaroni is cooked, drain it well. Now add it and three quarters of the green onions to the sauce and gently mix to combine.

Lightly butter the inside of 10-inch diameter cast-iron skillet (see Eric’s options). Spoon the macaroni mixture into the skillet. Top macaroni with the remaining grated cheeses, and then sprinkle on the bacon bits. Set small nuggets of the goat cheese at various points on top of the mac and cheese. Now sprinkle top of mac and cheese with the panko.

Set skillet on side of the barbecue. Close the lid and turn the heat off underneath the skillet; leave the other side of the barbecue on. Cook the mac and cheese 25 to 30 minutes, or until very hot and bubbly. As the mac and cheese cooks, check the temperature in the chamber and adjust the flame as needed to maintain the 375 to 400 F temperature.

When ready, sprinkle the mac and cheese with the remaining green onions and serve.

Note 1: Places making bacon on Vancouver Island include grocery store chain Red Barn Market (redbarnmarket.ca); small charcuterie shop the Whole Beast (thewholebeast.ca); and meat companies Hertel Meats (hertelmeats.ca) and Berryman Brother’s Meat Ltd. (berrymanfarms.ca). Hertel and Berryman bacon is available at many grocery stores and smaller foods stores.

Note 2: I warmed the milk for this recipe to just below a simmer in a 2-cup measuring cup in my microwave. It could also be warmed up in a small pot on the stove set over low heat.

Note 3: The cheeses noted in this recipe are available in the deli section of most grocery stores and smaller food stores. You will have to buy package sizes that contain more than you need here. But wrap up and refrigerate the leftover cheese and save it for a cheeseboard or other use. If you can’t find the exact type of cheese called for in the recipe, simply use one of the company’s other types of cheese that’s similar in style.

Eric’s options: If you don’t have a 10-inch cast-iron skillet, any other barbecue-friendly pan will work here as long its about 2 1/2-inches deep and holds eight to 10 cups. If you don’t have a barbecue, you could bake the mac and cheese in 375 F oven for a similar length of time.

On one recent outing, I ended up buying a cornucopia of ingredients that would be good to use in a simple summer vegetable soup — the kind of soup my mom used to make when I was a kid, where she simply threw everything into the pot and simmered it until it was ready to enjoy.

That meant cutting and cooking in stock the local vegetables I had bought, such as corn, snap-top carrots, bell peppers, zucchini, potatoes and more, with a few flavourings until tender.

You end up with an earthy-tasting, light and colourful soup whose flavour I enhanced by topping each bowl with pistou, often described as a French-style of pesto that I made with local basil and garlic.

My recipe for the soup yields about 10 to 12 servings. If that’s too many, the leftover soup will freeze well for another time. The pistou could also be frozen (see its recipe for details).

Feel free to adjust my soup recipe by adding vegetables you like and leaving out those you don’t care for. The cut vegetables I added to the pot totally about nine cups, so keep that in mind if you make any substitutions.

Summer Vegetable Soup with Pistou

Here’s a light, throw-all-the vegetables-in-the-pot soup topped with basil- and garlic-rich pistou, often described as a French-style pesto. This soup, and the pistou recipe, will freeze well. So enjoy some now and freeze the rest for another time.

Preparation time: 30 minutes

Cooking time: 20 minutes

Makes: about 10 to 12 servings

1 cob of corn

2 to 3 medium snap-top carrots, scrubbed well, and then sliced (see Note 1)

1 medium green bell pepper, cut into 1/2-inch cubes

1 medium yellow bell pepper, cut into 1/2-inch cubes

1 lb (about 4) large nugget or white-skinned potatoes, cut into 1/2-inch cubes

3 to 4 ripe roma tomatoes, halved and cut into 1/2-inch cubes

1/2 medium zucchini, cut into 1/2-inch cubes

1 small to medium leek, white and pale green part only, cut into 1/2-inch cubes

8 cups chicken or vegetable stock or broth (see Note 2)

2 tsp herbes de Provence (see Note 3)

1 bay leaf

• splash or 2 red wine vinegar or balsamic vinegar

• salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

• pistou (see recipe below)

Shuck corn and then, with a sharp knife, cut the kernels off the cob.

Place corn kernels in a large soup pot and add the carrots, bell peppers, potatoes, tomatoes, zucchini, leek, stock (or broth), herbes de Provence, bay leaf and vinegar.

Set pot over medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Now lower the heat until the stock (or broth) is gently simmering (small bubbles should just break on the surface). Simmer the soup, uncovered, 15 to 20 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender. Taste the soup and season with salt and pepper, as needed.

Ladle soup into bowls and let diners top theirs with a spoon or two of the pistou.

Note 1: Snap-top carrots are bunches of carrots sold with their green tops attached. If they’re very fresh, you don’t need to peel them — just scrub them well before slicing. If desired, you can slice some of the green tops and add them to the soup, too.

Note 2: If using store-bought stock (or broth), two 946 mL containers of it should yield the amount needed here.

Note 3: Herbes de Provence is a French-style blend of dried herbs sold in the bottled herb and spice aisle of most supermarkets.

Pistou

This French-style, fresh basil-rich sauce is great to spoon on or swirl into soup. It can also be tossed into pasta or served as an accompaniment for such things as grilled meats, sausages and chicken, fish and grilled vegetables.

Preparation time: 10 minutes

Cooking time: None

Makes: about 1 1/4 cups

36 large basil leaves, stems removed (see Note)

3/4 cup freshly and finely grated, loosely packed Parmesan cheese (about 40 grams, don’t use the dried powdered type)

6 medium to large garlic cloves

3 Tbsp tomato paste

1/2 tsp sea salt, or to taste

2/3 to 3/4 cup extra virgin olive oil

Place basil, cheese, garlic, tomato paste and salt in a food processor and pulse until finely chopped. With the food processor running, slowly pour the oil down its feed tube, stopping when you’re happy with the consistency of the pistou.

Refrigerate the pistou in a tightly sealed jar until needed. It will keep at least a week. The pistou could also be frozen in ice-cube trays, unmoulded and kept frozen in freezer bags or containers until needed.

Note: The large basil leaves I used when testing the recipe were about three to four inches long.

It's an opportune time for an update to this lavishly illustrated history of gardening and landscaping. ""The Story of Gardening"" might sit (heavily) on a coffee table, but it transports the reader out into the yard or the park with some new perspectives and ambitions.

article continues below

We all appreciate green space more than ever these days. As always, gardens offer the promise of beauty, serenity, artistry and practicality. They're also a relatively safe place to spend time, and gardening as a pursuit has taken off in the age of coronavirus.

""We can picture the garden-owner gradually beginning to derive pride, status and pleasure from the plot that it was within his power to make fertile and beautiful,"" write the authors, Penelope Hobhouse and Ambra Edwards, imagining humankind’s very first gardens. They could just as well be describing many people this summer.

The authors show gardening to be an age-old struggle to appreciate and amplify nature’s beauty while also imposing order on it. It’s about finding a balance, too, between what looks good and what is practical.

""The Story of Gardening"" begins in the Fertile Crescent and travels around the world and up to the present. For those of us wondering what to do with our yards and gardens next year, there might be inspiration in seeing how different cultures have approached layout and plantings, from Islamic walled gardens to the ""power-gardening"" formalism of French royalty to the more naturalistic English cottage gardens to pared-down Japanese gardens and more.

The American idea of the endless front lawn, one rolling into another, was an attempt to democratize the landscape, doing away with the walls and formal plantings of colonial estates, the authors say.

A new final chapter includes recent projects, including New York City’s High Line and Piet Oudolf’s sweeping meadows of grasses and perennials, and focuses on sustainability, ecology and other gardening concerns today.

As the garden evolves into its late summer season and beyond, it yields gifts of sun-ripened tomatoes and cucumbers, squashes, leeks and kale, brilliant hydrangeas, fragrant lilies, and full-headed sunflowers.

As I walk through the August garden, Robert Browning’s poem Rabbi Ben Ezra comes to mind:

“Grow old along with me!

The best is yet to be,

The last of life, for which the first was made”

All the planning and preparation, seeding and transplanting done early in a gardening season is rewarded later with many pleasures as the garden “evolves.” It’s a time for me to revisit longtime favourite dishes that bring back old memories as they deliver fine summer flavours.

There’s a broad bean salad in a lemon juice, olive oil, garlic and salt dressing, with cooked broad beans joined by sweet red pepper, onion, chopped raw zucchini and feta cheese.

With the first sun-warmed, ripe tomatoes I anticipate a garlic and basil flavoured, uncooked tomato sauce over hot spaghetti, dusted with freshly grated parmesan cheese.

Every summer, zucchini are transformed into a tart with onion, eggs and cream in a recipe I learned to make in Italy. And during a year I spent in a tiny Greek village I observed what was called a “Middle Eastern” salad being made with cucumber chopped into a yoghurt mixture.

First, yoghurt was placed in a bowl and drizzled with a little olive oil. Fresh lemon juice was added next, along with salt and a generous amount of mashed garlic. Finally, the cucumber. What a wonderfully tangy way to enjoy the summer’s cucumbers. My daughter often mentions how she loved it as a child.

This poppy is called Black Swan Lace.

Perpetual poppies. It was a warm weekend morning late last month when two neighbours rang the doorbell and asked to walk through the garden. Karen, on a week’s leave from coast guard duty, had not yet been through the garden this summer.

They sampled raspberries and gathered a few broad beans, which they had never eaten, to try, but Karen was clearly most drawn to the big poppy seed heads. She is fond of the seeds as toppings for bagels and as ingredients in muffins and breads. Most of the peony-flowered poppies (Papaver somniferum) had dropped their petals and were in the process of ripening the black seeds that are used in baking.

These poppies, both single and double flowered, commonly appear in gardens, and self-sow to return each year. A double-flowered pink bloom is common, as is a pale mauve form with deep rosy purple blotches. Every year seems to bring its own assortment of colours. This year, several peach-coloured poppies flowered in the garden.

Every few years I add to the gene pool by choosing and seeding a new variety. This year, I grew Black Swan Lace, an unusual fine-petalled flower in deep burgundy-black. The seed was from Brother Nature Seeds in Victoria.

Tanya’s berry parfait. When I invited a neighbour to have dinner with me late in July, she volunteered to bring dessert. What she created was a visual and flavour-filled seasonal delight.

Tanya brought individual, layered desserts, in glasses. Over a thin layer of graham cracker crumbs was a blend of yoghurt thickened with a little cream cheese, sweetened with maple syrup and flavoured with lemon juice and zest.

The next layer was blueberry sauce, also sweetened with maple syrup and flavoured with lemon. Tanya thickened the sauce with cornstarch (dissolved in a little water).

The sauce was covered with more of the yogurt mixture topped with a dusting of graham cracker crumbs and garnished with fresh berries. The individual desserts had been chilled in the fridge for about two hours.

Tanya and I share a preference for minimally sweet desserts. This dessert is light, fresh and versatile. It can be made using any garden fruit or berry, fresh or in sauce form.",707,0.9595481655009728,local

On Friday night, residents in Saanich’s Panama Flats neighbourhood saw a large gathering of young people hanging out in the street.

Sarah Wakefield, who lives on Carey Road where the crowd congregated, estimated there were at least 100 people.

At first, she could hear the group in the distance, and then they migrated to her street.

“It was a constant stream of kids for an hour,” she said.

Wakefield said she saw one person wearing a mask, but for the most part, people were ignoring public health measures such as physical distancing.

She said she’d never seen or heard of a gathering so large in 20 years living in the area. That it happened during a pandemic worried Wakefield.

“It’s COVID times, so we need to behave in that way,” she said.

Saanich police said the frequency of complaints about large gatherings seems comparable to other years and it’s concerning that some people do not appear to be following public health guidelines designed to slow the spread of COVID-19.

Police said they were initially called about a group of 20 to 30 people near Northridge Elementary School shortly before 11 p.m. Less than 10 minutes later, they received more calls saying the group had grown to more than 100 people, and some were becoming verbally agressive and trying to damage private property.

Officers spoke to some of the people gathered on Carey Road and learned someone had weapons, including a baton and maybe a knife.

Officers were trying to locate the person with weapons, who was believed to be at the school, when they were approached by residents with more information to share.

Police said the group eventually dispersed and officers stayed in the area to speak to residents. They are still investigating and are asking residents with information to provide statements.

Victoria police said they’ve received numerous complaints about large groups who are not practising physical distancing. VicPD spokesman Bowen Osoko said the events have ranged from parties in apartments to a beach rave on Dallas Road a few weeks ago, “complete with DJs, a mirror ball and people openly drinking while they danced together.”

In Oak Bay, problem parties seem to have dissipated since the early days of the pandemic, said Police Chief Ray Bernoties.

“I’m pleased that we don’t seem to be getting those right now. Months ago, there were some concerns expressed about the number of people on the beach but we’re not hearing those concerns much anymore.”

Bernoties said he hopes the change is because people are complying with the guidelines. He noted the District of Oak Bay created a program in May of small outreach teams that provide information on physical distancing guidelines to people on Willows Beach and at Cattle Point.

On Monday, Health Minister Adrian Dix said while outdoor gatherings are more visible, indoor parties pose a greater risk.

Deputy provincial health officer Dr. Reka Gustafson said the number of cases linked to transmission in purely outdoor settings has been “very, very limited.”

“The vast amount of transmission is occurring in close, prolonged contact, especially in indoor settings, so that means among people who are spending a lot of time together and in close proximity,” she said.

Dix and Gustafson emphasized the need to educate and influence people to make safe decisions, rather than punish or shame anyone not following guidelines.

Dix said he spent much of the weekend encouraging young people to engage with their peers about COVID-19.

“I’ve been so inspired by their willingness to do so, by their understanding and their ability to translate some of the things we’re trying to say in a way that works for them, and we need that,” he said, adding the pandemic and “this new normal” is expected to last into 2022. “The way we deal with that as a society inevitably has to be by choice, and by engagement and by talking to each other.”

On occasion, surveillance and enforcement is needed, Dix said, and government ministries met Monday to map out a comprehensive approach to increased enforcement measures and stricter penalties that will come into effect this week.

Solicitor General Mike Farnworth is expected to make an announcement in the coming days.

Because a new drug gives its user a random superpower but only for five minutes, the people who take it tend to check their wristwatches. Watching the dull sci-fi, quasi-superhero film Project Power, I found myself doing the same. One supposes the movie can be seen as a cautionary tale about Big Pharma. We should worry more about Big Film.

Project Power, from Netflix, gives itself away well within five minutes. The bad guy (he’s the one with the villainous goatee) is handing out the new drug to the punk pushers for free. One of the pushers (Newt, played by the rapper Machine Gun Kelly) says the deal sounds too good to be true. “That’s because it is,” says The Goatee.

The drug is bad, you see? Power is bad. It’s very simple. And so is Project Power. It’s too good to be true. It’s not worth the risk. Take two hydroxychloroquine and call me in the morning.

Jamie Foxx stars as a former soldier done wrong by his government. He’s stoic, on a mission to find the source of the drug called power. It would be great if he occasionally lightened up and said a funny thing or two for, you know, entertainment’s sake. He doesn’t, though. He’s all business. Why hire the talented Foxx for a leading role, only to instruct him to turn off the charisma?

Then we have the good cop fighting the system, played by Bruce Willis. Hold on, it’s not Willis after all – it’s Joseph Gordon-Levitt, playing a ragged, Willis-y unshaven police detective. I didn’t recognize Gordon-Levitt with a gun in his hand. He’s not built for this kind of maverick cop role. Maybe the scriptwriter knows it, because there’s a running joke about the character being a Clint Eastwood/Dirty Harry wannabe.

The third co-star is Dominique Fishback, who is perfectly suited to play a precocious teenager who, though smart, struggles with her grade point average. Though a rapping savant, she suffers from stage fright. That’s her untapped superpower, if you will: hip hop. She deals drugs, but only because her mother has diabetes, needs an operation and is without health insurance.

“I gotta work the system,” the girl says. But, as she’s told, “You’re young, black and a woman. The system was designed to swallow you whole.”

This is unfair. This is power inequity. This is America.

New Orleans, specifically, perhaps chosen because of its recent history of being abandoned by its country in the wake of Hurricane Katrina of 2005. In Project Power, the city’s inhabitants are basically guinea pigs used to test the new super drug, which, we learn, is so strong as to enable one man to take out a whole police battalion by himself. Fighting the system, then.

Most of the film’s action happens at night, so we really don’t get a good look at the colourful city. Why hire New Orleans as a location if you’re not going to show it off?

That’s probably a question for Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman, the horror-thriller director duo who previously shouted “action” on Catfish, Viral and Nerve, not to mention Paranormal Activity 3 and Paranormal Activity 4. For Project Power, they cast a moody, gritty and ominous mood. It’s their thing.

There’s plenty of shooting and explosions and weird super-powering. Being a human fireball seems cool, but impractical. (I like the rubbery guy, but even when the henchmen are popping superpower pills they’re not very good at henching.) But the action is mostly run of the mill. It’s a comic book that fails to come to life.

The villain touts the drug as part of the evolution of the human species – something to level the playing field, or, if you like, to destroy it entirely. There’s some meaning to the film, about power systems. But it comes wrapped in a gloomy package that makes the whole thing, well, a tough pill to swallow.

Project Power is available to stream on Netflix starting Aug. 14.

The officer and other Mounties then use force to arrest him while he's on the ground.

Lahaie says the man was then injured in an alleged assault by another detained man in a cell at the Kinngait RCMP detachment and had to be flown to Iqaluit for medical treatment.

She says the investigation is to determine whether the conduct of the Mounties, including use of force, was reasonable.

She says in a news release that the probe will be a Public Interest Investigation into the conduct of RCMP in Kinngait.

""The RCMP members' conduct will be assessed in accordance with relevant law and RCMP policy,"" reads the terms of reference of the investigation released Tuesday.

""Consideration will also be given as to whether racial bias and/or discrimination played a role in the man's arrest and subsequent treatment.""

Lahaie noted the review she has requested by the commission is separate from an investigation by the Ottawa Police Service at the request of the Mounties and an RCMP internal Code of Conduct review.

""I am concerned with the conduct of RCMP members involved in this serious incident and will monitor both the OPS (Ottawa police) investigation and the RCMP's Code of Conduct investigation,"" Lahaie said in a release.

""The CRCC's investigation will provide an added level of scrutiny to the incident, as it will additionally examine the circumstances that led to the man being placed in a cell at the RCMP detachment where another detainee assaulted him and he needed to be airlifted to Iqaluit for treatment.

""I am aware that there is historical distrust by Inuit toward the police and I am committed to increasing RCMP accountability.""

The day after the man's arrest Nunavut Justice Minister Jeannie Ehaloak said she was outraged.

""I have seen the video from Kinngait circulating on social media and am very concerned by the unnecessary force, the violence and the lack of respect I have seen,'' she said in a release at the time.

""Nunavummiut should not fear this kind of treatment and disregard for safety and basic rights.''

Ehaloak said she would formally request a review by the commission.

Nearly two decades after the slaying of Run-DMC star Jam Master Jay, federal prosecutors said Monday they have solved one of New York City’s most enduring mysteries, charging two men from his neighbourhood with murder and suggesting that the hip-hop artist – celebrated for his anti-drug stance – was ambushed over a cocaine deal.

The suspects were identified in court papers as Ronald Washington, 56, who is currently serving a federal prison sentence stemming from a string of robberies while on the run from police after Jay’s 2002 death, and Karl Jordan Jr., 36, who is also charged with engaging in a cocaine distribution conspiracy in 2017.

Jason “Jay” Mizell, known professionally as Jam Master Jay, formed Run-DMC with Joseph “Run” Simmons and Darryl “DMC” McDaniel in the early 1980s. Together, they helped take hip-hop mainstream with hits like “It’s Tricky” and the Aerosmith remake collaboration “Walk This Way.”

Jay’s death, following the long unsolved slayings of rappers Tupac Shakur in Las Vegas in 1996 and Christopher “Biggie Smalls” Wallace in Los Angeles in 1997, shook the hip-hop world. Chuck D of Public Enemy compared his death to that of John Lennon. More than $60,000 in rewards was offered, but witnesses refused to come forward and the case languished.

Rapper Jam Master Jay, one of the founding members of Run-DMC, was murdered in 2002 'in cold blood' as part of a dispute over a drug deal, prosecutors say. Reuters

“This is a case about a murder that for nearly two decades had gone unanswered,” Acting U.S. Attorney Seth DuCharme said at a news conference announcing the charges. “Today, we begin to answer that question of who killed Jason Mizell, and why, and we’re confident that we can prove those charges beyond a reasonable doubt.”

Washington, who had reportedly been living on a couch at Jay’s home in the days before the killing, was publicly named as a possible suspect or witness as far back as 2007. Prosecutors allege he waved a handgun and ordered another person at the recording studio to lie on the ground while Jordan shot Jay in the head Oct. 30, 2002.

According to prosecutors, Jay would bring in bulk amounts of cocaine to sell retail and was killed as retribution for cutting Washington out of a plan to distribute 10 kilograms in Maryland.

“They walked in and murdered him in cold blood,” DuCharme said.

A message seeking comment was left with a publicist for Run-DMC. The group performed anti-drug concerts, established scholarships and held voter registration drives at its live shows. In Hollis, the Queens neighbourhood where he grew up, Jay was seen as a role model. Friends were puzzled by his death, thinking him an unlikely target for violence.

If convicted, Washington and Jordan each face a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years in prison and a maximum of life in prison, or the death penalty. Prosecutors said in court papers that Attorney General William Barr had not yet decided whether to seek the death penalty.

Story continues below advertisement

Jordan pleaded not guilty at an arraigned held Monday by teleconference because of coronavirus-related precautions. His lawyer declined to comment. Washington, who is imprisoned in Kentucky, will be arraigned later this week, prosecutors said.

Prosecutors have asked that both be jailed pending trial.

The 37-year-old Jay was shot once in the head with a .40-calibre bullet by a masked assailant at his studio in Hollis. Police identified at least four people in the studio with Jay when he was killed, including the two armed gunmen.

At Jay’s funeral, McDaniels remembered his friend and fellow Run-DMC star as “the embodiment of hip-hop.” He was also a husband and a father of three children.

“Jam Master Jay was not a thug,” McDaniels said. “Jam Master Jay was not a gangster. Jam Master Jay was a unique individual.”

Prosecutors, though, now say Jay had been bringing cocaine into the New York area since 1996.

Story continues below advertisement

At the time, Jay’s acquaintance with Washington – a repeat offender with convictions dating in 1982 – worried and upset his family.

Before ending up on Jay’s couch, Washington served prison time for grand larceny, assault, criminal use of a firearm, heroin possession and other charges. He was been linked to the 1995 fatal shooting of Randy Walker, a close associate of the late Tupac Shakur.

Afterward, prosecutors said, Washington hopped from motel-to-motel and robbed businesses including supermarkets and a Burger King while detectives pursued him in connection with Jay’s killing. He remained at large for nearly three months until police on Long Island nabbed him for robbing a motel.

Last month, as prosecutors were preparing to seek a grand jury indictment against him for Jay’s death, Washington filed a handwritten petition asking to immediately be released to home confinement, arguing his medical history put him at risk for complications from coronavirus. Federal prosecutors responded by asking for more time to respond, delaying any decision until after Washington was charged.

Jordan, just a teenager when Jay was killed, was declared a juvenile delinquent after a 1999 robbery arrest and had a firearm case dismissed when the complaining witness refused to co-operate with law enforcement. In recent years, prosecutors said, he’s been caught on audio and video surveillance six times selling cocaine to an undercover federal agent.

Budget talks are already underway in some municipalities, and city councillors will be crunching the numbers. While the local politics of policing will be interesting to follow, who knows what might shake out at the provincial and federal levels.

You don’t have to venture far in most cities to see police lights flashing and hear sirens wailing. It has become disturbingly common especially in the heart of most downtown cores.

This week, we cast some of that light on Peel’s Sixth Policing Principle, which states “police use physical force to the extent necessary to secure observance of the law or to restore order only when the exercise of persuasion, advice and warning is found to be insufficient.”

Some would argue that the use of force by many police departments and their officers seems to be on the rise. It’s a complex problem that certainly merits close attention, and a lot more research.

Let’s face it, modern policing has provided more tools to secure observance of the law and restore order than ever before. As civilians, we would prefer an officer’s persuasion, advice or warning over staring down the barrel of gun, being stunned by a Taser, struck with a baton or pepper sprayed — anytime.

Last week, the Ontario Human Rights Commission released a disturbing report on their inquiry into racial profiling and racial discrimination of Black persons by the Toronto Police. It’s their second interim report. The data analysis ranges from 2013 to 2017.

The findings indicate that black people represent almost 32 per cent of people charged while they only make up 8.8 per cent of the population in Toronto. There has been an immediate call for action by the commission, and many others.

The Special Investigations Unit, which is responsible for investigating incidents of death, serious injury, sexual allegations and assaults, involved Black people in 25 per cent of all investigations.

Further findings indicated that 39 per cent of cases are not investigated by this unit because they involve a lower-level of force, which begs the question: Who is investigating those cases?

There are so many questions now being raised regarding matters where the police have used force, and the public is demanding answers. It’s complicated further when police investigate these matters themselves with little or no civilian oversight.

Further frustration stems from how long many of these investigations take. The RCMP watchdog is recommending statutory deadlines in order to speed up this process and have their officers respond in a timelier manner.

The Civilian Review and Complaints Commission for the RCMP says that their case findings are often sent to the police service for further input before a final report is completed, and this can sometimes take years.

It’s little wonder then that the public or a victim loses faith in the police. Remember, justice delayed is justice denied.

The current state of policing should encourage us to seek out the best ways possible to reduce the need for officers to use force, although it will always be necessary in some cases. Training is always the first and best line of defence so perhaps more verbal judo, de-escalation tactics or simply having a subtler approach could save more lives.

Every police incident is unique, and can often be unpredictable so officer safety is paramount. However, we must protect everyone in these circumstances, especially those who have been marginalized and are most vulnerable.

In Margaret Wheatley’s book titled Turning to One Another: Simple Conversations to Restore Hope to the Future, the author shares a poem we can all learn from.

In it, she writes: “Remember, you don’t fear people whose story you know. Real listening always brings people closer together.”

Perhaps we should all start listening more, including police officers. We must all strive to resolve our problems peacefully. We might fear people a lot less if we just took the time that was necessary to learn their stories before resorting to force of any kind.

A year ago children felt safe playing on the street. That isn’t the case anymore, residents say. Some youngsters don’t sleep in their own rooms but in their parents room where it is deemed to be safer.

On Sunday, residents with signs demonstrated at the alley behind Milton Street and more were on the street to raise attention to their continuing concerns, which have continued since mid-March, Natalie Cunliffe, a Milton Street resident, said Monday.

Nanaimo RCMP searched the house in June, arresting two people who were charged with possession for the purposes of trafficking. Police found crystal methamphetamine, a small amount of what they suspected was fentanyl, drug paraphernalia and $2,500 in cash.

Last month, Nanaimo council voted unanimously to designate 560 Milton St. a nuisance property. A $250 fine is imposed whenever government officials such as bylaw and police officers are called to the site. The house is in Nob Hill area, on the south side of Nanamo.

After the long-term owner and resident of the Milton Street house died, the ownership and probate were left in control of his brother who lives in Gibsons, Dave LeBerge, Nanaimo’s bylaw services manager, told council. The deceased owner’s roommate was permitted to remain.

But the house was taken over by the street drug culture, turning into a “tremendously busy drug house,” LeBerge said. The city and RCMP received close to 30 complaints from about 15 residences and businesses, he said.

Cunliffe said, “Every day, every hour it impacts us and it has escalated.”

Residents are not sleeping and feel unsafe, she said.

An overgrown vacant property close by is used by people who frequent the house, she said.

People use drugs there, sleep in dugouts and defecate there. “You can imagine the stench,” Cunliffe said.

Two four-hour-long work parties have cut down trees and cleared undergrowth. They use rented power tools and filled in dugouts to remove cover and make the site more open, she said.

A total of 700 pounds of rubbish was removed from the vacant property, she said.

Workers wore heavy boots and thick gloves for protection, Cunliffe said. “We found so many needles. It was amazing.” They were taken to a needle exchange site.

Paul Saroya, who is building a hotel in Nanaimo, owns the vacant lot and said he is a victim of the problems at that property as well.

A development permit application has been submitted to the city for a mixed use rental-commercial project on the site and an adjacent lot. If approved, work could start on the property within two months, he said.

Andrew Homzy, of nearby Hecate Street, is calling on elected officials from all levels of government to take action, saying the people at the drug house are able to run their business with impunity.

“It’s a ridiculous situation.”

The problem with the 110-year-old house may resolve itself because the property is for sale at $295,999. The three-bedroom house is on a 5,049 square foot lot.

Real estate agent Fraser Carmichael said there has been interest in the property. The property permits a carriage home in the back.

Regrettably Screech is only one of many who’ve been victimized by such scams.

Some of us have received phone calls or emails claiming to come from law enforcement agencies. We are told a warrant has been issued for our arrest, and the police will arrive unless an immediate fine is paid.

Others are warned they owe the CRA money, and various threats are made to extort payment. Credit card accounts have also been hacked.

The volume of these scams, which began in earnest several years ago, has grown as the COVID epidemic surges. The victims are often elderly people, perhaps already anxious about their health and vulnerable to intimidating calls.

What is particularly frustrating is how rarely anyone gets caught, despite the extent of this racket. Between 2014 and 2019, CRA hacks alone netted $17 million, country-wide, yet law enforcement agencies report only a handful of arrests.

While our local police departments are sympathetic, their attention appears focussed mainly on damage control. Contact them to report a scam, and the best you can hope for is advice about how to avoid becoming a victim, or how to limit damage already done.

But even getting their attention can be a challenge. The Victoria police department didn’t respond when we asked what they’re doing to catch scammers.

The Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre, which is supposed to be quarterbacking such efforts, didn’t reply either. We got a recorded message saying the centre is indefinitely closed.

This is, to put it mildly, discouraging. We understand the limitations caused by the current COVID outbreak. But surely at least skeleton crews could be at work on this challenge.

In fact there has been some limited progress. RCMP detachments in Ontario are running an investigation called Project OCTAVIA. It aims primarily at CRA scams, but also bank account fraud.

Last month it was revealed that these scams are being operated mainly out of India. Unfortunately, police raids in that country have failed to accomplish much of anything.

As a result the OCTAVIA project is targeted mainly at so-called “money mules” here in Canada. These low-level recruits place the phone calls and emails intended to defraud unwitting victims, bundle the cash, and pass it along to their bosses in India.

Recently one of these mules, Jatin Chahal from Brampton, Ontario, was caught.

Chahal, age 21, is charged with fraud over $5,000, possession of the proceeds of crime, and laundering the proceeds of crime.

Unfortunately he was immediately released on an undertaking to appear at a Brampton court in September.

We say “unfortunately”, because when RCMP officials accused a second man of being a mule, he promptly fled the country. Henry Xue of Vancouver was allegedly part of a ring which conducted credit card frauds.

His bank account records showed more than $1 million being moved in an out over a short period of time. Xue’s family insist he is innocent.

It might be thought those scam phone calls and emails would leave an electronic footprint that, at least in theory, should be traceable.

It’s understood that mules use “ghost” addresses to conceal their true identity. Yet with sophisticated software, can’t our law enforcement agencies make more of a dent in this problem?

The answer is that they’re reluctant to say what they are doing. If their reason is to protect ongoing investigations, that is quite proper. Necessarily, much of the effort to combat these scams flies under the radar.

Yet the limited success rate is well below the level required to confront what has become a major industry.

Nor is it sufficient to issue merely defensive advice. If the scam is sophisticated enough, anyone can be tricked.

Consider this example. A 23-year-old Cornwall, Ont., woman was robbed of her life savings after being called by someone identifying himself as an RCMP officer.

He gave the woman his badge number, and his caller ID showed up as belonging to the local RCMP detachment. She was fooled, and handed over her hard-earned savings.

When this is the kind of chicanery we are up against, a full-scale police campaign is required to root out these scammers and send them to jail.

An upstart Islamic State group affiliate claimed responsibility for a mortar attack in Kabul on Tuesday morning that wounded at least 10 civilians as Afghans marked their country’s Independence Day. The attack came amid new uncertainties over the start of talks between the Taliban and the Kabul government.

According to the SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks militant groups’ online activity, said IS in a “communiqué” claimed credit for the firing of 16 mortar shells, which targeted the presidential palace, embassies and Afghan government offices.

The Interior Ministry’s spokesman, Tariq Arian, said a total of 14 mortar shells were fired from two vehicles in the northern and eastern part of the Afghan capital. Four children were among the wounded.

“Most of the mortar shells hit residential houses,” Arian said, adding that an investigation is under way.

More than a dozen rockets struck Kabul on Tuesday, wounding at least ten people, including children, prompting some foreign embassies to order a lockdown, officials and sources in the Afghan capital said. Reuters

According to eyewitnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity fearing reprisals, at least one mortar shell landed in the upscale Wazir Akbar Khan neighbourhood, where diplomats and senior government officials reside.

Also on Tuesday, Afghanistan’s intelligence agency said it killed the IS chief justice Abdullah Orakzai in a “complex and targeted operation,” without elaborating.

The statement said Orakzai had orchestrated a prison break earlier this month in eastern Nangarhar province that killed at least 39 people. Nearly 400 IS militants escaped in the first hours of the attack.

The mortar attack in Kabul came a day after the government said it would not release the last 320 Taliban prisoners it holds until the insurgents free more captured Afghan soldiers. The decision went against that of a traditional Afghan council held earlier this month – the Loya Jirga – and is likely to further delay intra-Afghan peace talks sought by the United States.

Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said he wasn’t aware of the mortar attack in Kabul. The Islamic State group’s affiliate, which operates in Afghanistan, has interrupted national celebrations in the past with rocket fire.

Also on Tuesday morning, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani attended an Independence Day ceremony at the Defence Ministry in Kabul, inspecting an honour guard and laying flowers on the Independence Minaret monument there.

This broader insensitivity to systemic racism is part and parcel of the issues in our police.","Richard Fadden is a former national security adviser to the prime minister, director of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, deputy minister of national defence and deputy clerk of the Privy Council.

It is now beyond reasonable debate that the issue of systemic racism in our law-enforcement institutions must be seriously addressed. This is not to suggest that every police service is equally flawed, or that every officer acts unacceptably, consciously or not; indeed, we must avoid ascribing all of society’s ills to the police who serve us, lest we throw the baby out with the bathwater, and ignore how other social institutions also contribute to systemic discrimination. But clearly, the current model of policing needs to change.

Political leaders, legislators, police board members, city councils and police chiefs in Canada and the United States have acknowledged as much, and with various degrees of specificity, have said that something must be done. What that might look like remains difficult to discern. Some have suggested the abolition of some police forces altogether; that is a non-starter, and will only divert attention away from more effective ways of dealing with the issue. Defunding is a more complicated proposal; most police forces are already underfinanced, but a careful look at how public funding is being used would be a worthwhile undertaking. Some police practices likely need to be more strictly limited or forbidden, including chokeholds and carding, while new ones should be mandated. And police-training curricula should be reformed so that they’re about more than just firearm requalification and criminal-law updates; it must be disseminated repeatedly over the course of all levels of a police career, and must send the message that the coercive power of the state should always be the last resort.

Story continues below advertisement

But whatever the solution is, it will be important to understand that change will be profoundly difficult – indeed, far harder than any simple message being delivered – because of the closed-personnel nature of these police services.

Closed-personnel organizations are ones in which young men and women join as recruits, plan to stay for their entire careers and work toward promotion within that force (some entry at mid-level is possible, but is relatively rare). Such systems aren’t the exclusive domain of police forces; they can also be found in intelligence agencies, foreign services, the military and in many religions.

All organizations develop a culture that determines not so much what they do but rather how they carry out their work, and police services are no exception, with the culture pervading widely across this closed loop. But while police culture varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and is a function of many factors, a crucial commonality is that officers spend the majority of their time dealing with a small part of the population that the rest of us would often rather not hear about. This gives rise to a we-versus-them mentality – one that’s amplified by the closed-personnel systems and their practical requirement that members strongly support one another, often against any outsiders. The pressures of this culture of conformity and mutual support also make it difficult to operate within the structure. Policing’s hierarchical, command-and-control approach to managing and standardizing behaviour – as is required by the considerable power held by individual police officers – should make it easier to discipline “bad apples.” Instead, police culture tends to counterbalance the ability of chiefs to act.

Over the course of my career, I’ve worked with police officers from many forces. Virtually all of them impressed me with their dedication, work ethic and belief that their role was central to peace, order and good government. But I remember that most only ever wanted to discuss their good qualities; areas where improvement might be possible were rarely ever raised. With some notable exceptions, usually at the chief level, they were professionally very conservative and resistant to any suggestions from outsiders such as myself, my colleagues, or cabinet ministers.

Without a shadow of a doubt, statements to press for change by political leaders, legislators and police chiefs are necessary, but they’re far from sufficient. Consider the challenges in dealing with sexual abuse among the Roman Catholic clergy despite the views of the Pope, or the Canadian Armed Forces’ sexual-harassment crisis despite the efforts of the Chief of the Defence Staff. Indeed, it is telling that front-line officers and their unions or associations are often missing from the list of those agitating for change.

To get officers on board, organizations that work with the police should, at minimum, transparently acknowledge their own complicity in policing’s problems. To suggest that police boards, city councils, responsible ministers, Crown counsel and criminal law courts knew nothing of these appalling practices is to suggest either gross negligence or incompetence, when neither view is warranted. This broader insensitivity to systemic racism is part and parcel of the issues in our police.

Systemic discrimination or racism anywhere is an assault on what most Canadians believe and what the Charter demands. Because of how police services are organized, however, transformation is going to be arduous and slow. Police chiefs working inside their organizations cannot do this alone: a considerable amount of political capital, structural untangling and society-wide patience is going to have to be expended if the long mission ahead has any hope of succeeding.

Re Scheer Offers Advice For His Replacement (Aug. 13): I would like to thank Andrew Scheer for his service to the Conservative Party and to Canada.

Hopefully he will remain in politics, as I find he has performed nobly as House Speaker and Conservative Leader. It cannot have been an easy time for him, filling in while a new leader is to be declared, but he soldiered on.

His conduct made me think of a line from Robert Burns’s A Man’s A Man For A’ That: “The honest man … is king o’ men for a’ that.” In short, Mr. Scheer suffered his lumps and took it on the chin. His actions, as I see them, serve a sharp contrast to Justin Trudeau.

Re Three Years Ago, Gun-Law Loopholes Paved The Way For A Rampage in B.C. Why Has Nothing Changed? (Aug. 8): The crux of this story seems painfully obvious: a mentally ill individual was able to purchase a firearm and hundreds of rounds of ammunition in Canada, then goes berserk. To attribute the ensuing rampage to a legal technicality – one that enables 10-round pistol magazines to be used in five-round rifles – feels disingenuous. In fact, pistol-calibre firearms have significantly less power, lower accuracy and shorter range than conventional rifles.

This person could have affected more mayhem with a perfectly legal 25-round magazine in a .22 rimfire rifle. And the potential for lethal carnage would have increased had he used a five-round capacity, full-bore military surplus or commercial hunting rifle. As well, the shooter could have caused multiple vehicle wrecks and injuries had he chosen to wield a shotgun with buckshot or slugs.

All in all, I find his choice of a legislative “loophole” rifle to wreak havoc was far from the most advantageous strategy.

Bert van Ingen Nepean, Ont.

The perpetrator of this rampage purchased a firearm from a store without a valid Possession and Acquisition Licence and was likely not qualified to renew it. The RCMP investigation “deemed that all store policies were followed and no charges were laid.” This is outrageous to me.

Story continues below advertisement

The PAL was designed precisely to prevent the sale of firearms to persons that are not considered by the RCMP to be capable of safely handling, storing and using them, which this individual was clearly not. The RCMP are supposed to ensure such regulations are followed.

I believe this episode had nothing to do with the type of gun and everything to do with the failure of the store clerk, who should have been properly trained by management. It’s clear to me that store policies were not followed, as they would not have been able to sell firearms without having these policies front and centre.

The PAL is an excellent tool, when properly used, and I doubt any law-abiding gun owner would disagree with its main purpose.

Re How Broken Systems Allowed Matthew McKnight To Get Away With Sexual Assault For Years (Opinion, Aug. 8): The account of the offences of Matthew McKnight against his victims is indeed horrific. However, contributor Karlee Kobasiuk refers to white male privilege no fewer than four times. Are we to assume that only privileged white men are getting away with sexual assault due to our “broken systems?”

Sexual violence is and always has been a crime that knows no boundaries in terms of race, ethnicity or economic background. I believe it does no one any service to point a finger at white men as being the only ones who benefit from our failure to protect women.

Re The Coming Baby Bust (Opinion, Aug. 8): While I agree with columnist John Ibbitson and contributor Darrell Bricker on the significance of accepting newcomers into Canada, I can’t help but think of the countries they are leaving behind.

Whether a person is coming to Canada for economic reasons, to flee persecution or to reunite with family, we should also understand what their country of origin is losing, not just what Canada is gaining. In a global society, wouldn’t it be better if all countries had a chance to prosper? I’m not sure how that happens if the best and brightest minds of so many countries move here.

It seems immigration solves some of our problems, but adds long-lasting ones elsewhere in the world.

Nathan Stoffman Toronto

I am a strong proponent of immigration, but what John Ibbitson and Darrell Bricker argue for seems to be a beggar-thy-neighbour population policy.

If there really won’t be enough young people to go around when the global population starts to decline, then the only true solution would be to adapt our systems so they don’t depend on youth. From that point of view, immigration can only ever be a temporary stopgap.

The real argument for immigration is that free movement should be a right. No state should be permitted to tie people to its soil – even when the soil in question is as expansive as Canada’s. But, to deal with declining global fertility, we need to change our societies so they don’t depend on exponential population growth.

Word on the street

Re The Artful Flogger (Arts & Pursuits, Aug. 8): After spending 50 years in enemy territory in the book publishing business, I have rarely read such a compelling portrait of a would-be novelist as reporter Ian Brown’s of Crad Kilodney, the late outlaw of Canadian letters.

The pain and depth of his exile from any recognized publication is remarkable. Behind his desperate search for establishment endorsement, I see a lonely soul trying to make a place for himself, in an unsuccessful way, in the CanLit world.

I think he may have been our own Willy Loman. If you remove all the bluster, I think Crad Kilodney was a nice guy who wanted to be loved and appreciated, perhaps for the wrong reasons. Finally, we have an anti-hero who we can all appreciate.

Air of ire

Re Air Canada Overhauls Aeroplan Amid Travel Uncertainty (Report on Business, Aug. 12): So Air Canada is revamping Aeroplan in hopes of convincing Canadian travellers to remain loyal. But Canadians have little choice in remaining loyal to our national air carrier, owing to federal laws restricting foreign ownership of domestic airlines.

Some healthy competition would force Air Canada to improve its service, thereby encouraging loyalty without having to offer incentives to do so. The introduction of the Air Passenger Protection Regulations last year was thought to effect better service through the implementation of financial penalties for delays within the control of airlines. But because the regulations are enforced by airlines themselves, many Canadians find that they are denying compensation claims for a myriad of reasons.

Story continues below advertisement

My own claim is now with the Canadian Transportation Agency, where it lies among more than 3,000 complaints that flooded the office within the first months of the new regulations. I don’t expect a decision for years.

Canadians deserve better air service, and I believe that will only come when Ottawa takes the blinders off when it comes to protecting Air Canada.

Crunch time for classes

Re Unions Decry School Board’s COVID-19 Sick Leave Policy (Aug. 13): As stated by a Ministry of Education spokesperson, teachers and education workers in Ontario “benefit from the most generous sick leave program in Canada.” Unions should realize that’s 11 full salary days a year and 120 short-term leave days paid at 90 per cent.

Options for educators during the pandemic are there; options to teach in person or online are there. The recent Hospital for Sick Children report recommends kids go back to school for their academic and mental health. In this new-normal world, educators, as others, should also learn to adapt.

Re As Back-to-school Anxiety Mounts Across Canada, Parents Turn To Private Pods (Aug. 13): It’s not surprising to see parents take steps to ensure their children receive safe, meaningful education through “education pods” or other means. It’s also not surprising that this can lead to inequality, since many families can’t afford anything other than government-run schools. What is surprising is the silence around policies that would erase those inequalities: Give parents money for their children’s education.

At Cardus, we propose that families be offered funding to use in the school setting that works best for their kids. The lower a family’s income, the more money they’d receive.

We should implement policies that will give all families the resources to make school work this fall. Why should only wealthy parents have the freedom to do what’s best for their kids?

Re Toronto Schools May Not Be Ready In Time, Board Says (Aug. 14): When I look at the old brick fortresses attended by my grandchildren and thousands of other elementary-school students in Toronto, I see no way to make them safer in the next few weeks. With hot-water heating, they don’t even have HVAC systems to modify. Many have windows that can’t be opened after years of painting.

I understand there are tens of thousands of working-class parents who do not have the money to ride out keeping their children at home until it’s safe. This is a huge dilemma for which I have no slick solution.

I do know these parents should be supported financially and we should have more information about the time and cost of keeping our children safe at school. I’m pretty sure the federal government will need to help. Unsafe actions, mostly driven by our collective fear of hurting the economy, are not good enough.

Re Carleton Criminologists Cut Student Internships With Police (Aug. 13): I am appalled that criminologists at Carleton University would follow such a disastrous social policy. It seems to me that the purpose of a university criminology department should be to learn about and suggest improvements in policing practices, not to limit and demonize the current method of keeping peace in our society.

Canada is one of the most peaceful and respectful countries in the world – I think we can thank our policing policies for this. I know, like everything else, policing in Canada can be improved. But while this is being continually done, I would thank police personnel for a tough job well done.

Jonathan Usher Toronto

I rarely lose my temper, but this move by criminologists at Carleton University leaves me dumbstruck.

I believe universities are supposed to prepare people to be excellent citizens, so that the next generation can tackle society’s problems, and some of them will become leaders who shake up existing structures.

Story continues below advertisement

However, it appears that these professors are hiding from their own responsibility for problems in policing. As some of the country’s brightest experts on criminology, isn’t it part of their jobs to advise and work with police-related organizations to uncover issues and resolve them?

I find their current decision to be a shallow and unhelpful response to a problem as important and complex as how we police.

Ed McDonough Toronto

It must be a sublime pleasure for Carleton University criminologists – with their secure positions and pensions – to know they may be blocking career opportunities for students by denying them a chance to work in the police and prison fields.

If, as they claim, these institutions are “rotten institutional structures,” wouldn’t it be preferable to send in newly woke students to fix the problems?

On one hand, she is solidly for law and order. She has little patience for the ivory tower lefties on city council, the ones whose view of street life is filtered by ideology, the cop-bashers who don’t understand what the police really do. She is tired of the discarded needles in her Burnside-Gorge neighbourhood, of the stranger’s hand rattling her door at 4 a.m.

article continues below

On the other, she calls the conversion of area hotels into temporary housing “a good start.” And long before the province announced $36 million for youth treatment centres this week, McMurter was passionately arguing the urgent need for such facilities, particularly here on Vancouver Island, where none exist. She has nothing but sympathy for people like the young woman she found living in a tent the other day, unaware of the help available to her.

For McMurter, 45, has a rare perspective: Three decades ago, she was a street-entrenched runaway. And she knows that if you want to paint a picture of an individual, you can’t use a broad brush.

Her story goes back to 1989, when the then 14-year-old found herself on Vancouver’s Granville Street after fleeing traumatizing violence. She survived by couch-surfing, panhandling, living in squats with other broken, bullied teens. The streets were full of such kids, gravitating to their own sub-cultures: criminals, punks, goths, racist skinheads, non-racist skinheads….

Knowing that she needed an education, she bounced around a series of schools, where no one paid attention to the honour roll student who would be there for awhile, then be gone.

At 15 she asked about getting government help, but because her family home was in the Fraser Valley she was sent to a welfare office in Aldergrove, where a social worker basically told her to stop whining and go away. Great. Already feeling like she didn’t matter, she had it confirmed by officialdom. “The world’s telling me I’m a complete piece of shit.”

So she stayed on the streets where, because she wasn’t crossing paths with the police or creating problems in school, she was effectively invisible. No one saw that she was anxious and depressed. No one paid attention to the drinking and the drugs.

She avoided some of the traps, though. “Pimps are looking at me and I’m, like, ‘I know what you’re after. Go away.’” She scrambled for jobs where she could find them, even working at a high-end south Granville salon until customers complained she was too young.

It wasn’t until she was 16 and starving that a friend dragged her to the provincial government’s adolescent services unit in search of meal vouchers to a local restaurant. “Where have you been all this time?” asked the man in charge. “I came in here before and you guys sent me away,” she replied.

After that, McMurter was taken into government care, which first meant a room in an infamous flophouse, then — thankfully — a spot in a group home for girls run by a wonderful woman named Lenox who provided structure and, more importantly, caring. McMurter went to alternative school, where she thrived. “I didn’t have the obstacles the other kids had.”

In fact she did so well that she outgrew the group home — which proved to be her downfall. Deemed strong and competent enough to live unsupported, she moved out on her own at age 18. Without the structure provided by Lenox, it was a disaster. She found herself surrounded by addicts. It was 1993, the year the China White heroin wave broke over Vancouver. “B.C. Ambulance personnel were having nervous breakdowns. They were hauling bodies out of dumpsters.” It wasn’t only the street addicts who were dying. There were high school kids, business guys in Armani suits.

“It was not just the Downtown Eastside. The ugliness was absolutely everywhere, and there was a gang turf war exploding.”

Then, far away in Ontario, her grandmother died. “That was a massive hit to me, losing her. My grandma was the one person in the world who loved me, and she was gone.” McMurter was closing in on her 19th birthday, which in those days meant aging out of government care, falling off a cliff. She was scared.

“My whole peer group was going downhill with all the heroin that’s around,” she said. She found herself alone in an East Van slum, no job, no school, nothing. “I felt completely abandoned by the people who were supposed to be taking care of me.”

Back then, when youth in care turned 19 they would get shuttled down the street to the adult welfare office, assigned to a formidable woman who would admonish them to get a job. Blunt advice, but the alternative was the treadmill in which the ambulance sirens began as soon as the welfare cheques were cashed.

McMurter got into program in which street kids got restaurant training while working at a cafe. That went well until her anxiety caught up to her and, instead of helping her work through it, her government-funded employer dumped her. What made things worse was that the job had made her ineligible for social assistance, so, unable to pay her rent, she found herself on the street again. “Thanks, guys.”

She drifted to Denman Island where, while working in a restaurant and living in a tent, she turned 20. Then came a similar job in Invermere, then other towns. She was still self-medicating, but the more she distanced herself from her old life in Vancouver, the more she met new kinds of people, saw more possibilities.

She was 23 and living in Calgary when she got clean.

What was the catalyst? “Just knowing that that there’s more to the world, and being smart enough to know I didn’t want to die in a gutter…. Knowing I was capable of being more than that.”

She focussed on gaining the life she wanted, not quitting the one she wanted to leave. It worked. “I’m someone who came out the other side.”

So now she is married and has a government job — and the perspective that comes with lived experience. The latter allows her to eschew that broad brush being applied to both campers and the used-to-be homeless now living in temporary housing. The actions of some shouldn’t leave them all branded as criminals. Nor are they all little lost lambs.

“The little lost lamb talk has to go away,” she says. Social justice warriors can’t excuse anti-social behaviour. “You can be compassionate and have boundaries at the same time. You can take care of people without letting them burn down your house.”

But you do need to take care of people, which means that it’s not good enough to offer harm-reduction strategies that aren’t accompanied by treatment. “Sure it gives them clean supplies, but where’s the incentive to stop?” So, yes, those youth-treatment beds are desperately needed. So are treatment beds in general. People in need matter, even when made to feel that they don’t.

A Zimbabwean magistrate Tuesday barred Beatrice Mtetwa, a top human rights lawyer, from representing a jailed journalist and ordered that she be prosecuted for comments posted on a Facebook page run by an American filmmaker.

Magistrate Ngoni Nduna also said he will forward his ruling to the Law Society of Zimbabwe for possible further punishment of the lawyer.

Mtetwa was representing Hopewell Chin’ono, an investigative journalist who has reported alleged government corruption on Twitter and has been in jail for more than three weeks on accusations of mobilizing an anti-government protest.

Prosecutors in Chin’ono’s bail case last week asked the magistrate to order Mtetwa to step down, arguing that she had posted on a Facebook page called “Beatrice Mtetwa and the Rule of Law” proceedings that were held in camera.

The allegedly offensive posts called on the international community to speak out against Chin’ono’s imprisonment.

Chin’ono told the court that Mtetwa had nothing to with the page. He said it was administered by an American filmmaker who produced a documentary by the name of the Facebook page, where people regularly post on human rights issues in Zimbabwe.

On Tuesday, the magistrate agreed with the prosecution and also ordered that Mtetwa should be charged with contempt of court.

Mtetwa has over the past decades represented dozens of journalists, human rights campaigners and opposition leaders accused of plotting against the government. She also frequently speaks against human rights abuses in the troubled southern African country.

She has been arrested, detained and allegedly assaulted by police in a pattern of harassment and intimidation.

Mtetwa said Tuesday’s ruling was meant to instill fear in human rights lawyers and could have the “chilling effect” of dissuading young lawyers from taking on human rights issues.

“The intention is to stop us defending a certain type of client it means the right to legal representation has been severely curtailed and it has been curtailed by the courts,” she told reporters outside the court. She said she will appeal the ruling.

Studying justice administration and police science in the mid-1980s provided an opportunity to explore criminal law, and my instructor at the time was Crown prosecutor Peter Martin, now an Alberta Court of Appeal justice.

Fast forward to Peel’s fifth principle of policing which is “to seek and to preserve public favour, not by catering to public opinion, but by constantly demonstrating absolute impartial service to the law.” That’s a tall order to fill, and police officers do their best to uphold this day in, day out, 24/7.

article continues below

It’s quite likely, then, that the world of policing was where the saying “by the book,” really got traction. Police officers often refer to the Criminal Code of Canada, and other forms of legislation in the execution of their duties.

Police leaders and the officers who serve their communities are often found in a difficult spot as they regularly find themselves trying to separate policing from political issues.

According to this particular principle of policing, they must steer clear of catering to influence and maintain the law or risk being scrutinized by the public.

Can you imagine trying to keep various community groups and politicians happy all the time?

We are all equal when it comes to the law and it’s through this impartial service that the police sometimes find themselves under fire when politics and community concerns demand their attention. Policing policies are very structured, as are the laws that we are all bound by.

Therefore, issues such as drug decriminalization and homelessness become hot topics, often creating divisions like those we are now witnessing throughout our country and around the world.

In 2019, provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry released a report on decriminalizing drug users in an effort to reduce opioid overdoses. There are many supporters, including the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police, which recommends the simple possession of illicit drugs be decriminalized.

Many police officers support this movement, and yet are still bound to enforce drug laws. Premier John Horgan is also an avid supporter of the recommendation and recognizes that we’re in a health crisis, and that changes in legislation would allow police services to tackle other problems.

In Johann Hari’s book Chasing the Scream, he set out on a three-year, 30,000-mile journey into the war on drugs. What he found is that more and more people all over the world have begun to recognize three startling truths — drugs are not what we think they are, addiction is not what we think it is and the drug war has very different motives from those we have seen on TV screens for so long.

Homelessness is another crisis that the police find themselves in the thick of, and as several authors for the U.S. Urban Institute pointed out in a June 29 article, “addressing chronic homelessness through policing isn’t working. Housing First strategies are a better way.”

The authors go on to suggest that “people forced to endure chronic homelessness (experiencing homelessness for an extended period) are more likely to interact with the police and face citations, arrests and incarceration, trapping them in a homelessness-jail cycle.”

While there are certainly some differences between countries, the war on drugs and the ongoing challenges with homelessness are taxing on police services. Let’s remember that the police are bound to uphold the law, not pander to public opinion or political pressure. Reflect again on Peel’s first principle — their basic mission is to prevent crime and disorder.

Most of us recognize that we are at a crossroads, and that the police continue to be tasked with what many people would say is insurmountable.

It’s critical, then, that the public and the police do their utmost to demonstrate compassion towards our most vulnerable populations and that our politicians expedite new laws that release the pressure on police to enforce laws that are ultimately targeting citizens at risk.

Walker said the woman, who is in her early 20s, fell to the ground. She told Walker the man said he would hurt her if she moved or called the police.

The man took the day’s pay envelope and fled eastbound on Belleville Street on a light-coloured road bike, said Victoria police spokesman Bowen Osoko.

Police looked for the man but were unable to find him. He is described as white and in his mid-30s, with a long, full beard. He was wearing a black and red ball cap, a dark-coloured hoodie and jeans.

Walker said the man had been hanging around the carriage booth, talking to carriage operators and customers and acting very “jolly.”

The woman told Walker that she’s trained in martial arts but she didn’t want to fight back because she couldn’t see if the man had a weapon.

“I said money isn’t everything. We can replace the money, we cannot replace you,” Walker said. He didn’t want to say how much was stolen, but said it’s a significant amount considering how much tourism operators are struggling amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

Police said the woman declined medical attention. Walker said she took Monday off and was shaken up but recovering.

“It was an unfortunate incident,” Walker said. “We’ve been doing this for 45 years and we’ve never encountered this kind of behaviour before.”

Roughly 1,100 protesters caught up in the largest mass arrests in Canadian history a decade ago are eligible to receive between $5,000 and $24,700 each in the proposed settlement of a class-action lawsuit against the Toronto Police Service.

The police service also committed to more appropriate use of crowd-control techniques, such as giving people warnings and a chance to disperse, than they used on mostly peaceful demonstrators during the Group of 20 meetings of world leaders on June 26 and 27, 2010, in Toronto.

The police also agreed to expunge any records of the protesters’ arrest and detention, unless they were charged with an offence. The vast majority were released without charge. The settlement took 10 years to achieve after the two sides fought the lawsuit’s first stage – certification of the class action – to the Supreme Court of Canada, which took six years.

Police did not admit liability, or acknowledge violating protesters’ rights under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms – although they did promise to respect Charter rights in the future. They also did not entirely forswear the aggressive containment techniques they used in 2010, but said their measures should be proportionate to the risk of harm.

The $16.5-million settlement, if approved by a judge, would bring to a close a widely criticized episode in Canadian policing, when peaceful protesters, and in some cases passersby, were hemmed in by police in riot gear, held in the open for several hours in a relentless downpour, and detained in poor conditions in a makeshift jail.

“It was terrifying,” Sherry Good, the representative plaintiff in the class action, told The Globe and Mail. “It made me very wary of the police. That lasts to today.”

She said she is very happy with the settlement. “The money, of course, is lovely, but it’s the other parts of the settlement that are important to me,” such as commitments to do better in the future.

Lawyers for the protesters, Murray Klippenstein and Eric Gillespie, said the financial settlement is comparable to those reached in similar legal actions in the United States.

“We think most Canadians will recognize that there really have to be limits on police actions, and that this is an example of how not to do things,” Mr. Klippenstein said.

The settlement is to be brought before Ontario Superior Court Justice Edward Belobaba on Oct. 19.

The first day of protests had been marked by violence when black-clad protesters broke away from peaceful demonstrators and burned police cars and broke windows on downtown streets. In response, senior police officers declared that they would take back the streets, said Gerry McNeilly, then Ontario’s independent police review director. He said the actions that followed caused a loss of public confidence in the police.

Lines of riot police boxed in peaceful protesters, a technique known as “kettling,” on crowds along the Esplanade, at Queen Street and Spadina Avenue, the University of Toronto and in Parkdale. In all, roughly 1,100 people were arrested, and large numbers were detained without access to legal counsel, adequate food or water or bathroom privacy, in overcrowded wire cages in a makeshift jail, according to a court document filed on behalf of the protesters in the class action.

The class action, filed that August, sought $45-million in damages from Toronto Police and the federal government (later dropped from the lawsuit), and a court declaration that the police had violated the protesters’ Charter rights.

The proposed settlement does not contain such a declaration. But it does include a commitment to avoid using “containment,” except where necessary to avoid substantial harm to a person, and only after audible warnings have been given, and an opportunity to disperse. Anyone arrested for a breach of the peace must be released as soon as any risk of imminent harm has passed, even if they intend to rejoin a peaceful protest.

If temporary detention facilities are to be used, they should be designed for prompt processing, and they should provide adequate food, water and access to medicine, the document says.

Bill Blair, the federal Public Safety Minister, was Toronto’s police chief at the time. His office declined to comment on the proposed settlement. The Toronto Police Service said in a statement it is pleased to reach a resolution.

Victim after victim lined up on Tuesday to describe Joseph DeAngelo as a “sick monster,” “horrible man” and “subhuman” who stole their innocence and changed their lives during a more than decade-long reign of rape and murder that earned him the nickname Golden State Killer.

The daughter of one rape victim gave him an obscene hand gesture and cursed him during the first of four days of hearings in Sacramento County Superior Court before he is formally sentenced to life in prison on Friday under a plea agreement that allows DeAngelo to avoid a death sentence.

Some read statements on behalf of their loved ones who could not testify in person, while others proudly gave their names now that DeAngelo, 74, is heading to prison.

“He and his knife had complete control over me for the next two hours,” Patti Cosper, the daughter of rape survivor Patricia Murphy, read from her mother’s statement. “He truly is an evil monster with no soul.”

DeAngelo is a former police officer in California who eluded capture for four decades. He was identified and arrested in 2018 by using a new form of DNA tracing.

Nearly two-dozen of his Sacramento County rape victims or their family members confronted him in the courthouse that is otherwise still sealed from the public because of the coronavirus. Others planned to tell Superior Court Judge Michael Bowman on Wednesday and Thursday how DeAngelo’s crimes changed their lives.

“I was a normal 15-year-old kid. I loved going to school, having sleepovers and going to church,” Kris Pedretti told the judge. “My world was small, predictable and safe.”

Then DeAngelo attacked her just before Christmas in 1976.

“I sang ‘Jesus Loves Me’ in my head as I waited – waited to die,” Pedretti said. “The knowledge that DeAngelo will spend the rest of his life in prison for his heinous acts has ended my dark journey so that I may begin a new one.”

Lisa Lilienthal described DeAngelo as a sadistic “boogeyman” as she testified by video about the attack she witnessed on her mother. Until his arrest, she said, “something lingered in the shadows – our sense of normalcy, our sense of safety had been raped too.”

In June, DeAngelo pleaded guilty to 13 murders and 13 rape-related charges between 1975 and 1986. He also publicly admitted dozens more sexual assaults for which the statute of limitations had expired.

All told, he admitted harming 87 victims at 53 separate crime scenes spanning 11 California counties in the plea deal that spares him the death penalty, prosecutors said.

That’s more victims than prosecutors disclosed after his admission in June to 161 crimes involving 48 people. The higher number includes those who chose not to participate in having DeAngelo publicly admit to crimes in which he could not be formally charged, Ventura County District Attorney Greg Totten said.

DeAngelo’s nicknames showed the escalation and geographic sweep of his crimes: the Visalia Ransacker, thought to be responsible for about 100 burglaries and one slaying in the San Joaquin Valley farm town; the East Area Rapist; the Original Night Stalker; and finally, the Golden State Killer when investigators finally linked the crimes that stretched across much of the state.

The family of Debbie Strauss, who died in 2016, recounted what became the signature that marked DeAngelo’s crimes after he escalated his attacks to couples instead of single women and girls.

He would force his victims to bind themselves with shoelaces before balancing plates on the man’s back with a warning that he would kill both victims if he heard the plates rattle while he raped the woman.

“He spent hours raining his terror through threats and unspeakable abuse,” said Strauss’ mother, Dolly Kreis. “He would leave his victims shaking in fright while he went to the kitchen to eat, only to return and then the abuse and vileness started all over again.”

Sandy James, Strauss’ sister, was among the many speakers who repeatedly tried to rattle DeAngelo by bringing up what they said was his small penis, a description that numerous victims gave investigators when they reported the rapes.

The killer, however, sat silently in an orange jail jumpsuit, staring straight ahead and wearing a mask as protection against the coronavirus.

Some said they believed his day of reckoning would never come.

Among them were two sisters who took turns testifying. Peggy was 15 when she was raped, and Sue was 16 when she was bound and gagged in another room. Neither gave their last names as they described the trauma that still haunts their otherwise successful lives.

“My God, we were just high school kids,” Peggy said, noting that she was stunned when DeAngelo was arrested.

The Canadian Press

At a time of unprecedented scrutiny on the costs of policing, Toronto’s police board will vote Tuesday on whether to give the city’s auditor-general increased access to the service’s finances – a move city councillors say would allow a more thoughtful debate on the future of Canada’s largest municipal police force.

The recommendation was among more than 80 that came in reports done in recent months aimed at tackling systemic anti-Black racism and rethinking the force’s response to mental-health emergencies. It also calls for a line-by-line breakdown of the $1.2-billion police budget to be made public instead of the summary currently available.

“The reality is that today, and every year before, Toronto council votes on a budget that is over a billion dollars without even the ability to see the line-by-line budget,” City Councillor Josh Matlow said. “And so [this] will hopefully change that … because then we can actually have a really substantial discussion around the line-by-line, and then actually debate whether we agree that our money should be invested in A, B and C, but maybe not E.”

Mr. Matlow, who put forward a motion with Councillor Kristyn Wong-Tam in June to increase budget transparency and eventually scale back police funding in Toronto by 10 per cent, praised the mayor and the police board for these recommendations, which are slated to be discussed at Tuesday’s police board meeting.

Although the motion failed, council later passed a revised version, on which many of the recommendations going to the police board are based.

A recent Globe analysis of police spending across the country showed that, in some provinces, funding for police has grown faster than for transit or social services. (In Toronto, about one-tenth of the municipal operations budget goes toward police services. In other cities, forces have accounted for a quarter or more of city spending, with the majority of those funds spent on officers’ salaries.)

“Transparency results in greater accountability and, potentially, savings,” Toronto Police Services Board chair Jim Hart wrote in one report.

Under the City of Toronto Act, Toronto’s auditor-general lacks the power to audit the police force without an invitation. In addition to providing that invitation, the police board is also recommending that Mr. Hart go to the province to express support for an update to that legislation, “to expand the auditor-general’s jurisdiction to include auditing the [police] service, and reporting the results ... to the board.”

The recommendations have piqued the interest of Ken Hughes, Auditor-General for the City of Ottawa. While Toronto has its own act, Ontario’s 443 other municipalities are governed by the Municipal Act, which does not require local governments to establish an auditor-general’s office. Very few have one, Mr. Hughes said, and those that do similarly require an invitation to audit police.

Although municipalities still have an internal audit function, he stresses that this is not the same as an independent auditor. For instance, a municipality’s internal auditor could report to the city manager, and an internal auditor at the police might report to the police chief.

Story continues below advertisement

“Every internal audit function is not independent of the administration themselves because they are part of the administration,” he said.

Mr. Hughes said police finances should be audited as standard practice, and questions why municipal police services would be exempt.

The federal auditor-general routinely examines the RCMP to ensure value for money, for example. And Ontario’s auditor-general has scrutinized the provincial police force’s finances.

“Obviously, there are some aspects of police operations that should remain confidential. I think everyone gets that,” Mr. Hughes said. “But where do you draw the line? How do you know if you’re getting value for money if no one is ever asking the appropriate questions or comparing the activities of one police service to the activities of another?”





Mr. Hughes said he is encouraged by the proposal in Toronto, but would like to see the same change made to the Municipal Act, which undergoes mandatory reviews every so often, to address gaps.

“The most accessible government is supposed to be your municipal government. That’s where you expect to see accountability and transparency,” he said. “If there isn’t somebody independent who can help make everything more transparent, then your accountability is lessened.”

Akwasi Owusu-Bempah, a professor of criminology at the University of Toronto, said that financial audits of the police force would be particularly valuable at a time when cities face widespread calls to “defund” police. The idea is to reduce police budgets and direct the savings to social programs. “Taxpayers should be asking for these,” he said. “This is ultimately taxpayer money.”

“It could be [that they could be defunded by] 25 per cent, it could be 5 per cent. But without looking at what they do, and figuring out what they don’t need to be doing and what could be done elsewhere… we have no idea what that figure should be,” he said. “This is why we need the audit.”",846,0.7777158281958607,local

Hours after mutinying soldiers seized Mali’s top leadership in an apparent coup, the West African nation’s president announced on state television that he would step down.

The resignation capped a day of dramatic developments and exposed the deepening instability of a country that has become one of Canada’s biggest recipients of military and development aid.

Earlier Tuesday, thousands of people cheered and celebrated in the streets of Mali’s capital, Bamako, as the rebel soldiers drove through the city in armoured vehicles. The city has been consumed by mass protests since June as a result of widespread anger over corruption, a weakening economy and worsening armed conflicts in much of the country.

President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita and Prime Minister Boubou Cissé were detained by soldiers and escorted to the Kati military base, about 15 kilometres from the capital, according to photos on social media.

The same military base had been the origin of an earlier coup in 2012, which in turn had ignited years of deadly insurgency by Islamist radicals and other militia forces in northern and central regions of the country, killing thousands of people.

Since the beginning of the insurgencies, Mali has received an outpouring of aid from Western and African countries, including thousands of French troops and a United Nations peacekeeping force. Canada contributed by deploying helicopters and hundreds of peacekeeping soldiers to northern Mali from 2018 to 2019. But the massive aid has failed to quell the insurgencies or stabilize the fragile government.

Mali has received nearly $1.6-billion in development aid from Canada over the past two decades, including more than $136-million from 2017 to 2018, making it one of the world’s top recipients of Canadian aid. Over the past 18 months, Canada has also deployed units of police officers in Mali to support peace efforts and the reform of Mali’s security forces.

Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne, in a tweet on Tuesday, said Canada is “very concerned” by the Mali situation and “strongly condemns” the military mutiny against the government.

Canadian embassy staff in Mali are safe, he said. “We will continue to follow the situation closely.”

The United States, France, the United Nations, the African Union and the Economic Community of West African States also condemned the military rebellion.

Moussa Faki Mahamat, chairperson of the African Union Commission, called for the “immediate release” of the President and Prime Minister from their “forced detention.” In a statement, he rejected any attempt at “unconstitutional change of government” and urged the mutineers to cease all violence.

The UN Security Council is reported to have called an emergency session for Wednesday to discuss the Mali crisis. There are about 13,000 soldiers and almost 2,000 police officers in the UN peacekeeping mission in Mali. France and West African countries also have thousands of soldiers in the country.

Bruno Charbonneau, a peacekeeping expert and associate professor at Royal Military College Saint-Jean in Quebec, said the mutiny and apparent coup on Tuesday had been unforeseen by experts but should not have shocked anyone.

“It is unsurprising given the stalemate of the last few years: A peace process that was going nowhere, the mounting violence notably in the central regions, a government that seemed unable and incapable of responding positively to the situation and a President who often seemed disconnected or reluctant to change his ways,” Mr. Charbonneau told The Globe and Mail.

A recent report by a UN panel of experts showed that Malian government officials “were working against the peace process and benefiting from it,” he said.

Moreover, there has been an “undeniable failure” of the international approach to Mali and the broader Sahel region, and a new strategy might now be adopted, Mr. Charbonneau said.

The international community has allowed the conflicting groups in Mali “to prolong and at times avoid the peace process, to make sure that it went nowhere,” he said. The peace process has been shaped by a counterterrorism agenda that created incentives for armed groups and government officials to undermine peace, he said.

Mr. Keita, President since 2013, has been the target of growing protests for months. Last month, at least 11 people were killed during clashes between protesters and security forces. Many people have been angered as Mali’s military has increasingly lost control of much of the country while the insurgencies grow.

The insurgencies that began in 2012 culminated in an Islamist offensive that drove south toward Bamako from northern Mali until it was halted by French military intervention in early 2013. But the continuing heavy presence of French troops and other forces failed to prevent the latest coup.

On Tuesday, as the mutiny began, Mr. Cissé issued a statement appealing for dialogue with the rebel soldiers. But he soon disappeared from view, until the mutineers took him and the 75-year-old President to their base.

Five officers then arrested him in a rough manner, and placed him under detention in police cells, where court documents show that he was brutally beaten by a fellow inmate, before being airlifted to hospital in Iqaluit. An RCMP statement said he was charged with intoxication in a public place, after members of the public told a Mountie a man was fighting. The charge was later dropped.

The investigation, initiated by Michelaine Lahaie, chairwoman of the Civilian Review and Complaints Commission for the RCMP, is the third into the episode. The Ottawa Police Service is doing a criminal investigation, at the RCMP’s request, into the conduct of the officer who hit the man with the door, and the RCMP is doing an internal review.

Nunavut RCMP recorded for second time violently arresting an Inuk man

Ms. Lahaie said the commission’s review will be broader in that it will also look at the beating the man suffered in custody, whether his jailers took reasonable steps to ensure his safety, whether his conditions in detention were adequate and whether he received adequate medical care after the violent encounter in the cell.

“Consideration will also be given as to whether racial bias and/or discrimination played a role in the man’s arrest and subsequent treatment,” Ms. Lahaie said in a news release on Tuesday.

She said the commission will also monitor the police and RCMP investigations of the episode. And, she said, the commission will address whether the arrest of the man was reasonable in the circumstances.

“I am concerned with the conduct of RCMP members involved in this serious incident,” Ms. Lahaie said. “I am aware that there is historical distrust by Inuit toward the police and I am committed to increasing RCMP accountability.”

The incident, which occurred in Kinngait (formerly Cape Dorset), a community of about 1,500 people, is similar to another interaction this summer recorded on video and posted to social media. The second one happened Aug. 9, also in Kinngait, when a man sleeping on a roadway was kneed three times by an RCMP officer during an arrest for public intoxication. (He was detained until sober, then released without charge.) And the Mounties in Nunavut have been involved in three shootings, two of them fatal, since February. Ottawa Police are investigating, and expected to report soon.

Amanda Jones, the RCMP’s commanding officer in the region, said in an e-mail that she welcomes the investigation and that the RCMP will assist in any way it can.

Benson Cowan, the chief executive officer of Nunavut’s Legal Services Board, which oversees legal aid in the northern territory of 39,000 people, was encouraged by the investigation of the door incident, but said a wider review of RCMP conduct in Nunavut is necessary. He has called on the commission, in letters last June and this January, to begin such a review.

“It’s heartening to see that they’re taking action,” he said in an interview. “It would have been good to see something sooner. Fundamentally, what is needed is a broader more systemic approach. ... Simply investigating these as one-offs does nothing to address the systemic nature of the conduct. But it’s a good start.”

Infrastructure Minister Catherine McKenna said Thursday that new measures must be taken to protect Canadian politicians from threatening behaviour.

Her comments come after police launched an investigation this week into an incident at her constituency office, as well as reports that two other Ottawa-area politicians also faced threats recently.

Ms. McKenna, who has spoken out in the past about being a target, said she’s heard from many politicians who have experienced similar incidents, some never reported publicly.

“It’s not just about me. There’s been some attention to incidents involving me, but I’ve heard from so many women, from so many men, and it’s really worrying,” she said after a funding announcement in Ottawa.

“We need to reflect on this and take action so we can all do our jobs.”

Earlier this week, a police investigation was launched after someone yelled obscenities at a member of Ms. McKenna’s staff, with the footage posted to social media.

After being told the constituency office in downtown Ottawa was closed owing to COVID-19, the individual yelled expletives and insults at the employee about Ms. McKenna and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

In the aftermath of the 2019 election, vulgar and sexist graffiti had been spray-painted across the front of her campaign office.

During that campaign, she had also spoken to The Canadian Press about how what had started as anonymous online abuse had escalated into in-person verbal assaults, sometimes requiring her to have a security detail. That level of protection is not usually provided to cabinet ministers.

According to data from the RCMP, first reported by the Toronto Star, there has been an increase in the number of threats made against the prime minister and cabinet when compared to last year.

Story continues below advertisement

The RCMP say from January to July, 2019, protective policing opened 100 investigations into threats, while from January to July, 2020, there have been approximately 130 launched.

Following the incident at Ms. McKenna’s office, Lisa MacLeod, a member of the Ontario legislature for an Ottawa riding and provincial cabinet minister, gave an interview on local radio condemning the abuse.

She then received threats of her own, her spokesman confirmed Thursday.

“Minister MacLeod is once again receiving police protection due to both threatening emails and an unexplained mischievous incident to her personal vehicle in Ottawa,” Derek Rowland said in an email.

In March, 2019, a woman was charged with making threats against Ms. MacLeod, and she was given a police detail, during controversy around changes to the province’s autism strategy. She was in charge of that file at the time.

Last week, Laura Dudas, an Ottawa city councillor, had a rock hurled through a window of her home while her family was asleep.

“While I cannot speak to the motivations of the person behind this disturbing act, it comes as the latest in a string of acts targeting my role as a woman in politics,” she said in a statement posted to social media Thursday.

“There are too many reports of women politicians being the recipients of vicious online abuse, derogatory comments about their gender, and when online vitriol spills into the real world, violent physical attacks. This has to stop.”

Federal Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau, the first woman to ever hold that post, said while she’s never received threats at the same level as McKenna, she has been subject to negative comments online.

She said while she doesn’t physically fear for her own safety, she thinks a light has to be shone on how much abuse is heaped upon politicians.

What’s happening to McKenna though, she said, is both inexplicable and unacceptable.

“How can we still have this type of behaviour in 2020? I don’t get it,” she said.

The Supreme Court of Canada has ruled against the main complainant in an ongoing dispute involving Steven Galloway, a bestselling novelist and former head of the creative writing program at the University of British Columbia.

Mr. Galloway is suing the woman, a former student who has accused him of sexual assault and harassment, for defamation.

On Thursday, the country’s highest court rejected the woman’s application to appeal a lower court’s ruling that she must turn over documents Mr. Galloway’s lawyers have requested and which have been deemed relevant to the case.

It is a key legal win for Mr. Galloway, whose lawyers have been seeking the documents for more than a year.

David Wotherspoon, one of the lawyers for the woman, known in court documents as A.B., called the ruling disappointing.

The application for leave to appeal was dismissed without costs. No reason was given for the judgment. There is no further legal recourse in the matter.

Mr. Galloway is suing the woman, whose identity is sealed under court order, and more than 20 other people, including UBC faculty and other Canadian authors.

Thursday’s judgment means she will be compelled to produce documents such as e-mail correspondence with some of the other people named in Mr. Galloway’s lawsuit.

The allegations against Mr. Galloway, initially blanketed in secrecy, received a great deal of attention and led to his dismissal from the university and the devastation of his personal life, according to his lawsuit.

A.B. is trying to have the lawsuit thrown out under anti-SLAPP legislation, which seeks to protect freedom of expression on matters of public interest and ensure that powerful people or organizations cannot silence critics.

Story continues below advertisement

When A.B. testified in a B.C. court in 2019 that she could not remember certain things, she was asked by Mr. Galloway’s lawyers to produce documents they said could have cleared up those matters. When she refused, she was ordered by a judge to produce the documents. That judgment was upheld by the B.C. Court of Appeal in April. She then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.

“While it is unusual for the [Supreme Court of Canada] to grant leave in such cases, given the importance of the issues for survivors of sexual violence, we felt it was important to seek leave,” Mr. Wotherspoon noted in an e-mail to The Globe and Mail.

“An appeal would have been an opportunity for the [Supreme Court] to ensure that the anti-SLAPP protections are in fact real for survivors faced with actually litigating these applications. That issue is now left for another day and another case.”

The case dates back to November, 2015, when UBC announced that Mr. Galloway had been suspended because of “serious allegations.” An independent investigation conducted by retired B.C. Supreme Court Justice Mary Ellen Boyd concluded on a balance of probabilities that Mr. Galloway had not committed sexual assault, but found that he had had an inappropriate affair with A.B.

In June, 2016, Mr. Galloway was fired by UBC for an “irreparable breach of … trust.”

The university was later ordered to pay him more than $240,000 in damages after it was found UBC had damaged his reputation and violated his privacy rights.

Story continues below advertisement

Mr. Galloway filed his lawsuit in October, 2018, arguing that he was defamed by false accusations of rape, sexual assault and physical assault and that the defamatory statements were recklessly repeated both within the university and online, including on social media.

A GoFundMe campaign has raised more than $87,000 to help pay legal costs for the people named in the suit.

The trial for Mr. Galloway’s defamation suit had originally been scheduled to begin in June, but it cannot happen until the SLAPP matter is resolved. Mr. Wotherspoon said he hopes that can move forward quickly.

Lawyers for Mr. Galloway declined to comment for this story.

Ferrukh Faruqui is an Ottawa writer and community activist.

COVID-19 has redefined every facet of our lives, and the hajj – the mandatory, once-in-a-lifetime pilgrimage for Muslims – is no exception. Typically, 2.5 million pilgrims converge on Mecca in Saudi Arabia every year to fulfill this fifth pillar of Islam. But the pandemic dictated that only 1,000 people who already live in the country would be allowed to perform this year’s five-day ritual, which ended Aug. 2.

For me, though, there was something else extraordinary about this year’s hajj. I was overcome by the sight of women circumambulating the coveted inner circles nearest to the Kaaba, the most sacred site in Islam, in the heart of Mecca’s Grand Mosque. In a YouTube interview with Mufti Menk, a popular Zimbabwean cleric, one of these fortunate pilgrims marvelled: “I thought it would be like when women pray behind the men … but here I was, in the first row closest to the Kaaba.”

Her strange but beautiful experience unfortunately belies the recent troubling phenomenon of hostility toward female pilgrims. Though we comprise half the world’s two billion Muslims, many women are still forced to chafe under gender restrictions. In the past, there would be solace in Mecca’s egalitarian rules, but now, even the holiest of holies is less welcoming – perhaps not even safe.

Last fall, my daughter Nishat flew to Mecca with her new husband for umrah, the lesser, year-round pilgrimage seeking reconnection with God. But on the night of her arrival, she called me, sobbing. Her pilgrimage had been “ruined” by officious strangers who tugged at her hijab and shouted at her. Something in me withered and died. I recalled my own 1988 umrah, when my scarf slipped intermittently off my head. Yet I wasn’t accosted by outraged, gimlet-eyed pilgrims; I was left in peace to contemplate God.

Disillusioned women shared similar stories with me. Hoping for a transformative journey, they were instead hectored and betrayed by fellow believers. Being reprimanded by strangers for dressing “improperly” was just the beginning; some detailed sexual harassment, even assault – violations that stain this sacred space.

Such gender-based discrimination has become a part of the Canadian Muslim experience, too. My father designed Winnipeg’s first mosque in the 1970s, and our family found a spiritual home in its bright, barrier-free prayer hall. When women stood at the pulpit to address the mixed congregation there, no one tried to silence them. We weren’t forced into segregated rooms through back entrances. But sadly, that halcyon era is history.

A battle over sacred spaces has played out in North American mosques since the 1980s, when the Saudi Arabian government launched an oil-funded campaign to homogenize Islam overseas. Strict Saudi interpretations of the faith drove the imported fundamentalism that gripped our communities. One day we arrived at our mosque to find a physical barrier separating the men in the front from the women in the back. The unmosquing of Muslim women had begun.

Ironically, the only place where men and women remained free to pray together was in the very heart of the Saudi kingdom. But soon the conservative sheiks whose support legitimizes the House of Saud wrested control of the Grand Mosque, too, by allowing freshly “radicalized” Muslim pilgrims to police each other.

Women of all ages now report strangers hissing imprecations on their pilgrimages, impatiently adjusting their hijabs or demanding that they cover their faces – which is forbidden during these rituals. As former New York Times correspondent Diaa Hadid chronicled during her hajj in 2016: “As I tried to find room between worshippers, a security guard shouted that I was taking space where men needed to walk … I felt safe. But also, too often, second-class.”

Some men even cynically commit assault under the cover of faith, grabbing buttocks or breasts. In a 2018 Facebook post, Pakistani Sabica Khan described the multiple assaults she endured near the Kaaba, a story amplified by Egyptian-American journalist Mona Eltahawy, who then launched #MosqueMeToo by sharing the story of her own assault in Mecca at the age of 15. The campaign unleashed emotional accounts from women who’d suffered similar molestation. Even in Mecca, the real world intrudes to shame women and put them in their place. As Ms. Eltahawy wrote: “The men who assaulted me abused the sanctity of a sacred space to ensure the silence of their victim.”

At its core, Islam is a feminist religion. Georgetown University historian Margot Badran tirelessly celebrates the forgotten tenets of Islamic feminism, declaring that in the Koran, “men and women alike are enjoined to obey Islamic precepts and are exhorted to engage in taqwa or righteous behaviour.” And in her revolutionary book Believing Women in Islam, scholar Asma Barlas shows how centuries of patriarchal readings of Muslim scripture have sown misogyny.

Let’s cleanse our hearts and remember the Koran’s forgotten message of radical equality. Maybe then we can halt the exodus of women from the sacred spaces that belong to us all, so that images of women touching the Kaaba become the new normal.

The Conservation Officer Service says the 58-year-old man was riding along the Castle Pass Trail north of Lillooet when he was attacked by a sow that had two cubs with her.

The service says the man's wife used bear spray on the sow and the animal left with her cubs.

It says the man has injuries to his stomach and leg, but his head was protected even though the bear bit right through his helmet.

Search and rescue crews along with an air ambulance were called for assistance by the RCMP.

The service sent in its predatory attack team on Monday, which determined the bear attacked the man in defence when it was surprised and there will be no effort to capture the mother or her cubs.

We’ve seen how physical and verbal abuse damages and ends lives. But the movement on the streets, online and among work communities is bringing attention to how quiet behaviour and attitudes — intentional, thoughtless, or unknowing and unaware — can cause similar and often hidden harm.

A couple of weeks ago, we were talking about how the pandemic shutdowns provided an opportunity to reorder the world intentionally as part of the post-health-crisis restart. Many people saw that we could use the reopening of economies to address major problems and concerns faced by society and the world.

The restrictions exposed the cracks in our society, the fractures among our families, and the flaws in many of our systems. When so many parts of the world shut down, the weaknesses in how our lives are structured could no longer be avoided. Domestic abuse, mental health, homelessness, lack of support for seniors, young adults and young families, and the precarious nature of much work deemed essential yet done by some of the most poorly paid among us — these problems have long existed but are usually plastered and painted over, like mould in a building.

It took closing businesses, schools and offices, a nosediving economy, and hospitals and health-care workers standing by for a potential flood of COVID-19 cases such as Italy, France, Seattle and New York City saw to make us stop and pay attention.

And when we did, the problems stared right back at us.

As the pandemic unfolded, some problems were acknowledged. Some were temporarily addressed. Some employers of essential services topped up the wages of their front-line workers. Governments have stepped in with emergency-response programs to help individuals, businesses, non-profit agencies and industries. Changes to how work is conducted were mandated to keep people safe.

Those are only the problems that became most obvious when the shutdown occurred. With time, the existence of other problems — as persistent, but long shoved deeper into the flawed structure of our society — have emerged.

As many of the protesters have noted over the last couple of weeks, Canada has its own shameful past regarding racism. We carry the infamy of past harms — smallpox-infected blankets distributed to Indigenous peoples, residential schools, the segregation of black children in Ontario schools in the 1800s, the Komagata Maru, the turning away of non-white, non-Christian refugees during the Second World War, Saskatoon’s “starlight tours,” whereby city police dropped off intoxicated First Nations membersway out in the countryside to “walk it off,” even in deep winter … and the list goes on.

But just as the past few months have exposed other unpleasant truths about Canadian society, they have also revealed that racism resides just below Canadian society’s polite surface.

The recent attacks on people of Asian heritage in the Lower Mainland, the shooting of Chantel Moore, the beating of Chief Allan Adam and the death of Regis Korchinski Paquet belie the lies we tell ourselves. These are overt acts. They’re easier to spot and address.

The people whose attitudes have silently seeped into society for years rarely make the news. Those attitudes are much harder to expose and change. Whether we’re aware of and acknowledge our biases and prejudices or are oblivious to them, the harm we cause with them is just as real. Nobody has a right to make others feel unsafe and unwelcome in the communities they call home, the workplaces they are part of, the schools they attend, and the professions they contribute to.

Now that these uncomfortable truths are in the open, enough is enough — it’s time to deal with them and make a better world. For all peoples.

A common response is employers and management teams need to work toward identifying their own biases, before things can improve for Indigenous employees.

Bias doesn’t just affect Indigenous people — it affects us all. In some cases, we are oppressed and others the oppressors. It can be uncomfortable to look within ourselves to identify our own biases, but if we don’t, nothing will change.

article continues below

Biases comes up all the time. We all have them. We need to understand that some biases we carry knowingly, and others are drawn on subconsciously. Sometimes bias can be displayed loudly and other times its underlying.

“We all grow up here and we are bombarded by millions of messages, many of which are upheld by institutions and it’s impossible to not be influenced,” Janice Abbott, CEO of Atira Women’s Resource Society, explained, adding these messages can lead to racism, sexism, misogyny, ageism, ableism and heterosexism.

Like most flaws, it is easier to identify bias in others than in ourselves, but it’s important for everyone to take a moment and think about it even if it is uncomfortable.

“Too many of us are way too committed to the idea that we are awesome and unwilling to reflect on our own biases,” said Abbott. “And while we may not choose to admit we have biases, we mostly know they exist. Basically, we have to want to change and then understand it’s a life-long journey with stumbles, and so it requires our absolute commitment.”

I recently took an Indigenous cultural safety course that had a few exercises on stereotypes and bias that I found challenging. One of these exercises was a list of stereotypes I was asked to sort into categories of different demographics. I had a hard time and felt awful because I knew what stereotypes they wanted me to link with individual groups, but I couldn’t actually force my mouse to connect them together. Right under the exercise was a statement saying it was meant to be uncomfortable.

We can be biased of people for many reasons that have nothing to do with race. Bias can include making assumptions about age, education, income, family composition, gender and sexual orientation. Bias is a shortcut our brain takes to process the millions of messages we are exposed to that Abbott mentioned. Not all shortcuts are good, and I think it could make a world of difference if we take a second to pause and assess some of these shortcuts.

Our bias makes snap judgments on how people look and behave, often resulting in unfortunate outcomes.

A recent example is the woman in New York’s Central Park calling 911 on a man who was bird-watching and who asked her to follow the park’s guidelines and put her dog on leash. When the conversation turned to a verbal dispute, the man started filming and the woman called 911 stating: “There is an African American man threatening my life.”

The story is disheartening, because in the video it appears the woman is stating the man is African American because she is hoping to garner a specific type of reaction, which could be deadly for the man. The video has spread worldwide.

While this is an example from the United States, we need to remember things like this happen here, too. During my conversation with Abbott, she raised a very important point, one that I am not sure we as Canadians think about.

“Being Canadian, we are often told that we are less racist, kinder, more accepting than other people,” Abbott said, explaining this as a bias we are taught to be true. “So we think we’re good and we’re shocked when it turns out the Amy Coopers are Canadian. Who wants to be less bad at something that is evil anyway? Is that our bar?”

Abbott noted that bias begins in our homes, and as we get older, we are exposed to bias through our peer groups and institutions. If we acknowledge our own biases and address them, we can reduce the biases that we pass on to others.

Handout

Mark Grenier had barely begun working the door at Knoxville’s Tavern when he heard the stories – and warnings – about one of its owners, Matthew McKnight.

“Guys were telling me about McKnight and to watch out for him,” says Mr. Grenier, who worked as a bouncer at the popular Edmonton country bar from 2014 to 2016. “Like, ‘He’s going to do some greasy things, but there’s nothing really we can do about it because he’s McKnight.’”

Mr. Grenier was one of two former Knoxville’s security employees and several staff members who came forward to The Globe and Mail to talk about their experiences, in the hope it can help make change or protect others from being victimized in the future.

Mr. McKnight, 33, is currently serving an eight-year prison sentence for five sexual assaults committed against young women in the Edmonton bar scene between 2010 and 2016. At one point, he was facing 26 charges of sexual and physical assault against 21 women, but went to trial on 13 sexual assault charges involving 13 women. He was found not guilty in eight of the cases.

Reaction to the high-profile case has continued to roil in the community and on social media since the sentencing last month, with people questioning not only the verdicts and sentence, but also wondering how Mr. McKnight was able to assault so many women over such a lengthy period, and if anything could have been done to stop him sooner. In some cases, former co-workers, employees and even victims are asking whether they could have done more.

He said, they said: inside the trial of Matthew McKnight

How broken systems allowed Matthew McKnight to get away with sexual assault for years

“Everyone knew that Matt was doing something,” says Emily Lloyd, who started working as a “shooter and beer-tub girl” at Knoxville’s in 2013, the week after her 18th birthday. “But none of us knew how to prove it.”

Mr. McKnight was, at one time, an extremely powerful figure in the Edmonton bar scene, having made his way up from working on party buses into the management fold of Urban Sparq, a hospitality group that owned a series of popular bars around the city and was expanding across the country, billing itself as “one of North America’s premier hospitality companies.” His influence was never clearer than at Knoxville’s, which he helped build into one of the busiest nightclubs in the city and where he would ultimately become a part owner.

But as Mr. McKnight’s professional influence and success increased, so did stories and concerns about his inappropriate, questionable and, in some cases, assaultive behaviour toward women, including inside Knoxville’s.

“These guys don’t exist in a bubble,” says Kristin Raworth, a sexual assault survivor and advocate who has been tweeting and writing about the case. “They exist in a world that allows them to continue, that allows them to accelerate. Along the road there were probably hundreds of people who saw [problematic behaviour] and didn’t do anything.”

But while it’s clear many people wondered about Mr. McKnight’s interactions with women, knowing what to do about it wasn’t quite so simple. In the youthful bar scene at Knoxville’s, Mr. McKnight was older and significantly more established than most of those around him, and his position with management proved a powerful protection. It was also easy to brush past McKnight’s lewd and lecherous behaviour within the bar’s wildly sexualized atmosphere, and though stories circulated about more serious incidents, nobody knew anything for sure.

Ms. Lloyd says Mr. McKnight said inappropriate things to her on multiple occasions, and also touched and grabbed her. But she was young and inexperienced and, since he was an owner, she didn’t want to upset him and get fired. She says she was warned by several women to stay away from Mr. McKnight, and taking the warnings seriously, did her best to warn other women in return.

“I would go up to girls when I was passing and I would go, ‘Don’t take a drink from him,’” she says. “It was known, but I didn’t know what more I could do other than warn people, because I didn’t have any evidence. And what’s the word of an 18-year-old girl who’s been working there two months?”

In her testimony, the first woman Mr. McKnight was convicted of assaulting said she didn’t come forward after Mr. McKnight raped her in 2010 for the same reasons. She was 19 and new to working in the bar industry, and even then, Mr. McKnight was more prominent and powerful than her. (The night of her assault began at the Oil City Roadhouse, another Urban Sparq bar, in the location that would later become Knoxville’s.)

“I didn’t want to be this one person making these claims and have people pointing fingers at me for whatever reason,” testified the woman, whose name cannot be published because of a court-ordered publication ban. “I guess I didn’t think I was important. I didn’t think people would believe me.”

She said she only came forward later to back up the other women, because she felt “they were more significant than me.”

In the years that followed, Mr. McKnight’s power and influence continued to grow.

By the time he was arrested in August, 2016, Mr. McKnight was so central a figure at Knoxville’s that former employees describe a special VIP room known as “Matty’s playroom” that was guarded by security and off-limits to everyone except Mr. McKnight and the Edmonton Oilers. They say it had a beaded curtain, leather couches, its own fridge stocked with alcohol and, on one wall, a custom floor-to-ceiling mural of actor Phillip Seymour Hoffman.

“The biggest thing about the bar industry is that you can do whatever you want as long as you’re bringing people in,” says Mr. Grenier, who has since left the industry. “Matt brings people in. My job is to kick people out. So he’s going to win. In the bar industry, unfortunately, that’s how it works. If you are bringing people in, if you are making the club money, you win.”

In an e-mailed statement, the general manager of Knoxville’s at the time, Marty Melnychuk, declined knowledge of any incidents involving Mr. McKnight’s treatment of women at Knoxville’s, including multiple incidents of groping that were described to The Globe and Mail by other former employees.

“I am not aware of these in the bar that I ran,” wrote Mr. Melnychuk.

Mr. Melnychuk, who was also part of the Urban Sparq ownership group, says he does “not support Mr. McKnight’s personal actions or crimes whatsoever,” and now says he regrets writing a glowing letter of reference for Mr. McKnight’s sentencing, in which he describes Mr. McKnight as “one of the best people I have worked with in over a decade in the hospitality industry.”

“If anyone could possibly learn from this experience and go on to become a positive contributing member of the community, it’s Matt,” he wrote in the letter dated June 15, 2020, to the judge considering Mr. McKnight’s sentence. “I humbly ask that you give him a chance to do so.”

Mr. Melnychuk did not respond to further requests for comment.

The website for Urban Sparq is now blank, and it’s not clear whether the ownership group still exists. Knoxville’s is closed and out of business.

Andrew Cormier, who was at one time head of security at Knoxville’s, says he recalls at least a dozen confrontations and incidents between Mr. McKnight and female patrons. In each case, Mr. Cormier says security personnel were expected to kick the women out the bar, with no debate.

He says in one incident, in which Mr. McKnight dumped a milkshake over a woman’s head, there was a meeting with managers, and Mr. McKnight was forced to apologize to Mr. Cormier for causing problems for security. But in other cases, no follow-up occurred.

“He was a part owner, as we were told all the time, so we’d treat him as an owner. It’s his establishment, right? So if he needs you removed, you gotta go,” Mr. Cormier says. “Whether we thought it was legitimate or not, she was leaving. There was no talking to other managers, like, ‘Hey this is a bad call.’ There was none of that. It was just, no, they gotta go, and that was the end of it. We never talked about it ever again.”

He says he heard rumours about more serious incidents outside the club, but didn’t know it was anything more until the charges were laid. If he’d known, Mr. Cormier says, “I would have gone right to the cops.”

Mr. Grenier says he wishes he “dug a little deeper” into the rumours about Mr. McKnight’s behaviour or had spoken up more, even if it meant losing his job. He also wonders if he should have mentioned the rumours to the beat cops in the area, even though he didn’t have anything solid.

“I feel kind of sick about it,” Mr. Grenier says.

Both Mr. Cormier and Mr. Grenier say they’re speaking out in the hope something positive can come from it.

Among those looking back at what transpired is one of the women Mr. McKnight was accused of raping, who says she, too, is questioning whether she did enough. “What’s mainly on my mind is how to protect other women and make sure this never happens again, especially for as long as it did,” says the woman, who has been speaking and tweeting about the case but cannot be identified by The Globe and Mail because her name remains under a court-ordered publication ban.

The woman, who went forward to police after the other charges became public in 2016, says she “basically begged” the Crown not to proceed with her charge before the preliminary hearing, because she was suicidal at the time.

But she says she’s struggled with how the trial might have changed if her charge went ahead with the others, and her feelings are motivating her to speak out on behalf of victims who can’t or don’t want to address it publicly.

“I almost feel like it’s my responsibility to the other girls to say something. I just feel like I need to do it for them,” she says. “I think what I’m doing now is me desperately trying to make up for not doing more earlier.”

Nina Simone once answered, “I’ll tell you what freedom is to me. No fear.” Freedom from fear is the ultimate goal of Black people around the world. It is enshrined in The Universal Declaration of Human Rights. And yet, there is the fear that you feel on the streets as a Black person. The fear that the failure to “tone down your Blackness” will get you killed by the police, or neglected by a doctor, or denied housing by a landlord.

And then there is the fear that you feel every day on the job as a Black person – the fear that if you bring your full Black selves into the workplace, not only will you be rejected, but you will be fired. It is an insidious fear that leads to greater economic inequality, precarious employment and the continuation of systemic racism.

Story continues below advertisement

Over the past few weeks, Black employees and business owners across Canada have described the fears that come with bringing Blackness into their workplaces. It has not been a conversation everyone wants to have. As the CBC personality and cultural commentator Amanda Parris recently wrote: “If history has taught us anything, it’s that Canadian institutions and companies do not welcome the truth when it comes to the realities of systemic racism. They often do one of two things in response: 1) they systematically shut down those who disrupt the status quo, or 2) they symbolically acquiesce, but make only surface-level changes.”

Fortunately, this has not been my experience at OCAD University, where I am the first Black, and Black female, dean of a faculty of design – not just at OCAD U, but anywhere. And rather than seeing this anomaly as an example of tokenism – or supertokenism, as the utility of my exceptional talents are designed to overcome the institutional aversion to my presence as a Black cis-gendered woman within systems of white supremacy – what is happening at OCAD University is a possible model for other institutions to mimic to ensure enough Black representation that people feel free to be Black.

OCAD University is achieving a critical mass of Black employees at effective levels to transform the institution. It’s not just talk, but action. Here’s how to do it: Like OCAD U, institutions need to think about hiring Black employees in “sets of three” and entrusting them with power at the top level, influence in the middle level and growth at the entry level.

My school recently announced a successful Black Cluster Hire of five full-time Black faculty in Design – its first in 144 years, which is both thrilling and shameful. This was achievable because OCAD U had established critical mass in the sets of three. At the entry level, Black students consistently advocated for faculty who represented their lived experiences so that they could grow. At the middle level, professors, such as Lillian Allen and Andrea Fatona, wielded great influence on the institution through their activism and scholarship. They also served on the hiring committees to influence decisions, including the one to hire me. It took 144 years because the institution needed someone at the top with power. Nearly four years ago, I was hired as a (Black) dean with the real power to determine and negotiate faculty budgets, write position descriptions, support Black community initiatives and redesign the qualifications standards to account for systemic exclusion.

Many big and small freedoms in being Black are possible because we have built critical mass by turning five full-time Black faculty into 10. This also adds to our complement of Black administrative staff, who are represented in the president’s and provost’s offices, within facilities, the library, IT and student services.

Another positive development was the Speak to Power student forums we held not long ago. Black students overcame their fears to share with the new president, Ana Serrano, and the leadership team at OCAD U all the ways in which the institution has failed them by not supporting their lived experiences of Blackness in their education.

What do I mean by “big and small freedoms in being Black?” Those freedoms manifest themselves in wearing our hair in locs or braids, dressing in Kente cloth or Trinidadian tricolours, bringing jollof or patties to a potluck, and openly saying Black lives matter and having colleagues agree.

Many institutions have declared the intent to hire more Black employees. These declarations are welcome, but intention is just the first step. Black employees must be hired in numbers – think in multiple sets of three – and entrusted with power, influence and growth. Companies and institutions that do this will only benefit. We perform miracles when free from the fear to be Black.

NewLeaf began service in July 2016 and suspended it late that year. Flair purchased NewLeaf in mid-2017.

Flair also initiated a seasonal service from Victoria to Edmonton in 2018.

The airline’s base fare pays for a seat. Victoria passengers heading to Fort McMurray, for example, would pay $49 to get to Vancouver, and then another $79 for the leg to Fort McMurray.

Passengers can pay more for options, such as a middle seat for social-distancing and checked luggage.

Flair said safety during the pandemic is its highest priority. Passengers must have masks, answer a health-check questionnaire and have their temperatures taken prior to boarding. Enhanced aircraft disinfecting measures and the use of HEPA filters will remain in effect for the foreseeable future, the airline said.

The only routes out of western gateways between Nov. 1 and April 30 will be from Vancouver to Toronto and Montreal, as well as some connecting flights to Europe via Toronto.

Would-be passengers will automatically receive a full refund rather than the company credit that has previously been offered for flights cancelled due to the COVID-19 crisis, Transat said.

""Since the current situation does not allow us to foresee resuming routes from Western Canada in the near future and there will therefore be no direct flight options to use vouchers with Air Transat from their location, customers impacted by cancellations resulting from this suspension will receive a refund in the amount on file,"" Transat spokeswoman Marie-Christine Pouliot said in an email.

""For other locations, where more options exist, we have offered more flexibility by relaxing our travel credit policy. They are now fully transferable and have no expiry date.""

Transat cited ""the many challenges"" facing the airline industry, which revolve around a pandemic that shut down borders and grounded fleets before traffic slowly starting to pick up in the summer, though not enough to revive the critical crossborder tourism or business travel markets. The Montreal-based carrier's first flight in four months took off last week.

Transat and other Canadian airlines have refused to reimburse most customers whose flights were cancelled as a result of the coronavirus.

Transat, Air Canada and WestJet Airlines Ltd. have all said their stance on refunds aligns with federal regulations and guidance posted over the past five months by the Canadian Transportation Agency (CTA).

Legal precedent, contract law suggest that's not the case, said passenger rights advocate Gabor Lukacs, noting ""the universal principal across Canada"" that customers should be reimbursed for services never rendered.

""Air Transat must refund all passengers whose flights were cancelled, regardless of their point of departure or the reason for the cancellation,"" Lukacs said, citing a CTA decision from 2004 concerning Transat as well as the carrier's own contract of carriage.

The company's crossborder tariff — a contract between airline and passenger — states that Transat ""will refund the unused ticket"" in the event of overbooking or cancellation by the airline.

Air Canada quietly changed its refund policy in June to allow some customers with cancelled flight tickets to recoup their cash — but not passengers whose trips originated in Canada.

Travellers with flights originating in the European Union, Switzerland or Iceland are entitled to receive a refund, the airline said, but passengers who were slated to fly one-way or round-trip from Canada to Europe are not.

WestJet changed its policy to reimburse customers on flights between the U.S. and Canada that were cancelled due to COVID-19 after ""carefully monitoring the regulatory frameworks"" across jurisdictions.

The country's three biggest airlines have cancelled tens of thousands of flights since late March. Air Canada saw capacity dip by 95 per cent in the spring after it lost more than $1 billion in the first quarter and projects passenger levels will not return to 2019 levels for at least three years.

Transat told The Canadian Press last week it will delay the closing deadline of its takeover by Air Canada, pushing it back by one month until Aug. 27 as European regulators and federal cabinet members mull how the $720-million acquisition will affect competition.

The Air Passenger Rights organization sought leave to appeal Monday a Federal Court of Appeal decision that dismissed the group's attempt for an injunction compelling the Canadian Transportation Agency to remove a post about refunds from its website temporarily while a broader case about the statement's validity is ongoing.

The CTA said in March that airlines have the right to issue travel credits instead of a refund for cancelled trips in the ""current context,"" though the agency later clarified that the online statement was ""not a binding decision.""

Canadian airlines have generally offered credit valid for two years or more but avoided offering reimbursement to customers whose flights were called off because of the coronavirus crisis, with carriers citing the agency's stance in response to consumer complaints and analyst questions.

Air Passenger Rights founder Gabor Lukacs says the CTA's statements misled travellers about their right to a refund and contradict the quasi-judicial body's previous decisions.

""If people believe they have no right to a refund, they will just not pursue it,"" he said in an interview.

""This case is about whether a public body can mislead the public without facing some kind of judicial scrutiny.""

Some passengers may not be able to fly in the next two years for health or financial reasons, advocates say. Meanwhile, the airfare they paid amounts to a no-interest loan to airlines.

The pandemic has devastated the airline industry, with billions of dollars in losses for Canadian carriers amid grounded flights and tight international borders.

In contrast to Canadian authorities, the European Commission and the U.S. Department of Transportation have required airlines to refund passengers. The U.S. and European countries including France and Germany have also offered billions in financial relief to struggling carriers, however, while Ottawa has provided no industry-specific bailout to airlines.

Since February, passengers have filed a handful of proposed class-action lawsuits and three petitions garnering more than 109,000 signatures that call for customer reimbursement.

The CTA did not respond to requests for comment Tuesday.

In March, the agency said passengers ""should not simply be out-of-pocket for the cost of cancelled flights,"" but also stated that airlines facing a plunge in revenues and customer volumes ""should not be expected to take steps that could threaten their economic viability.""

""The CTA believes that, generally speaking, an appropriate approach in the current context could be for airlines to provide affected passengers with vouchers or credits for future travel, as long as these vouchers or credits do not expire in an unreasonably short period of time (24 months would be considered reasonable in most cases),"" it said on March 25.

The online statement is not an official CTA decision — these are issued periodically on complaints brought before the body — but Lukacs argues it amounts to an unsolicited advance ruling on how the agency will treat passenger complaints, and thus deters them.

Responses by officials in the airline industry and government suggest the post is viewed authoritatively.

On a conference call Friday, Air Canada CEO Calin Rovinescu told analysts that ""the CTA spoke clearly on the topic, and at this point...I've got no reason to believe that they'll change that.""

Transport Minister Marc Garneau has also framed the online post as an authoritative ruling.

""The Canadian Transportation Agency has ruled on this issue and has ruled that, in the present circumstances and in a non-binding way, it is acceptable for airlines to offer credits for up to two years,"" Garneau told the special all-party COVID-19 committee on May 28.

Customer reimbursement for services that were never rendered is a fundamental principle of consumer protection legislation across multiple provinces, Lukacs said.

The CTA's statement touting travel credit as an alternative has served to ""undermine"" that right, the court submission says, particularly since some credit card and insurance companies have cited the statement as a reason ""to deny policy coverage for actual travel disruptions,"" the court submission says.

The Supreme Court does not automatically hear appeals and instead issues a written decision, usually within one to three months, on whether it will consider a case.

Air Passenger Rights' leave to appeal relates to the Federal Court of Appeal's dismissal of its request for an injunction against the CTA while the case over the travel credits statement is ongoing.

Air Passenger Rights states that the appeal court's test to determine eligibility for such an injunction is too stringent, and could affect not only interprovincial transportation but all areas of federal law, including immigration and refugees, intellectual property law and Indigenous claims.

While the majority of B.C’s new cases have been reported in people under the age of 40 – many in the 20 to 29 demographic – the province is still seeing cases from air travel, Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said during Thursday’s media briefing.

“We do continue to have introductions (of COVID-19) into the province from international travel,” she said.

“Some of these are temporary foreign workers, who have come in from countries, particularly Mexico, and a number of them have become ill while in quarantine.”

Henry added that the province has been providing quarantine support to all of the temporary foreign workers coming into B.C. for two weeks, prior to them going to work on farms.

Cases also continue to be linked to Canadians returning from abroad.

“As well, we continue to have Canadians returning from other places around the world, including recently, a number of people from India, from the U.S. and we have had a number of cases related to that as well.”

It will eliminate the carrier surcharge — which varies from less than $25 to the high hundreds — on flights purchased with points, though a $39 fee applies for trips operated by Air Canada's partner airlines.

Members will also be able to share points with up to eight friends and family members, combining them in a pool anyone in the group may put toward a trip.

The airline hopes the relaunch, planned after it reacquired the rewards program from Aimia Inc. in January 2019, will add another two million members before 2024 to the five million-plus who already hold Aeroplan cards.

The new program, based in part on feedback from thousands of consumers, ""is more important than ever as airlines compete to earn and retain customer loyalty in a rapidly changing environment,"" CEO Calin Rovinescu said in a statement Tuesday.

Passenger revenues at the Montreal-based airline dropped by 95 per cent year over year in its second quarter, prompting 20,000 layoffs as the airline burned through $19 million of cash per day amid border closures and a collapse in demand stemming from the coronavirus.

Air Canada made last-minute tweaks to the rewards revamp in response to the outbreak, prioritizing partnerships with the Uber Eats app and other companies yet to be announced, said Mark Nasr, head of loyalty and e-commerce at the company.

""We did a lot of soul-searching as COVID-19 developed,"" Nasr said. ""We really accelerated these 'every day' partnerships.""

The points that members earn on purchases via eligible retail, hotel and credit card partners will count toward to the tally required to reach the lowest rung of ""elite status"" — 25,000 kilometres of air travel in a year.

For example, an Uber Eats purchase of $50 would yield 100 points for Aeroplan members, and another 50 to 75 points if it was made through a TD Aeroplan Visa card.

Frequent travellers in one of Aeroplan's five elite categories will be able to share benefits such as lounge access and priority boarding with friends and family, even if they are not flying together.

Current Aeroplan members will keep their account numbers and Aeroplan miles will be converted to points on a one-for-one basis, Air Canada said.

The new system will base the number of points earned for a given flight on airfare rather than distance, which currently provides the baseline. That means the points gap between a flight to Asia and a flight across the country will likely narrow, since the difference in distance is often greater than the difference in price.

Meanwhile the new, more flexible pricing model — Air Canada has posted a ""points predictor"" tool on its website — also means more popular routes and times will cost more points than under the current fixed system, while off-peak times and less popular routes will be cheaper, said National Bank analyst Cameron Doerksen.

""We see this as margin-enhancing for Air Canada as it will be able to effectively charge market prices for rewards seats for more popular flights. In addition, it will allow the airline to enhance load factors on less popular flights,"" Doerksen said in a research note.

A flight between Toronto and Vancouver will cost between 25,000 and 35,000 points, according to the points predictor.

The renewed focus on consumer spending — TD announced Tuesday a ""refreshed suite"" of Aeroplan Visa credit cards, set to launch Nov. 8 — expands the loyalty program's potential appeal well beyond the jet set.

""The cards are what drives massive amounts of value. If Bob or Betty don't travel much by air, they can still have a TD or a CIBC or Amex credit card and they can make points on the program,"" said Robert Kokonis, president of Toronto-based consulting firm AirTrav Inc.

""There's all that day-to-day household spending that you can put onto the card that really generates points for the member and through to the bottom line of Aeroplan and then Air Canada.""

The added incentive to plastic comes as a welcome change for Air Canada credit card partners Toronto-Dominion Bank, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Visa and American Express.

Air Canada has said credit card penetration for so-called elite flyers is only 38 per cent versus about 50 per cent for most U.S. airlines.

TD and CIBC paid a total of $1.2 billion to help offset the hefty points liability, acquisition price and other working capital and pension assumptions for Air Canada.

When asked by the Richmond News, a spokesperson for the Provincial Health Services Authority, which oversees the BCCDC, said the agency believes the discrepancy likely occurred because the passengers who contracted the virus aren’t B.C. residents, and that “the province or territory in which these cases reside notified the Public Health Agency of Canada about the exposure, but not the BCCDC.”

“BCCDC staff are connecting with the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) to ask that they be notified whenever PHAC becomes aware of an exposure on a flight with an origin or destination in B.C. to prevent this situation from occurring in the future,"" said spokesperson Jane Campbell in an emailed statement.

Typically, said Campbell, flights where exposures may have occurred are identified by the province or territory that’s managing the case during its investigation and contact tracing.

BCCDC adds flights to its public exposures webpage once they are identified as health officials investigate the COVID-19 case, or when the agency is alerted to an exposure on a flight by another province or territory.",354,0.4817476081354179,business

In April, 2019, a Sunwing airliner was on approach into Toronto’s Pearson International Airport when it was ordered by air traffic control operators to climb in altitude because an unknown aircraft had entered into its flight path. The Sunwing pilots reported that the “target appeared momentarily to them then disappeared.” Two months later, in June, an airliner on final approach to the St. Hubert airport near Montreal was notified by air traffic control of “unidentified traffic.” The airliner’s collision avoidance system confirmed the object was roughly 3.5 nautical miles ahead of the aircraft and climbing in altitude to 2,700 feet. The pilots eventually made visual contact as the object continued to gain altitude and crossed into controlled airspace without radio contact or clearance from air traffic control. A month later, air traffic controllers in Langley, B.C., reported to Transport Canada that “radar targets were coasting in and out to the Northwest (NW) of the airport” and “Random targets popping up, radar tags swapping, targets jumping to random locations.”

The recently released 2019 Canadian UFO Survey indicates Canadians see about two or three unidentified flying objects a day, and while many will laugh UFOs off as being a silly fringe delusion, several sighting events reported to Transport Canada present in the 2019 survey, such as those outlined above, involve pilots coming into close proximity with unknown aerial objects, and indicate a clear risk to air safety. While the U.S. government is actively investigating UFO reports and Congress is calling for more public oversight on unknown aerial incursions, the Canadian government seems to be doing nothing.

It is easy to dismiss UFOs, or as they are called today, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP). Nearly a century of mass media has turned a curious phenomenon into a tinfoil hat-wearing enterprise filled with extraterrestrials, martian invasions and far-future technology. It is unlikely that pilots are being harassed by pop culture aliens in flying saucers. However, our southern neighbours seem to be concerned with the fact that something is zipping around North American airspace and no one seems to know how to deal with it.

A recent congressional report indicates that the U.S. Office of Naval Intelligence has an active task force that investigates incursions of UAP into U.S. airspace. Recently, Senator Marco Rubio, who chairs the Senate intelligence committee, introduced a congressional bill giving this intelligence-gathering operation 180 days to disclose its findings regarding these incursions. The Americans seem to consider this an important issue that needs more attention.

Canadian science writer and researcher Chris Rutkowski, who diligently collects nearly all of Canada’s UAP reports from civilian research organizations and those reported to Transport Canada, told me that Canada is experiencing a “possible public safety issue.” While Canada has had 849 reports in 2019, somewhat lower than the usual yearly average, Mr. Rutkowski disclosed that a more in-depth look into Transport Canada’s Civil Aviation Daily Occurrence Reporting System, known as CADORS, seems to portray that pilots have been reporting unknown objects frequently within Canadian airspace for decades. While many of those sightings can be attributed to misidentification or commercial drones and quadcopters, some reports defy prosaic phenomena.

One 2012 air incident report indicates that a Chinese Eastern Airlines Airbus was flying over Alberta when the pilot spotted an unknown object 40 nautical miles to the south, at 41,000 feet. Most commercial drones cannot even get close to that kind of altitude. Another incident in 2015 occurred over Saskatoon’s international airport, where the pilot notified air traffic control that they witnessed a bright white light above their aircraft at roughly 34,000 feet. Two flight attendants were injured in 2016 when a Porter flight landing in Toronto nearly collided with an unknown object over Lake Ontario at 9,000 feet. The Transportation Safety Board was unable to identify what caused the incident. In 2019, several aircraft over the vicinity of Medicine Hat reported multiple unidentified objects above their aircraft. In September, 2019, at roughly 2:00 p.m. EST, an unidentified aircraft buzzed the Kitchener/Waterloo radar control zone at 2,100 feet without clearance. Several other similar cases have occurred over the past decade. These incidents beg an important question: What is the Canadian government doing about them? Seemingly, very little.

“We have no idea if UFO reports are investigated,” explained Mr. Rutkowski. Transport Canada investigates air incidents, such as near misses or crashes. However, when pilots witness unknown aerial objects and radar operators are unable to identify them, Transport Canada told me that cases such as these are considered “only advisory” and “not investigated.” Transport Canada explained that all sightings or encounters concerning unknown aircraft are under the jurisdiction of Nav Canada.

When pilots witness “unidentified flying objects,” they are requested to make “aviation occurrence” reports to the regional Flight Information Centre in “the interests of national security,” according to regulations published by Nav Canada, a private non-profit organization that handles all Canadian air navigation services. These reports are known as “Communication Instructions for Reporting Vital Intelligence Sightings.” In an e-mail, Nav Canada’s media relations manager Brian Boudreau said examples would include “sightings of aircraft violating operating parameters, unidentified aircraft, unauthorized aircraft or any activity that may impact flight safety or pose a security threat.”

Depending on the details of the incident, Nav Canada may send a report to the Department of National Defence, the North American Aerospace Defence Command (NORAD), Transport Canada or the American Federal Aviation Administration.

A spokesperson from the Department of National Defence said all reports of unknown aerial vehicles are reported via Nav Canada’s procedure, including sighting reports made by military personnel. In a dizzying turn of double-speak, although Nav Canada collects UFO reports to assess potential security threats, an e-mail from the DND read:

""We wouldn't really comment on speculative matters such as this. The Canadian Armed Forces concerns itself with credible threats, and this falls outside the scope of our operations.""

In an attempt to gain more answers, this journalist filed a formal Access to Information Request concerning access to all reports involving “incursions made by foreign unknown aircraft” into Canadian airspace for the past two decades. “Speculative matters” aside, the DND responded that it “neither confirms or denies records exist …” and that “if documentation did exist, it is exempted in its entirety” from Access to Information Requests owing to national defence.

“The government was mostly uninterested in UFOs; they really wanted the whole thing just to go away,” explained Matthew Hayes in an interview. Dr. Hayes is a filmmaker and researcher whose 2019 PhD dissertation, “A History of Canada’s UFO Investigation, 1950-1995,” stated that while some individuals within the government take the issue seriously, “most efforts were put toward debunking the subject.”

Dr. Hayes was not surprised by the military’s response to my UAP question. In 2017, a DND spokesperson sent the CBC an image of a flying saucer when responding to their press query concerning the phenomenon.

“There were many attempts over the years and decades to ignore the UFO phenomenon and requests for information about UFOs, as something outside the scope of the department or agency,” Dr. Hayes stated.

The U.S. military has publicly admitted that unknown aerial objects are making incursions into sovereign airspace. In 2017, begrudgingly, it was forced to provide three pieces of video footage of unknown objects filmed by naval aviators piloting F-18 Super Hornets. They were attempting, albeit unsuccessfully, to engage these aircraft. The U.S. Navy has also changed its policies for its personnel and is moving to reduce the stigma around reporting sightings of unidentified aerial phenomena. Jokes over aliens and flying saucers do not seem to be on their minds when their best pilots and aircraft cannot keep up with whatever these unidentified aircraft are. The concern is far more severe. American politicians and intelligence experts have publicly expressed their opinions that a foreign adversary may have developed a superior system of propulsion or technology that can trick complicated radar and video recording systems. Alternatively, this phenomenon may be something else entirely. Regardless, the United States is taking this issue seriously. Looking into the various assortment of reports present in the CADORS flight safety system indicates Canada ought to take it seriously as well.

“In the past, the Canadian government has certainly tried to take its lead from the U.S. when it comes to UFO information,” Dr. Hayes explained. “There are several documented instances of minutes from committee meetings, or interdepartmental memos, of Canadian officials uncertain about what to do, and deciding to wait to see what the Americans do.”

Mr. Rutkowski said that while Canada has seen a reduction in sightings in 2019, 2020 has seen a dramatic increase in the first few months. While the various Canadian governmental agencies attempt to make light of unidentified aerial phenomena, the data indicate this issue is not going away. Perhaps now that the U.S. is beginning to look at the issue of UAP more seriously, Canada will follow suit. Governments and militaries are not comfortable with unknowns. They are potential threats to a nation. When the role of the government and the military is to protect that nation, pretending something does not exist is more politically palatable than admitting there has been an intelligence failure.

That being said, if anything can be drawn from the Department of National Defence’s response to inquiries regarding this subject, perhaps they do not consider the implications of unknown aircraft making incursions into Canadian airspace as being a “credible threat.”

In a letter to Transport Minister Marc Garneau, the B.C. government noted the information the province has received from airlines is ""not necessarily complete and is sometimes unusable.""

B.C. Transport Minister Claire Trevena said the data often includes the names of travel agencies that booked flights, a frequent flyer number, or the person who booked the ticket but not necessarily the name and contact information of the person who actually flew on the plane.

She urged the government to ""ensure the data gathered is usable and traces back to the individual traveller directly,"" rather than simply listing flights with a positive COVID-19 case.

""We have come so far together as a country with much success to curb the spread of COVID-19,"" reads the letter. A copy was provided to The Canadian Press.

""As we restart our economy, however, we want to ensure all passengers and communities remain safe and that nobody is put at risk due to any oversight.""

Garneau and Trevena spoke on Wednesday afternoon, his spokeswoman said. Livia Belcea said in an email that Garneau committed to create a way for airlines to share passenger data to trace ""individuals who may have been exposed to COVID 19 while on a domestic flight.""

The Public Health Agency of Canada already requires airlines to provide information on travellers arriving on international flights, who are subject to strict quarantine rules, but it's domestic flights where issues have arisen.

The divide in talks between Ottawa and the airlines appears to fall along whether phone numbers or email addresses are enough, or if residential addresses, for instance, should also be part of any handover.

Mike McNaney, president of the National Airlines Council of Canada, said in a statement that flight information is provided when requested, ""per established procedures for communicable diseases"" and usually in less than 24 hours.

""Our members are fully committed to protecting public safety,"" the statement said.

Public health officials tried to trace contacts for every person early on in the pandemic, but those efforts slowed as people were ordered to stay home or quarantine, and as travel dropped.

Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, said Tuesday there could be improvements to the data that airlines provide, noting flight manifests lack all sorts of details that make it difficult to reach people in certain seats.

Tam also said there hasn't been a confirmed case of in-flight transmission.

""Very few of our cases actually come from travellers at the moment,"" she said. ""But now that our case numbers have gone down, there's been more interest in why don't we follow some of these planes and see if there's been any contact at all that's been exposed or transmitted.""

The federal health agency she leads referred further questions to Transport Canada, which had previously referred questions to the health agency.

Air operators have to record the names of everyone on board an aircraft, but there is no federal requirement that they submit passenger manifests to Transport Canada, said Belcea.

NDP transport critic Niki Ashton said the federal government needs to take a harder line on carriers to provide the necessary information for contact tracing.

""Airlines should be making sure that accurate information is being shared as soon as possible and it shouldn't be up to them to pick and choose how they do it,"" she said. ""It should be the federal government mandating them.""

Orville Peck was at the Grammy telecast earlier this year when a woman yelled his name during a commercial break. Peck turned around to see none other than Shania Twain coming his way. The country music icon got to Peck’s seat, hoisted him in her arms and hugged him. She’s a fan – not nearly the only one.

Peck stands out in the country music crowd. The crooner, with a moody baritone, substantial indie-music cred and a storyteller’s stone-lonesome heart, is mysterious, gay and never appears in public without his trademark tassled masks. Nowadays everyone and their dog is wearing a mask, but nobody pulls it off with the panache of the Canadian balladeer now based in Los Angeles.

Following up on the out-of-nowhere success of his 2019 debut album, Pony, Peck releases a new EP on Friday, which comes with a duet with his heroine/admirer Twain. The album is ironically called Show Pony, a term used to describe a person who appears to perform well, but has no actual ability. By phone, Peck spoke to The Globe and Mail about persons, personas and the twain they meet, and the Twain he met.

Orville Peck, what’s your deal?

I’m a country and western artist who likes to sing songs about myself with the sincerity that is required in the genre and in a way that is perceived as new and different and that maybe challenges the status quo.

And what about the fancy masks you wear? Do you wear them to remove yourself from the equation, so as to let the songs stand on their own?

That’s one of the byproducts, for sure. It’s not the main intention though. What I love about country music is that it is very much at the crossroads of sincerity and performance. I think that’s a beautiful space to create art in. You can be as bold and dramatic and theatrical as you want, but you get away with it because all of it is steeped in sincerity. I like to work from that place.

But with the performative aspects, don’t you risk people questioning your sincerity?

I’ve gotten questions like that. But at the end of the day it isn’t my job to answer that for people. I spend all my effort trying to make art that I think I would enjoy and that I can feel proud of, because it’s from a genuine place. I can’t also worry whether other people see that or not. That’s a battle you’re probably going to lose at some point.

Any other intentions with your look?

I like things that are not just spoon-fed to me. I grew up loving artists like David Bowie and Freddie Mercury and Elton John. These are prolific artists who created profound lyrics and songs, but also looked like they were from outer space. You can do both those things.

Clearly one person who doesn’t question your sincerity is Shania Twain, who you duet with on Legends Never Die on your new EP Show Pony. How did that come together?

I’d heard that she was a fan of mine. My first reaction was that I didn’t think that was possible. Maybe because I’m a bit of a cynic. But if she even knew I existed, I had the inspiration to write a song written off what I thought was a rumour that she liked me. So, I wrote it and sent it off to her management.

Shania must get a dozen of such requests a day, though.

Right. We went back and forth on it with her management for awhile, and it felt like it wouldn’t be possible. But then I met her at the Grammys and she told me how much she loved me and how much she loved my last album and my voice and how much she loved the song I wrote for her. Two months or so later, we were sitting at her ranch in Las Vegas riding her horses and working on the song together. She was actually the last person I hung out with before the quarantine started.

So many collaborations are done remotely. It’s quite something that you got to do it in person.

I’m such a fan of collaborations. I love that Shania and I got to have what I felt like was a very thrilling, adventurous road to this song. It felt very much in keeping with the spirit of the collaborations that are so rich in the history of country music.

This interview has been condensed and edited.

Bruce Cockburn and jazz singer Holly Cole are some of the Canadians icons headlining the schedule for the Royal Conservatory of Music this fall and winter and both are artists who have enjoyed national and international acclaim.

The Royal Conservatory, a “music education institution” founded on the principle that personal growth is channelled through the arts, has alumni of such renowned names as Oscar Peterson, Glenn Gould, Sarah McLachlan, Diana Krall, Gordon Lightfoot, k.d. lang and Cockburn.

Mervon Mehta, executive director of performing arts at The Royal Conservatory, says blending in Canadian icons is vital to their programming since they opened Koerner Hall 10 years ago. The venue showcases top-flight artists from across the jazz, classical, world music, folk and pop genres.

“Quite naturally, many have been Canadian,” Mehta says. This season the Royal Conservatory has 100 concerts and 51 of those feature Canadian artists.

That tells you everything about the demand. Canadian audiences take pride in Canadian artistic talent, but won’t go just because it’s the patriotic thing to do.

“Canadian musicians can go toe-to-toe with musicians from around the world in any genre,” Mehta says. “We proudly present them without caveat and without quotas. We also love to introduce our audiences to newer artists who we think show promise and need a larger platform.”

Of the Canadian headliners for the coming season three are already sold out (Cockburn, Cole and Adrianne Pieczonka) and several others are close (Karina Gauvin, Toronto Sings the Breithaupt Brothers, Amici Ensemble with Russell Braun, Louis Lortie, Oscar Peterson’s Africa, Angela Hewitt and Jan Lisiecki).

Cockburn plays Oct. 19 and Cole plays Dec. 14.

In Brampton, the Rose Theatre has a lineup this fall featuring Canadian legend Burton Cummings, rock quartet Sloan and a tribute to the late, great Gord Downie of The Tragically Hip.

Formed in Halifax in 1991, Sloan, now based in Toronto, just released its 12th studio album. A CBC Critics’ Poll had the Juno Award-winning band as one of Canada’s top bands of all time. Sloan plays on Oct. 10.

It’s been almost two years since Downie, the former frontman of The Tragically Hip, died, and Canada lost one of its true music icons. One of his legacies was his work on the reconciliation with Canada’s First Peoples.

The tribute concert at The Rose on Oct. 16 will feature a group of Canadian artists, in collaboration with The Gord Downie & Chanie Wenjack Fund, promoting awareness and education about the issue and celebrating Downie, his music and legacy. (Gord’s Legacy will also be performed on Oct. 18 at First Ontario Performing Arts Centre and at the Burlington Performing Arts Centre on Oct. 17.)

Cummings needs no introduction – the legendary singer, songwriter and recording artist was with Canada’s original rock ‘n’ roll superstars, The Guess Who, and then followed that with a long solo career featuring dozens of hit singles and albums. His Up Close and Alone show runs at The Rose on Nov. 28.

There is no shortage of Canadian talent around the province this fall and winter. Other notable concerts include: award-winning Canadian singer-songwriter Loreena McKennitt at Roy Thomson Hall on Nov. 1; Avril Lavigne plays TO Live’s Meridian Hall (formerly the Sony Centre) on Oct. 6; Jann Arden plays Casino Rama Resort on Dec. 7; Celine Dion is at Scotiabank Theatre on Dec. 9; and Blue Rodeo is at the Barrie Molson Centre on Dec. 29.

The idea that art imitates life has been around for centuries and there’s a good reason for it.

Real life stories resonate with an audience, grabbing their emotions, whether it be a theatre production, musical performance, art piece or a photographic exhibition.

“Those who don’t remember history are doomed to repeat it,” says Clyde Wagner, president and chief executive officer of TO Live, which is putting on the major exhibition Mandela.

“That’s critical at this time, particularly here in North America as I think we see value-based movements in your marketplace. When we were approached by the Canadian Human Rights Museum … it didn’t take us five seconds to say yeah we would like to do [the exhibition],” Wagner says.

“The reason we want to do it is because it’s germane to our mandate, which is to reflect the city on the stage but also to create public dialogue around important topics of the day, and the topic of equality, diversity and human rights is one that’s being questioned I find.”

A rich sensory experience of imagery, soundscape, digital media and objects, Mandela explores Nelson Mandela’s fight for justice and human dignity in South Africa. Among the exhibition’s many dramatic visual features and original artifacts is a replica of Mandela's eight-foot by seven-foot prison cell.

Previously known as Civic Theatres Toronto, TO Live is one of Canada’s largest multi-arts organizations, operating three iconic venues and presenting a full range of performing arts, theatrical and concert events in both downtown and uptown Toronto at Meridian Hall (formerly the Sony Centre for the Performing Arts), St. Lawrence Centre for the Arts and the Meridian Arts Centre (formerly the Toronto Centre for the Arts).

“Art or the creative arts in any format – visual arts, music, dance, theatre, architecture, design all of these things – have a way to inspire people and engage with the public that is both able to be accepted by a broad audience but also emotionally connected to a topic,” Wagner says.

“Great art can touch people whether it has a social message or not. If it has a social message like the exhibition … then it also falls into a category of things that we’re inspired to do.”

Andrey Tarasiuk is artistic director at Pleiades Theatre, which is presenting Besbouss: An Autopsy of a Revolt, the English-language premiere of a story inspired by the headlines and running in November. It’s based on the Arab Spring uprisings in Tunisia that were triggered by the self-immolation of a street vendor named Mohamed Bouazizi in 2010.

“For me, essential to this play is it really sort of sits in a place where it asks the question: ‘Can one person make a difference?’ … The play is the starting point for a conversation is how I view this production,” he says.

“The issues don’t escape us. I think it behooves artists to examine global events and the impact of those global events on all of us and to be fearless in posing questions. Why is this happening? And what are the consequences? How do these events impact on our lives? These are critical and imperative questions that need to be responded to by artists. I feel very strongly about that and artists are up to that task,” Tarasiuk adds.

Majdi Bou-Matar, director of Besbouss, says art tells stories by taking historical events and figures as source material but then making it more relevant way to audiences today.

“Real events in history is material out there that belongs to anyone. The main thing is how do we use those events as a tool to tell our stories in the here and now,” he says.

If one had to boil down what audiences will get out of this upcoming season at Young People’s Theatre, it’s this, says artistic director Allen MacInnis: the Seven Ancestral Teachings.

Rooted deep in Anishinaabe culture, they are respect, humility, bravery, honesty, love, wisdom and truth, and act as signposts by which to live and work well. Each of this year’s productions in YPT’s 2019/2020 season explores one or more of these seven teachings.

“I think we live in a time when we need to think about what makes us do what we do. How do we do better? And thinking about these things doesn’t have to be done in a full or overly serious way. Sometimes it’s in something entertaining and fun and delightful that we realize what’s good in the world and in us,” MacInnis says.

David Lipnowski/The Globe and Mail

The Canadian Museum for Human Rights, embroiled in controversy over allegations of a racist, toxic workplace, has named a new president and chief executive officer.

Human rights lawyer Isha Khan, former executive director and senior counsel for the Manitoba Human Rights Commission, will begin in the position next week. Khan, 46, has no museum experience, but has worked for years as an advocate for human rights, working with organizational change and workplace culture. Most recently, she was appointed by the Minister of Public Safety to co-ordinate a review of conditions in federal penitentiaries.

She joins the museum at a difficult time. An independent report released last week found that racism is “pervasive and systemic” within the federal museum. The third-party investigation was ordered after public allegations of racism, censorship (suppressing the museum’s LGBTQ content), and inaction on the part of management in dealing with allegations of sexual harassment.

Story continues below advertisement

“I think that dismantling systemic racism, discrimination, oppression has to be very deliberate and thoughtful work,” Khan said in an interview on Monday, shortly after Canadian Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault announced her appointment. The announcement indicated she will take “decisive action for change” and ensure the museum is diverse and welcoming for all employees.

In the interview, Khan said discrimination, abuse and harassment will not be tolerated. “I’m going to work with the staff to bring about some change within the walls and build the trust of the community around us.”

Khan was born and raised in Winnipeg, where she earned her undergraduate degree before studying law at the University of Victoria. She has lived and worked in Calgary, and has been back in Winnipeg since 2007. She is the board chair of the United Way of Greater Winnipeg and a founder of the Canadian Council of Muslim Women’s Winnipeg chapter. Her family is of Pakistani origin.

“It’s 2020, and it’s still pretty unfortunate that it’s remarkable that there is a woman of colour in a leadership position like this, that that’s something that we talk about,” Khan said. “But that said, I’m a realist, and I think my appointment does break down some barriers, and if I can be part of that, if I can be part of modelling what a representative work force should look like or having diversity in leadership positions, I’m pretty happy about that. I feel proud.”

Ms. Khan’s appointment follows the departure of John Young, who had been scheduled to step down as CMHR president and CEO in August. He resigned early after public criticism began on social media when the museum tweeted in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. The museum was also accused of altering tours on request from some religious schools, omitting LGBTQ content.

Ms. Khan declined to comment on the specifics of the report, but noted that she will follow its recommendations, and do so with transparency.

The report, titled “Rebuilding the Foundation,” revealed that staff at the museum who persisted in efforts to address racism in the workplace were penalized, some branded by management as “troublemakers,” “difficult” or “angry.” Employees who were Black, Indigenous and people of colour reported being passed over for promotion in favour of equally or less-qualified white candidates.

Story continues below advertisement

The report said employees were subjected to racist treatment from visitors too, and management did not take action.

Staff were treated by management as being “over-sensitive” or emotionally weak for being unable to handle the discrimination, the report said.

One former employee, a Black woman who was about 20 when the harassment began, reported being stalked by a white museum member in his 60s. This went on for about two years.

The report found that LGBTQ content was hidden or omitted six times in 2017 and once in 2015.

It noted that the museum “neither explicitly acknowledged nor apologized for the racism perpetuated,” although it acknowledged that LGBTQ content was hidden, and apologized. “The apology has been viewed by many as tone deaf at best,” the report stated.

Its 44 recommendations include that the museum issue a “meaningful apology to Black and Indigenous people that is action-based.” It also recommends that a Black Canadian history tour be launched within 12 months, and that tours and programs with primarily Indigenous content be delivered only by Indigenous people. A number of recommendations call for training.

Story continues below advertisement

A second phase of the review will further explore the extent to which sexism has been an issue at the museum, as well as gendered racism, and barriers to employment for people with disabilities.

“I think that if people understand and are really driven by the mandate of having a respectful, inclusive workplace, we can get through this,” Khan said. “That also means doing some work to identify what discrimination and harassment look like so people can call it out and know how to respond to it.”

Vancouver set and costume designer Drew Facey is a fixture of the local theatre community, designing shows here and beyond for theatre and opera productions, winning 18 Jessie Richardson Theatre Awards along the way. Now Facey is leaving Vancouver – and theatre. COVID-19 has claimed another professional casualty.

“In one week in March I lost 14 months’ worth of contracts,” Facey says in his nearly empty East Vancouver condominium, the one he and his partner decided to sell after the pandemic hit (his partner works in hospitality, which has also been hard hit).

“I obviously went through a difficult, dark time emotionally,” Facey continues. “I focused singularly for the last 15 years on building this design practice, and it was wiped out in a week. And there was really no kind of sense that companies were going to be supporting artists and that we would be able to survive this.”

Story continues below advertisement

Seeing the writing on the wall, Facey, 39, spent the past few months retraining in 3-D visualization, while collecting the Canada Emergency Response Benefit. He spent hours each day teaching himself the sometimes frustrating technology. On Thursday, Facey takes off for Merida, Mexico, where he and his partner will open an interior design business in the Yucatan state capital using the complicated digital technology.

His departure is a huge loss for the theatre scene, and a scary sign of what may be to come.

Because of COVID-19, performing arts companies have cancelled their upcoming seasons – and the contracts that came with them. There is no indication of when it will be safe – or legal – to gather in theatres again.

“The theatre industry is so fragile and freelance theatre artists are so vulnerable,” says Facey, who is beloved as much for his positive energy as his creativity. “I worry constantly for my colleagues in such uncertain times and I feel that the conversation hasn’t really begun around what’s next for all of us.”

Facey was born and raised in Kelowna, B.C., where he obtained a subscription to Architectural Digest when he was 10. He studied at Concordia University in Montreal and in Vancouver, at Emily Carr University of Art and Design and Langara College’s Studio 58 theatre school. He has worked for a long list of companies, designing nearly 170 professional productions, ranging from The Sound of Music to Shakespearean tragedies to an opera based on Shane Koyczan’s novel-in-verse Stickboy.

When the nominations were released for the 2014 Jessie Awards, for instance, Facey had a jaw-dropping seven of them, and walked away with the award for Significant Artistic Achievement for his body of work, among others. Most recently, he won the Jessie in June for outstanding set design (large theatre) for Cost of Living at The Arts Club Theatre Company.

“He is a great positive spirit, a mass of talent and he’s got a marvellous optimistic encouraging way about him,” says Christopher Gaze, the long-time artistic director at Vancouver’s Bard on the Beach. “So when you talk to him, you just feel that almost anything is possible and won’t it be fun to do it.”

It’s a lot to walk away from, but Facey is not feeling much optimism about theatre’s immediate future.

COVID-19 further highlighted the issues that were already making him uncomfortable about how the industry operates. He felt his life wasn’t sustainable – working on overlapping shows, travelling several months of the year, all to support life in an expensive city like Vancouver.

He made a decision to stop working in what he calls dysfunctional situations, or for companies where he has witnessed bullying and racism – he declines to give details – and then felt more centred; he could sleep again. Then the pandemic hit.

“A lot of theatre companies are keeping vague promises of work on the horizon and I think that it is giving artists false hope that their jobs are going to return soon,” Facey notes. “But when I talk with [artistic directors] about what the future holds, any that I have spoken with are very worried about how limited programming and opportunities are going to be when and if theatres reopen.”

He is also frustrated with the pandemic divide between freelance artists like himself, and some people employed in senior positions by theatre companies. “They’re working, they’re collecting their salaries, they’re going to work every day. And then on the other side of it, you have the actors and choreographers and directors and designers and everybody else, and we’re all out of work,” says Facey. “That is frustrating. And knowing that that doesn’t seem like it’s going to change any time soon is difficult.”

We were speaking a few days before his departure, and Facey pulled out his laptop to demonstrate his new line of work. He scrolled through a series of photos of a derelict property in Merida; then new photos, re-imagining digitally what the home could look like. This kind of 3-D visualization can help a real estate agent sell a property; then maybe Facey will get an interior design gig from whoever buys the place.

“I feel like I grieved this career that I spent 15 years building and sort of went through this quite dark process and then made a decision that I had to just be strong and build out. I built a design business once; I can do it again,” he says.

He is clearly excited about the work. But his departure leaves a chasm – that likely won’t be unique.

“It’s a sad testament of this pandemic that people will be changing gears; they’ll be finding other ways to earn livings. And maybe they won’t come back to the theatre,” says Gaze, who worries about losing all that experience and depth. “It’s dangerous. And there could be many losses over the next while.”

The director of the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts was dismissed by the board over a hiring dispute, not because of complaints of a toxic workplace, says the director of a U.S. gallery who has close ties with the Montreal institution.

Alex Nyerges, director of the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, says he was given that reasoning in a recent conversation with Michel de la Chenelière, the chair of the MMFA’s board of trustees. Nyerges has worked with de la Chenelière at the French American Museum Exchange organization, and he collaborated with the recently dismissed director, Nathalie Bondil, on exhibitions over the past decade.

“Michel felt [the board] had the absolute authority, regardless, and they were going to put their person in that role,” Nyerges said in an interview.

The dismissal of Bondil last month as director-general and chief curator of one of Canada’s largest art galleries has sparked a fierce debate about the acceptable bounds of workplace behaviour and the degree to which boards of trustees should step into the inner workings of cultural institutions. The Quebec government has commissioned an investigation into the circumstances of Bondil’s dismissal, given the museum’s prominence in the province’s culture.

Montreal Museum of Fine Arts employees release letter supporting dismissal of former director Nathalie Bondil

A central issue of the debate has been the reasons for her dismissal: whether it is, as the board has publicly said, in response to employees who complained that she had created a toxic work environment, or, as Ms. Bondil and her defenders say, because she objected to the board hiring a person for a senior role at the museum without her consent.

A spokesperson for the MMFA said de la Chenelière would not comment on the conversation with Nyerges.

On the board’s side, more than 100 current and former employees of the Montreal museum signed a letter on Monday in support of the decision to dismiss Bondil, saying she had fostered an unhealthy work environment and claimed credit for her subordinates’ ideas.

Richard Gagnier, head of the museum’s restoration department, said the employees signed and issued the letter because they believe that public debate over Bondil’s dismissal is getting derailed by the hiring issue, when those inside the museum feel it was all about intolerable working conditions. For example, Gagnier said his department was regularly consulted too late in an exhibition planning process to properly do its job of restoring and maintaining art objects. He said repeated requests for postmortems on exhibitions to avoid future problems proved fruitless.

“This is a cri de coeur from employees,” he said. “It’s coming from the base.” He added that the signatories had consulted neither their union nor the museum’s board before releasing the letter.

But Nyerges said that, any workplace issues aside, the board’s main hiring job was picking a director – and that anyone more junior than that should be the director’s choice. He said that the board of trustees should have acquiesced to Bondil’s choice for the newly created position of a director of the curatorial division.

“I can tell you, I would quit before I was forced into a situation like that,” he said, adding that it “goes against the grain” of how a museum should operate.

Nyerges said the dispute over hiring was the central reason he was given for the dismissal, and the issue of workplace tensions was presented to him as “tangential.”

The board’s original explanation for the dismissal on July 13 cited employee complaints that began the previous October, and which led to a report from an independent human-resources firm that described the workplace of the museum as “toxic.” As a result of the report, the board decided to divide Bondil’s job in two, with her keeping the role of director-general and someone else leading the curatorial team. In a previous interview with The Globe and Mail, Bondil said she accepted the change, but disagreed with the board’s choice of curator Mary-Dailey Desmarais for the promotion. She said she respected Desmarais, but had wanted someone with more experience for the job.

Nyerges said that, in a decade of working with Bondil, he had seen her “transform that museum from being a relatively unknown, smaller, less-relevant institution into being a powerhouse in North America.”

He said he is speaking out because he sees a trend of the leaders of cultural institutions being turfed by their boards for what he called “capricious” reasons. He said he is on a weekly call with the directors of the 15 largest art museums in North America, and his colleagues have not wanted to come to Bondil’s defence.

“More [directors] are reluctant and hesitant to be vocal,” he said. “I’m just not one of them.”

Valerian Mazataud/The Globe and Mail

A group of more than 100 current and former employees of the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts has released a letter supporting the dismissal of former director Nathalie Bondil, alleging she created chaos within the workplace and took credit for subordinates’ ideas.

The letter, issued late Monday, backed the decision of the board of trustees, who ousted Ms. Bondil last month after a third-party firm hired by the board alleged she had created a toxic work environment. Ms. Bondil and her allies, however, say the dismissal stemmed from a disagreement over who to hire for a senior role at the museum.

Since then, the dismissal of the well-connected museum director has become a serious debate in Canada’s visual arts world, with major donors, governance experts and international art leaders weighing in on whether the board made the right call. The Quebec government has even hired its own independent firm to investigate the circumstances.

Anne Grace, curator of modern art at the MMFA and one of the organizers of the letter, said it wasn’t easy for staff members to speak publicly. But, she said, the debate has become so heated it has made it difficult for them to do their jobs.

“We have wanted to be discreet, we have wanted to take the high road through all of this controversy,” Ms. Grace said in an interview. “But at a certain point we wanted to rectify a lot of misinformation.”

Ms. Bondil’s supporters point to her track record of doubling the gallery’s floor space and tripling its attendance since she took over in 2007. She won national and international recognition, including an investment in the Order of Canada in 2016.

When reports began to surface in the Quebec press last month about issues with Ms. Bondil’s management, provincial Culture Minister Nathalie Roy declared: “The Montreal Museum of Fine Arts is Nathalie Bondil!”

But behind the scenes, staff say in the letter, conditions had deteriorated in recent years. The letter says Ms. Bondil largely rejected her staff’s ideas, and took credit for those she did accept. The letter also said incidents of harassment and intimidation were “daily occurrences.”

Ms. Grace said that many staff members took offence to Ms. Roy’s characterization. “An institution is more than just a person who has the high-profile position of director,” she said.

The letter did not provide specific examples of the allegations. Ms. Grace said the group wanted to protect each other’s privacy and that, as far as she knew, those who had shared their experiences with the independent human resources firm were bound by confidentiality agreements.

Ms. Bondil did not immediately respond Monday to a request for comment on the letter. In a previous interview with The Globe and Mail, she said that difficulties arose at the museum during a stressful period leading up to the much-delayed 2019 launch of the One World galleries, a suite devoted to non-Western art and archeological objects.

One staffer was driving installers too hard, she said. When the museum’s board hired an outside consultant to report on working conditions, she said she agreed to its recommendations, including working to improve relations with a “problem employee.”

Ms. Bondil held the titles of director and chief curator, which is unusual for comparable art galleries. Ms. Bondil said she was stretched too thinly at the rapidly expanding museum and heartily agreed with the board’s decision to hire a new curatorial director to share the load. That idea came from the outside consultant the board had hired to look into workplace issues.

Ms. Bondil said her dismissal was the result of a disagreement with the board over who to hire as the lead curator. Ms. Bondil said she disagreed with the board’s choice of Mary-Dailey Desmarais for the job because she wanted someone with more experience in the senior role, although she said Ms. Desmarais was a capable curator.

Ms. Grace said Ms. Desmarais was supported by her colleagues at the museum, who signed a public letter last month welcoming her appointment. Ms. Desmarais, who is part of the wealthy Quebec family that is prominent in corporate and cultural circles in the province, was first hired by the museum in a junior role in 2014.

“Yes, she’s a Desmarais,” Ms. Grace said, “but for us she’s a very well-educated, well-respected colleague who we felt was very capable to take on her position.”

Anyone in the theatre community will tell you about the importance of volunteers, many of whom step up to help any way they can, just for the love of it.

There is no better feeling of community than what comes with being a volunteer, establishing longlasting emotional connections with other people who have that same level of interest and passion for local theatre, the arts and the not-for-profit community.

When Rose Theatre in Brampton, Ont., asked its volunteers why they get involved, the top three responses were: to give back to the community; to stay active; and to be a part of theatre and arts culture. Volunteering in the arts is particularly important to seniors and retirees. At the Rose, these are the lobby greeters, theatre ushers, ticket takers, coat-check people and event hosts.

“Their contribution to theatre and arts and culture in Brampton is something that cannot be measured in hours or shifts worked, but in exceptional service and connections created,” says Cristina Rizzuto, co-ordinator for performing arts marketing at the Rose. “Our volunteers welcome our patrons to the theatre as though they are welcoming them home.”

The McMichael Canadian Art Collection has a core of 150 volunteers who serve on the board of trustees, the McMichael Youth Team, the McMichael Volunteer Committee and with staff members on the Moonlight Gala, the McMichael’s signature annual fundraiser.

Those volunteers assist visitors, participate in community outreach and provide crucial event support throughout the year. Their gallery docents are trained volunteers who lead visitors on interactive tours of the gallery’s ground and exhibitions.

Roberta Smith, vice-president and chief of staff for the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, says volunteers are “vital to the success of the TSO.”

The Toronto Symphony Volunteer Committee, with 150 members and which has been in existence almost as long as the TSO itself, is credited with bolstering the financial health of the TSO and with helping to expand awareness of its musical and education programs. That includes hosting fundraising events such as wine auctions and marathons.

“They are not only ambassadors for the orchestra, but they are very much like family,” she says.

Stacey Arppe, volunteer manager at the Canadian Canoe Museum in Peterborough, Ont., actually keeps a tally of the number of hours booked in by museum’s 180 volunteers: 19,648 hours were logged in 2018 by the people who support every department and program at the museum.

“A large contingent of our volunteers are paddlers themselves with a passion for canoeing, camping and outdoor pursuits,” says Arppe.

“We consciously strive to foster a strong sense of community among our volunteers, so some join us to network, meet new people and connect with like-minded individuals.”

One of those volunteers, Dale Standen, says he is a historian and canoeist, with a connection to the museum going back to its roots. Again, the payoff for volunteers like Standen is the emotional connection to the topic and what the museum or gallery represents both personally and to the community.

“The museum’s collection is unparalleled in its richness, and its preservation is an important project,” he says.

“Working with people who share the same sense of the value of the museum to the community is personally rewarding. It is also fun.”

Walter Emrich, a collections and exhibition volunteer at the Agnes Etherington Art Centre, at Queen’s University in Kingston, was a practising doctor who retired four years ago. His aim was to volunteer in an area different from his professional life. This is popular thinking among retirees who volunteer.

After becoming a member at the Agnes Etherington Art Centre just before retiring, he soon found that the gallery’s collection numbered more than 17,000 items, and that there were collection managers and curators who all needed help. That’s how he jumped in.

His job is to do collections condition reporting – doing a walk around the gallery on a weekly basis, looking for any changes in all the exhibited artwork. That could be aging factors such as paint flaking off an oil painting, or paintings warping. It could be contact of the works with gallery visitors or attendants, such as fingerprints or dust on frames.

“After reviewing the various pieces for several weeks I feel like I have a personal relationship and attachment with that work,” Emrich says.

“I’m allowed to be in an environment of creativity and am able to give my time to help in a small way to maintain and preserve that creativity, so that others may benefit from it.”

It is certainly the notion of giving back that appeals to many volunteers.

“At this point in my life I feel an obligation to give something back, to share the knowledge I have accumulated and to mentor others. Volunteering at Agnes provides me with an opportunity to do that,” says Christina MacLachlan, community docent at Agnes.

Young and old, volunteers are crucial to the arts community. Opera Atelier’s crew of volunteers, called on to help out in the office, on larger projects and mailings, especially for the annual gala, are a core group of friendly, dedicated opera lovers.

“From mailings to helping staff our gala and our education/outreach programs, volunteers are the reason it all works,” says Rebekah Lobosco Gilli, development manager for Opera Atelier.

Toronto’s Tarragon Theatre calls on 100 to 120 volunteers each season to cover off duties such as front-of-house usher, as well as to provide gala and administration assistance.

“We do offer the opportunity to see the performances when they’ve assisted us, so that’s certainly a motivator,” says Cameron Johnston, director of marketing for Tarragon Theatre.

“Beyond that, Tarragon volunteers are genuinely passionate about the work we’re doing. They’re our best, most honest audience.”

Canadian actor Michael Greyeyes says he’s been waiting decades for a project like Rutherford Falls.

The Peacock streaming service announced this week that Greyeyes is among the cast members in the upcoming series, which touts the largest Indigenous writing staff for an American TV show.

Ed Helms, Sierra Teller Ornelas and Mike Schur created the comedy, about a small town in upstate New York that borders a reserve.

Story continues below advertisement

Helms plays the town namesake, Nathan Rutherford, who fights the moving of a historical statue.

The Toronto-based Greyeyes plays the chief executive of his tribe’s mid-level casino.

The Plains Cree performer says he booked the project in early March, but the pandemic put a halt on things until recently.

“I read the scripts and I was just really blown away, gobsmacked at how smart they were,” Greyeyes said this week in a phone interview.

“It took me a while to get through every script because I just kept laughing. As I said to Sierra, sometimes I was crying for joy, because it’s a kind of representation that I’ve been waiting 30 years to come out of Hollywood.”

Peacock hasn’t announced a premiere date for Rutherford Falls yet, but Greyeyes said he plans to do a table read in Toronto via video conference soon and then fly to Los Angeles to shoot.

Other cast members include Jana Schmieding as Nathan’s long-time friend, and Canadian actor Dustin Milligan of Schitt’s Creek fame as a reporter/podcaster in the town.

Greyeyes said the series felt “groundbreaking,” partly because it deals with Indigenous identities outside of the trauma that’s a part of their history.

“This is really new territory,” Greyeyes said from Halifax, where he’s set to shoot the film Wildhood by writer-director Bretten Hannam.

“We haven’t seen families portrayed in this way.”

Greyeyes said he was thrilled when Teller Ornelas, who is Navajo and Mexican-American, said the writers’ room would be half Indigenous.

“When diversity enters into a writers’ room, the door is literally pried open and there’s easier access,” said Greyeyes, who is also a choreographer, director, educator and founder of the non-profit Signal Theatre in Toronto.

“This is what I think is at the crux of these sort of social movements, is access. It’s not that we’ve been unable or incapable of making shows like this. It was a question of opportunity.

“And with Rutherford Falls, the paradigm is shifting to not simply an inclusive workspace but a workspace that is redefined.”

In the 1976 live album and concert film The Song Remains the Same, Led Zeppelin singer Robert Plant sings a line from Stairway to Heaven, “and the forests will echo with laughter.” After a pause, he asks rhetorically, “Does anybody remember laughter?”

It’s a good question. Here’s a better one: Does anybody remember live albums?

There was a time when concert LPs were a big deal. Frampton Comes Alive! and Cheap Trick at Budokan, for example, were massive sellers in the 1970s and defining albums of those acts’ careers. Nirvana’s MTV Unplugged in New York is a stone-cold classic. James Brown’s Live at the Apollo is legendary.

With YouTube, though, live performances available to fans are ubiquitous. Live albums are now mostly released as catalogue filler or contractual obligations. Any prestige that concert recordings once had is gone. And, given current live-music restrictions caused by COVID-19, concert albums are not only relics but probably represent an act of insurrection.

All of which makes Vancouver hard-rock duo Japandroids seem out of step with a new live album recorded at the storied Toronto venue Massey Hall in 2017. “We’re an old-fashioned band in a lot of ways,” says drummer David Prowse, who shares singing duties with guitarist Brian King. “We approach things differently from a lot of our contemporaries.”

Prowse lists Nirvana’s Unplugged recording and Neil Young’s Live at Massey Hall among his favourite live albums, but reserves special praise for Otis Redding’s Live in Europe. “It’s an artist at the height of his powers, in the best circumstances possible,” says Prowse, born 16 years after the album was recorded. “It’s an amazing moment of communion with an audience.”

Communion with an audience – does anybody, in these coronavirus times, remember that?

Bill Withers’ Live at Carnegie Hall, from 1973, recorded on a rainy night at the iconic venue in 1972, a year after his breakthrough hit Ain’t No Sunshine: “The only parallel I can think of between Japandroids and Bill Withers is us playing Massey Hall and him playing Carnegie Hall. They’re not venues you’d expect a lot of audience engagement to happen. So, it was really cool to hear this funky show. You can hear clapping, and I can imagine people jumping out of their seats and dancing. The juxtaposition is great – a sweaty-dancey show in a button-down venue.”

Joni Mitchell’s Miles of Aisles, from 1974, recorded at the peak of her fame at various California venues: “I could be wrong, but it seemed like Joni was giving the audience a little bit of what they wanted and a little bit of what she wanted. She’s interested in exploring this jazzier side of things. But then she goes back to the singer-songwriter stuff the crowd may have bought their tickets for.”

Boogie Down Productions’ Live Hardcore Worldwide, from 1991, by the hip-hop pioneers, recorded in Paris, London and New York: “I was familiar with them, but never took a super deep dive into their music. This album blew me away. The audience engagement was incredible. The beats in my car sounded like they were going to blow out my speakers. But there’s a great balance, with the booming bass and then KRS-One has such a great voice and he’s an amazing lyricist. I feel like, what have I been doing with my life? Why did it take me so long to hear this album? It just left me so energized.”

Bob Marley and the Wailers’ Live!, from 1975, recorded at London’s Lyceum Theatre: “I feel that this album is a reminder of what a great songwriter Bob Marley is. His messages about oppression are very relevant right now. White people are comfortable with Bob Marley as long as he’s the happy reggae guy who sings One Love. But there’s a huge underestimation of what a powerful voice he was.”",710,0.9573865637946541,arts & entertainment

But among the Canadian artists she helped nurture, she was better known as “Mother Earth,” her demeanour as soulful and sincere as the voice that won her success both in the studio and onstage.

Bey, who began showing signs of dementia in 2004, died early Saturday morning at the Lakeside Long-Term Care Centre in Toronto, according to the family’s publicist. She was 86.

Story continues below advertisement

Singer and actor Jackie Richardson, who describes Bey as a mentor and “sister,” says her contributions to Canadian culture will live on in both the body of work she leaves behind and the talent she lifted up along the way.

“She definitely was an ambassador of what is wonderful and beautiful in our community of artists,” Richardson said by phone Monday.

“Salome was a bottomless pit of soul, the best in human values and being willing always to be that rock for those that needed a rock. That’s Mother Earth.”

Born in Newark, N.J., on Oct. 10, 1933, Bey toured the U.S., Europe and Canada as part of the sibling act Andy & the Bey Sisters.

In 1964, Bey moved to Toronto where she played the jazz club circuit, and soon made her mark on Canada’s music and theatre scenes.

She recorded two albums with renowned jazz pianist Horace Silver, and released albums of her live performances with the Montreal Jubilation Gospel Choir and at the Montreux Jazz Festival.

Bey also lent her vocal talents to the 1985 charity single, “Tears Are Not Enough,” as part of a Canadian supergroup that featured such artists as Joni Mitchell, Gordon Lightfoot and Bryan Adams. Produced by David Foster, the star-studded song aimed to raise funds for 1983-1985 Ethiopian famine.

She also earned a Grammy nomination for her work on the cast album of the Broadway show, “Your Arms Too Short to Box with God.” Other musical theatre credits include the 1972 off-Broadway show, “Justine,” for which she won an Obie Award.

Bey wrote and starred in “Indigo,” a cabaret about the history of Black music. The show, which won two Dora Mavor Moore Awards, was broadcast on CBC TV in 1984.

Richardson said Bey’s relentless work ethic, and the results onstage, served as an inspiration to countless artists coming up behind her.

Bey took on the role of teacher with her typical generosity and grace, Richardson said.

Her children’s musical, “Rainboworld,” served as a launching pad for many young up-and-comers on their path to stardom, including award-winning soul singer Divine Brown.

“I got my feet wet literally through the opportunities that she presented to me at the very ripe age of 12,” Brown said in a phone interview.

“She played that role for a lot of young, aspiring Black singers in this city.”

Bey’s commitment to Canada’s creative community won her a 1992 Toronto Arts Award, and the Martin Luther King Jr. Award for lifetime achievement from the Black Theatre Workshop of Montreal in 1996.

In 2005, Bey was made an honorary member of the Order of Canada, which Richardson sees as an acknowledgment of her status as a national treasure.

“She definitely was that Canadian star,” Richardson said. “She belongs beside all the greatest of the musicians internationally.”

Bey is survived by her two daughters, the singer SATE and performance artist tUkU, and son Marcus Matthews.",551,0.8704059964848143,arts & entertainment

The director, playwright and actor Mani Soleymanlou will succeed Brigitte Haentjens as the artistic director of the National Arts Centre French Theatre. He will take over from Haentjens on Aug. 31, 2021, at the conclusion of her nine-year term.

His appointment comes at an unprecedented time, with theatres across the country dark because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Much of what was programmed in the NAC French Theatre’s fall season has either been cancelled, rescheduled or reoriented into digital offerings.

“Theatre was one of the first things cancelled, and it’s likely going to be one of the last to come back,” Soleymanlou, 38, told The Globe and Mail. “It was a shocker for me, but all of a sudden we have this luxury of time to rethink theatre, in terms of what the audience needs and who the audience is.”

A 2008 graduate of the National Theatre School of Canada and currently based in Montreal, Soleymanlou has also lived in Tehran, Paris and Toronto. He is best known as the artistic director of the Montreal company Orange Noyée, which he founded in 2011.

Soleymanlou’s connection to the NAC French Theatre stretches back to 2017, when he directed Le Wild West Show de Gabriel Dumont, a romp about a multilingual buffalo-hunting commander of the Métis forces in the North-West Resistance of 1885. After opening in Ottawa, the NAC production, written by 10 playwrights with various languages and backgrounds, toured to Montreal, Winnipeg, Quebec City and Saskatoon.

Not only that, we need to rethink how to make it essential.”

In the spring during the COVID-19 pandemic, he created ""Prologue,"" a physically distanced theatre project performed at Montreal's OFFTA festival.

The NAC said Soleymanlou's ""ongoing involvement in the francophone theatre community, coupled with his expertise and sensitivity, make him an exceptional candidate who is able to grasp the full depth and complexity of Quebec and Franco-Canadian theatre.""

It's a perfectly-timed appetizer for an evolving artist — a wistful and experimental musical postcard for an uneasy era. Many songs have an extended house break, as if Sivan was stepping away to dance furiously on his own.

Sivan reunites with producer Oscar Görres, who worked on some songs from ""Bloom,"" Sivan's last, marvelous full-length album in 2018, including the awesome track ""My My My!""

This time, Görres and Sivan stretch and play with song structure and length, a fun little present for Sivan fans and an indication that perhaps he's restless mining the same territory. Lyric-wise, he's lost a little of his swagger, more vulnerable.

""Easy"" has a '80s, ""Pretty in Pink"" vibe with echoing computer-altered vocals and spacy, thick slabs of synth. The less-than-a-minute ""could cry just thinkin about you"" has Sivan's vocals so distorted he sounds like he's singing deep in a swimming pool.

The clear standout is the dreamy ""Take Yourself Home,"" the only song finished during the pandemic. It is stunning, hypnotic and sexy. It even has an anti-urban feel. ""I’m tired of the city,"" he sing. ""If I’m gonna die, let’s die somewhere pretty.""

Sivan's voice gets drunken for ""STUD,"" a pleading song to a wannabe lover distorted by various effects. He looks back with ""Rager teenager!"" which reveals a confessional side to the Australian singer-songwriter and lyrics that call back to a pre-coronavirus era. ""I just wanna sing loud/I just wanna lose myself in the crowd.""

The title track comes last, a sturdy and more conventional song offering a glimpse of an artist stuck in heartbreak. ""It’s all just feeling real now/So far away but I still feel you everywhere.""

Not too little, not too much. Sivan's EP is the Goldilocks of quarantine.

Directed by Thea Sharrock (""Me Before You"") and scripted with characteristic sensitivity by Mike White (""School of Rock,"" ""Enlightened""), the film initially seems like the expected stuff of snarky CGI animals. Ivan (Sam Rockwell) is a 400-pound silverback gorilla who lives in the corner of the Big Top Mall, a shopping centre with a struggling circus act on the side. (Given that multiplexes have long similarly abutted malls, ""The One and Only Ivan"" — which premieres Friday on Disney+ — could serve as an unwitting metaphor for a fading brick-and-mortar reality for movie theatres.)

Their owner is Mack (Bryan Cranston), an increasing desperate small-business owner — more carnival barker than zoologist — whose show isn’t drawing like it used to. Ivan is his star act; he finishes off each performance with a loud roar and some chest thumping. Mack decides he needs a new headliner and procures a cute baby elephant named Ruby (Brooklynn Prince), who’s parented by the circus’ veteran pachyderm, Stella (Angelina Jolie, also a producer).

""The One and Only Ivan"" seems at first fully invested in whether Mack can turn his show around. But it pivots to sink deeper into the interior lives of the animals in his care. Their caged homes don’t seem oppressive; a mangy stray dog named Bob (Danny DeVito) keeps Ivan company. But Sharrock bathes their restricting confines in claustrophobic shadow. The outside world feels far away. Taking up painting, Ivan colours a dreamed-up forest.

Mack is far from Joe Exotic but we start to question whether Big Top Mall is a good home for Ivan and the rest. The movie, like the book, is inspired by the real story of a gorilla named Ivan who was captured as a baby in the Congo, raised by a family in the U.S., and sat on display in a small concrete cell at a Tacoma, Washington, shopping mall for 27 years before an outcry (prompted in part by a National Geographic documentary ) won his release to a zoo.

The real story of Ivan is more interesting even if it's probably too dispiriting and shameful for a Disney movie. At the same time there’s some awkwardness in relating such an animal-rights tale with fart jokes and a celebrity voice ensemble (among the cast is Helen Mirren as the poodle Snickers and Chaka Khan as a chicken named Henrietta.)

But there’s an uncommon mournfulness to ""The One and Only Ivan"" that tugs at the question of where can these animals go? They plot an escape to the woods across the street only to find it's a small green patch surrounded by development. Give ""The One and Only Ivan"" credit for trying to bridge ""Dumbo"" with ""Blackfish.""

""The One and Only Ivan,"" a Walt Disney Co. release, is rated PG by the Motion Picture Association of America for mild thematic elements. Running time: 90 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four.

Hugo Alvarado: Refugee. Artist. Mentor. Humanitarian. Born July 16, 1948 in Santiago, Chile; died May 23, 2020, while awaiting double lung transplant, in Edmonton; aged 71.

The young man boarding an Air Canada flight in Santiago, Chile, in 1976, spoke no English. Still, he understood when the captain said, “Mr. Alvarado, welcome to Canada,” as other passengers applauded and cheered.

By international law, once aboard a Canadian aircraft, Hugo Alvarado had entered the country. The embassy personnel encircling him for protection could now disperse, and a nun from the convent where Hugo had been hidden for several weeks managed to toss him a bag containing $5 Canadian, clean underwear, toothpaste and a toothbrush.

Three years earlier, Hugo was held with thousands of others in Chile’s national stadium, following the brutal 1973 military coup. Hugo’s work in the Chilean Ministry of Agriculture led to his detention. Tens of thousands were interrogated, tortured, imprisoned and systematically killed. Escaping after three years’ imprisonment, Hugo made it to a Catholic Church. Priests and nuns risked their lives to save his until Canada agreed to accept him as a political refugee.

Upon arrival in Toronto, Hugo was asked where he wanted to go. When he said he knew nothing about Canada, the immigration officer pointed to a map and suggested Hugo pick a spot. Hugo put his finger on what he said looked like “the middle of Canada.”

“That’s Saskatoon,” the officer said.

While Hugo’s selection was by chance, his decision to remain in Saskatoon was by choice. Caring people helped him find work and shelter. He quickly decided this community would be his home and that he would do what he could to help others.

After art classes at the University of Saskatchewan, Hugo became a professional artist at 30, painting vibrant cityscapes and landscapes, still lifes and figures. He sought to use his art to lift up others and started a number of gallery collectives over the years and co-founded the Prairie Sculptors’ Association. He taught adult art classes, encouraging students to find their own style. “There are no prima donnas in my class, including me,” he told them.

Hugo was a passionate, loving and gentle man who wore his heart on his sleeve. He was a master at relating stories, in many of which heartfelt emotion was not far from the surface. The combination of his choking up slightly and heavy Spanish accent could make him difficult to follow, but everyone knew Hugo’s stories always ended with the message: “Do good and be kind.”

He said his parents would be proud of the life and Canadian family he established. A first marriage to Sharon, a fellow student he met while learning English at community college, produced two sons, Ricardo and Jose.

Story continues below advertisement

In the early 1990s, Hugo met Julie at a small gallery where she worked as a picture framer. During their 26 years together, they raised two daughters, Raquel and Paloma.

Hugo always proudly updated friends on the activities of his four children as they established their lives. And his family learned to live with the fact that, immersed in painting, he was often late or missed appointments altogether.

Hugo never stopped creating art or “paying it forward.” He co-founded Artists Against Hunger in 1991, helped raise money for the Saskatoon Crisis Nursery, local theatre and countless community organizations and relief efforts. In recognition of his contributions, he was named CTV Saskatoon’s Citizen of the Year in 2017.

“He never said no when asked for help,” friend Don Greer noted.

Canada’s warm welcome to a refugee made our country richer and stronger.

Eric Cline is Hugo’s friend.

Canadian actor and singer Brent Carver inhabited many roles with a masterful presence that could, at times, appear otherworldly. Between 1980 and 2017, he appeared in 20 productions at Ontario’s prestigious Stratford Festival, where he interpreted iconic characters like Hamlet and made them his own. Both at home and internationally he consistently wowed audiences and critics.

In 1979 he played Ariel to Anthony Hopkins’s Prospero, directed by John Hirsch in Los Angeles. It was noteworthy but it didn’t shoot Mr. Carver’s star into the U.S. stratosphere. That would happen more than a decade later when his portrayal of Luis Molina in Kiss of the Spider Woman made him the toast of Broadway. In the musical, Molina, a gay Argentine window-dresser, eases the pain of his mostly heterosexual Marxist cellmate by re-enacting scenes from favourite movies. Mr. Carver sings at the beginning of the show, followed by a scene in which he emotes as Molina.

During previews, singer Barbra Streisand was overheard whispering to her companion, “Geez! He can act as well!”

New York audiences were astounded by the virtuosity of this Canadian “newcomer.” The New York Times noted that the American press greeted Mr. Carver’s arrival with the amazement reserved for someone found miraculously singing and dancing under a cabbage leaf. Its powerful theatre critic Frank Rich, not one to dispense praise lightly, described the 41-year-old Mr. Carver’s performance as “riveting.” It won him the coveted 1993 Tony award for lead actor in a musical.

It was remarkable that he was able to perform at all. A recent personal trauma had left an indelible mark that would haunt him the rest of his life. In December, 1991, a fire of unknown origin broke out at his house in Stratford. At the time an adored friend, actor Susan Wright, was staying at the home along with her parents. All three perished in the blaze. At his acceptance speech for the Tony, Mr. Carver thanked “my dear, dear Susan. This is for you. And I can say: ‘Death be not proud.‘”

Mr. Carver left Kiss of the Spider Woman three months after that. His contract was up but he explained, in an interview, that he found himself unable to play any role for too long. The energy he devoted to characters, frequently anguished ones, was debilitating. One regular theatregoer who saw Mr. Carver performing as Pontius Pilate in Jesus Christ Superstar at Stratford said, “He acted everyone else off the stage. I thought, the poor man. Does he have anything left over for himself?”

Few entered Mr. Carver’s private world but those who did remarked on his gentility and kindness. He once admitted that “emotional guardedness” caused him some regret as it had distanced him from love. He also explained his reluctance to divulge personal details. “I always felt that if I said anything it would just be a label they put on me. I also felt it was nobody’s business. As Hamlet says, ‘You would pluck out the heart of my mystery.’”

Aside from Molina and Hamlet, Mr. Carver cited Tevye in Fiddler on the Roof, and Robert Ross in Timothy Findley’s The Wars as being some of his favourite roles. The Wars was adapted into a TV movie. He also appeared in the films Shadow Dancing (1988), a thriller with Christopher Plummer; Millennium (1989), a sci-fi drama with Kris Kristofferson; and the made-for-TV movie The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, in which he played the lead character, Ichabod Crane.

While comfortable in front of a camera, the stage was where Mr. Carver drew raves. “No one ever delivered the Seven Ages of Man [speech] from As You Like It with as exquisite a melancholy as Mr. Carver did under the direction of Des McAnuff,” wrote Globe and Mail theatre critic J. Kelly Nestruck. A former artistic director at Stratford, Mr. McAnuff also had high praise for Mr. Carver. “His work was at once sensitive and dangerous. He was a shy rock star.”

An animal lover and vegetarian, Mr. Carver dressed conservatively, preferring to remain inconspicuous in public. “He never set store in being famous,” said Janice Thomson, a long-time friend from Niagara-on-the-Lake, where Mr. Carver maintained a home for many years. “He truly believed he was just doing work like anyone else. He used to talk to me about understanding the audience, people who’d made a journey to get to the theatre. He said everyone came with different moods and expectations. He wanted to meet those expectations to the best of his ability. I never saw him wanting to be Brent Carver, the star,” Ms. Thomson said.

Another friend and neighbour from Niagara-on-the-Lake dropped by Mr. Carver’s house one day to tease him about a clue encountered in a crossword puzzle: Canada’s most prestigious actor, 11 letters down. The actor’s boyish face broke into a delighted grin. “That’s me,” he said. He then asked if he could have the crossword when it was done so he could show it to his mother.

After winning Canada’s 2014 Governor-General’s Performing Arts Award for Lifetime Achievement, a recognition that thrilled him, Mr. Carver was the subject of a short National Film Board production titled simply Brent Carver. Accompanied by a solo cellist, within the melancholy setting of a rusting, paint-peeled warehouse, Mr. Carver’s wiry figure steps with slow, feline precision from shadows toward a single light. The song he’s about to sing is All Through the Night, a 1700s Welsh ballad that connects Mr. Carver to his Celtic family roots. In voice-over, before his ethereal tenor fills the air, and before he embarks upon a soliloquy from Hamlet, and before his blue eyes overflow with tears, he reveals a rare personal sliver of himself. “What I do is perform. In many ways it’s like a sensation of coming home. It’s the sensation of moving through all sorts of thresholds to find the heartbeat of what’s going on.”

The Carver household, overseen by Kenneth Carver, a lumber truck driver, and his wife, Lois (née Wills), was a working-class family of eight children who lived in Cranbrook, a small city in southeastern British Columbia. One of the children, a boy named Danny, drowned at age 2 when he fell into a water-filled ditch while Lois had her back turned. Brent Christopher Carver, born on Nov. 17, 1951, was a baby when the tragedy occurred. He said he learned to sing before he could talk. The first song he ever learned was Danny Boy, forever a reminder of the brother he never knew.

Patriarch Kenneth Carver played guitar and sang for fun but no one else in the family, other than Brent, had an interest in show business. “They’re all sane,” Mr. Carver once quipped. He graduated from Cranbrook’s Mount Baker Secondary School in 1969. For the valedictory address of his graduating class, he sang a Broadway show tune. Eager to get on with things, he dropped out of the University of British Columbia, where he had been studying theatre, and hit the road. The stage was set for his stellar career to begin.

In the 70s, Mr. Carver moved to Toronto where he shared a house with comedian Martin Short and his wife. Almost 15 years later they would compete for the same Tony, which Mr. Carver won.

He would return to Broadway three more times: in 1998′s Parade as Leo Frank, a doomed factory manager, for which he received a second Tony nomination, as Edgar in King Lear (2004) and in Romeo and Juliet as Friar Laurence (2014).

One award Mr. Carver received during the early 1980s was a Dora Mavor Moore Award for his portrayal of a gay man in Martin Sherman’s play Bent. The play revolves around the persecution of homosexuals in Nazi Germany.

After his success in Kiss of the Spider Woman, the Los Angeles Times asked how his family reacted to him playing a gay character. “They were very moved by the show,” he replied. “They’re quite understanding. Even when they saw me in a pretty wild production of Tartuffe. It was set in the West and in one scene, I had to wear a pair of backless leather chaps with nothing on underneath. After that, they came backstage and said, ‘Yes, dear, that was fun.’ ""

Home, whether actual or metaphorical, painful or pleasurable, was never far from Mr. Carver’s thoughts. Despondent over the inability to work due to COVID-19, he recently returned to his birthplace, a place he called “the most beautiful on Earth.” He once told The New York Times: “It constantly calls me back, the pine smell, the lakes, the trees, the mountains. It’s a tough place to make a living but it’s a great place to live.”

He died in Cranbrook on Aug. 4, at age 68. His family did not disclose the cause of his death. He leaves his sisters Vicki and Frankie, and brothers Randy and Shawn.

To honour the life and ferocious talent of Mr. Carver, Mirvish Productions dimmed the marquee lights of two theatres in Toronto on Aug. 7 – the Royal Alexandra, where he performed a solo show of his stories and songs in 1995; and the Princess of Wales, where he starred as Gandalf in the world premiere production of The Lord of the Rings in 2006.",1651,0.8456811509392439,arts & entertainment

And there’s the 2019 movie Five Feet Apart, about a young woman with cystic fibrosis who becomes romantically involved with an ailing young man.

Langham Court Theatre has just opened Lauren Gunderson’s 2014 play I and You. In this two-actor drama, Caroline, a high-school student with a serious liver ailment, receives a surprise visit from a classmate. Like a cactus flower in an inhospitable desert, young love ultimately blooms.

Caroline — feisty and smart — has never before met Anthony, a decent young man with a heart as big as Kansas. At the beginning, in true rom-com style, the pair spar and bicker furiously before bonding like Super Glue.

I and You was a hit, gleaning critical acclaim and enjoying well over 20 productions since it debuted. Gunderson has, meanwhile, emerged as one of America’s most produced playwrights.

Some will find I and You a touch jejune and sentimental in the manner of after-school TV specials.

A melodramatic surprise ending will leave you either thrilled or groaning. There’s a distinctly YA-lit vibe throughout this 90-minute play (I kept thinking of the classic line, “Stay gold, Ponyboy,” from S.E. Hinton’s The Outsiders).

An audience noticeably younger than Langham Court’s usual crowd responded enthusiastically to Thursday’s opening performance. Certainly this production of I and You, capably directed by John Han, has its share of strengths.

The show benefits from the talents of two promising actors. Jesse Deutscher (Caroline) and Justin Francis Lee (Anthony) offered well-rehearsed, energetic performances.

The detailed set is terrific — Caroline’s bedroom is stuffed with groovy teen detritus: vintage Elvis poster, lava lamp, cat-scratching post, retro-lamps and so on. Wide-screen clips of computer games and music videos work well; all light, video and sound cues were handled adroitly.

The play commences with Anthony, wearing a backward baseball cap, dropping in unannounced. He spouts a cryptic line that turns out to be a quote from Walt Whitman’s famous poem Song of Myself.

Caroline — a tiny girl in a too-big sweatshirt — is bewildered and frightened. Anthony hastily explains he’s volunteered to be her partner for a school assignment. Nonetheless Caroline, who is homebound because of her liver ailment, lashes out at the intruder for 20 or 30 minutes.

This introductory section is heavily salted with sitcom teen speak. “What is wrong with you, super hater?” says Anthony. “Walt Whitman can bite me,” says Caroline.

Eventually she does agree to a partnership — they’ll create a Whitman-inspired poster together. “How do you feel about glitter?” Caroline asks. “Philosophically I’m agnostic on glitter,” says Anthony.

It’s doubtful anyone outside a Neil Simon (or Lauren Gunderson) play actually speaks like this. Happily, about halfway through, the quip-fest subsides and we get to know the characters a little more.

Bon mots on the benefits of Chunky Monkey ice cream and Caroline’s toy turtle give way to heavier subjects. Anthony turns out to be a John Coltrane devotee; she digs Jerry Lee Lewis.

Caroline is a gifted photographer with a Whitman-esque love for minutia; he has just witnessed a terrible tragedy on the basketball court.

Deutscher, as Caroline, sometimes displayed flashes of nuance and a knack for subtle facial expression. And the more the playwright eased up on the shallow-end-of-the-pool banter, the more Lee was able to dig into the character of Anthony.

Gunderson intends to say something brave and refreshing about the fleeting, transcendent beauty of life — never a bad thing. And if I and You sends you back to that tattered copy of Walt Whitman poems on your bookshelf, so much the better.

The show continues at Langham Court to March 14.",631,0.9560447426917451,arts & entertainment

article continues below

Early this week, there was a flutter of consternation within the arts community over COVID-19, the virus that’s now reached pandemic proportions. By Thursday night, announcements of show cancellations — some of them last-minute — had swelled from a trickle to a fast-flowing river.

I first heard of this Thursday. That night, I was set to attend a performance of Lillian Hellman’s The Children’s Hour staged by University of Victoria’s Phoenix Theatre. Then Adrienne Holierhoek, the theatre’s publicist, emailed me with sobering news: the performance was cancelled.

“We’re not going ahead with a public performance, as we’re on the verge of the 250 limit,” she said. Holierhoek would now spend a busy night doing damage control.

She added wryly: “Let’s just say I’m having granola bars for dinner.”

As is the case with many performing arts companies in Victoria and throughout the province, the cancellation was in deference to a recommendation by B.C. health officer Bonnie Henry. On Thursday she suggested cancelling events expected to draw crowds of 250 or more to help contain the highly contagious virus.

That night, the list of cancellations continued to grow. Pacific Opera Victoria’s production of Flight of the Hummingbird, set to run Friday to March 22, is postponed indefinitely. The Victoria Symphony has discontinued its concerts. Dance Victoria says this weekend’s performances of Romeo + Juliet by Ballet B.C. are cancelled.

The Royal and McPherson theatres are closed until further notice.

Yesterday morning, I sat down to write a review of Busted Up: A Yukon Story, which played the Belfry Theatre’s Spark Festival. It’s a first-rate show and was to conclude its run tonight.

Later that morning, the Belfry’s communications director, Mark Dusseault, told me his company had made the difficult decision to cancel further Spark Festival performances. This festival, a showcase of new theatre, was originally to continue to March 22.

“It’s heartbreaking,” said Dusseault.

A decision had to be made quickly. One company was preparing to fly to Victoria from its home province of Newfoundland for Spark shows. The Belfry didn’t want them to invest effort, time and expense, only to learn their run was canceled.

Langham Court Theatre has cancelled today’s final performances of I and You.

Manager Michelle Buck said Langham Court originally considered capping the audience at 75 (the theatre’s capacity is 175) to allow for “social distancing” — that is, leaving physical spaces between attendees.

But in the end, the company — regretfully — decided to play it safe.

“It’s such a good little show,” Buck said. “It’s sad to pull it from underneath them.”

Dusseault, who has worked in theatre for 30 years, cannot remember a situation like this ever occurring before in Victoria. Yes, there have been other calamities: 9/11, the Gulf War, the global SARS outbreak of 2003. But nothing ever shut down the arts scene like COVID-19 has.

Not every theatre company has closed its doors. Blue Bridge Repertory Theatre says no upcoming events at its Roxy Theatre have been cancelled. The Roxy will host a musical tribute to the Beatles March 26 to 29.

It is, of course, disappointing for audiences when performances are cancelled. You not only miss out on the show, there’s the task of getting a refund. Yet for arts organizations, the fallout from this situation is much more profound.

Many companies scrape by to survive. Over the past 30 years, government funding has eroded. Audiences for opera, classical music and theatre are getting older. And in general, the battle for audiences is becoming much more intense.

For example, years ago, direct-to-consumer services such as Netflix didn’t even exist.

A new meme now making the social-media rounds suggests people holding tickets to cancelled shows should consider opting out of a refund. By doing so, you make a donation to the company in question.

It’s a noble notion worth considering. One potential legacy of COVID-19 is that it will shut down some arts organizations permanently. And once they go under, it’s difficult — if not impossible — to resurrect them.

When you are The Killers and your usual guitarist has gone, no problem. When you’re The Killers you can turn to Lindsey Buckingham.

The former Fleetwood Mac guitarist steps in for a tune on the new 10-song ""Imploding the Mirage,"" another sign of the band’s clout. The album's guests also include k.d. lang and Adam Granduciel of The War on Drugs.

The absence of guitarist and co-founder Dave Keuning is felt, with keyboards and drums stepping into the void. Without Keuning’s jangle and riff shards, The Killers have a more poppy sound.

If 2017's ""Wonderful Wonderful"" was a meditation on the anxiety of masculinity, the new album often explores the lives of women, with two sharp portraits of tough survivors in ""Blowback"" and ""Caution"" — women whom Brandon Flowers sings each come from ""white trash.""

Many other songs are about loyally backing a partner. ""I’ll be there when water’s rising/I’ll be your lifeguard,"" Flowers sings on ""Dying Breed."" On ""When the Dreams Run Dry,"" he vows: ""I’ll be on your side/When the dreams run dry."" In ""Lightening Fields,"" he sings, ""Just wanted to run my fastest/And stand beside you."" The cover of the album depicts a god tenderly supporting a goddess.

Jonathan Rado of California psychedelic-rock duo Foxygen and Shawn Everett — who worked on ""Wonderful Wonderful"" as well as with Kacey Musgraves and Alabama Shakes — have stepped in to produce and their influence can best be heard on the funky ""Fire in Bone.""

Elsewhere, listeners may have fun finding the band's other influences. There's a Tom Petty-ish sound to ""Blowback"" and ""My Own Soul's Warning"" has a Springsteen vibe. But there's no mistaking that classic Killers mix of soaring vocals, sonic bombast and sly humour in such songs as ""My God"" and the title track. It's a solid album from a band still exploring.

The unanimous ruling issued Monday by a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is the latest — but possibly not the last — in a case that has wound through the courts of Spain and the United States for 20 years.

article continues below

At stake is ""La Rue St. Honoré, effet de Soleil, Après-Midi, 1898,"" an oil-on-canvas work of a rain-swept Paris street that Pissarro painted as he gazed at the scene from his hotel window. Its value has been estimated at $30 million.

Lilly Cassirer’s father-in-law bought it directly from Pissarro’s art dealer and left it to her and her husband when he died. In 1939, she traded it to the Nazis in exchange for exit visas for herself, her husband and her grandson, who eventually settled in the U.S. Her great-grandson, David Cassirer of San Diego, has continued the litigation since his father's death.

Neither Cassirer's heirs nor Spain's Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum dispute the painting's early history.

What's at issue all these years later is whether Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza made any serious effort to determine the painting was looted art when he acquired it from a New York gallery owner for $275,000 in 1976.

Also whether Spanish curators did their due diligence in tracing its provenance when a Spanish non-profit foundation acquired it and hundreds of other paintings from the baron's collection in 1992 and created the Madrid museum that bears his name.

Lilly Cassirer’s heirs say she spent years trying to recover the painting before concluding it was lost and accepting $13,000 in reparations from the German government in 1958.

It wasn’t until 1999 that her grandson, Claude, who had vividly recalled seeing it hanging in the family's German home, discovered it in the Madrid museum. After Spain refused to hand it over, he sued.

Attorney Thaddeus Stauber, who has represented the museum since the case reached U.S. courts in 2005, hailed Monday's decision, noting that the painting was sold and resold to numerous legitimate and prominent collectors over the years before the baron obtained it, with none discovering it had been seized by the Nazis.

He said there also appeared to be no effort by Thyssen-Bornemisza or any other collector to hide it from the public.

""We've been transparent from the start of this case, and we're very pleased that there's been a trial now and it brings it to a conclusion, we trust,"" he said Tuesday.

He did say the Cassirer family may appeal to the full 9th Circuit or even the U.S. Supreme Court.

The family did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday, but the president of the Holocaust Survivors Foundation USA denounced the decision.

""The Nazis murdered more than 6 million Jews, including 1.5 million children under the age of 12, and including 105 members of my family,"" David Schaecter said. ""How on God’s Earth can Spain fight so hard to deny a Jewish family its precious legacy that was looted by the Nazis? And how on God’s Earth can an American court ignore the unprecedented trauma of the Holocaust and reward Spain for its greed?""

Both U.S. District Judge John Walter, in a 2019 ruling, and the appeals court in Tuesday's, criticized the baron and the Spanish foundation for not doing more to discover whether the painting was looted art. But both courts concluded there was no proof either deliberately hid that it was.

Both courts also criticized Spain for not living up to what the courts called ""moral commitments"" to return Nazi-looted art.

""It is perhaps unfortunate that a country and a government can preen as moralistic in its declarations, yet not be bound by those declarations. But that is the state of the law,"" the appeals court said in its ruling.",653,0.9792570726460249,arts & entertainment

Shauf has been a critical favourite in Canada for years. He was nominated for multiple Juno Awards, and ""The Neon Skyline"" landed on the long list of Polaris Prize contenders for this year's best album.

Fellow Canadian artists Drake and PartyNextDoor also showed up on Obama's list.

Both of them shared billing on Popcaan's track ""Twist & Turn,"" while Drake was also featured for his part on Rihanna's megahit ""Work.""

PartyNextDoor, who is Mississauga, Ont.-raised rapper Jahron Brathwaite, made a second appearance for his solo effort ""PGT,"" taken from his 2020 album, ""Partymobile.""

In documents filed by her court-appointed lawyer that give a rare public airing to the wishes of the 38-year-old pop superstar, she asked that her father not return to the role of conservator of her person, which gave him power over her major life decisions from 2008 until 2019, when he temporarily stepped aside, citing health problems.

article continues below

""Britney is strongly opposed to James return as conservator of her person,"" the document says.

James Spears has kept his separate role as conservator over his daughter's finances. For the first 11 years of the conservatorship, he served as co-conservator with attorney Andrew M. Wallet, who resigned from the role early last year.

That briefly left James Spears with sole power over Britney Spears' life, money and career, a situation she says she very much wants to avoid repeating.

An email seeking comment from James Spears' attorney was not immediately returned.

Spears says she wants Jodi Montgomery, who has been serving as conservator of her person temporarily, to do so permanently, but she says that doesn't mean she is waiving her right to seek an end to the entire arrangement.

The documents also reveal that Britney Spears has no plans to perform again anytime soon. She last performed live in October 2018, and early in 2019, cancelled a planned Las Vegas residency.

The filing gave a rare glimpse at Britney Spears' own wishes in the conservatorship that has had vast power over her for over a decade. She has almost never spoken publicly about the matter, and court hearings and documents in the case are cloaked in secrecy, though last year she addressed the court at her request, suggesting she was seeking changes.

In the papers, Britney Spears praises the conservatorship and its work overall, saying it ""rescued her from a collapse, exploitation by predatory individuals and financial ruin"" and that it made her ""able to regain her position as a world class entertainer.""

The document was filed a day before a status hearing on the conservatorship, expected to be closed to the media and public.

Britney Spears' attorney said that he expects James Spears will aggressively contest being marginalized, and said that Britney Spears has suggested they retain a lawyer with expertise in complex financial court fights.

The conservatorship, known in some states as a guardianship, gave James Spears power over his daughter's career choices and much of her personal life, including her relationship with her teenage sons. Spears' ex-husband Kevin Federline has custody of the boys, but she has frequent visits with them.

Podcasting has been a boon for fans of theatre, and now, with stages closed down because of health regulations associated with COVID-19, storytelling serials are a lifeline. These three podcasts arrive just in time for those jonesing for drama.

Metamorphosis – A Viral Trilogy: From the Giller-winning author André Alexis comes a pandemic-inspired audio drama in three parts, directed by Ross Manson. The first instalment is Lucretia in Quarantine, in which a young teenager (voiced by Bahia Watson) documents her motherless, near feral existence in a daily journal. It’s a poignant story of fear, family and survival, involving the adoption of a baby raccoon. In an allegory for these weird times, the lines between human and animal are blurred: A confused “pet” shrieks; its unprepared caretaker is just as scared. “I wonder what it would be like,” Lucretia says, “if you had to remember you were human.” The trilogy is presented by Volcano Theatre, TO Live, Canadian Stage and SummerWorks theatre festival, with new episodes dropping Aug. 24 and 31.

Playing On Air: This continuing American radio and podcast series was launched in 2012 to present short plays – a preferred form of many playwrights because of the pithy dramatic possibilities, and yet they are rarely performed professionally outside of theatre festivals. Though the Playing On Air productions are bite-sized, they’re not short on big names, with actors Ed Asner, Elizabeth Ashley, Adam Driver, Kathleen Turner and Jesse Eisenberg being just a few of the A-listers on board for these stripped-down performances. A new season comes this fall, but meanwhile Playing On Air is re-releasing a few old episodes, including Happy by Alan Zweibel of Saturday Night Live, It’s Garry Shandling’s Show and Curb Your Enthusiasm fame. Taped in front of a live audience, Happy stars Frankie Faison and Scott Adsit in a delightful curve-balling comedy about a New York Mets fan who looks up a former boys-of-summer hero of his.

Ghosts of the Royal Alex: Figuring that every good ghost story needs a twist, Mirvish Productions marketing and sales director John Karastamatis came up with a crowd-sourcing gimmick. At the end of each chapter of this spooky six-part taleabout Toronto’s historic (and apparently haunted) Royal Alexandra Theatre, listeners are invited to submit ideas on what should happen next. The backstage story read by actor David Mucci is set in 1959, when the new television fad contributed to a decline in theatre attendance in general and the building of the modern, bigger O’Keefe Centre nearby threatened the Royal Alex’s livelihood in particular. The script comes from Karastamatis, and while he’s no playwright, as a promotion man he knows there’s nothing more frightening than an empty theatre.

Health care workers fighting coronavirus in dozens of countries are facing violence from fearful communities who have attacked doctors and burned down clinics, aid agencies said on Tuesday.

In Colombia, ambulances were blocked from entering a town to screen for COVID-19 cases, said the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which recorded 611 incidents targeting health workers, patients and facilities from February to July.

In South Africa, a testing station and a clinic were torched by people who did not want responders in their neighbourhood, said medical charity Médecins sans frontières (Doctors Without Borders).

“It’s a byproduct of the new, novel, infectious disease – there’s a lot of fear,” said Sean Christie, a spokesman for MSF in South Africa.

“Even for areas that have experienced very big HIV and TB epidemics, this was just different. The media response was so overwhelming, and [there is] so much social media misinformation,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

Although governments and charities have launched information campaigns, more work is needed to address fake news, make sure people have access to the facts and include local communities in decision-making, aid workers said.

Drawing on first-hand accounts and media reports, the ICRC said incidents – including physical attacks, verbal harassment and threats – took place in more than 40 countries including Afghanistan, Bangladesh and the Philippines.

The real figure was likely much higher, the global humanitarian agency said.

“Fear of contracting the disease and the lack of basic knowledge concerning COVID-19 are often the underlying reasons behind violent acts,” said Esperanza Martinez, the ICRC’s head of health.

“To protect health care staff, medical facilities and patients from violence, it is of paramount importance to disseminate accurate information,” she said in a statement.

Some of the most common beliefs are that coronavirus is man-made, that it is not real, or that new testing facilities or health centres will bring it to communities.

Some people in Haiti believe hospital patients are given a deadly injection to increase the number of coronavirus deaths so that the government can attract more aid, according to one community leader.

In Gambia, there have been no attacks but people are avoiding health facilities out of fear and trying to self-diagnose their illnesses, said Baba Balajo, a program manager for the humanitarian agency Catholic Relief Services.

“We have had people expressing the fear that nowadays when you go to the health facilities you are always diagnosed with COVID,” he said.

“It’s a problem because people now resort to going to pharmacies, and that may not resolve their health problems.”

The World Health Organization has said it is concerned that the coronavirus spread is being driven by people in their 20s, 30s and 40s, many of whom are unaware they have been infected, posing a danger to vulnerable groups. Reuters

Jets believed to be Russian bombed several towns in rebel-held northwestern Syria in a new flare-up of violence since a Turkish-Russian deal that halted major fighting nearly six months ago, witnesses said.

Also on Tuesday, the RIA news agency cited the defence ministry as saying a Russian major-general died and three other servicemen were injured after a bomb exploded in the path of a Russian military convoy near Deir al Zor.

War planes flying at high altitude, which tracking centres said were Russian Sukhoi jets, dropped bombs on the Harbanoush and Sheikh Bahr Nahr areas where makeshift camps house tens of thousands of displaced families.

“There were over 20 raids we have monitored by Russian jets stationed in Hmeimim air base,” said Abdullah Sawan, a volunteer plane spotter whose network covers the Russian air base in the western coastal province of Latakia.

Russian jets this month bombed mountainous areas in Latakia where rebel fighters are dug in and civil defence witnesses said jets struck a camp for displaced people near the town of Binish in Idlib province that killed at least three civilians.

Russian jets in June made the first air strikes since the deal brokered in March between Russia, which backs Syrian President Bashar al Assad’s forces, and Turkey, which supports opposition fighters.

Rebels say the Syrian army and its allied militias were amassing troops on front lines.

There was no immediate comment from Moscow nor the Syrian army who accuse militant groups of wrecking the deal and deny any indiscriminate attacks on civilians.

Russia said last week the joint military patrols in Idlib, carried out along the M4 highway linking Syria’s east and west, had been suspended over increasing militant attacks in the area.

The March deal ended a Russian-backed bombing campaign that had displaced over a million people in the region which borders Turkey after months of fighting that killed hundreds.

Residents also said the jet strikes coincided with heavy artillery shelling by the Syrian army of several villages in Jabal al Zawya in southern Idlib.

Moscow has established a major presence in Syria where its airforce and military bases across the country have allowed Syrian President Bashar al Assad in recent years to defeat rebels who rose up against his authoritarian rule.

President Vladimir Putin announced the Health Ministry's approval and said one of his two adult daughters already was inoculated. He said the vaccine underwent the necessary tests and was shown to provide lasting immunity to the coronavirus, although Russian authorities have offered no proof to back up claims of safety or effectiveness.

""I know it has proven efficient and forms a stable immunity,"" Putin said. ""We must be grateful to those who made that first step very important for our country and the entire world.""

However, scientists in Russia and other countries sounded an alarm, saying that rushing to offer the vaccine before final-stage testing could backfire. What's called a Phase 3 trial — which involves tens of thousands of people and can take months — is the only way to prove if an experimental vaccine is safe and really works.

By comparison, vaccines entering final-stage testing in the U.S. require studies of 30,000 people each. Two vaccine candidates already have begun those huge studies, with three more set to get underway by fall.

""Fast-tracked approval will not make Russia the leader in the race, it will just expose consumers of the vaccine to unnecessary danger,"" said Russia’s Association of Clinical Trials Organizations, in urging government officials to postpone approving the vaccine without completed advanced trials.

While Russian officials have said large-scale production of the vaccine wasn't scheduled until September, Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova said vaccination of doctors could start as early as this month. Officials say they will be closely monitored after the injections. Mass vaccination may begin as early as October.

""We expect tens of thousands of volunteers to be vaccinated within the next months,"" Kirill Dmitriev, chief executive of the Russian Direct Investment Fund that bankrolled the vaccine, told reporters.

The vaccine developed by the Gamaleya Institute in Moscow with assistance from Russia's Defence Ministry uses a different virus -- the common cold-causing adenovirus -- that’s been modified to carry genes for the ""spike"" protein that coats the coronavirus, as a way to prime the body to recognize if a real COVID-19 infection comes along.

That’s a similar technology as vaccines being developed by China’s CanSino Biologics and Britain’s Oxford University and AstraZeneca — but unlike those companies, Russian scientists haven't published any scientific information about how the vaccine has performed in animal tests or in early-stage human studies.

Dmitriev said even as Russian doctors and teachers start getting vaccinated, advanced trials are set to start Wednesday that will involve ""several thousand people"" and span several countries, including the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, the Philippines and possibly Brazil.

The Associated Press couldn't find documentation in the Russian Health Ministry's records indicating that permission to start the advanced trials was granted. The ministry has not responded to a request for comment.

Putin said one of his daughters has received two doses, and had minor side effects such as slight fever, and is now ""feeling well and has a high number of antibodies."" It wasn't clear if she was one of the study volunteers.

The Health Ministry said in a statement Tuesday that the vaccine is expected to provide immunity from the coronavirus for up to two years, citing its experience with vaccines made with similar technology.

However, scientists around the world have been cautioning that even if vaccine candidates are proven to work, it will take even more time to tell how long the protection will last.

""The collateral damage from release of any vaccine that was less than safe and effective would exacerbate our current problems insurmountably,"" Imperial College London immunology professor Danny Altmann said in a statement Tuesday.

The World Health Organization has urged that all vaccine candidates go through full stages of testing before being rolled out, and said Tuesday it is in touch with the Russian scientists and ""looks forward to reviewing"" Russia’s study data. Experts have warned that vaccines that are not properly tested can cause harm in many ways — from harming health to creating a false sense of security or undermining trust in vaccinations.

Becoming the first country in the world to approve a vaccine was a matter of national prestige for the Kremlin as it tries to assert the image of Russia as a global power. Putin repeatedly praised Russia’s effective response to the outbreak in televised addresses to the nation, while some of Moscow’s top officials – including the country’s prime minister and Putin’s own spokesperson – became infected.

And the U.S., Britain and Canada last month accused Russia of using hackers to steal vaccine research from Western labs. Russia has denied involvement.

Russia has so far registered 897,599 coronavirus cases, including 15,131 deaths.

The Gamaleya Institute’s director, Alexander Gintsburg, raised eyebrows in May when he said that he and other researchers tried the vaccine on themselves before the start of human studies.

Those trials started June 17 with 76 volunteers. Half were injected with a vaccine in liquid form and the other half with a vaccine that came as soluble powder. Some in the first group were recruited from the military, which raised concerns that servicemen may have been pressured to participate. The test was declared completed earlier this month.

""It’s a too early stage to truly assess whether it’s going to be effective, whether it’s going to work or not,"" said Dr. Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health at England's University of Southampton.

It's not Russia's first controversial vaccine. Putin has bragged that Russian scientists delivered an Ebola vaccine that ""proved to be the most effective in the world"" and ""made a real contribution to fighting the Ebola fever in Africa."" However, there is little evidence either of the two Ebola vaccines approved in Russia was widely used in Africa. As of 2019, both of those vaccines were listed by the WHO as ""candidate vaccines.""

The British government announced Tuesday it is scrapping a public health agency that has taken blame for the country’s uneven response to the coronavirus.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the work of Public Health England will become part of a new body, the National Institute for Health Protection, which will guard against infectious diseases and biosecurity threats.

“We did not go into this crisis with the capacity for a response to a once-in-a-century-scale event,” Hancock said during a speech in London.

He said the new body would “bring together the science and the scale into one coherent whole.”

The new institute will be headed by Dido Harding, a former telecoms executive who leads the much-criticized test and trace program set up in recent months to help contain COVID-19.

Hancock said it would learn from public health agencies in South Korea and Germany, which have been praised for their strong response to the pandemic.

Public Health England has been criticized for taking an overly centralized approach to testing and contact-tracing, and of abandoning widespread testing for the virus in mid-March because it lacked the diagnostic capacity.

Its defenders argue that Britain’s Conservative governments have been cutting public health budgets for years, leaving the country ill-prepared to deal with the pandemic.

Jonathan Bell, professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham, said Britain’s initial response to COVID-19 “did appear disjointed and insufficient.” But he said preparing for a possible second wave would be better done by “strengthening the systems we have now” rather than setting up new structures.

The U.K. has Europe’s highest official coronavirus-related death toll, with more than 40,000 deaths.

The French government plans to make wearing a mask compulsory in the vast majority of workplaces from Sept. 1 to try to stop a resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The labor ministry said on Tuesday the new arrangement would apply to all shared spaces in offices and factories, but would not extend to individual offices where only one employee is present.

It also said that working from home would remain its recommended option for employees. A government official said masks at work would become mandatory from Sept. 1.

He further said there would be talks with employers and unions about borderline cases, such as when only two people are present in one large open-space and sitting well apart.

Details will also be worked out for special work environments such as frozen food warehouses, where masks are not practical as they would freeze.

Mask-wearing is also compulsory nationwide on all public transport and in most indoor public spaces such as shops and museums, as well as in crowded outdoor areas in some cities.

France imposed some of Europe’s toughest lockdown restrictions earlier this year, greatly reducing the rate of coronavirus infections. But in the past few weeks the numbers of new COVID-19 cases have climbed, and public health officials have warned that contagion could spin out of control.

The government has been under pressure from trade unions to step up protective measures in time for September, when people return to work after long summer holidays, and when children are due back at school.

“The best thing we can do to prepare for the return from vacations is to reassure employees that, together, we are taking the precautions to avoid spreading the virus,” Elisabeth Borne, the labor minister, was quoted as saying by the ministry.

U.S. drug developer Novavax Inc said on Monday that it is starting a mid-stage study of its experimental COVID-19 vaccine in South Africa, as the country experiences a surge in coronavirus cases. Reuters

However, that might be only a temporary relief. So far, the outbreak has been largely confined, at least in its most lethal form, to the northern hemisphere.

That was to be expected. Coronaviruses, flu among them, are often a winter phenomenon. It may be the virus is vulnerable to ultraviolet light that tends to be more prominent in the summer months.

But when winter returns to our hemisphere, are we in for a second round? Many experts believe so.

In that event, what should our policy be, and who should enunciate it? One explanation for the unprecedented measures employed so far has been that this was an emergency, the full consequences of which could not immediately be known. Extraordinary steps were therefore fully justified.

Hopefully, if the outbreak reappears in the fall, we will have better data to calibrate our response, and possibly a vaccine — though many experts believe the latter to be either improbable, or of limited value. The effectiveness of some flu vaccines has fallen below 20 per cent.

Yet the issue remains, who decides how such a recurrence should be handled. And this question grows in magnitude when we consider that decisions taken in the more prosperous northern hemisphere may devastate the southern half of the globe.

Winter is just now approaching that region. Africa and Middle and South America look especially vulnerable (New Zealand and Australia might escape the worst effects because both are islands. That might be one reason Vancouver Island has been less hard hit than parts of the mainland.)

You can begin to see a picture of what may happen if you look at the current death tolls per million population. In several northern countries, the fatality rates are in the hundreds per million.

There are some exceptions. China reports very low figures, but there are good reasons to disbelieve these numbers.

In contrast, many African and South American countries are so far reporting figures at or close to single digits. As I write this, Paraguay stands at 11 deaths per million population, Venezuela 10, Egypt 6.9, South Africa 6.4, Sudan 2.9, French Guiana 1.

Most of these are Third World countries. You can’t expect their reporting to be precise.

Yet what happens if these numbers climb to the levels experienced in Britain (552), Italy (544), France (424) and Belgium (inexplicably 815)? Brazil, with its huge, densely populated cities, is already in trouble.

How will we handle this? By offering those governments more foreign aid? Certainly.

However, most Western nations have gone heavily into debt to deal with their own crises. In the midst of a panic-inducing epidemic, could there ever be sufficient resources to aid two entire continents whose populations approach 2.5 billion?

Given the success of public health experts such as B.C.’s Dr. Bonnie Henry in limiting the outbreak, this may appear an ungenerous question. But if, as many experts have predicted, COVID-19 makes a comeback in the fall, should we continue using the same policies to handle the crisis? For these measures have wider implications.

Difficult as it is to assimilate in the midst of a pandemic, the United Nations has warned that “hundreds of thousands of children could die this year due to the global economic downturn sparked by the coronavirus pandemic, and tens of millions more could fall into extreme poverty as a result of the crisis.”

This would undercut many of the gains made in reducing world poverty over the past two decades.

The International Monetary Fund has said that as a result of the COVID lockdown, “the world economy will experience the worst recession since the Great Depression.” Some economists are fearful it could last a decade or more.

And it has been argued that a full-scale outbreak in Africa or South America, accompanied by economic shutdowns, could lead to a flood of refugees from these continents that might swamp neighbouring health systems.

Can we institute effective public health measures that allow for economic growth? At the very least, shouldn’t there be a full-scale public discussion about this?

Bob Plecas, a retired deputy minister in the B.C. government, has offered a solution on these pages that, for what it’s worth, I think makes sense.

Plecas points out that if we want broader considerations given a hearing, then the proper venues to construct future policies are the federal and provincial cabinets. There you have ministers representing small businesses, the tourism industry, forestry, municipal government and so on, all sectors of the economy under extreme pressure.

You also have foreign-affairs staff who can speak to the implications in poorer countries.

Certainly the advice of public-health staff will play a central part in that analysis. But a wider range of voices must be heard if we are to avoid the kinds of disasters predicted by the UN and others.

A potential coronavirus vaccine being developed by a unit of China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm) could cost no more than 1,000 yuan ($144.27) for two shots, state media on Tuesday quoted chairman Liu Jingzhen as saying.

Sinopharm has said its experimental vaccine could be ready for public use by the end of this year. It has entered a late-stage human test in the United Arab Emirates to gather proof of efficacy for final regulatory approvals.

“It will not be priced very high. It is expected to cost a few hundred yuan for a shot, and for two shots it should be less than 1,000 yuan,” Liu told the Guangming Daily newspaper.

Governments and drugmakers around the world are in a frenetic race to develop a COVID-19 vaccine. More than 200 candidates are in development, including more than 20 in human clinical trials.

Moderna Inc said earlier this month that smaller volumes of its experimental vaccine have been priced at $32-$37 per dose.

Last month, the U.S. government struck a deal for an experimental vaccine being developed by Pfizer and partner BioNTech SE that secures enough to innoculate 50 million Americans for about $40 a person.

Sinopharm’s Liu did not mention whether China’s state-backed nationwide insurance program would cover some of the vaccine costs for consumers, or whether it could be included in the country’s free vaccination scheme.

China National Biotec Group (CNBG), a Sinopharm unit, has moved two vaccine strains using the same method into human trials. Its plants in Wuhan and Beijing combined could make over 200 million doses of the drug annually.

As news emerged that Russia had approved the world's first such vaccine, Dr. Theresa Tam said she is as anxious as anyone for a safe and effective vaccine to be ready, but that getting one quickly doesn't mean compromising safety.

""Getting this done in record time is no easy feat, as we must ensure any vaccine demonstrates the highest standard of safety and effectiveness,"" Tam said at a media briefing in Ottawa.

""There are many steps and partners across research, government and industry required to produce and deliver a safe and effective vaccine. All steps and partners are crucial. Nothing gets cut.""

Tam said for Canada, fast-tracking a vaccine means trying to do some things at the same time. That could mean while a vaccine candidate is still in its third and final clinical trial phase, governments are developing plans to produce, distribute and administer that vaccine if it gets approved.

Scientists both within Russia and outside it sounded alarm at the early approval of the Russian vaccine, which was developed by the Gamaleya Institute in Moscow and Russia's ministry of defence. Russia's health ministry claimed that the vaccine, which modifies a common cold virus to try and mimic the novel coronavirus, will make someone immune to COVID-19 for up to two years.

But Russian scientists have published no data on the evidence to back that up.

Tam would not comment on Russia's vaccine at all because she said she doesn't have enough information about it.

Her deputy, Dr. Howard Njoo, said there is just not much information available about how effective that vaccine has been, any side effects it had for the people it was tested on, or how many people were involved in those trials. He said one of the only indicators is the amount of time that passed between the discovery of the vaccine and the decision to approve it.

""It seems quite short, based on what we know about how normally vaccine trials go,"" Njoo said.

Vaccines normally go through at least three phases of testing, with very small numbers of volunteers receiving it in the first two phases. In phase three, the number of people it is tested on grows exponentially. At least two of the vaccine candidates being developed in the United States are testing their product on 30,000 healthy adults in phase three.

The Moscow vaccine appears to have been given approval before any phase three trial, citing enough success in the first two phases.

Tam warned last week that getting a vaccine approved won't be a ""silver bullet"" to stop the pandemic because approval is just the first step. She said Tuesday the success of any approved vaccine will depend heavily on getting Canadians to take it.

The number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada surpassed the 120,000 mark Tuesday, with 8,987 deaths attributed to the disease. Tam says almost nine in 10 patients have already recovered.

There are more than two dozen COVID-19 vaccine candidates in various clinical testing phases around the world, and Tam said eight are in the third and final phase. Most companies behind those trials have said not to expect results until the fall.

Last week, Canada signed deals with two vaccine developers, Pfizer and Moderna, to get access to millions of doses of their experimental vaccines if they succeed at phase three trials and are approved by Health Canada. The earliest either is expected to arrive in Canada for use in patients is next winter.

Tam said she is ""cautiously optimistic"" a vaccine is coming and she has full confidence in Health Canada's approval process to ensure any vaccine Canadians are given is both safe and effective.

Antibodies are proteins the body makes when an infection occurs; they attach to a virus and help it be eliminated. Vaccines work by tricking the body into thinking there’s an infection so it makes antibodies and remembers how to do that if the real bug turns up.

article continues below

But it can take a month or two after vaccination or infection for the most effective antibodies to form. The experimental drugs shortcut that process by giving concentrated versions of specific ones that worked best against the coronavirus in lab and animal tests.

""A vaccine takes time to work, to force the development of antibodies. But when you give an antibody, you get immediate protection,"" said University of North Carolina virologist Dr. Myron Cohen. ""If we can generate them in large concentrations, in big vats in an antibody factory ... we can kind of bypass the immune system.""

These drugs are believed to last for a month or more and could give quick, temporary immunity to people at high risk of infection, such as health workers and housemates of someone with COVID-19. If they proved effective and if a vaccine doesn't materialize or protect as hoped, the drugs might eventually be considered for wider use, perhaps for teachers or other groups.

They’re also being tested as treatments, to help the immune system and prevent severe symptoms or death.

""The hope there is to target people who are in the first week of their illness and that we can treat them with the antibody and prevent them from getting sick,"" said Dr. Marshall Lyon, an infectious disease specialist helping to test one such drug at Emory University in Atlanta.

Having such a tool ""would be a really momentous thing in our fight against COVID,"" Cohen said.

Vaccines are seen as a key to controlling the virus, which has been confirmed to have infected more than 20 million people worldwide and killed more than 738,000. Several companies are racing to develop vaccines, but the results of the large final tests needed to evaluate them are months away.

The antibody drugs are ""very promising"" and, in contrast, could be available ""fairly soon,"" said Dr. Janet Woodcock, a U.S. Food and Drug Administration official who is leading government efforts to speed COVID-19 therapies. Key studies are underway and some answers should come by early fall.

One company, Eli Lilly, has already started manufacturing its antibody drug, betting that studies now underway will give positive results.

""Our goal is to get something out as soon as possible"" and to have hundreds of thousands of doses ready by fall, said Lilly’s chief scientific officer, Dr. Daniel Skovronsky.

Another company that developed an antibody drug cocktail against Ebola — Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. — now is testing one for coronavirus.

""The success with our Ebola program gives us some confidence that we can potentially do this again,"" said Christos Kyratsous, a Regeneron microbiologist who helped lead that work.

Regeneron’s drug uses two antibodies to enhance chances the drug will work even if the virus evolves to evade action by one.

Lilly is testing two different, single-antibody drugs — one with the Canadian company AbCellera and another with a Chinese company, Junshi Biosciences. In July, Junshi said no safety concerns emerged in 40 healthy people who tried it and that larger studies were getting underway.

Others working on antibody drugs include Amgen and Adaptive Biotechnologies. The Singapore biotech company Tychan Pte Ltd. also is testing an antibody drug and has similar products in development for Zika virus and yellow fever.

""I’m cautiously optimistic"" about the drugs, said the nation's top infectious diseases expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci. ""I’m heartened by the experience that we had with Ebola,"" where the drugs proved effective.

What could go wrong?

— The antibodies may not reach all of the places in the body where they need to act, such as deep in the lungs. All the antibody drugs are given through an IV and must make their way through the bloodstream to wherever they’re needed.

— The virus might mutate to avoid the antibody — the reason Regeneron is testing a two-antibody combo that binds to the virus in different places to help prevent its escape.

Skovronsky said Lilly stuck with one antibody because manufacturing capacity would essentially be cut in half to make two, and ""you will have less doses available."" If a single antibody works, ""we can treat twice as many people,"" he said.

— The antibodies might not last long enough. If they fade within a month, it’s still OK for treatment since COVID-19 illness usually resolves in that time. But for prevention, it may not be practical to give infusions more often than every month or two.

A San Francisco company, Vir Biotechnology Inc., says it has engineered antibodies to last longer than they usually do to avoid this problem. GlaxoSmithKline has invested $250 million in Vir to test them.

Giving a higher dose also may help. If half of antibodies disappear after a month, ""if you give twice as much, you will have two months’ protection,"" Lilly’s Skovronsky said.

— The big fear: Antibodies may do the opposite of what’s hoped and actually enhance the virus’s ability to get into cells or stimulate the immune system in a way that makes people sicker. It’s a theoretical concern that hasn’t been seen in testing so far, but large, definitive experiments are needed to prove safety.

""As best as we can tell, the antibodies are helpful,"" Lyon said.

A vaccine would be the kind of significant achievement that would elevate Putin at home and in the international community.

The announcement Tuesday by Russian President Vladimir Putin that his country was the first to approve a coronavirus vaccine did not provoke the awe and wonder of the Soviet Union’s launch of the first satellite into orbit in 1957. Instead, it was met by doubts about the science and safety.

But the claim underscored how, like the space race, the competition to have the first vaccine is about international rivalries as well as science. The first nation to develop a way to defeat the novel coronavirus will achieve a kind of moonshot victory and the global status that goes along with it.

That's valuable to Putin, whose popularity at home has declined amid a stagnant economy and the ravages of the virus outbreak.

""To be the first one out of the block with a coronavirus vaccine would be a real — pardon the pun — shot in the arm for the Kremlin,"" said Timothy Frye, a political science professor at Columbia University who specializes in post-Soviet politics.

Russia is not alone in viewing a vaccine in this light. China, where the virus first emerged, has also raced to make progress on a vaccine. A state-owned Chinese company is boasting that its employees, including top executives, received experimental shots even before the government approved testing in people.

President Donald Trump, whose handling of the coronavirus pandemic has put his political fate in grave jeopardy, is hoping to get credit for his administration’s aggressive push for a vaccine, ideally one that arrives before Election Day in November.

It's far from clear at this point whether Putin has beaten Trump to this medical milestone.

Putin said the Health Ministry gave its approval after the vaccine, named ""Sputnik V,"" underwent the necessary tests. he said one of his two adult daughters had been inoculated. ""We should be grateful to those who have taken this first step, which is very important for our country and the whole world,"" he said.

No proof was offered and scientists in Russia warned that more testing would be necessary to establish it is safe and effective. Nonetheless, officials said vaccination of doctors could start as early as this month and mass vaccination may begin as early as October.

Scientists around the world have been cautioning that even if vaccine candidates are proven to work, it will take even more time to tell how long the protection will last.

""It’s a too early stage to truly assess whether it’s going to be effective, whether it’s going to work or not,"" said Dr. Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton.

It was also too soon to dismiss the Russian claim out of hand.

The country, though economically dependent on the export of natural resources, does have a history of achievement in science, medicine and aerospace — including becoming the first to put a person into space, in 1961.

""It is possible that they concentrated and could do this,"" said Daniel Fried, a retired senior U.S. diplomat. ""I’m not scoffing at it, but it doesn’t mean that the Russian economy is advanced.""

A vaccine would be the kind of significant achievement that would elevate Putin at home and in the international community.

""They would love to be able to claim credit because the first country to develop the vaccine will gain enormous prestige,"" said Fried, a former assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs who is now a distinguished fellow at the Atlantic Council.

It’s also possible Russia had help. The U.S., Britain and Canada l ast month accused hackers working for Russian intelligence of trying to steal information about a coronavirus vaccine from academic and pharmaceutical research institutions.

In any case, the public is eager for a vaccine as global deaths from the virus surpass 730,000. Some say they would even welcome one from Russia, provided it passes muster with the Food and Drug Administration, which approves vaccines used in the U.S., and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which recommends who should receive them.

""I can’t take it anymore. I’m getting crazy,"" said Fernanda Henderson, as she strapped her infant into a car seat at a park in the Maryland suburbs of Washington for a break from quarantining at home. ""I don’t think the CDC or the FDA would approve something that is not going to work.""

But to Vesna Jezic, a 79-year-old native of Croatia and immunologist who was taking her grandchildren to the same park, the suspiciously fast progress on the vaccine announced by Putin was reason to be doubtful. ""You can imagine we don’t trust anything that comes from Russia,"" she said.

The Russian president may face similar doubts at home. Frye noted a 2018 Gallup Poll that showed the former Soviet countries have some of the highest rates of anti-vaccination sentiment in the world.

""If it turns out not to work, it would be a real black eye,"" he said.

The United States and Russia concluded two days of arms control talks Tuesday with the two sides still at odds over the U.S. demand to include China in any new treaty but showing signs of a possible willingness to extend the existing New START deal, which expires next year.

U.S. negotiator Marshall Billingslea told reporters after the talks in Vienna ended that “there are some areas of convergence between Russia and the United States, but we do remain far apart on a number of key issues.”

The U.S. argues that any new nuclear arms limitation treaty should cover all types of warheads, include better verification protocols and transparency measures, and be extended to include China, which has been increasing its own arsenal.

China has rejected the idea as an American ploy to avoid a new deal and said that it would gladly participate if the U.S. would agree to nuclear parity among all nations. China was invited to participate in the Vienna talks but did not send a delegation.

Russia, meanwhile, has said that if China is part of a new treaty, Britain and France should also be included.

The Russian representative to international organizations in Vienna, ambassador Mikhail Ulyanov, tweeted a comment from Russia’s negotiator saying that due to the “non-readiness” of the two western European countries to join a new arms pact, the “U.S. and Russia should concentrate on [the] bilateral track.”

The New START treaty was signed in 2010 by then-U.S. president Barack Obama and then-Russian president Dmitry Medvedev. The pact limits each country to no more than 1,550 deployed nuclear warheads and 700 deployed missiles and bombers.

After both Moscow and Washington withdrew from the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty last year, New START is the only remaining nuclear arms control deal between the two countries. It’s set to expire in February, 2021, unless the parties agree to extend it for another five years.

Russia has offered an extension without any conditions. Mr. Billingslea indicated the U.S. was willing to talk about an extension but only if there were a politically binding framework for making changes to New START, which he called “deeply flawed.”

Mr. Billingslea said modifications were needed to the exchange of telemetry information – the data generated during missile flight tests – and to address how quickly inspectors could be sent to a site, and the frequency of inspections, among other issues.

He said the agreement would also have to cover all nuclear warheads, including the short-range and tactical-range missiles being built by Russia.

“If we can fix these things, and if we can address all warheads, and if we do so in a way that’s extendable to China, ultimately, then we would be prepared,” Mr. Billingslea said. “Again, it’s [U.S. President Donald] Trump’s decision. We’re not going to take a bad deal back to him, but we would recommend that we consider, that he consider, an extension of the New START treaty this year.”

Commenting on the prospects of the pact’s extension, Russian deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov, who led Russia’s delegation to the Vienna talks, said “the chances aren’t great, but they still haven’t dried up yet,” according to the Interfax news agency.

A follow-up meeting has not yet been scheduled. Mr. Billingslea said one could take place in as little as two weeks but that “the ball is in Russia’s court; we’ve signalled what we need to see.”

“We have a mandate from President Trump, and it’s going to be important that the next meeting the Russian delegation also have the same mandate,” he said. “I think our two leaders really have had all the necessary discussions to get there.”

The worldwide count of known COVID-19 infections climbed past 20 million on Monday, with more than half of them from just three countries: the U.S., India and Brazil, according to the tally kept by Johns Hopkins University.

The average number of new cases per day in the U.S. has declined in recent weeks but is still running high at over 54,000, versus almost 59,000 in India and nearly 44,000 in Brazil.

In other developments Tuesday:

— Russia became the first country to approve a vaccine against the virus. While a proven coronavirus vaccine would be an epic medical breakthrough, the move raised alarms among scientists because the shots have not been subjected to large-scale testing in humans. They have only been studied in dozens of people, not the thousands typically involved.

— The Big Ten and Pac-12 announced they won’t play football this fall because of the virus, taking two of college sports’ five powerhouse conferences out of the season. The Big Ten includes Ohio State, Michigan, Nebraska and Penn State, while the Pac-12 includes Arizona, Arizona State, UCLA, the University of Southern California, Oregon, Utah and Washington.

The severe and sustained crisis in the U.S. — over 5 million cases and 163,000 deaths, easily the highest totals of any country — has dismayed and surprised many around the world, given the nation’s vaunted scientific ingenuity and the head start it had over Europe and Asia to prepare.

South Africa, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, Argentina, Russia and the Philippines round out the list of the top 10 countries contributing the most new cases to the global tally since July 22, according to an Associated Press analysis of Johns Hopkins data through Monday.

The real number of people infected by the virus around the world is believed to be much higher — perhaps 10 times higher in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — given testing limitations and the many mild cases that have gone unreported or unrecognized.

Some of the worst-hit nations have been those whose leaders have downplayed the severity of COVID-19, undercut the advice of health experts and pushed unproven remedies.

President Donald Trump, Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro and Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, for example, all rarely wear masks and have resisted calls for strict lockdowns. Trump and Bolsonaro have promoted the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, even though studies have shown it to be useless against the virus, with potentially deadly side effects.

In the U.S., Mexico and Brazil, testing has been criticized as inadequate. While the U.S. has ramped up testing in recent months, Americans have faced discouragingly long lines and delays in getting the results. In Mexico, 47% of tests are coming back positive, suggesting that only seriously ill people are getting screened.

Contact tracing, which has helped authorities in other countries get a handle on the spread, has also been criticized as insufficient in all three countries.

The U.S., with about 4% of the world’s population, accounts for about 25% of the known coronavirus infections and 22% of the deaths.

Mexico has reported nearly 500,000 cases and more than 50,300 deaths, but the president’s point man on the epidemic, Assistant Health Secretary Hugo López-Gatell, said a full lockdown would prove too costly for people with little savings and tenuous daily incomes.

""We do not want a solution that would, in social terms, be more costly than the disease itself,"" he said.

Cases have begun to rise significantly in Caracas, Venezuela, perhaps one of the world’s least-prepared cities to face the pandemic.

The country has been under a lockdown since March, but limited testing, open defiance of quarantine measures and the return of tens of thousands of Venezuelan migrants from countries with higher caseloads have resulted in a steady expansion that is starting to overwhelm hospitals with scarce supplies.

""What has been successful in other countries is massive testing and isolating the population that is sick,"" said Domingo Subero, 66, an engineer worried about the situation in Caracas. ""Here, neither of those two things is happening.""

Elsewhere around the world, New Zealand, which has been praised for quickly getting the virus under control, reported the first cases of local transmission in the country in 102 days. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said four cases were discovered in a single Auckland household.

The researchers found that 54 per cent of parents planned to vaccinate their children — up 16 percentage points from the previous year.

The study determined parents were more likely to get their child the flu shot if they thought there was potential for the child to catch COVID-19, and if their child was already up-to-date on other vaccinations.

Dr. Ran Goldman, the study's lead author, notes that public health officials around the world are concerned about the potentially harmful combination of COVID-19 and flu season.

In a phone interview with The Canadian Press, Goldman says immunizing children will be ""critical"" in protecting the population from both infections.

He said his team was ""very encouraged"" by the results of the study, but still would like to see a slightly higher proportion of parents willing to give their children the flu shot.

Goldman said the magic threshold for a vaccine to be highly effective is about 70 per cent.

Although he believes that goal can be reached, Goldman said the media and the scientific community must work harder to help dispel myths and disinformation about vaccine use.

""Vaccination is the world’s greatest public health achievement,"" Goldman said, stressing the impact vaccines have had on global mortality rates over the last century.

""If we reach 70 to 80 per cent of the population — not even 100 per cent — I'd be really thrilled.""

Canada’s first research institute dedicated to studying pandemics will help to address the biggest questions about the current global outbreak of disease – and aims to be prepared for the next one.

On Wednesday, the Dalla Lana School of Public Health at the University of Toronto will launch the Institute for Pandemics, which will study how pandemics arise and how to mitigate their effects on health systems and economies.

The institute is supported by a $1-million grant from the Vohra-Miller Foundation, a philanthropic organization based in Toronto.

Adalsteinn Brown, dean of the Dalla Lana School, said pandemics touch on every aspect of life – and in order to create effective health care systems and policies to deal with them, experts from a broad range of fields must be included. But until now, no facility existed in Canada to bring them all together in one place.

It’s why the institute will focus on a holistic approach that brings together epidemiologists, biostatisticians, doctors, nurses, economists, social workers and more. They will work with other institutions and the government of Canada to inform health and economic policy.

“We want to be able to take a Canadian perspective,” Dr. Brown said. “This will allow us to answer important questions ... everything from the sort of masks to use, through to the issue of inequity and who the pandemic is affecting.”

Jennifer Gibson, a bioethics expert with the Institute for Pandemics and director of the University of Toronto’s Joint Centre for Bioethics, said while pandemics have long been an important topic of study in public health, experts weren’t fully prepared for the broad effects of this year’s novel coronavirus.

“Many of our health systems had influenza pandemic plans, and a lot of those had been sitting on the shelf for a period of time. ... None of us really had the experience to know what a total societal response would look like,” she said. “We’ve learned a lot, and this [institute] is a response to the need for that learning.”

Dr. Brown said that in the short term, the experts will focus on how to best move forward in the face of a possible second wave of COVID-19. They’ll address such issues as border closings, how to send children back to school, or the best practices for wearing masks.

But the prospect of another global pandemic is not a question of if, but when, Dr. Gibson said. So while the coronavirus pandemic will be the focus of study in the short term, the aim of the institute is also to be ready for future global contagions, which may not be a long way off.

Countries that hoard possible COVID-19 vaccines while excluding others will deepen the pandemic, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Tuesday, issuing a last-ditch call for countries to join a global vaccine pact.

The WHO has an Aug. 31 deadline for wealthier countries to join the “COVAX Global Vaccines Facility” for sharing vaccine hopefuls with developing countries. Dr. Tedros said he sent a letter to the WHO’s 194 member states, urging participation.

The global health agency also raised concerns that the pandemic’s spread was being driven now by younger people, many of whom were unaware they were infected, posing a danger to vulnerable groups.

Dr. Tedros’s push for countries to join COVAX comes as the European Union, Britain, Switzerland and the United States strike deals with companies testing prospective vaccines. Russia and China are also working on vaccines, and the WHO fears national interests could impede global efforts.

“We need to prevent vaccine nationalism,” Dr. Tedros told a virtual briefing. “Sharing finite supplies strategically and globally is actually in each country’s national interest.”

The European Commission has urged EU states to skirt the WHO-led initiative, citing worries over its cost and speed.

More than 21.9 million people have been reported to be infected by the novel coronavirus globally and 772,647 have died, according to a Reuters tally.

‘NOT TWISTING ARMS’

So far, the COVAX facility has attracted interest from 92 poorer countries hoping for voluntary donations and 80 wealthier countries, a number little changed from a month ago, that would finance the scheme, the WHO said.

Still, some countries are waiting for the Aug. 31 deadline before making a commitment as the facility’s terms are still being finalized, said Bruce Aylward, who leads the WHO’s ACT Accelerator initiative to speed supplies of COVID-19 diagnostics, drugs and vaccines.

“We are not twisting arms for people to join,” Dr. Aylward said. “We’ve had more and more discussions with a broader and broader group of players … to work through what might be the barriers to collaborating – issues around price, issues around timing, issues around national expectations.”

With more than 150 vaccines in development, about two dozen in human studies and a handful in late-stage trials, the WHO said even countries signing bilateral deals boost their odds by joining COVAX.

“Which one will be the candidate that will be successful, we don’t know yet,” said Mariangela Simao, a WHO assistant director for drug and vaccine access. “By joining the facility at the same time that you do bilateral deals, you’re actually betting on a larger number of vaccine candidates.”

COVAX now covers nine vaccine candidates.

The WHO remains worried that infections among younger people are rising globally, putting at risk elderly and sick people in densely populated areas with weak health systems.

“The epidemic is changing,” WHO Western Pacific regional director Takeshi Kasai said. “People in their 20s, 30s and 40s are increasingly driving the spread.”

The World Health Organization has said it is concerned that the coronavirus spread is being driven by people in their 20s, 30s and 40s, many of whom are unaware they have been infected, posing a danger to vulnerable groups. Reuters

Police dragged him through his Apple Daily newsroom in handcuffs Monday to make an example of him: If you dare to crusade for democratization, incarceration awaits.

article continues below

Such is the price of defiance.

The message could not have been clearer. Coming just days after Hong Kong cancelled elections, and mere weeks after Beijing imposed a draconian national security law, his arrest has stripped any last pretense of democracy or autonomy from this former British crown colony.

Lai is incarcerated but not cowed, just as the seven million people of Hong Kong are disenfranchised but unbowed. Prison, he mused, would be a good chance to catch up on his reading.

“I will have the opportunity to read books I haven’t read,” he announced with customary resolve as his arrest loomed.

This is the defiant Lai I came to know during my seven years in Hong Kong running the Toronto Star’s Asia Bureau. He enjoyed the company of foreign correspondents, inviting them for brunch in his sumptuous private garden or a cruise through the harbour on his splendid yacht.

The luxe was merely for show — a side show in status-conscious Hong Kong, a city swimming in affluence and drowning in privation. In truth, he sought out foreign outlets as a vehicle to get the message out that Hong Kong needed the world to keep watch, and keep faith — which is precisely why he provokes the wrath of the authorities today.

Gruff and blunt, disinclined to bluffs or bluster, he remains Hong Kong’s most atypical tycoon and unpredictable publisher.

He makes no pretence of being a public intellectual — unlike Martin Lee, that other aging stalwart of the democracy movement I came to know (both were arrested briefly in April) — because Lai leads from the heart and goes with his gut.

That makes him hard to stop, harder to shut up, and harder still to shut down. The authorities are stopping at nothing, arresting his children and staff while raiding the newsroom to ratchet up every pressure point.

In prison, he might read up on the history of humiliation and intimidation that marked the Cultural Revolution a half-century ago, when the likes of Lai were paraded in the streets with dunce caps so that spectators would stay in line. Monday’s police tactic of punishing a publisher with a “perp walk” in the precincts of his own newspaper is a perfect reprise of Maoist times on the mainland.

The arresting officers are little better than the Red Guards who once did the party’s bidding. They are Hong Kong’s thought police.

It is no accident that a newspaper publisher would be among the most brazen targets of the latest crackdown. The objective is no longer repressing protests, but suppressing thoughts and disrupting democracy.

Lai’s thoughts are not so easily ordered.

Where most of the erstwhile colony’s capitalist elite moves in lockstep with their Communist overlords, Lai is not cut from the same cloth.

His Giordano chain of clothing stores cut a swath through Hong Kong and the mainland with a customer focus that proved revolutionary in its staid time.

Copying the same formula, his upstart tabloid gave readers what they wanted — starting with salacious coverage of a secretive elite, progressing to spirited exposés on corrupt politicians, culminating with an unabashed crusade for democracy in one of the world’s most literate yet least liberated polities. He replicated the formula yet again in Taiwan — another safe space for a free Chinese press — where he could torment politicians with impunity.

Until he couldn’t. Lai escaped China at age 12 to escape dictatorship, only to find himself in its embrace all these years later at the age of 71 as Communist rule reasserts itself.

In the 1984 Sino-British Declaration, Beijing guaranteed 50 years of autonomy and democratization upon the 1997 handover, under the rubric of “One Country, Two Systems.”

Two weeks ago, Hong Kong announced a one-year delay in scheduled September legislative elections (with limited powers, it must be noted) — on the pretence of a COVID-19 crisis, but in reality to thwart the momentum built up by pro-democracy candidates.

Imagine if everyone else on the planet postponed democracy until further notice, pending production of a vaccine years from now. Chinese authorities seem more interested in inoculating Hong Kong from the democracy virus than protecting it from a pandemic.

Not even in Donald Trump’s America is there serious talk of rescheduling elections. Which is why a coalition of concerned countries — notably Canada, the U.S., U.K., Australia and New Zealand — has condemned the latest developments while imposing restrictions on Hong Kong trade and consular links.

Canadians are especially seized of Hong Kong’s fate, given the hundreds of thousands of people who immigrated here after 1997. Equally, hundreds of thousands of Canadian citizens live as expatriates in Hong Kong, mindful of China’s growing ruthlessness — not least the ransoming of Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig, still imprisoned as retaliation for the Huawei affair.

No one expects Beijing to be deterred any time soon by foreign pressure, least of all Lai. But that doesn’t mean this maverick publisher is about to bend to local coercion, or that the voters of Hong Kong will ever be satisfied with anything less than the elections they have demanded on the streets for decades.",878,0.5434566954751238,politics

The Canadian government is being urged to do more than issue written condemnation of China’s crackdown on Hong Kong, but a governing Liberal MP says he’s concerned how further action might imperil efforts to free two Canadians locked up by Beijing.

A parliamentary committee holding hearings Tuesday on the deterioration of civil rights in Hong Kong was pressed to support measures that could help Hong Kongers, including offering safe haven to asylum seekers here. Canada has released several statements of concern about Hong Kong and suspended an extradition treaty with the former British colony in July.

“It is not enough to call out Beijing’s violations – it is critically and urgently important to put an end to the extraordinary sense of impunity Beijing continues to enjoy for wide-scale state-sponsored human rights violations,” Sophie Richardson, China director of Human Rights Watch, told the House of Commons special committee on Canada-China relations.

A number of Canadian advocates for democracy in Hong Kong and human rights campaigners raised the idea of sanctioning Chinese officials responsible for human rights violations there. The United States last week imposed sanctions on Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, and 10 others.

Canada must resist the temptation to sink into a new cold war with China

They proposed that Canada use the Justice for Victims of Corrupt Foreign Officials Act, also known as the Sergei Magnitsky Law, to sanction officials. It’s named after a Russian tax expert who was tortured and died in a Moscow prison after uncovering fraud in Russia.

Aileen Calverley, the co-founder of British-based Hong Kong Watch, said sanctions could make life difficult for Hong Kong officials, telling MPs the partners of the city’s Secretary for Justice Teresa Cheng and Secretary of Education Kevin Yeung have Canadian citizenship, and the Secretary of State for Home Affairs, Caspar Tsui Ying-Wai, owns property in Canada.

However, Peter Fragiskatos, a London, Ont., member of Parliament with the governing Liberal Party, raised concerns during Tuesday’s hearings about how tougher action on Hong Kong might anger China and jeopardize Canadian attempts to free Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor.

The two men were detained by Chinese authorities in what was widely seen as retaliation shortly after Canada arrested Huawei Technologies executive Meng Wanzhou on a U.S. extradition warrant. The pair were subsequently charged with espionage and more than 600 days later remain incarcerated.

“If the government of Canada was to move ahead in that direction, I wonder about the consequences for Canadians in China, namely the two Michaels,” Mr. Fragiskatos said.

“If Canada was to take dramatic action along those lines, what is the prospect for those two individuals. ... Is it reasonable to suggest and assume that it would dramatically diminish the prospect of the release of Mr. Kovrig and Mr. Spavor?”

Alex Neve, secretary-general at Amnesty International Canada, told MPs the best way for Canada to take action is as part of a bigger coalition.

“To go down that road is inevitably going to be much more successful if it’s done on a multilateral basis, that it isn’t just Canada ... as one of a very small handful of states pursuing this,” he said.

The first of several Commons meetings on Hong Kong was held one day after the arrest in Hong Kong of newspaper owner Jimmy Lai, whose Apple Daily publication is sharply critical of Beijing and a major champion of the pro-democracy movement.

The move against Mr. Lai is the latest feature of Beijing’s clampdown against pro-democracy opposition in the city. China imposed a sweeping new security law on Hong Kong on June 30, drawing condemnation from Western countries.

Davin Wong, director of youth engagement and policy initiatives at Alliance Canada Hong Kong, an umbrella group of pro-democracy advocates in Canada, pleaded with MPs to consider the deep and long-standing ties between this country and the former British colony.

More than 300,000 Canadians live there and, during the Second World War, nearly 2,000 Canadian soldiers fought and died for the territory – a contribution to the city’s defence that ultimately claimed more than 550.

Mr. Wong noted the new national security law – which targets “subversion,” “secession” and “collusion with foreign forces” – is extraterritorial, meaning it applies to anyone, anywhere in the world. China has signed extradition treaties with nearly 60 countries around the world and has already issued warrants for six overseas critics under the new Hong Kong national security law.

“This committee should pay attention to Beijing’s long arms and the interference that is already effectively undermining our freedoms in Canada,” he said.

Richard Kurland, a Vancouver-based lawyer, said suspending Canada’s extradition treaty with Hong Kong was a practical move. “Under Beijing’s new security law, the potential for a large number of extradition requests looms large. Charter of Rights challenges to these requests would likely shut down every extradition case, so why bother having the extradition treaty?”

TODAY’S HEADLINES

The Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement that Justin Trudeau has “full confidence” in Finance Minister Bill Morneau. However, sources tell The Globe that a cabinet shuffle is in the works and Mr. Morneau’s position is not safe.

Toronto lawyer Annamie Paul has raised the most money so far in the Green Party leadership race, which continues until October.

Human-rights advocates are urging Canada to do much more in opposition to China’s crackdown in Hong Kong.

Ten years after the MV Sun Sea arrived on the B.C. coast carrying hundreds of Tamil migrants wanting to apply for refugee status in Canada, many cases are still not resolved. One man who received refugee status in 2018 told The Globe he was dismayed to see how quickly cases of Syrian refugees were processed given that, at that time, his own claim had not yet been dealt with.

And Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has picked Kamala Harris as his vice-presidential candidate. Ms. Harris, a senator from California and former state attorney-general, is seen as a strong fundraiser who will bring a jolt of energy to the campaign.

Campbell Clark (The Globe and Mail) on Trudeau’s statement of support for Morneau: “That will be familiar to sports fans, who will recognize it as the kind of thing the general manager says the day before the coach gets fired.”

Andrew Coyne (The Globe and Mail) on Trudeau, Morneau and the entrance of Mark Carney: “How much better for both men for Mr. Morneau to exit over a question of policy, allowing each to simultaneously claim the high ground: as either the last voice of relative fiscal sanity in this government, or the author of a bold new vision of federal activism – with help from the most admired central banker of his generation.”

Robyn Urback (The Globe and Mail) on Canada’s lack of retaliation to China’s aggressive moves: “Just about the only action Canada has taken over the past several months was to suspend the Canada-Hong Kong extradition treaty after the passage of the national security law, and to stop exporting certain military items to Hong Kong. But in that case, Canada had no choice: To not take action would have been to compromise our own national security. Yet to Beijing’s other abuses, including those that directly affect Canadian citizens (hundreds of thousands of whom live in Hong Kong), Canada just sputters some words.”

Sharon Davis-Murdoch, Charisma Grace and Jalana Lewis (CBC) on addressing anti-Black racism in the health-care system: “Yes, people of African descent are genetically predisposed to diabetes, but the challenges go beyond ethnicity. They are related to social determinants of health, including lived experience of systemic racism, distrust of the health system, higher rates of poverty and rural isolation.”

Nam Kiwanuka (TVO) on Ontario’s school reopening plan: “How did the government actually prepare for this upcoming school year? By all accounts, everything will be much the same as it was this past school year, with a few tweaks. Class sizes will be the same. Having students in high school going only every other day is a glaring example of phoning it in.”

The U.S.-China dispute just took a dangerous turn. Late last week, the U.S. government issued three separate measures – two executive orders imposing sanctions on social-media networks WeChat and TikTok, and another to set up a “clean network” program – that, come mid-September, would prohibit any U.S. citizen or company from conducting business with those apps’ Chinese parent companies, Tencent and ByteDance respectively.

While these efforts take aim at legitimate security concerns, the hawkish measures were surely intended, at least in part, to strengthen President Donald Trump’s chances of winning re-election in November. Given the bipartisan support for national-security pressure on China, the orders may well prove helpful in that regard.

Story continues below advertisement

But the three measures’ wider effects are far more consequential, including for Canada. If fully implemented, they could eviscerate the foundations of a free and open internet, strengthen authoritarian governments and hasten the unravelling of the economic interdependencies that powered the most successful half-century in human history. And while it will be virtually impossible to enforce these orders, which are already facing legal challenges, the damage is already being done. Indeed, by signing these orders, the U.S. government has effectively ended its long-standing role as guarantor of a free, interoperable and neutral global internet.

Mr. Trump’s political pyrotechnics – part of a years-long strategic campaign against Beijing that includes tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of Chinese products, restrictions on Chinese technologies, and sanctions against Hong Kong and Beijing officials – may not even achieve their intended ends. Paradoxically, this latest crackdown threatens to actually hurt U.S. corporations and speed up deglobalization. After all, China makes up roughly 19 per cent of global GDP in a deeply interconnected global economy, so e-commerce companies such as Amazon will need to rethink how to source the hardware and software that power their global cloud infrastructures, while companies that partner with ByteDance and Tencent could experience devaluation and retaliation. Tencent is one of the world’s largest tech firms, with stakes in video-game studios, social-media apps and music companies around the world. U.S. companies, including Visa, Mastercard and Starbucks, also use WeChat’s e-commerce functions in China, and they may be forced to reconsider their footprint there.

The executive orders might also normalize governmental control over the flow of information into and out of their jurisdictions. In recent years, autocratic governments in North Korea, Russia, India and Belarus, among others, have hived off their citizens’ access to the internet, and this “splinternet” will have dangerous implications for digital and human rights.

Further, Chinese President Xi Jinping stands to benefit from U.S. sabre-rattling. Regardless of whether ByteDance and Microsoft make a deal to acquire at least some part of TikTok before next month’s deadline (unless Twitter beats them to it), Mr. Xi will almost certainly feel empowered to take reciprocal actions, including stepping up interference efforts in the coming U.S. elections (as some believe is already occurring). As the second-largest holder of U.S. debt, China could also dump bonds, increasing interest rates for the battered U.S. economy. This might negatively affect China’s trade balance in the short-term, but could also hurt Mr. Trump’s prospects for re-election.

Perhaps most worryingly, Mr. Trump’s orders undermine the role of the United States as the lead defender of digital freedoms, open innovation and the wider digital economy. The contest over the future of the internet will not just be between the U.S. and China; other countries will likely join the chorus to overhaul the internet. China is unlikely to sit idly by and could work with allies to enact similar restrictions on foreign operators. And the potential ascendance of this techno-nationalism will devastate political, social and economic relations just about everywhere.

Canada can help combat this trend by defending an internet that benefits everyone. This is not just a political imperative; it is an economic priority. Today, we rank as one of the most digitally advanced countries in the world, and yet Canada’s IT sector is still dependent on technologies and cloud resources whose origins and operators lie beyond its borders. Mr. Trump’s latest gambit exposes the vulnerability of Canadians to tariffs on data transit across Chinese-owned fibre-optic cables, and to sanctions that could cut off access to critical cloud providers. Such scenarios seem far-fetched, but that was once the view of U.S. sanctions on Canadian exports under national security auspices, too. And Canada’s Nortel, once a global leader in telecommunications, collapsed in part because of Chinese cyberespionage.

The next chapter of the internet will be written in 2020. As the U.S. and China battle over internet supremacy, middle powers risk being roadkill along the information superhighway. For better or worse, the internet has propelled unparalleled advancements in science, education, political expression and economic prosperity – values that Canada has embraced. If the world truly needs more Canada, then standing up for a free and open internet is not just in Canada’s interest, but the world’s.

‘We are all choking’: Hong Kong media mogul Jimmy Lai speaks out after arrest

Calls for further action on Hong Kong spark concern over impact on detained Canadians in China

Canada condemns arrest of Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai as erosion of press freedom

The MPs were also cautioned that any member of the committee – or any Canadian – could be charged under the new law, which is worldwide in scope. China has extradition agreements with more than 35 countries.

Witnesses included Samuel Chu, a U.S. activist who was charged under the new law even though he lives in the United States. Chinese state media reported last last month that arrest warrants had been issued for him and five other overseas pro-democracy activists, including Nathan Law, who has fled Hong Kong for London.

“Every provision of the national security law applies to everyone outside of Hong Kong,” Mr. Chu told the committee, which is holding hearings on the law.

“Nobody is beyond its reach; not me, an American living on U.S. soil, and not the 300,000 Canadians living and working in Hong Kong itself.”

Mr. Chu noted that several Hong Kongers have been charged under the law in connection with posts they made on social media.

He said he now must avoid countries that have extradition treaties with China or even just friendly relations. And he must prevent family members being drawn into this.

“I cannot speak to my elderly parents in Hong Kong without opening them up, or subjecting them, to investigation and invasive searches by the police,” he said.

Michael Davis, a former law professor at the University of Hong Kong, told the MPs Article 38 of the new legislation says the law applies not only in Hong Kong but to offences “committed outside the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region ... by a person who is not a permanent resident of the region.”

He told MPs that merely talking in hearings with a witness who calls for sanctions against Hong Kong, for instance – or, as the law says “provokes ... hatred” towards the Chinese government – is grounds for charges.

“Unfortunately, this committee could also be tarred with that,” said Prof. Davis, who is a global fellow at the Wilson Center in Washington and a senior research scholar with the Weatherhead East Asian Institute at Columbia University.

“If we actually advocate sanctions at this moment, we could be charged under the law regardless of the fact we are exercising our freedom of expression.”

Prof. Davis said the law empowers officials from China’s state security and public security bureaus – whom he called “secret police” -- to operate in Hong Kong and seize suspects.

“Under this new law .. if these security officials from the mainland want to, they can take you, render you, to the mainland for trial. So Hong Kongers or foreigners in Hong Kong, including Canadians, if they are arrested under this law, and the mainland officials decide they want to bring you to China, they can do so.”

Annie Boyajian, director of advocacy at Freedom House, a U.S.-based rights watchdog, warned MPs that the new freedom for Chinese security officials could mean that some of the 300,000 Canadians in Hong Kong may fall victim to politically motivated arrests more common in mainland China. While most Canadians know of Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig, who were incarcerated in China in apparent act of retaliation, other cases are not as high-profile.

“Perhaps less well-known is the case of Sun Qian, a Canadian citizen and businesswoman just sentenced in Beijing to eight years in prison for being a Falun Gong practitioner. It is possible these types of arrests could also occur in Hong Kong,” Ms. Boyajian said.

She and Benedict Rogers, a human rights activist who is co-founder and chair of Hong Kong Watch, told MPs that Canadians, particularly those with ties to dissidents, could be stopped from leaving Hong Kong. Authorities have already threatened not to recognize passport documents the U.K. is giving to residents.

“There is certainly a risk that China will threaten to do this, which is why Canada should move quickly to help people while they are still able to leave,” Mr. Rogers said.

Asked if it’s planning to evacuate or repatriate Canadians who live in Hong Kong, a spokeswoman for Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne said the government is prepared to help citizens return home.

“When it comes to the estimated 300,000 Canadians who reside in Hong Kong, the government will continue to provide consular assistance, and stands ready to help any Canadians who wish to return do so,” press secretary Syrine Khoury said in an e-mailed statement.

At the very least, the arrest this week of Jimmy Lai, the outspoken owner of a popular pro-democracy tabloid in Hong Kong, has rallied the territory’s residents against Beijing’s first major attempt to assert its new authority over the former British colony.

It it also a reminder that Beijing’s desire to absorb Hong Kong into the corrupt justice system that keeps Chinese citizens silent on the mainland has not yet been fulfilled, and that there is still time to try to preserve the freedoms that China vowed would continue when it took over the territory in 1997.

Mr. Lai is now out on bail, along with his two sons and four executives from his media company, who were also arrested and charged. He isn’t stashed away in a Chinese jail, the way an accused dissident or alleged threat to national security on the mainland would be.

Instead, the 72-year-old media mogul is using his freedom to speak out against the actions of Beijing and its supporters in the Hong Kong government. His Twitter feed was filled this week with sharp satire and links to Apple Daily pieces critical of China. He is still giving interviews to foreign journalists, and he went ahead with a weekly live online chat in which he discussed his arrest.

“The show must go on!” he tweeted.

Most importantly of all, his newspaper, Apple Daily, is still publishing, even though 200 Hong Kong police officers carried out a garish, nine-hour raid on its newsroom the day he was arrested.

Officers paraded Mr. Lai in handcuffs past his employees, and seized a large number of documents, on grounds that Mr. Lai had violated the controversial new security law that China imposed on Hong Kong as of July 1. The law criminalizes talk of independence and outlaws criticism of the Chinese Communist Party, casting such acts as sedition, terrorism and colluding with a foreign power.

The arrest of a high-profile media mogul and the raid on the Apple Daily newsroom were obvious intimidation and harassment tactics, designed to dampen support for independence in Hong Kong, and silence criticism of Mr. Xi’s regime.

It didn’t work. Hong Kongers lined up to buy the next day’s issue of Apple Daily, which was filled with accounts of the arrests. The tabloid sold 500,000 copies, five times the normal press run. As well, more than 20,000 Hong Kongers bought digital subscriptions in the days after the raid.

Story continues below advertisement

Not only that, the newspaper’s supporters answered social media calls to buy stock in Mr. Lai’s media company, Next Digital. The stock price jumped 1,200 per cent in the two days after the arrests, thanks in part to retail investors who purchased just one or two shares in solidarity. (The share price has since fallen, but it remains up overall on Thursday.)

And Mr. Lai, though scared, is still speaking his mind. Beijing’s attempt to intimidate him has backfired.

There is no doubt Mr. Xi’s henchmen will try again. Beijing has already forced Hong Kong to postpone coming local elections for a year, because pro-democracy candidates were likely to win and might have taken control of the Legislative Council. Beijing has also banned four duly elected pro-democracy LegCo members in a naked attempt to keep its side in control.

The arrest of Mr. Lai and others puts the lie to the claim by Hong Kong’s government that the new security law would only be used to crack down on pro-democracy rioting going forward, and would not be invoked to retroactively go after critics or silence the press.

Above all, China has effectively voided the “one country, two systems” international treaty it signed before it took over Hong Kong in 1997. If the new security law proves unable to intimidate Hong Kongers, no doubt Beijing will do an end run around the territory’s relatively independent justice system, with its bail laws and other inconveniences, and simply start disappearing people like Mr. Lai into mainland jails.

That’s why the world, Canada included, needs to support Mr. Lai and keep the pressure on Beijing. As Mr. Lai said in a recent op-ed in The New York Times, the longer Hong Kong can hold out, the more the world will see “how distrust-worthy China is, how dangerous it is to peace in the world.”

Members of Parliament were warned Monday that an insufficient response from Canada and its allies to the crisis in Hong Kong could embolden the Chinese Communist government in Beijing to one day move against the self-ruled island of Taiwan.

“I remain very concerned that Beijing could draw the wrong conclusions about the international community’s response to Hong Kong, which over time could lead it to extend such an approach to Taiwan,” Evan Medeiros, an American scholar who served on the National Security Council in Barack Obama’s administration, told the Commons Canada-China committee.

“The U.S., Canada and other governments should work in co-ordination to take actions that disabuse Beijing from the belief that it could extend its coercion to Taiwan.”

The Commons committee on Canada-China relations has been holding hearings on Beijing’s crackdown in Hong Kong, where 300,000 Canadian citizens live.

A new national security law imposed by the Chinese Communist Party on the former British colony has chilled political freedoms by creating a cadre of secret police to enforce new vaguely defined offences that carry punishments as harsh as life in prison.

Prof. Medeiros, an expert in Asian studies at Georgetown University, cautioned MPs that he did not regard Beijing’s crackdown on Hong Kong as a prelude to military action against Taiwan. But, he said, China will certainly be taking inventory of how much blowback it received for restricting political freedoms in Hong Kong.

He said he’s concerned that “if there is insufficient solidarity in the West about the situation in Hong Kong, then in the future, if the situation deteriorates over Taiwan, Beijing could come to the conclusion that the costs were worth bearing – that they were really weren’t that high. And that American and Canada and U.K. and Australia would eventually get over it.”

China regards Taiwan as a renegade province and has never renounced the use of force to bring it under Beijing’s control, though most people in Taiwan have shown no interest in being ruled by China. In January, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said: “The unification of the two sides of the strait is a historical inevitability,” according to state-run Xinhua News.

Aside from suspending an extradition treaty with Hong Kong, and ending shipments of certain military goods to the territory, Canada’s response to the deteriorating rights situation there has included two joint statements with the U.S., Britain and Australia and one with the Group of Seven. There have been no requests for Canada to extradite people to Hong Kong over the past five years.

Prof. Madeiros advised Canada to broaden future statements to include Japan, South Korea and European Union countries. And to take co-ordinated action with the U.S. to “signal there are costs for its crackdown.”

MPs were urged to slap targeted sanctions on Chinese and Hong Kong officials responsible for human-rights abuses in the former British colony by using the Justice for Victims of Corrupt Foreign Officials Act, known as the Sergei Magnitsky Law. The U.S. earlier this month imposed sanctions on Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, and 10 others.

Witnesses urged the committee not to enact broad sanctions measures that would hurt Hong Kong’s economy. Sharon Hom, executive director of Human Rights in China, a Chinese non-governmental organization founded by overseas Chinese students and scientists, urged Canadian authorities to consult databases created by Hong Kong support groups.

“When it comes to sanctions, implement them like laser surgery – not hitting them over the head with a baseball bat,” she said.

“Threatening [sanctions] is not enough. You have to follow through,” she told MPs.

Canadian MPs were reminded of how Canada and the United States and other Western allies said little or nothing when warning signs arose in Hong Kong years ago.

China had pledged in a 1984 treaty with Britain – the Sino-British declaration – that it would allow Western-style freedoms including freedom of the press, assembly and speech to continue to flourish in Hong Kong for 50 years after the former colony was relinquished by the British.

Story continues below advertisement

Alvin Cheung, a scholar at New York University’s U.S.-Asia Law Institute, noted however that in 2014, China declared that the Sino-British declaration no longer had any meaning. A Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman in 2017 told journalists that it was now only “a historical document, [and] no longer has any practical significance, and it is not at all binding” on Beijing.

“The failure of the international community – Canada included – to condemn these repudiations has contributed to the climate of impunity under which the People’s Republic of China now operates in Hong Kong,” Mr. Cheung said.

Conservative MP Garnett Genuis, a member of the committee, said: “the defining question for the upcoming committee report on Hong Kong will likely be whether or not to recommend the use of Magnitsky sanctions ... Without real consequences, Chinese state aggression will continue to grow.”

Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne said Ottawa will not tolerate the intimidation of human rights activists in this country by foreign governments after a democracy activist told a parliamentary committee she and her family have faced threats from Beijing over the past year.

But Amnesty International said Wednesday that Canada’s response to rising complaints about bullying by pro-China forces has been hapless, muddled and ineffective.

Parliamentary hearings on Canada-China relations this week in Ottawa included testimony from Canadians of Hong Kong origin, who described threats they’ve received on Canadian soil during the course of their advocacy for democratic rights in the former British colony.

Story continues below advertisement

Cherie Wong, executive director of Alliance Canada Hong Kong, told the Commons committee on Canada-China relations that she has been the target of “death and rape threats,” as well as talk of harming her family, over the past 12 months. At rallies – even on Parliament Hill – pro-Beijing supporters have harassed and threatened those demonstrating in support of Hong Kong. Afterward, the personal information of pro-Hong Kong demonstrators – cellphone numbers, e-mail addresses, photos, class schedules – was published online.

Her experience echoes a May report by Amnesty International Canada and other groups warning that Chinese government officials and supporters of the Communist Party of China are increasingly resorting to “threats, bullying and harassment” to intimidate and silence activists in Canada, including those raising concerns about democracy and civil rights in Hong Kong, and Beijing’s mistreatment of Uyghurs, Tibetans and Falun Gong practitioners.

This intimidation includes threats of sexual violence and other physical violence against targets in Canada, as well as their family members in Hong Kong and China.

Conservative foreign affairs critic Leona Alleslev asked Mr. Champagne on Wednesday in the House of Commons about testimony such as Ms. Wong’s, and whether the government would introduce legislation to fight foreign interference.

“Witnesses at the Canada-China committee stated the People’s Republic of China is actively threatening Canadians on Canadian soil who seek to expose China’s authoritarian agenda. These individuals have been subjected to everything from physical threats, commercial blacklisting and state-backed cyberhacking with no protection from Canada. When will this government introduce legislation to combat foreign influence and protect basic human rights in Canada from aggressive actions of the Chinese Communist Party?” Ms. Alleslev asked.

Mr. Champagne told the Commons that Canada does not allow such intimidation and said Ottawa has been swift to address it.

“Let me be very clear, the safety and protection of Canadians is paramount to this government. We will never allow any form of foreign interference in Canada by state or non-state actors,” the Foreign Affairs Minister said.

He said Canada has acted whenever complaints have arisen. “Every time there have been allegations … we have taken action with the Minister of Public Safety,” he said, and advised Canadians to contact the police if they are being threatened.

“We invite any Canadians who might be subject to any form of such actions that have been described to contact law enforcement authorities and we will always defend the freedom and liberty of Canadians in Canada from foreign interference.”

But Alex Neve, secretary-general at Amnesty International Canada, said the response from Canadian authorities to such complaints has been unco-ordinated and disappointing. He said that in 2017 and again in May this year, Amnesty and other groups in the Canadian Coalition on Human Rights in China published reports on the intimidation and threats, as well as recommendations to address it – but these have received little response.

He said targets of harassment end up discouraged. “Individuals have often found they turn to one agency only to be told to go to another, and yet another, and at the end of the day told, ‘Well, we share the concern, but there’s not really anything that can be done here because it’s not a clear criminal offence,’ or, ‘You don’t have enough evidence.’ ”

The Amnesty-led coalition has recommended establishing a point person and hotline to handle complaints, talking to China about the harassment, and the consideration of a law to counter foreign interference as other countries such as Australia have enacted.

Mr. Neve said the response from the Canadian government, from security agencies and from police “lacks coherence and at the end of the day therefore is entirely ineffective.”

“Individuals experiencing these instances of interference and of threats, including threats of sexual and other physical violence and threats against family members in Hong Kong or in China, are largely left without effective recourse, often unsure where to turn and what to expect,” he said in recommendations provided to the Canada-China committee this week.

“It may be a considerable challenge to counter China’s influence on the world stage, it may be difficult to exert pressure for human rights reform on the ground in China, but there is no excuse for a failure to take robust and decisive steps to counter human rights abuses that may be linked to or backed by Beijing – connected to what is happening in Hong Kong, but taking place here in Canada.”

The Chinese embassy in Ottawa did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

MOMENT IN TIME: AUGUST 18, 1886

Open this photo in gallery Engraving from the 'Illustrated London News' based on a photograph taken by Mr Webster, the Collector of Mangalore, showing a group of British astronomers waiting for a total eclipse at Bekul Fort, or Baikal, in south Canara, India on 12 December, 1871. Universal History Archive/Universal Images Group via Getty Images

Helium is discovered

Helium, the gas that keeps party balloons aloft, is the second most common element in the universe. But until 1868, no one had any idea it existed. Then came the great solar eclipse of Aug. 18, which swept across India and Southeast Asia. Astronomers were keen to study the event with a new tool called the spectroscope, which separates light into its constituent colours. Norman Pogson, director of the Madras Observatory, was one of the few to notice a glowing yellow line in the spectrum of the sun’s atmosphere that he observed during the eclipse. Such lines are produced by different chemical elements, but this one did not correspond to any known substance. French astronomer Pierre Janssen was also watching from India and later learned how to spot the same line without having to wait for an eclipse. So did Norman Lockyer, a British civil servant-turned-scientist and founder of the journal Nature. By year’s end, Lockyer and Janssen believed the mysterious line represented a new element. Lockyer proposed calling it “helium” after Helios, the sun god of ancient Greece. Not until 1895 did chemists provide earthly confirmation of helium – the first and only element discovered in space.

What led to this trash talking, more of which in a moment, was the decision by Prince Harry and Meghan Markle to begin a new life on Vancouver Island. Now I’m not sure that decision still holds — there’s been talk they might prefer Hollywood, a genuinely characterless backwater.

But apparently, the thought of losing what it calls “one of the world’s glamorous couples” was more than the paper could stomach.

Hence we get this: the “relatively young couple seem anxious to escape the restrictions of the UK monarchy … so picking … underpopulated Vancouver Island, with fir trees in every direction, freezing winters and a brief six-week summer might seem understandable … in reality, it’s just plain weird. Instead of Lake Como they’ve got a rocky beach with grey skies overhead ... Have we Brits really upset the Duke and Duchess of Sussex so much they prefer the hum drum [sic] existence of downtown Victoria, with its limited choice of fine dining and trendy cafés?”

And: “If Canada is so fabulous, how come so many famous Canadians live elsewhere?”

Then again: “What cuisine has Canada given the world — apart from maple syrup, bacon and a disgusting dish called poutine, which consists of cheese curds, chips and brown sauce.”

Plus “The average age [Canadians] start drinking is 13 and there’s a huge alcohol problem — maybe it’s the lack of things to do.”

Actually, the country with a “huge alcohol problem” is Britain, where the locals down 20 per cent more per capita than we do.

So let’s turn this around. First off, I’m fairly confident the ex-royal couple fled Britain to get away from outfits such as the Daily Mail, famous for scantily clad “models” and bare-faced rumour-mongering.

As well, if Britain is so fabulous, how come so many Brits live abroad? According to the 2016 census, a third of Canadians list their ethnic origin as English or Scottish.

And sliming weather on Vancouver Island when you’re writing for a newspaper based in England, home to one of the dreariest climates on the planet, takes nerve. The U.K. has been blasted with unprecedented gale-force winds, torrential rain and flooding in recent weeks.

But let’s get to the heart of the matter. I assume the author of this hit piece, Janet Street-Porter, lives in London, where the paper is published. Though in passing, she confesses to having spent two weeks once upon a time on Gabriola Island, where “pooing in a composting toilet has scarred me for life.”

In any event, traffic in London is now so hellish, you have to pay a $20 fee just to drive into town. There are indeed fine dining establishments and trendy cafés, but you would need a bank loan to eat at one.

And don’t think of buying a house — average price $1.4 million for an ancient pile built in the 1800s, with lousy wiring and a kitchen the size of a broom closet. Even a one-bedroom apartment can set you back $3,000 a month in rent.

Mangy foxes roam the streets and even mangier pigeons decorate your parked car with droppings. That is, if you can find somewhere to park it in the first place.

By general agreement, London’s underground — the Tube — is dirty, smelly and crowded, perhaps the worst of its kind in Europe.

And the city’s crime rate, at 96 offences per thousand residents, is 10 times the level on Vancouver Island, and rising rapidly.

In short, life in a “characterless backwater” such as North Saanich is heaven compared with eking out an existence in the concrete jungle Street-Porter calls home.

However, if she cares to pay us a visit, I’m sure we can find her a place with an indoor toilet, something you still can’t count on in that Sceptred Isle.

The phrase quickly became a rallying cry to change course, taking advantage of the break in business as usual.

The serious challenges we currently face include the environmental crisis, pandemics, cyber warfare, terrorism and a renewed nuclear threat, among others. All are global. Our greatest strengths, on the other hand, are dedicated individuals working in common cause. To take a look at our options in aligning our strengths and challenges, we need to exit the news cycle to examine an interesting bit of inconvenient history.

When the UN Charter was created 75 years ago it was reluctantly permitted a concession deemed necessary for the Charter’s acceptance by Stalin’s Russia and the United States Congress, both flush with victory from the Second World War. They, along with France, the UK and China, were given veto power over UN Security Council decisions, effectively giving five nations disproportionate power.

The framers of the 1945 Charter also incorporated plans for a Charter review conference, to be held within 10 years. Unfortunately, the Cold War and inertia set in, and that conference never happened. Many decades later, the United Nations presides with great difficulty over a world still desperately in need of global governance that is just, effective and inclusive.

The need for unity in the international sphere is greater than ever. A belief in that unity has inspired me along with generations of other Bahá’ís. “The well-being of mankind, its peace and security, are unattainable unless and until its unity is firmly established,” said Bahá’u’lláh, the founder of the Bahá’í faith. “It is not for him to pride himself who loveth his own country, but rather for him who loveth the whole world. The earth is but one country, and mankind its citizens.”

That idealistic spirit is alive and well. A young generation of problem-solvers from every background has arisen around the world, often motivated by environmental concerns. Together First, Common Home for Humanity, Ocean Unite, Simpol and Democracy Without Borders are incredibly promising international initiatives. If we’re to move forward together, we need to give such organizations our full attention.

The visceral, entertaining forms of politics make the news, but it’s the quiet, hard-working efforts that tend to change the course of history. Unfortunately, disillusioned with corruption and polarization, many believe that things were just fine before we had global problems and global institutions, if only we could turn back the hands of time – although they weren’t and we can’t.

The drama plays out against a backdrop of cynicism and despair, which in itself hampers progress. Still, enormous changes can begin almost imperceptibly. Beginning in 1993, Canada was followed by the European Parliament, the PanAfrican Parliament and the World Federation of United Nations Associations, all calling for the establishment of a UN Parliamentary Assembly (UNPA) to help correct the “democratic deficit” in global decision-making. The UNPA Campaign may provide a solution to decades of broken environmental promises, since democracy is essential to a legitimate capacity to enact laws.

There are several proposed routes towards bringing greater justice and the rule of law to the international sphere. (See the Times Colonist 5 August article in the online Spiritually Speaking blog for links.) The United Nations needs to follow its advice and “Build Back Better”, with support and assistance from civil society. It’s up to us, as world citizens, to pay attention and do what we can.

Of note is the fact that even the local reptiles are aware it is the safest commuter route in the area just as it is.

Re: “Amid pandemic, hate is the dominant emotion being expressed,” Aug. 13.

Kudos to Grant McKenzie for speaking up. I agree that we are seeing more anger and intolerance from the general public right now.

People feel helpless in the new COVID-19 world.

People are forgetting pandemic rules

I am disgusted that people in B.C. seem to have forgotten all the things we did at the start of this pandemic.

We had low numbers under Bonnie Henry’s leadership.

Get back to the way we were behaving, people, as we are going in the wrong direction.

To the young people who feel their lives have been too constricted, your partying is costing lives and people’s suffering. Let’s hope that some of the growing numbers aren’t your friends and family.

How would you feel if a parent or grandparent died because you needed some face time with your friends. Think selfish.

Community events should be banned

So, as was the case after Canada Day, the COVID-19 incubation period following the August long weekend, seems to have now resulted in a spike in new cases “from community events.”

Will the premier and health officials do the logical thing and ban community events for Labour Day — distasteful as that is — or are they comfortable with “it is what it is”?

Like Woodlands in New Westminster, and Tranquille near Kamloops, it housed men, women, and children with intellectual disabilities.

People with intellectual disabilities may, like the general population, have mental health issues; however, they are more often living with Down’s Syndrome, cerebral palsy or other significant brain injuries.

When these institutions were closed their residents were successfully accommodated in their local communities with their families or in community living facilities with appropriate living and life supports.

Let’s not confuse those living successfully with intellectual disabilities with those who are struggling with homelessness and profound mental health issues.

The latter need the same level of support in a different and I think more challenging societal context!

Time to clean Government Street

Government Street is looking so sad. The restaurant street patios look tawdry. And when was the last time a street cleaner hosed things down? Do the patios prevent that?

Seagull poop mixed with dead leaves and trash. Overheard at one of those restaurant patios, “It’s so dirty here!”

Spot on!

Back to school with tents across the street

I live in James Bay and have experienced the effects of the tent encampment in Beacon Hill Park.

I agree the homeless problem is the result of gaps in our social safety net.

Classes will resume in September at South Park school under the cloud of the pandemic. The situation across Douglas Street from the school is another reason the encampment must be moved.

Children, in some cases starting school for the first time, are the most vulnerable members of our society. The stress, risk and danger to children attending South Park needs to be mitigated.

If even one child is injured or scared by the encampment residents, we have all failed.

Vandalism needs to be condemned

The B.C. border has not been closed by public health authorities. All Canadians including Albertans have the right to travel in B.C. while abiding by local public health protocols without being subject to vandalism and harassment.

B.C. residents who vandalize vehicles of Albertans in B.C. are committing crimes.

Premier John Horgan’s failure to condemn such crimes and harassment by some B.C. residents and his absurd admonishment to Albertans to change their licence plates or use public transit is appalling and irresponsible.

It is a Trump-style dog whistle condoning acts of vandalism and harassment by B.C. residents against Albertans.

Horgan fails to heed the advice of health officer, Dr. Bonnie Henry, to “be kind, be calm, be safe.”

Horgan and many B.C. residents suffer from the delusion that B.C. is for the exclusive benefit of B.C. residents.

Horgan’s statements reflect a parochial politician risen to the level of his own incompetence and they reflect what is wrong with Canada.

There has been a long standing and ongoing failure of leadership by the prime minister and provincial premiers in finding any national purpose or interest beyond the backyards of provinces.

So long as premiers like Horgan are in office, Canada is no more than a confederation of provincial backyards.

Dysfunction-By-The-Sea is truly a place in Backward Columbia. Try Suicide Lanes by the Sea. Yes, the City of Victoria seems to want to solve problems that do not exist. Longtime residents of Victoria can remember the giant traffic circle at the Douglas-Hillside-Gorge intersection. According to those who are still alive, it worked very well. Traffic flowed in one direction, eliminating the dreaded head-on and T-bone crash potential. This functioning roundabout was replaced with a brand-new toy, signalized traffic lights. Proving once again you can always tell an engineer, but not very much. Giving up on a proven technology in favour of an unproven new toy is their eternal fault. Their heralded advancements are much appreciated, but every so often, they overreach. Frankly, we cannot live without engineers, but every so often, we could do without their shiny new toy.

article continues below

The ultra-brand-new toy is the shared lane insanity about to be hoisted upon an unsuspecting commuting public.

The one-block trial, where a single lane, referred to as a Suicide lane in the old days, is intended to serve opposite motor vehicle directional travel. Once a driver comes face-to-face with another car driver in the single provided road lane, it is expected that each would swerve right. This action takes the drivers into the well-marked, same direction, painted bike lanes on each side of the street.

By the way, bike riders are not restricted to these well-marked bike lanes. Drivers will not only have to make a right shoulder check before moving right from the suicide lane, but also check their left shoulder before returning to the suicide lane, since bike riders are not restricted to bike lanes.

I have nothing against bikes. I like bike riders. The more bike riders, the fewer cars needed to get from A to B. This odd new toy will be especially difficult for visitors to our city. Who in their right mind, would choose a city block, with a major hotel complex, to do a first run of this unnecessary matrix? What do visitors to the hotel think? Is this block of Humboldt street a high crash site? Is it the location of fatal crashes?

Richardson Avenue is another future disaster in the making. The plan is to do the same configuration on this commuter arterial. Crash rates and vehicle volume do not justify the proposed suicide-lane modifications. Residents are up in arms and cyclists are not of one mind when it comes to these revolutionary changes.

• If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it! This phrase comes to mind when referencing not only Richardson, but also Vancouver street. Richardson is a connector street, and a low stress way to get to and from the Tweed Curtain, known as Oak Bay. The death rate on Richardson must be astronomically high for such changes to be proposed. It is not!

The Vancouver Street directional changes are different than others referenced. The plan is to do major capital expense, namely concrete and stationary construction, in order to physically block and re-route motor vehicle traffic. Vancouver Street will no longer be a through street for motor vehicles. The 4,000 to 5,000 vehicles using the street will be diverted to Quadra or Cook. These streets are already stressed during morning and afternoon commutes.

Why are any of these projects being considered at this time of municipal financial crisis?

City council would be wise to delay in this time of a never before experienced financially stressful pandemic.

“We have temporarily closed the store to thoroughly clean and sanitize the location. We plan to reopen the store on or before Aug. 17, 2020, in consultation with the Vancouver Island Health Authority.”

The incident is one of the first on Vancouver Island where a business has been closed due to a positive test for an employee. Infection rates are low on Vancouver Island. The website for Island Health, which provides updates on the locations and times of known possible exposures to COVID-19 in the region, did not mention the 7-Eleven case on Saturday afternoon.

“Contact tracing from Island Health’s Public Health team ensures anyone potentially exposed to a confirmed case is followed up with,” a representative from Island health said in a statement.

“When public health officials cannot be certain they have reached all those who need to be contacted and there may be a risk to the public, they issue a public notification. We have no public notifications to issue today.”

A sign on the front door of the 7-Eleven at 1327 Douglas St. said the location was “closed for cleaning,” but made no mention of COVID-19. The sign asked customers to visit nearby 7-Eleven locations for service. By late afternoon, the glass door had been covered entirely with brown paper, cutting off views into the store.

Representatives from delivery services Uber Eats and Skip the Dishes, which are listed as delivery options on the sign, did not respond to requests for comment Saturday. It is unclear if the services had drivers visit the location during the five-day window when the employee had indications of the virus.

7-Eleven Canada said in a statement that staff at the closed Douglas Street location have been asked to self-isolate with pay. The Irving, Texas-based company has 636 stores in Canada.

Effort of 2 men in dog rescue is inspiring

“Dog rescued from cave, reunited with owners three months after becoming lost,” Aug. 12.

I want to thank the Times Colonist for bringing us the story about the rescue of Stella the dog by Zach Regan and Matt Johnson. In these anxiety inducing times their story is just the tonic we need. It gave us the chance to marvel at the determination and perseverance of two young men who put a lot of effort into doing the right thing.

Not only did they go to great inconvenience and some risk to bring the dog off the beach, but they also followed up by making the extra effort to contact the non-profit ROAM group that reunites owners with their missing pets. And then to find out that the owners had lost the dog on their honeymoon hike, leaving a dark cloud on what should be a happy time, made the rescue and reunion all the more poignant.

Zach said it was the best outcome he could have hoped for and it was the best outcome for all the TC readers too. You gave us the gift of an uplifting story of hope just when we needed it most!

Out on trail, keep dogs on leash

Fortunately this saga had a happy ending. Zach Regan and Matt Johnson are true heroes for rescuing Stella from where she was trapped on the Juan de Fuca Trail.

Dogs are meant to be on-leash on the Juan de Fuca Provincial Park trail for good reasons — protection of wildlife, maintaining the integrity of the trail environment, as well as for the protection of the dogs and others. This is a rugged hike with many potentially treacherous areas and drop-offs if one ventures off the designated trail.

Even a well trained dog will “take off” to chase an animal or if frightened by something in the wilderness, especially an unfamiliar dense wilderness. Many people think their dog will stick with them, but dogs will be dogs. Those of us who live in the rural areas see many poorly controlled dogs off-leash in our parks and on our trails, which is increasing with everyone heading out of town to the country during the pandemic.

As a dog owner, I can imagine the anguish the owners would have suffered after losing Stella. But my sympathies are more with Stella, and I shudder to think what she endured over the three months she was missing. It is up to us to make sure our pets are managed safely.

Restaurant servers should wear masks

Over the last few weeks my wife and I, both seniors have ventured out to some of our favourite places for lunch. Of the four that we visited we would only consider returning to one. All had very good signage, tables well spaced apart and sanitized before use and also separate entrance and exit.

However, apart from one, the serving staff did not wear masks and stood above us, right next to the table, to take our orders. We are encouraged to wear masks when social distancing is not possible so why not in restaurants? It is important to help our local businesses during these turbulent times but they must make customers feel safe in order to gain our continued support.

Positive attitude will help keep us healthy

Re: “Please focus on the positive,” letter, Aug. 14.

The letter writer invites us to focus on the positive. A good reminder especially during these COVID times.

It brings to mind how much we hear about the “number of cases” in B.C. and the rest of the world. Five months of this makes me feel like I’m being brain-washed.

Have we forgotten the miracles of our bodies? We cut ourselves and the body immediately begins to heal. That is the nature of our bodies – to heal – always wanting to bring itself back into balance and health. But many may feel their bodies have betrayed them.

But where have we betrayed our bodies and not given them what they need in order to be at optimal health? A positive attitude is always important, so perhaps shifting our focus away from the daily COVID numbers and putting our attention on something more constructive, like keeping our bodies healthier, might be a positive use of our time.

They were here illegally

Re: “Dozens gather for 10th ­anniversary of MV Sun Sea arrival,” Aug. 14.

Why is it that the media always seems to make the Conservatives under Stephen Harper sound like “bad guys,” which was exactly what the comment “were labelled by the then-Conservative government as ‘terrorists and illegals,’ ” sounded like.

The people who arrived on the MV Sun Sea were here illegally.

“We were detained, interrogated, stripped of our names and identities,” she said. Yes, they were , that’s what all countries do when someone enters their country illegally. Yes, they were migrants fleeing a war zone and people appreciate that, but they came here illegally and should expect to be thoroughly checked.

Federal Public Safety Minister Vic Toews called some of the passengers “suspected human smugglers and terrorists” and warned about criminal organizations abusing Canada’s refugee system.” That’s what he was supposed to do. Yes, we have to be compassionate for these people, but we also have to follow the rules to make sure Canada is safe.

A lack of cheering for Toronto teams

A friend recently asked why I was not a fan of the Jays/Leafs/Raptors, all Toronto teams that do reasonably well, especially the Raptors who won it all last year. My answer was quite simply that I did not appreciate the fact that all sports reporting in Canada seems to come out of Toronto (with the exception of the Canucks — their coverage in this area is excellent) and as a result we get bombarded by Toronto’s point of view and often with a bias.

Imagine if you will that the head coach of one of Toronto’s teams was rushed to the hospital in the middle of an important playoff series. You can be sure this would be covered by every outlet of the Toronto media, this being a Toronto story.

Last night, the head coach of the Montreal Canadiens was rushed to hospital, in the night following the Habs game with the Philadelphia Flyers. Tonight, on the National, not a single mention was made of this.

However, this story was not about Toronto.

Generic replies from the government

I have been writing to the minister of municipal affairs and housing. The response I receive smacks of a form letter. It doesn’t really address my concerns about providing so many benefits to people who move here who are homeless or addicted to drugs that come here from other provinces.

One of the best climates in the world, where they can camp in beautiful surroundings, while they are provided with all their necessities. Why not move to Victoria?

Clearly, Victoria is attracting large numbers of homeless and drug-addicted because of the support system here. And yet we don’t see decreasing numbers, we see increasing numbers. It seems apparent that the plans in place are not working effectively. The provincial and city governments need to consider another approach.

How their words are heeded

It has little to do with nice Bonnie Henry or stern Minister Dix, but more to do with how their words are heeded.

It is almost heresy to say the least negative remark about our provincial health officer — she has been de facto premier for the past few months .

And she is most often on target with her remarks if sometimes a little condescending. The slavish adherence to heath information that is almost changing daily is also a risky business.

The latest COVID-19 numbers for B.C., third largest daily increase this week since the virus arrived, shows only too clearly that it is the public that must take hold of the advice and practice common sense behaviour.

Canada as a whole and B.C. as well need more testing as well as more contact tracing , evidenced by the fact that the province has just now increased the number of people that will be doing contact tracing .

It might be useful to remind ourselves that virus incidence in B.C. is not the lowest of any province, and that as a country our testing rate is lower that the U.S. testing rate. According to worldometers.info, the U.S. is testing at a rate of 204,000 per million population and Canada at 121,000.

Of course, that is not to say that B.C. has not done well up to now but it is to indicate that we may have been a little complacent given our performance vis a vis the bigger provinces, ignoring perhaps the urban concentration of say Greater Toronto which has 5.9 million people, which is larger than B.C.’s total population of 4.6 million and more than double Metro Vancouver.

Keep Ocean Blvd. closed to cars

I would like to say how very much I and others are enjoying the Ocean Boulevard and Esquimalt Lagoon now that barriers block it from being used as a thoroughfare. Other walkers agree with me that with no cars to avoid, just being there is a peaceful and lovely experience.

I understand that a referendum about keeping it that way was voted on and the cars won out with the result that in September the barriers will be removed and drivers will once again push us park users, walkers, joggers and cyclists to the edges of the road.

Much as I hate using the word in ANY context, commuters should NOT trump families; parks are for people not cars — particularly as this one is also a bird sanctuary. It isn’t as though commuters have no other route to take and no other choice to make.

Everyone I’ve spoken to is just loving the way things have been since the barriers went up and I would like to call for a second referendum to be presented, this one with a lot more publicity than last time, and I think you would find the end result to be in favour of peace and quiet, not for pollution, noise, speeding and verbal abuse.

Please reconsider.

What the premier actually said

Re: “Vandalism needs to be condemned,” letter, Aug. 13

I’m sad to see another letter from an Albertan who has told been told “fake news” in regards to our premier’s statement about out-of-province plates. It includes wrong information about what John Horgan said, as well as other inflammatory statements.

Our premier welcomes our fellow Canadians from Alberta.

I listened to what he said and he berated any British Colombians acting with hate towards visitors and is very sympathetic towards anyone being subjected to harassment. After many statements like this, he mentioned that as an alternative to avoid being vandalized and harassed, visitors could use public transit and newly arrived residents need to update their vehicle registration. I feel the letter writer already had a bias against the premier and used this misinformation against him and I would like to correct that.

It’s more than just the mayor deciding

It is always with great amusement that I read letters to the editor, or articles, berating various elected officials. Lately, the flurry has been over the Richardson bike lanes.

Lisa Helps, as mayor of Victoria, has been on the receiving end of much of the criticism.

I don’t live in Victoria, I don’t vote for their city council, but I would remind the various objectors: Mayor Helps is not a one-person council. Victoria city has nine elected councillors (eight plus a mayor).

Any motion before council, the nasty bike lanes included, need a majority. For all the bike lane development in this city it has been just that: a majority of council voted in favour.

On the most recent bike lane additions, namely Richardson, only two councillors voted against it (Young and Thornton-Joe). That means the mayor alone was not responsible, but seven of the elected council thought it was a great idea. And it doesn’t stop there.

Mayor Helps was not alone in pursuing the rapid bike lane growth in the city. Believe it or not, there is a staff at city that consults and advises. In fact, in the fall of 2019 there was a call for input on the Richardson bike lanes by that very staff.

I’m not a defender of Mayor Helps, just a mere observer. But with just a few moments of your time, a Google search lets you uncover the fascinating world of municipal politics and the voting patterns of all the current council members on the bike lane additions.

I think you may well be surprised to see just who has been variously opposed or in favour. So remember, this is how democracy works — on every level of our government. It’s not a one person show.

People are feeling stressed and fearful

Re: “Amid pandemic, hate is the dominant emotion being expressed,” comment, Aug. 13.

Whilst not saying Victoria, you are in the local paper! How about fear, stress, anxiety and being depressed. You are forgetting during this pandemic we worked together, volunteered, and donated.

If fear and anxiety are projected as anger, you have translated to hate to stop the democratic right to express how we are feeling. Many have lost income, family members and dealing with huge demands on their emotional wellbeing. Long months of lockdown and giving up all our old norms.

Only now to see abuse of our green space, and not even feeling safe in our homes. Even with our personal safety, we cannot take it for granted any more..

In search of peace and quiet

I am wondering where I can go to find peace and quiet because the parks and beaches are inundated with irresponsible pet owners and their unleashed dogs. It’s not that I dislike dogs but I don’t know their dogs and when they come running up to me, sometimes jumping up on me, I do get afraid.

In these times of COVID-19, I need to de-stress in nature and it seems so unfair that I can’t do that without feeling uncomfortable and sometimes afraid.

The dogs also chase and frighten shore birds, which is upsetting to watch.

Then there is also the issue of many plastic dog poop bags that I come across either sticking out of the sand, thrown in the bushes or, worse, into the ocean and lakes.

Make sure your car’s wheel nuts are tight

When I read about the car that lost a wheel because somebody loosened the wheel nuts, I was shocked. But I also wondered how the driver didn’t notice the problem.

A number of years ago a friend of mine rotated his tires and forgot to snug up the nuts on one wheel. Due to the noise coming from the loose wheel he quickly pulled over and discovered the issue.

Whenever you hear odd noises coming from your car, don’t ignore them. Wheel nuts can come loose for a number of reasons, or it could be a wheel bearing failing, both of which could result in you losing a wheel.

So when you hear weird noises, stop and figure out why or call a professional. Ignoring such noises never ends well.

article continues below

But in B.C, in 2020 on at least one particular issue, it struck home. Because by a number of measures, it’s simply true.

NDP critics spent years accosting the former B.C. Liberal government for ignoring homelessness and the drug crisis that is driving much of it. Three years ago they got their chance to show what they could do. Despite a steady blizzard of announcements and news releases about all the expensive new efforts underway, there’s scant evidence that they’re making much progress.

It was North Vancouver Liberal MLA Jane Thornthwaite who made the observation above. She supplied chilling background numbers that bring home the enormity of what’s happening. One of them related to overdoses is particularly acute.

The NDP created a standalone Ministry of Mental Health and Addictions when it took over, with a mandate to make “substantive progress” on an “immediate response” to the opioid crisis. Even before the pandemic struck, the number of overdose fatalities was holding steady. And even though COVID-19 has hit B.C. relatively lightly to date and had much less impact on the street community than you might have expected, drug overdoses deaths are at their highest levels ever. A handful of deaths every single day is the new standard. The only noticeable measure of success is the number of deaths averted. Thornthwaite cited a CBC report that on one day in June, first responders across B.C. dealt with 131 overdoses, presumably saving most of them. She said in July they clocked 2,700 overdose reports, 87 a day.

It’s stunning to realize the potential death toll if hundreds of first responders weren’t out administering thousands of life-saving remedies.

It’s a similar story with homelessness. Despite pouring millions of dollars into new housing — in a controversial, heavy-handed fashion when it comes to Victoria — it’s the same perennial topic of conversation and anxiety among taxpayers it has been for years.

The NDP critics of years past had all the answers. Now they have all the power to implement them, but they aren’t taking effect to the degree they thought they would.

“Homelessness is up,” said Thornthwaite, who has done a lot of committee work on mental health issues. “Community disorder is up. Break-ins are up, vandalism is up, assaults are up, open drug use and drug paraphernalia in parks are up.”

There was new data this week that supported Social Development Minister Shane Simpson’s admission a few weeks ago that homelessness is on the upswing. The point-in-time count in metro Vancouver showed jumps of varying degrees across that region. More striking is that it is spreading across B.C. to the point where virtually every community is grappling with it. Simpson, who left an impression quite different from the one put out by the government’s housing statistics, estimated there are about 40 homeless camps around B.C.

The Opposition has cited dozens of instances of downtown residents and businesses having to deal with the fallout. People are afraid to work alone, they’re witnessing violence and theft on a daily basis, clients have to step over comatose addicts lying in the street and on and on.

All the above and more was presented to Housing Minister Selina Robinson on Monday. Her response was the traditional one used by every first-term government: “Frankly, it’s because B.C. Liberals didn’t do what they needed to do on this file.”

Robinson said they’re starting to make progress and there’s a ten-year-plan. True enough. But four-year governments coming up with ten-year plans is just as silly as a three-year-old government blaming its failures on its predecessors. The NDP in opposition knew how intractable addiction and homelessness issues were, but they left the impression all it would take to ease those two crises was their commitment to make things right.

That impression now looks to be completely erroneous.

Another requirement for an abbreviated season was the CFL and CFL Players' Association agreeing on an amended collective bargaining agreement.
However, none stepped up to provide the funds necessary for a shortened season.
Major League Baseball is running a shortened season, while the NHL, NBA and Major League Soccer have resumed play.","TORONTO — CFL commissioner Randy Ambrosie shoulders the blame for the Grey Cup not being handed out for the first time in more than 100 years.

The CFL cancelled its season Monday due to the COVID-19 pandemic, meaning the Grey Cup won't be presented for the first time since 1919.

article continues below

The decision comes after the CFL was unable to secure financial assistance from the federal government. The league sent Ottawa an amended request Aug. 3 for a $30-million, interest-free loan, but the sides couldn't come to terms on a deal.

It was the CFL's last-ditch effort to stage an abbreviated season in the hub city of Winnipeg. It came after the league asked for $44 million in July.

""I do feel I am responsible for the fact that we are not on the field this year,"" Ambrosie said in a telephone interview. ""But I resolve to learn from what we've experienced and I'm looking forward to a bright future.

""I think we're all watching an example on the world stage today of a leader that takes no responsibility for anything . . . and no matter what happens, I won't be that guy.""

The CFL had maintained it required government funding to stage a shortened season. In late April, Ambrosie told The Canadian Press the league had presented a three-tiered request for financial assistance that began with $30 million initially, more in the event of a shortened season and up to $150 million in the event of a cancelled campaign.

""I regret that . . . I do wish we hadn't thrown that number ($150 million) out,"" Ambrosie said. ""We never asked for $150 million, at least I don't feel we did.

""What we did was aggregate what we thought was the worst-case scenario . . . and we said, 'In the end our problem could be as big as $150 million,' but that became the number.""

Ambrosie had stated the CFL collectively lost around $20 million last season. With no football in 2020, a source familiar with the situation said the league will lose between $60 and $80 million this year.

Ambrosie said he was at a loss to explain why the CFL and government couldn't come to a suitable financial arrangement. But two league sources said the $30-million request fell through when the assistance couldn't be provided to the league under the terms it sought.

The sources were granted anonymity because the league and government haven't discussed certain financial figures publicly.

Last month, the CFL ruled out a loan from the Business Development Bank of Canada because it felt the interest rate was too high.

""I think there were at least a couple of times when for really good reasons we felt like we were on track to be able to do something with the government,"" Ambrosie said. ""And it didn't happen.

""I feel a sense of disappointment but not anger, just sorrow that something that I thought would come together didn't happen.""

Another requirement for an abbreviated season was the CFL and CFL Players' Association agreeing on an amended collective bargaining agreement. The CFL said it was close to a deal when it called off the season Monday.

That's what made the CFL's decision Monday so surprising to CFLPA president Solomon Elimimian.

""It's definitely disappointing and yes, we were surprised,"" said Elimimian, a Saskatchewan Roughriders linebacker. ""We felt like we were making tremendous progress . . . things were moving in a way that led me to optimism, led all of us to optimism.

""From that aspect, when the news came it was definitely tough.""

Six of the CFL's nine teams are privately owned by either wealthy individuals or organizations. However, none stepped up to provide the funds necessary for a shortened season.

""They have complicated businesses outside of their CFL ownership and all of those things have been affected as well (by the pandemic),"" Ambrosie said. ""I don't think it would be fair to harshly judge them when frankly they give and they give and they give.""

Ambrosie said while he's bitterly disappointed, the CFL and its teams have the luxury of time to plan for the 2021 season. However, there's plenty of uncertainty about next season, most notably if CFL fans will be allowed back in the stands.

The CFL is a gate-driven league and its teams depend heavily upon ticket sales to generate revenue. Ambrosie admits he's concerned about what impact the novel coronavirus will have on his league next season.

""Sure I am concerned but I think this is the challenge we're all facing together,"" he said. ""None of us really know what 2021 is going to look like.

""The optimist in me believes the scientific world is going to create a vaccine and we're going to get back to a more normal world. We'll (prepare) for the best, plan for the worst but I believe that good things will happen. You have to wake up with optimism and frankly that's how I'm going to face the challenge.""

Minister of Canadian Heritage Steven Guilbeault said the government tried to work with the CFL.

""Our government helped the CFL navigate through the existing COVID-19 emergency response programs that are helping tens of thousands of businesses across Canada with revenue and liquidity challenges during this time,"" Guilbeault said in a statement.

""Although the league was able to benefit from some of these programs, its board members ultimately made the decision not to pursue the upcoming season.""

Liberal MP Peter Fragiskatos (London North Centre) supported no federal money going to the CFL.

""The federal government made the right decision here,"" he tweeted. ""While the CFL is a very important part of sport heritage, it is not entitled to special treatment.

""Some fans will be disappointed but the league's ask simply wasn't fair or reasonable.""

With the cancellation, the CFL becomes one of the few major North American pro sports leagues to wipe out play in 2020. Major League Baseball is running a shortened season, while the NHL, NBA and Major League Soccer have resumed play. The NFL says it's planning to start its season on time next month.

Ambrosie has received heavy criticism for his leadership in navigating the CFL through the pandemic. Players routinely took to social media to voice their displeasure with Ambrosie throughout the process and politicians from all major parties criticized the league for not having its players involved in its initial financial assistance request.

However, Ambrosie wants to remain in his post.

""It's been hard and it wouldn't be honest to say that every day since this all started has been a bowl of cherries because it hasn't,"" Ambrosie said. ""I'm committed to this league, I'm committed to its future.

""I'm going to lean in as hard or harder than anything I've done in my career because I think we've got something special and I'd like to be part of it.""

“I still have 13 perfectly good clubs in my bag,” said the pro out of Beach Grove, who lost the club face on his three wood.

Those other clubs were plenty good enough to carry Cao to a share of the first-round lead Monday at 4-under 67 in the Canada Life Series golf tournament on the Bear Mountain Valley course.

“It was nothing special, just a good, solid round,” said the Tsawwassen resident.

“All the top guys played pretty well.”

They included former SFU golf team captain Scott Kerr, who was tied for first with Cao at 67. Andrew Harrison and Michael Blair were tied at 3-under 68 in third place. Amateur Nolan Thoroughgood, the NCAA Pac-12 performer with the Oregon State Beavers who won the Royal Colwood club championship over the weekend, was in a five-way tie for fifth place at 2-under.

The Canada Life series is a consolation for those Canadian pro golfers who missed out on the 2020 Mackenzie Tour-PGA Tour season after it was cancelled due to COVID-19. That included the DCBank Victoria Open, which has been a Tour fixture since 1981 and has featured future PGA Tour players from Steve Stricker to Tony Finau.

Cao has played the latter three times at Uplands. He had this year’s PGA Tour China, on which he has full status, also cancelled due to COVID-19.

“It’s tough to be a pro golfer right now,” said the native of Beijing, who came to Canada at 16, and graduated from McNair Secondary in Richmond.

The two Canada Life Series tournaments on the Bear are 54-hole events. The first was on the Mountain course last week. This week’s tournament, from Monday to Wednesday, is on the Valley course. A different approach and game-management outlook is being required in going from mountain to valley.

“The greens are softer and slower on the Valley course than they were on the Mountain course,” said Cao, who turns 30 next month.

“The greens last week were rock solid. These ones are a lot wwmore fair, and a lot more playable, and give you better chances at birdie putts.”

Former UBC Thunderbirds player Evan Holmes of Calgary led wire-to-wire over three rounds to win at 8-under on the mountain course last week, holding off former Washington State Cougars Pac-12 player Zach Anderson of Nanaimo by two strokes. Cao tied for third on the Mountain circuit.

Both Bear Mountain tournaments feature purses of $50,000 and both filled up fast with lengthy waiting lists. Holmes pocketed $9,000 for his win last week and an additional $2,750 bonus for recording the tournament low round. The latter perk is provided for every Canada Life tournament by current and former Canadian PGA Tour players Adam Hadwin, Corey Conners, Nick Taylor, Mackenzie Hughes, Roger Sloan, Michael Gligic, Graham DeLaet, Stephen Ames, David Hearn, Mike Weir and Ian Leggatt to help out the next generation.

The Canada Life Series concludes Sept. 2-4 and Sept. 9-11 at TPC Toronto at Osprey Valley. The series champion over the four tournaments will earn a berth into the 2021 RBC Canadian Open at St. George’s in Toronto.

Cao said he plans to contest all four Canada Life series tournaments to hopefully gain that cherished berth in the 2021 Canadian Open.

Spectators are not allowed for the two Bear Mountain tournaments. There are also no caddies and only a bare number of volunteers allowed on the Bear.

The Canada Life tournaments have been put together by the Mackenzie Tour-PGA Tour Canada, which is the launching pad to the Korn Ferry Tour, which in turn is the entry portal to the PGA Tour. The Mackenzie Tour’s alumni includes 41 PGA Tour players and 232 Korn Ferry Tour players produced since 2013.

These are the first pro tournaments on Bear Mountain since the mountain course hosted PGA Tour Champions’ events in 2016 and 2017. The $2.5-million Pacific Links tournaments featured former stars and current seniors such as Colin Montgomerie, John Daly, Bernhard Langer, Vijay Singh, Scott McCarron, Jerry Kelly and Lee Janzen.

The CFL cancelled the 2020 campaign Monday after its quest for a $30-million, interest-free loan from Ottawa fell through. The league said it needed financial assistance from the federal government to stage an abbreviated season.

Bighill and Mitchell, in separate media availabilities Tuesday, offered very similar opinions on what the cancellation could mean for the league. Bighill, a middle linebacker, helped the Winnipeg Blue Bombers capture the Grey Cup last year after quarterback Mitchell guided the Calgary Stampeders to the '18 CFL title.

""This is a good opportunity for us to strengthen,"" Bighill said during a conference call that also involved Bombers quarterback Zach Collaros. ""We need to build a better relationship (between) the CFLPA and CFL as far as how well we're communicating and build a real relationship that we can move forward on.

""Randy (CFL commissioner Randy Ambrosie) has said multiple times the business model has been broken so how do we fix it? Those are things that need to be addressed and we've got time to do that.""

Mitchell agreed.

""I just want to see the CFL and CFLPA work together in a more unified sense,"" Mitchell said. ""I think right now we can just come together and really find a way to make the CFL better, not just for 2021 . . . but the next 50 years, for guys who are going to come after us.

""I think this is a good chance to do it, so whatever that looks like I'm all for it.""

The CFL and CFLPA have had a sometimes acrimonious relationship, especially during collective bargaining talks. But the two sides were said to be close to having an amended CBA that would've allowed for a season to be played with federal funding.

But even that wasn't an entirely smooth process. In June, CFLPA executive director Brian Ramsey took to Twitter to express his frustration that the union hadn't heard from the league regarding its 2020 plans.

""We really didn't an offer to sit at the table and talk until June and then we really didn't get to look at a collective bargaining agreement until July,"" Bighill said. ""There could've been a lot of things, I think, that could've been done earlier.

""We need to work better together as a league and player reps and players union to make this product better.""

Collaros and Bighill played big roles in the Bombers downing the Hamilton Tiger-Cats 33-12 for their first Grey Cup title since 1990. Collaros was looking forward to defending that championship this year.

""I don't know if you win the championship in 2019 and 2021 if that counts as back-to-back,"" Collaros said. ""Man, it's really disappointing not to be able to get on the field and defend that title this year.""

A shortened CFL season would've been held in Winnipeg, the league's tentative hub city. In April, Collaros and his wife, Nicole, became first-time parents and although playing football would've meant being away from his family in a CFL bubble, Collaros was committed to suiting up for a 2020 campaign.

""It definitely would've been a conversation to have with my wife but I think we were both aligned on the same page that I was going to play,"" he said. ""We need to make money, that's the bottom line.

""I guess it's a good thing we don't have to have the conversation but at the same time you put a lot of work in to get ready for the season, physically and mentally. To have that kind of taken away and be strung along for months was not fun.""

Many CFL players will have to find alternate sources of income. Mitchell considers himself lucky as he received a signing bonus from Calgary as part of a restructured contract in December.

Mitchell, twice the CFL's most outstanding player, will use the extra time to further recover from off-season shoulder surgery.

""A year is lost but coming off shoulder surgery I really feel like . . . it's going to allow me to get my shoulder to 100 per cent and body feeling great,"" he said. ""I feel disappointed but blessed at the same time I'll be able to get my body and shoulder completely ready to go.""

Bighill, 31, who also won a Grey Cup with B.C. in 2011, will also be busy, working as a financial adviser.

""The idea was to be building a business that eventually I'd transition to (upon retirement),"" said Bighill, twice the CFL's top defensive player. ""It's good for me to be in a position that I am to at least have something I'm building and working on.""

Collaros, 31, who lives just outside Toronto in Aurora, Ont., with his wife and young daughter, has some details to iron out before deciding what's next.

""The trouble with me right now living in Canada is my permanent residency hasn't gone through yet,"" he said. ""So right now I'm only under contract to work for the CFL.

""We're trying to get that all squared away and figure out what to do moving forward.""

Collaros is hopeful fans stick with the CFL.

""I've really grown to love this game, the Canadian game, this league and the fans,"" he said. ""We just ask for the fans to stick behind us and know that we're putting all the work in to come back better and stronger in 2021.""

Cole Pearn abruptly retired at the end of last year's NASCAR season after helping build one of the best teams in stock car racing. His life on the road cost him too much time with his young family and relocating from Colorado to North Carolina had limited their access to outdoor adventures.

They returned to his native Canada to operate Golden Alpine Holidays in British Columbia, a venture that has been disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic. Racing has also been scrambled, and when the Indianapolis 500 was moved from May to Aug. 23, one of the Ed Carpenter Racing engineers had a conflict.

It created an opening at Carpenter on Conor Daly's car. One of Carpenter's crew members had worked with Pearn before and the connection was made: Pearn, the crew chief of Martin Truex Jr.'s 2017 NASCAR championship season, would work the Indianapolis 500.

""They asked. It was like, ‘Yeah, why not?’"" said Pearn, who called the Indy 500 a bucket list event. ""It's hard when you race your whole life and just completely turn it all off. So it's kind of nice to scratch that itch at the same time.""

Daly, in his first day working with Pearn, was ninth fastest around Indianapolis Motor Speedway. The Chevrolet was even faster Thursday, when Daly briefly sat atop the speed chart before Takuma Sato bumped him down a spot. He ended the day fourth overall in speed.

""We made some really good changes overnight and Cole has an idea of what he wants to do. He's got an interesting way of working, he's like ‘Yep, I know exactly what I want to do,’"" Daly said. ""I really like communicating with him and I think we are vibing really well.""

Daly, making his seventh Indy 500 start, finished a career-best 10th in his hometown race last season while running for Andretti Autosport. A scrapper who has pieced together a full IndyCar season swapping between Carpenter for oval races and Carlin Racing for street and road course events, the 28-year-old Daly is trying to stabilize his career.

Daly will try to parlay a strong 500 into full-time work while relying on a part-time engineer in the 37-year-old Pearn.

""I’ve learned to just try to get along with everyone,"" Daly said. ""I’m a very trusting individual. Obviously, Cole has an incredible amount of experience in the racing world. Was a driver himself, as well. He knows what’s going on.""

Pearn's most noted success is in stock cars and a five-year stint as Truex's crew chief that produced 24 Cup Series victories. The team raced for the title three consecutive years, finishing second in back-to-back seasons after the 2017 championship.

Things began to change when Furniture Row Racing closed at the end of the 2018 season and Pearn and Truex were pulled into Joe Gibbs Racing. They won seven races and were runner-up to teammate Kyle Busch in the title race when Pearn decided he'd had enough.

He has since watched NASCAR on television and provides both insightful and comedic commentary on social media. Pearn recognized he missed racing.

""For sure missed the competition side,"" Pearn said. ""This is obviously a fully different experience, but racing is still racing. You throw a green and checkered.""

To prepare for Indy, Pearn took a very literal approach — ""I had to read the rule book,"" he said.

He's always followed IndyCar and his racing experience qualifies Pearn for the crossover that few expect will be a difficult transition.

""I grew up knowing these cars, it's not like it's anything crazy,"" Pearn said. ""In some regards it is kind of simple and it's just about understanding the procedures and how we set the cars up, learn how tech goes. The physics is honestly the easiest part, understanding how everything else works is the harder part.""

When Carpenter made the hire, he had no doubt bringing in Pearn would be seamless and give Daly a shot at winning the Indianapolis 500.

""I believe when you bring in smart and talented people that have a work ethic, they’re going to figure it out,"" Carpenter said. ""There’s a lot that’s different but a lot of the processes are the same. Some of the language is different. He’s definitely putting in the work to do it, getting prepared. A lot of what we’re doing at Indy is making decisions in the moment. I think we all feel like Cole has those traits.""",760,0.9618243367615305,sports

I find it troubling that a word that can be so offensive has found a place in the mouths of youths. They call themselves “savage” if they’ve done something without caring about repercussions or how it affects others around them. When they use this word, it’s viewed as a compliment.

article continues below

I don’t know if they are aware this was, and still is, a derogatory term used toward Indigenous people. It’s a word that was used to infer Indigenous people weren’t human. If young people knew this, I wonder if it would change their minds about using it.

There are many terms and names that become mainstream that are offensive to communities they reference.

When I heard the Edmonton Eskimos football club was changing its name, it made me sigh and think to myself: “It’s about time.”

There are many sports teams across North America that have their names and mascots derived from Indigenous communities or Indigenous stereotypes. These names have been under scrutiny for many years and not just by Indigenous people.

I welcome the name change of the Edmonton football team and I think it is a great step forward.

When organizations are making decisions such as this one, I don’t think there needs to be consensus. Not everyone has to be offended for a name to be changed and not everyone has to agree. If the name refers to an Indigenous community and the community, or many in the community are offended by it, that’s whose opinion should matter most.

I know many sport fans may have an issue with it and they have many nostalgic memories of the team name and the logo. There is bound to be the argument, “That’s what it’s always been, what’s the problem?”

I hear these reactions and I understand, I really do. Change is hard for all of us. The team was founded in 1895 and officially adopted the name the Edmonton Eskimos in 1910. I am not sure what connotation the word “Eskimo” had in 1910, or what the Inuit community thought of the word being used in the team’s name at that time. I do know that words’ meanings and appropriateness change over time.

I am 38 years old and when I was a child, other children would ask me: “Are you an Indian?” The word “Indian” was used back then, and hopefully, no one today would ever ask me that same question with that phrasing today.

Politically correct terms have changed over the years. When I was in middle school, my peers asked me if I was “Native.” By my late teens. I was asked if I was “First Nations.” Then the questions changed to “Aboriginal” and now the word is “Indigenous.”

As correct terms evolve, we can do our best to evolve with them and listen to others who can correct us when a term or phrase being used can be deemed offensive. We can’t all stay up-to-date on everything all the time, and that’s when we can rely on teaching moments as they happen.

With the Edmonton team the name has been under scrutiny for a while, it’s not something that just happened overnight.

I am of First Nations and Inuit descent, and my family is from Fort Chipewyan in northern Alberta. I was adopted at birth and not raised in an Indigenous home. I am very proud to have Inuit roots even if I don’t know very much about my culture.

I have seen online the support of Inuit leaders and Elders toward the decision to change the name of the Edmonton team.

In the United States, the Washington Redskins football club has announced its name change as well. It has had the same name since 1937. For the 2020 season it will be called Washington Football Team.

I am impressed that these institutions have committed to doing better and in this process they are publicly demonstrating the importance of respecting Indigenous people.

And that includes how to allow players under contract to CFL teams the ability to sign elsewhere — most notably the NFL — if the opportunity arises. On Monday, the CFL cancelled its 2020 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

""The focus right now for us on a few certain things and one of them is ensuring if there's an ability for our players to receive some form of payment this year,"" Brian Ramsay, the CFLPA's executive director, said Monday during a conference call. ""They should be able to do that if they have an opportunity.""

While the pandemic has forced football leagues — pro and collegiate — to suspend operations this year, the NFL is planning to play a full regular season. However, 66 players have currently opted out of participating in the 2020 campaign, which could create opportunity for some CFL players to sign deals south of the border and have a chance to earn a football paycheque, either on the active roster or on the practice squad.

While there's no shortage of collegiate players available, the advantage a CFL player has is pro experience, a fact not lost upon NFL personnel people.

The NFL's rookie minimum salary this season is US$610,000 compared to $65,000 for an entire 18-game CFL campaign. This year, the CFL was looking at staging a six-game regular season in Winnipeg, its tentative hub city.

And players on NFL practice rosters receive at least US$8,000 per week.

Commissioner Randy Ambrosie said the CFL is amendable to doing what it can to help its players.

""Where we can do something we will,"" he said. ""We're going to be committed to working towards good outcomes, the best possible outcomes we can have with out players.

""That's not going to mean we're going to be able to do everything but we're certainly going to go into this with a real positive spirit.""

Something else that will be on the CFL-CFLPA radar will be the current collective bargaining agreement, which is slated to expire after the 2021 season. But union president Solomon Elimimian said the two sides covered a lot of ground this time around during talks to amend the agreement for a shortened '20 season.

""Everyone wants to the league to reach its full potential. The partnership has to be one that's very genuine and the players have to feel part of that. If that happens, the sky is the limit.""

The recently retired Winnipeg Blue Bombers superfan was hoping to fill up his summer schedule with football games.

""All hell broke loose,"" he said Tuesday.

He was disappointed to learn his team won't be able to defend its Grey Cup championship this year. However, he's not letting the CFL's decision to scrap the season affect his unbroken streak — he is considering 2020 a lost year.

""It's not my fault they aren't playing this year, so I'm going to consider my streak alive,"" he said. ""If it was happening this year in Regina, I would be going.""

Fans across the league shared in the sadness of the lost year after commissioner Randy Ambrosie announced the decision to cancel the 2020 season and focus on 2021.

There was hope Winnipeg — home of the 2019 champions — could serve as a hub city for the league. But the CFL was unable to secure financing from the federal government or resolve some other issues.

It marks the first year the Grey Cup won't be presented since 1919.

Fan Mike Goodchild had a lot more time for vacation and house projects this summer in Manitoba, but said he'd rather be watching football games.

""We miss going to the games, watching our favourite players,"" Goodchild said Tuesday. ""It is what it is right now.""

That the Bombers remain the reigning champions is a small silver lining to the news, Emile Morrissette said. The Manitoba team won its 11th CFL championship with a 33-12 victory against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats last November, ending a 29-year drought.

Morrissette, a season ticket holder, wanted to see what the champions would have done to defend the title on the field.

""Finally we win the Grey Cup and we have a very competitive team and we are probably going into the season to be one of the favourites again and then that COVID hit,"" Morrissette said.

""You know, it just makes it tough as a fan.""

Some people plan their summers around the cottage or the beach, but Morrissette and his sister make their plans around going to football games together.

He supports the decision if the league can become stronger and more financially stable for future seasons.

In Saskatchewan, Nelson Hackewich said he was expecting the season would be cancelled, but it was still hard to hear.

""The league was in a situation where it couldn't win. It was going to lose money either way,"" he said. ""It still hurts that we aren't going to have CFL football this year.""

To say the Hackewich family are Saskatchewan Roughriders fans is an understatement — they bleed green and white, he said. They are known for the Rider Room in his parents' Regina house. They converted Hackewich's childhood bedroom into a place to showcase decades of Roughriders memorabilia.

To fill the hole left by the season, Hackewich began simulating the CFL season using a video game and livestreaming it online. Each Friday, he gets about 8,000 viewers. But it's not quite the same as watching the game, he said.

It also feels like a bit of salt in the wound for Hackewich that the season was cancelled the year the Roughriders' top rivals — the Bombers — hold the Cup.

""They ended one of the longest droughts in CFL history and the league decided they were going to shut it down... It's all Winnipeg's fault,"" Hackewich said with a friendly laugh.

Morrissette responded from Winnipeg that it better not be another curse on the Bombers.

""They won the Cup and then the season gets cancelled, right? It's kind of weird,"" he said. ""But technically I can never agree with a Rider fan. That's just in the DNA.""

He led wire-to-wire over three rounds to win the Canada Life pro golf tournament Wednesday amid pandemic playing conditions on Bear Mountain.

The former UBC Thunderbirds player from Calgary began with a scorching opening-round 63 on Monday and closed it out from there to hold off former Washington State Cougars Pac-12 player Zach Anderson of Nanaimo.

Holmes finished at eight-under, two strokes clear of runner-up Anderson.

“The course got tougher over the last two rounds as the wind started to swirl,” said Holmes.

“But I was able to hold off Zach and bring it home.”

Holmes said everyone has adjusted to playing amid the COVID1-19 restrictions. “We’re all used to it by now and the new rules seem normal,” he said.

“The guidelines are here to stay for at least a little bit longer. And in the end, it’s still just golf.”

The Canada Life series is a consolation for those Canadian pro golfers who missed out on the 2020 Mackenzie Tour-PGA Tour season after it was cancelled due to COVID-19. That included the DC Bank Victoria Open, which has been a Tour fixture since 1981, and has featured future PGA Tour players from Steve Stricker to Tony Finau

This week’s tournament on the mountain course was the first of two Canada Life Series 54-hole events at Bear Mountain. The second tournament is on the valley course next Monday through Wednesday. Both events feature purses of $50,000 and both filled up fast with lengthy waiting lists.

Holmes pocketed $9,000 for the win plus an additional $2,750 bonus for recording the low round. The latter bonus is paid for by current and past Canadian PGA Tour players to help the next generation.

“It feels good — it was a nice day — especially considering the [abbreviated season],” Holmes said.

The Canada Life Series concludes Sept. 2-4 and Sept. 9-11 at TPC Toronto at Osprey Valley. The series champion over the four tournaments will earn a berth into the 2021 RBC Canadian Open at St. George’s in Toronto, which is a nice perk.

“I would love to be in the Canadian Open, but I have to focus over the next three tournaments,” said Holmes.

The Canada Life Series is adhering to the safety guidelines being practised elsewhere in golf’s reopening. Spectators are not allowed for the two Bear Mountain tournaments. There are no caddies and only a bare number of volunteers allowed on the Bear.

The Canada Life tournaments have been put together by the Mackenzie Tour-PGA Tour Canada, which is the launching pad to the Korn Ferry Tour, which in turn is the entry portal to the PGA Tour. The Mackenzie Tour’s alumni includes 41 PGA Tour players and 232 Korn Ferry Tour players produced since 2013.

""It was disappointing when circumstances surrounding COVID-19 required us to cancel the 2020 Mackenzie Tour season,” said Tour executive director Scott Pritchard. “But we never lost sight of the purpose for this Tour, which is to give players opportunities.”

Island players in the first Bear Mountain tournament included Anderson from the Harbour City, Lawren Rowe, Cory Renfrew, Jim Rutledge, Peter Jenkins and Nate Ollis of Victoria, Andrew Funk of Sidney, Callum Davison of Duncan and Travis Busch of Qualicum Beach. A pleasant surprise was Jenkins of the host club moving up 15 spots in the second round Tuesday to make the cut to play in Wednesday’s final round. The 22-year-old was among two sponsor exemptions awarded Bear Mountain and Jenkins more than proved he belonged. Bear Mountain held a qualifying tournament for its members and staff to decide who would get its two exempt slots.

It was the first pro tournament on Bear Mountain since the mountain course hosted PGA Tour Champions’ events in 2016 and 2017. The $2.5-million Pacific Links tournaments featured former stars and current seniors such as Colin Montgomerie, John Daly, Bernhard Langer, Vijay Singh, Scott McCarron, Jerry Kelly and Lee Janzen.

Next week’s second tournament switches from the mountain to the valley course and will offer the Canada Life Series golfers a vastly different challenge.

Rob Larocque, Bear Mountain director of golf, described the two courses as “quite diverse.”

“Jack and Steve [Nicklaus] designed them in such a way that we think the tournaments will certainly have different feels to them,” said Larocque.

The pandemic year has tested everyone’s resolve and commitment. “Nobody has seen anything like this before,” said PFC head coach Pa-Modou Kah.

“This has been about more than sports. It’s been about life, and what you choose for yourself. It's about character and persistence and sticking it out, which these players have done.”

All games will be played on the University of Prince Edward Island’s FIFA-standard Alumni Field turf facility without fans amid the league's “bubble” after Charlottetown beat out Langford and Moncton, N.B., to host the season tournament.

All eight CPL teams quarantined for 14 days before leaving their cities and quarantined an additional five days in Charlottetown, where each club is occupying a separate floor in the city's waterfront Delta hotel.

Each player was tested for COVID in their home communities and again upon landing in Charlottetown.

“The set-up is very good. The CPL and P.E.I. have done a great job,” said Kah, a former Norwegian international.

Each of the eight teams will play the other once in the round-robin portion of the made-for-TV tournament.

PFC’s other games are against York9 on Tuesday at 10 a.m., Forge FC of Hamilton on Aug. 22 at 1 p.m., Valour FC of Winnipeg on Aug. 25 at 11 a.m., Cavalry FC on Aug. 30 at 9 a.m., Atletico Ottawa on Sept. 2 at 5 p.m. and FC Edmonton on Sept. 6 at noon. All times are PDT.

All games will be broadcast live over the Web on OneSoccer.

The top-four teams will advance to a playoff-round robin. The top team from that will go directly into the league championship game while the second- and third-place teams will meet in a semifinal with the winner advancing to the championship final.

“Our mindset upon arrival is to get into that top-four,” said Kah.

“Our guys are on a mission here to win games.”

This is the second year for the long-awaited Canadian domestic pro soccer league, mandated by FIFA, as part of Canada hosting the 2026 World Cup with the U.S. and Mexico. Nobody could have anticipated the sophomore CPL being played in this abbreviated fashion amid a pandemic.

The tournament will adhere to current B.C. guidelines and a maximum of 50 people — including players, coaches and scorekeepers — will be in the rinks for the games.

“This is all dependent on the health authorities,” said Grizzlies GM and head coach Craig Didmon. “If it can’t happen, then we will continue practising and training until the start of the regular season.”

The BCHL regular season is targeted to begin Dec. 1. The Grizzlies will open training camp on Sept. 15 with Didmon expecting to have 30 players on hand.

Current B.C. guidelines allow for training in small groups, so teams in various sports have been breaking up practice sessions into allowable units and staggering ice, field or court times.

“That’s just the way it is and you have to accept it because this is an unusual time,” said Didmon. “The BCHL has done a good job of managing its way through this situation.”

It was the spring of 2010 and Clune, who had made his NHL debut earlier that season, was finally on the road to getting the help the 23-year-old knew he needed in his crippling addiction battle.

article continues below

With his younger brother, Matt, at the wheel, they drove through upstate New York in a torrential downpour home to Toronto. Clune wasn't sure he was going to make it.

""I was in the acute withdrawal phase,"" he said in a recent interview with The Canadian Press. ""I couldn't sit still for a second. The most logical thing at that point in time for me was to go jump off a bridge ... literally.

""I couldn't really see myself coming out of it.""

But come out of it he did, and a decade later, Clune is sharing his story in ""Hi, My Name is Dicky,"" a raw documentary available on iTunes and AppleTV that details his life from aspiring youth hockey player to out-of-control junior antagonist to pro athlete teetering on the edge — one consumed by drugs, alcohol and mental illness.

His journey to recovery started in earnest on that lonely stretch of highway.

""My brother really had to talk me off the ledge,"" Clune said. ""When I see his face and when I see my other brother Ben's face, that's what gave me strength to live, because I didn't really want to live for myself at that time.

""Matt, at a couple points on that drive, had to do things that no younger brother should have to do and really dig down deep and get me home.""

The documentary from Taylor Prestidge and Haris Usanovic of Upper Canada Films tracks Clune's life and career, recovery and redemption. It includes interviews with Clune's parents, brothers, teammates and coaches.

Clune was driven to be the best as a child, but the pressure led him down a dark path at early age.

""I made that decision I was going to put my head down and not see anything but being a hockey player,"" Clune, who was selected in the third round of the 2005 NHL draft by the Dallas Stars, says in the film.

He began to try alcohol in his early teens as a way to cope, and it escalated quickly once he got to high school and then the Ontario Hockey League.

""I had this hole inside me that made me insecure and afraid of the world,"" Clune recounts. ""I got wasted and was like, 'Wow. OK. I'll be able to do this. I can cope with this. It's like a warm blanket.'

""Alcohol saved me. It was my solution to that problem of being self-absorbed and focused on all the things that made me insecure and self-conscious and in pain and sad.""

But he didn't realize how much of a spiral his life was taking. In junior, he would drive from bar to bar, party to party, drinking, smoking marjiuana and doing cocaine.

""I wanted to walk that line of looking death in the face every day, but still play hockey and do all these things,"" Clune says in the film. ""I don't know how I did it.""

Things got worse after junior when he was living in the United States by himself before making his NHL debut in that fateful 2009-10 season, months before becoming completely unglued.

""I had achieved my goal,"" he recalls on screen. ""But I hated myself.""

Clune eventually checked into rehab a second time — he went once before, but didn't stay — and committed to getting better with a lot of help from the people around him.

After he got out, he resumed his career and went onto play a total of 120 regular-season games in the NHL with the Los Angeles Kings and Nashville Predators. His contract was bought out in 2015, and he was again at a crossroads — retire or keep going.

That's when the Toronto Maple Leafs, who were in the early stages of their massive rebuild, came calling to see if Clune wanted to be part of their program. They could only offer an American Hockey League contract, but if things went well, there was a chance he could make the NHL club. At the very least, he would play in the minors and help foster a new culture.

Leafs general manager Kyle Dubas, who was in charge of the minor-league Marlies at the time, saw something in Clune that could be useful.

""He provides a certain energy,"" Dubas said. ""He provides experience in his life that I thought brought a great spirit to our team.""

Clune played 19 games with Leafs, but the forward truly made his mark with the Marlies. He helped the team win the Calder Cup in 2018 and plans to continue his on-ice career, but equally important was how he's helped mentor a number of current NHLers.

He's proud of where he is, and not shy talking about how he got there. Clune still goes to meetings, does the 12 steps and now works to help others.

He also thinks a lot about why he made the decision to live, to fight, and get better, when many others — including some fellow pro hockey players — have gone down a different path.

""In the beginning, it was because I wanted to see my brothers,"" said Clune, his voice cracking with emotion. ""Then it transformed into wanting to live for myself. I started to discover what it feels like to have self esteem and to have love.

""I just hope people realize that they're not alone with how they feel. Don't be afraid to ask for help.""

The 104th running of ""The Greatest Spectacle in Racing"" will be the first without spectators, who showed up at Indianapolis Motor Speedway every year, even during the Great Depression.

It was a flip for Penske, who purchased the iconic speedway in January and has spent every day since upgrading his new showplace to prepare for his favourite race. The pandemic forced the race to change dates for the first time, from Memorial Day weekend to Aug. 23.

Penske had initially said he wouldn't run the 500 without fans. But as the pandemic continued to spread across the nation, the decision was made to limit capacity to 50%. The speedway then lowered that number to 25% and presented an 88-page manual on how to safely host spectators.

Cases have continued to rise — steadily in Indiana and specifically in Marion County, where the speedway is located — and Penske told The Associated Press on Tuesday the reversal on the spectator policy was ""the toughest business decision I've ever made in my life.""

""We didn't buy the Speedway for one year, we bought it for generations to come, and it's important to our reputation to do the right thing,"" Penske said in a telephone interview.

He said the financial ramifications of not hosting spectators — which even at 25% capacity, the mammoth facility could have held about 80,000 people — played no part in his decision. Rather, the continued increase of COVID-19 cases in Marion County made shutting out spectators the responsible decision.

""We need to be safe and smart about this,"" Penske said. ""Obviously we want full attendance, but we don't want to jeopardize the health and safety of our fans and the community. We also don't want to jeopardize the ability to hold a successful race.""

As part of the plan introduced two weeks ago for 25% of fan capacity, spectators who had purchased badges that granted them access to the garage and pit lane was going to be permitted, as well as infield access. Although the speedway, which can hold at least 350,000 spectators, has the space for social distancing, Penske did not want to put fans or competitors at risk.

The situation was compounded last week when IU Health, the state’s largest health care system and a partner of Indianapolis Motor Speedway, said it opposed fans attending the 500.

""Until we sustain better control of this virus and its spread,"" IU Health said in a statement, ""we strongly encourage IMS to consider an alternative to running the Indy 500 with fans in August.""

The letter blindsided speedway officials, who had worked with health officials on the comprehensive safety plan that included mandatory wearing of masks at all times inside the speedway.

IU Health said it ""appreciates"" the speedway's safety plan, but risks remained too high to host a large cluster of fans.

""We have concerns about the risks of infection beyond the scope of the IMS plan, including social gatherings, travel, restaurants, bars, accommodations and other event-related activities,"" IU Health said. ""This could lead to a spike in COVID-19 infections as we continue to see cases and hospitalizations increase every day.""

Penske said the IU Health letter was ""disappointing"" but did not force his hand. Instead, it simply came down to metrics of how the coronavirus is spreading through Indiana.

""The number of cases in Marion County has tripled while the positivity rate has doubled. We said from the beginning of the pandemic we would put the health and safety of our community first, and while hosting spectators at a limited capacity with our robust plan in place was appropriate in late June, it is not the right path forward based on the current environment,"" the speedway said in a statement.

The first inkling that Penske's group was waffling came Monday when the speedway confirmed to the AP that the opening day of practice scheduled for next Tuesday had been scrapped. The first day of practice will now be Aug. 12. The only other change to the schedule right now is the elimination of the Pit Crew Competition traditionally held on Carb Day, two days before the race.

The pandemic has obliterated the IndyCar schedule, with the series shutting down just two days before its March 15 scheduled season-opener. The schedule has undergone numerous alterations since, with a West Coast swing to Portland and Laguna Seca cancelled last week and doubleheaders added to Mid-Ohio, Gateway in St. Louis and the road course at Indianapolis.

Then, days after announcing the latest schedule updates, the Mid-Ohio events scheduled for this coming weekend were postponed. IndyCar has run just six events since the season resumed June 6. Limited spectators have been allowed at doubleheaders at Road America in Wisconsin and at Iowa Speedway, where Penske had to be the race promoter for the event to be held.

Penske, just the fourth owner of national landmark IMS, has spent roughly $15 million on renovations to the historic property that he eagerly awaited showcasing for fans. His doubleheader weekend with IndyCar and NASCAR in July was held without fans and access to the property was limited to the competitors inside the facility.

He said ""the place looks even 50% per cent better than it did in July"" and takes solace that the IndyCar paddock will be able to get a closer look at the upgrades when the track opens next week. As for fans?

""Look, this is a long-term investment for us for many generations to come,"" he said. ""We will continue to improve the speedway, the competitors will get to see it over the next two weeks and we believe this decision now regarding the 500 is in the best interest of protecting the 500 for the future.""",956,0.9475998082947382,sports

The commissioner of the Canadian Football League pledged Monday that 2021 “will be the biggest comeback season in the history of Canadian football,” as he announced the league was scrapping its plans for a shortened 2020 season after failing to secure financial assistance from the federal government.

“I’m heartsick for our players,” Randy Ambrosie told reporters. The league’s board of governors made the cancellation decision Monday morning, after learning late Friday that the Liberal government had denied its request for a $30-million interest-free loan.

The league, which was originally scheduled to kick off its 2020 campaign in early June before the coronavirus hit, had drawn up a hub-city plan under which it would gather all nine CFL teams in Winnipeg this fall. Each team would play a six-game regular season, with no fans in stands at the Blue Bombers’ IG Field, with the top eight advancing to three weeks of playoffs. The league would have staged a total of 34 games, including the Grey Cup.

Story continues below advertisement

The cancellation means this will be the first year since 1919 that the Grey Cup will not be awarded.

The hub-city plan was itself a change of strategy from the spring, when Ambrosie all but ruled out playing games without fans.

On Monday, he said that, in retrospect, “there are things I would have liked to have done differently,” adding that he does feel “responsible for the fact that we are not on the field this year.”

In late April, Ambrosie came under fire from politicians, fans and even the CFL’s own players’ union for requesting a federal bailout of up to $150-million. The league later modified and then revoked that request, but it continued to seek federal help.

Last month, the league was reportedly in talks with a pair of government agencies, including the Business Development Bank of Canada, for a loan of up to $44-million, but the commercial terms it had been offered were too onerous to accept.

During an appearance in front of a parliamentary finance committee in May, Ambrosie said CFL teams collectively “lose between $10-million and $20-million a season.” He added that if the season were scrapped and the teams were forced to give back season-ticket deposits and refund money they had received for TV rights, “our financial crisis will become very real and very big.”

More than most big sports leagues, which earn the bulk of their revenue from high-priced TV contracts, the CFL’s business model leans heavily on the sale of game tickets. In 2018, the last year for which figures are available, gate receipts and other game-day revenue accounted for 55.7 per cent of income for the Edmonton football team. TV revenue made up less than 17 per cent of the team’s revenue.

Ambrosie said that it had been “frustrating” to see other leagues, such as the NHL, NBA and even Canadian Premier League soccer pivot to fan-less games. “The big leagues, the financial resources they had at their disposal to throw at a hub [city plan], as they have, we don’t have.”

While the CFL projected that a truncated season staged without fans in stands would still lose tens of millions of dollars, an entirely scuttled season could lose more.

It also hoped this fall could give it a rare, relatively unobstructed access to Canadian sports fans during a year of chaos. “We did see a real opportunity, particularly in that October-November window, to really kind of dominate the landscape, where the NHL season would end and the NBA season would end, and we would really have some space to tell our story,” Ambrosie said.

The league hoped it could “really put our football on display and really take centre stage in Canada. We felt very, very good about that.”

Instead, Ambrosie said, the league will lick its wounds and take the opportunity of the extra few months it now has to work on “operational efficiency” to improve its financial framework.

Ambrosie also told reporters the league planned to court a broader fan base, using “this time to reach into communities of newer Canadians we have not had the opportunity to tell how amazing it is to sit in a CFL stadium and cheer on your local team, how much you’ll feel more Canadian when you do these things, using our stadiums to celebrate being Canadian, using our stadiums to celebrate our diversity.”

The executive director of the CFL Players’ Association said that while the cancellation was “devastating” for the athletes and the families, the pandemic had highlighted some of the structural weaknesses in the league’s operations. “We have an opportunity now to fix this, moving forward, including the relationship between the players and the league,” said Brian Ramsay, in an interview on Monday.

The players are not expected to be paid any of their 2020 salaries. The league is scheduled to meet with the players’ association on Tuesday to discuss helping them access the federal Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy program.",851,0.5781111070613415,sports

The Canadian Press

The CFL’s board of governors will meet Monday to determine the fate of the 2020 season after the league was unable to secure financial assistance from the federal government.

The CFL presented Ottawa with a $30-million, interest-free loan request Aug. 3 to stage an abbreviated 2020 season during the COVID-19 pandemic. But two sources familiar with the situation said Sunday night the plan fell through when the assistance couldn’t be provided to the league under the terms it sought.

The sources were granted anonymity because neither the CFL nor the federal government had divulged details of the loan request.

Story continues below advertisement

It wasn’t the first time the CFL had been unable to reach a deal for government assistance. Last month, the league ruled out a loan from the Business Development Bank of Canada because it felt the interest rate was too high.

The $30-million, interest-free loan request was essentially seen as the league’s last-ditch effort to secure government support for an abbreviated ’20 season

The CFL’s board of governors will meet Monday to determine its next course of action. However, it’s hard to see the league going ahead with a shortened season given the time of year and it stating repeatedly that government assistance was needed in order to stage an abbreviated campaign.

Earlier, a CFL source had told The Canadian Press that even with an abbreviated season the league would lose upwards of $50 million compared to between $60 and $80 million with no football at all.

The CFL sent Ottawa its $30-million loan request Aug. 3. It was a reduction of the $44-million amended requisition it presented last month.

The CFL first approached the federal government in April for up to $150 million in assistance due to the pandemic.

Until Friday, the CFL’s loan request rested firmly in the hands of the Public Health Agency of Canada, which had been in talks with the league and Manitoba health officials regarding the CFL’s return-to-play safety plans. The league had previously chosen Winnipeg as a tentative hub city for a shortened season.

On Friday, Dr. Howard Njoo, Canada’s deputy chief public health officer, reiterated he was encouraged about the CFL’s health-and-safety protocols. However, he couldn’t say when approval of the plan might come.

That painted a rather bleak picture for the CFL as a continued delay further diminishes chances for a season to be played.

Players would need to fulfil quarantine requirements and make their way to Winnipeg for training camps before a six-game season could begin. With a three-week playoff, the league is running out of time if it hopes to finish a season by early December.

But government money isn’t the only hurdle the league faces. It also has to reach an agreement with the CFL Players’ Association on an amended collective bargaining agreement, something that hasn’t happened yet.

The CFL regular season was supposed to kick off June 11. But many provincial governments had stated there would be no sports with large crowds over the summer due to the novel coronavirus outbreak.

That struck a serious blow to the CFL, a gate-driven league that relies heavily on ticket sales to operate.

Forty “social-distance ambassadors” will monitor the US Open grounds to make sure players and others are avoiding close contact and wearing face coverings — the U.S. Tennis Association bought 500,000 masks to distribute — as part of efforts to avoid a coronavirus outbreak during the fan-free Grand Slam tournament.

“We’re trying to leave nothing to chance,” Billie Jean King National Tennis Center chief operating officer Danny Zausner said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press, “and make it as stress-free for the players as possible.”

The USTA announced Tuesday that one person, who is not a player, turned up positive for COVID-19 out of 1,400 tests administered in the controlled environment set up for the US Open and another tennis tournament preceding it at the same site in New York.

The Western & Southern Open, moved this year from Cincinnati because of the pandemic, begins Saturday. The US Open starts Aug. 31.

Two tests are taken 48 hours apart when a player or member of an entourage arrives at one of the two official hotels or one of the private homes the USTA made available for rent on Long Island. (Eight players chose the private housing option.)

The person, who is asymptomatic, came up positive on the second test and will be isolated for 10 days. Contact tracing will attempt to determine who might have been exposed.

“We expected this to happen,” USTA chief executive Mike Dowse said during a conference call with reporters. “Mathematically, we expected to have a positive, if not more than one. So we did anticipate this and we have put very specific protocol in place to prevent this from spreading broadly. … Our No. 1 priority is to take care of this person first, and secondly to prevent the spread from going any further.”

Once the US Open begins, a player testing positive would be kicked out of the tournament.

“This is all about mitigation of risk, lessening the exposure,” tournament director Stacey Allaster said.

She said about 350 players — roughly 90 per cent of the field — already are in the “bubble.”

Story continues below advertisement

Among the elements of the USTA’s plan, described to the AP by Zausner:

Similar to the on-site ambassadors, who will be split into two shifts of 20, monitors at the hotels will make sure people don’t leave their rooms for 24 hours after an initial COVID-19 test. “If they come down for whatever reason — because they’re young — a security person is there to say, ‘Excuse me. You need to be upstairs,’ and send them back up to their room,” Zausner said.

Instead of individual cars ferrying players and others between the hotels and tournament site, about 60 buses will be used, filled to 50-per-cent capacity. One person will sit by each window and the adjacent seat will remain empty.

Every room on the 40-acre USTA campus was measured and had its air flow analyzed. Some rooms were shuttered, others outfitted with filtration systems to rotate air and “meet hospital criteria,” according to Zausner.

Arthur Ashe Stadium locker rooms that normally hold up to 300 people are limited to 30 at a time — and only players, not coaches or other entourage members. And players’ access will be restricted to 15 minutes or so, tied to match and practice schedules. “That’s a big sacrifice for [players]. They’re used to hanging out in the locker room, the lounges in the locker room, spending quality time in there with other players,” Zausner said. “And that just can’t happen under this scenario.”

Most training and massage tables were moved from locker rooms to outdoors, such as under the viewing gallery for practice courts.

The player dining room’s capacity was reduced from 300 to 50; hundreds of rented tables and chairs were set up on the Ashe promenade.

Sixty-four suites in the main arena, each of which normally generates hundreds of thousands of dollars in annual revenue, are being assigned as personal lounges to the 32 women and 32 men who are singles seeds for the US Open.

“For the players, this has to feel like a US Open — like, even better than last year’s US Open,” Zausner said. “The only caveat is that we’re building it for 350-plus players but not 800,000-plus fans.”",734,0.9327895861612502,sports

The second-ranked Romanian broke Mertens for a 6-5 lead in the final set before converting her first match point to win her second title this year after the Dubai Championships in February.

Before the Wimbledon champion recovered from a foot injury she sustained in Dubai, the coronavirus pandemic forced a five-month break.

Halep improved her record against her Belgian opponent to 4-1 at WTA tournaments.

After the final, Halep said she would decide on Monday if she is ready to play at the forthcoming U.S. Open.

The recently retired Winnipeg Blue Bombers superfan was hoping to fill up his summer schedule with football games.

“All hell broke loose,” he said Tuesday.

He was disappointed to learn his team won’t be able to defend its Grey Cup championship this year. However, he’s not letting the CFL’s decision to scrap the season affect his unbroken streak – he is considering 2020 a lost year.

“It’s not my fault they aren’t playing this year, so I’m going to consider my streak alive,” he said. “If it was happening this year in Regina, I would be going.”

Fans across the league shared in the sadness of the lost year after commissioner Randy Ambrosie announced the decision to cancel the 2020 season and focus on 2021.

There was hope Winnipeg – home of the 2019 champions – could serve as a hub city for the league. But the CFL was unable to secure financing from the federal government or resolve some other issues.

It marks the first year the Grey Cup won’t be presented since 1919.

Fan Mike Goodchild had a lot more time for vacation and house projects this summer in Manitoba, but said he’d rather be watching football games.

“We miss going to the games, watching our favourite players,” Goodchild said Tuesday. “It is what it is right now.”

That the Bombers remain the reigning champions is a small silver lining to the news, Emile Morrissette said. The Manitoba team won its 11th CFL championship with a 33-12 victory against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats last November, ending a 29-year drought.

Morrissette, a season-ticket holder, wanted to see what the champions would have done to defend the title on the field.

“Finally we win the Grey Cup and we have a very competitive team and we are probably going into the season to be one of the favourites again and then that COVID hit,” Morrissette said.

“You know, it just makes it tough as a fan.”

Some people plan their summers around the cottage or the beach, but Morrissette and his sister make their plans around going to football games together.

He supports the decision if the league can become stronger and more financially stable for future seasons.

In Saskatchewan, Nelson Hackewich said he was expecting the season would be cancelled, but it was still hard to hear.

“The league was in a situation where it couldn’t win. It was going to lose money either way,” he said. “It still hurts that we aren’t going to have CFL football this year.”

To say the Hackewich family are Saskatchewan Roughriders fans is an understatement – they bleed green and white, he said. They are known for the Rider Room in his parents’ Regina house. They converted Hackewich’s childhood bedroom into a place to showcase decades of Roughriders memorabilia.

To fill the hole left by the season, Hackewich began simulating the CFL season using a video game and livestreaming it online. Each Friday, he gets about 8,000 viewers. But it’s not quite the same as watching the game, he said.

It also feels like a bit of salt in the wound for Hackewich that the season was cancelled the year the Roughriders’ top rivals – the Bombers – hold the Cup.

“They ended one of the longest droughts in CFL history and the league decided they were going to shut it down. ... It’s all Winnipeg’s fault,” Hackewich said with a friendly laugh.

Ligue 1′s opening match of the new season has been postponed from Friday night after Olympique de Marseille said they had confirmed four cases of COVID-19, French professional soccer’s governing body the LFP said on Tuesday.

“In view of medical results passed on by Olympique Marseille … the LFP has decided to postpone the Olympique de Marseille/AS Saint-Étienne game to Sept 16 or Sept 17,” the LFP said in statement.

The game was the only fixture set for Friday, with the rest of Ligue 1′s first round of 2020-21 matches spread out over Saturday and Sunday.

The LFP told clubs last week it had set up a “COVID committee” to advise on whether to postpone matches. When a club reports more than three coronavirus cases, postponement is likely, based on the “COVID protocol” the LFP sent out to the clubs.

Among the “Big Five” European soccer countries, France was the only one to end its season prematurely because of the pandemic. Paris Saint-Germain was awarded the Ligue 1 title.

The Parisian club and Olympique Lyonnais have reached the semi-finals of the reformatted Champions League, the first time that two French teams will compete at that level. Olympique Marseille is France’s only winner of the biggest prize in European football.

1919

The CFL has cancelled its 2020 season, the first time since 1919 that the Grey Cup won’t be presented.

The CFL cancelled the season after it couldn’t secure financing from the federal government, which the league said was necessary for a shortened season. Without the loan, teams would be facing financial losses, the league said.

In Ottawa, Finance Minister Bill Morneau announced his resignation from the Trudeau cabinet on Monday after reports of tension between him and the Prime Minister bubbled to the surface during recent days.

Mr. Morneau told reporters that he met with the Prime Minister Monday to inform him that he would not be running in the next election. He said he never intended to run in more than two elections.

As a result, he said the next phase of economic recovery will take several years and another finance minister will be needed.

Last Tuesday, The Globe reported that sources said Mr. Trudeau was not committed to keeping Mr. Morneau on as the key architect of the federal government’s economic revival plan after the two clashed over the Finance Department’s policy responses to the COVID-19 crisis.

World No. 2 Simona Halep of Romania will not travel to New York to play in the US Open because of COVID-19 concerns, she said on Monday, leaving the women’s draw at the Grand Slam tournament without six of the world’s top-10 players.

Halep joined world No. 1 Ashleigh Barty, defending champion Bianca Andreescu, Elina Svitolina, Kiki Bertens and Belinda Bencic in skipping the event at Flushing Meadows.

“After weighing up all the factors involved and with the exceptional circumstances in which we are living, I have decided that I will not travel to New York to play the U.S. Open,” Halep, the reigning Wimbledon champion, wrote on Twitter.

“I always said I would put my health at the heart of my decision and I therefore prefer to stay and train in Europe. I know the USTA and WTA have worked tirelessly to put on a safe event and I wish everyone there a successful tournament.”

Immigration Minister Marco Mendicino announced the program Friday in response to public demand that the so-called ""Guardian Angels"" — many in Quebec — be recognized for their work in the health-care sector during the pandemic.

Ordinarily, asylum seekers must wait for their claims to be accepted before they can become permanent residents, but the new program waives that requirement.

To apply for residency now, they must have claimed asylum in Canada prior to March 13 and have spent no less than 120 hours working as an orderly, nurse or another designated occupation between the date of their claim and Aug. 14.

Applicants must also demonstrate they have six months of experience in the profession before they can receive permanent residency and have until the end of Aug. 2021 to meet that requirement.

In an interview Friday, Mendicino called the announcement historic, and a reflection of the fact asylum claimants put themselves at risk to contribute day-after-day on the front lines, in hospitals and in retirement homes, even without permanent status in Canada.

""They demonstrated a uniquely Canadian quality in that they were looking out for others and so that is why is today is so special,"" he said.

The new program was the result of negotiations between the federal government and Quebec, who have had a strained relationship on the question of immigration, and in particular the asylum claimants, in recent years.

Quebec has housed many of the nearly 60,000 people who requested asylum in Canada after crossing on foot into the country from the U.S., the majority using an entry point in Quebec called Roxham Road.

The provincial government had long called for Ottawa to do more to stem the flow of people and also increase financial support to Quebec to deal with the new arrivals and the pressures they were placing on local resources.

But during the height of the COVID-19 crisis, when it emerged that refugee claimants were among those toiling in Quebec's hard-hit long-term care facilities, public support began to build in favour of granting them special residency status.

Frantz Andre, a Haitian community organizer in Montreal who advocates on behalf of asylum seekers, said he had received calls from many people expressing relief that they now have a path to permanent status.

""I'm very happy with the decision the government took because it provides a lot of relief and comfort,"" Andre said in an interview.

But, he said, the government's plan is bittersweet because many front-line workers are still ineligible for regularization. ""We're not giving up yet,"" Andre said. ""We're hoping we can influence the federal government and Quebec that they should enlarge their program.""

That was echoed by Wilner Cayo, president of Debout pour la dignite, a Montreal group that has pushed for the federal government to grant permanent status to all asylum seekers working on the front lines.

Cayo said Ottawa's plan excludes thousands of asylum seekers whose jobs were deemed ""essential"" during the pandemic, such as cooks or security guards in Quebec's long-term care homes, as well as labourers on farms and at food processing plants.

""We're treating these workers like disposable products,"" Cayo said in an interview. ""Yes, we salute this first step in the right direction, but we are profoundly shocked by these workers who are deemed essential but are left on the sidelines.""

Quebec Premier Francois Legault said earlier this year that while he was grateful for the asylum seekers' work, he was concerned that granting them fast-tracked residency status would encourage even more people to cross the border.

Speaking to reporters in Chibougamau, Que., Friday morning, Legault said he did not know how many asylum seekers would be eligible for the regularization program. But, he said, he was happy his government could come to an agreement with Ottawa.

""I'm happy to see the Quebec and federal governments work together for asylum seekers (who) took risks by working in the health-care system during the pandemic,"" Legault said. ""To thank them, we'll accept them as immigrants.""

At the news conference in Montreal, Mendicino said the Quebec government was a positive force in putting together the agreement.

He said efforts were made to allow as many people as possible to apply, and there is still some flexibility in the criteria, especially if people weren't able to work the required number of hours because they contracted COVID-19.

But Mendicino said the program was designed with strict parameters limiting who is eligible. ""This is about recognizing an exceptional contribution during a very exceptional period of time and we feel that will come across very clearly,"" he told The Canadian Press.

Many asylum seekers entered Canada at unofficial border points to get around a deal between Canada and the U.S. called the Safe Third Country Agreement.

Under the agreement, which took effect in 2004, Canada and the U.S. recognize each other as safe places to seek protection. It means Canada can turn back potential refugees who arrive at land ports of entry along the Canada-U.S. border on the basis they must pursue their claims in the U.S., the country where they first arrived.

A federal judge in July, however, struck down that agreement and gave Canada six months to change it before it becomes invalid.

Mendicino said the government is still reviewing the ruling. He pointed out the border is currently closed to most asylum seekers, under restrictions designed to limit the spread of COVID-19.

COVID-19 remains widespread across the U.S., where cases of the virus surpassed 5 million earlier this week, according to the U.S. Centres for Disease Control.

This is the fifth time that the closure has been extended since it was implemented in March. Since then, nearly 13,000 travellers have been refused entry to Canada, according to the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA).

However, the land border remains open to essential workers, such as truck drivers and health care professionals. Meanwhile, Canadians can still travel to the U.S. by air.

Because it takes time to correct a credit score error, waiting until you ""need"" your high credit score is a risky move, she says.
So I would encourage people to check their credit report and make sure that everything on there looks right.""","TORONTO — Hundreds of thousands of Canadians have been negotiating with lenders over the past few months, hoping to hold off paying debt amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

Now, those payments are beginning to filter through the credit reporting system.

article continues below

""We have seen the average number of accounts that are in a payment deferral status triple since before the pandemic,"" says Eva Wong, co-founder and chief operating officer of Borrowell, which offers free credit scores and reports.

""It shouldn't impact the credit score, but it should show up on the credit report.""

The Canadian Bankers Association said that as of June 30, 760,000 account holders had negotiated mortgage deferrals or skipped payments, while 445,000 had requested deferral for credit card debt.

According to Equifax, deferred payments — many agreed to as part of COVID-19 relief programs — don't harm borrowers' credit scores. But the payments must be reported in a certain way, and the status of these payments may not get reported to Equifax for up to 30 days.

It's important to make sure these deferred payments are reported correctly to credit bureaus, because even one false late payment can drop a credit score by as much as 150 points, says Wong. Credit scores are used not only by lenders, but also checked by cellphone carriers, employers and landlords, Wong says. Because it takes time to correct a credit score error, waiting until you ""need"" your high credit score is a risky move, she says.

""Depending on the type of error, the longer it persists, the more negative the impact,"" says Wong. ""If it's showing up as a late payment and it goes to month two, then it's two months of missed payments as opposed to just one. So I would encourage people to check their credit report and make sure that everything on there looks right.""

Anne Arbour, a financial educator at the Credit Counselling Society in Toronto, says that Canada's two credit-reporting agencies, Equifax Canada and TransUnion Canada, are data aggregators, and it is up to the lenders to create policies on how they report the deferred payments. It's important for consumers to get clear documentation of their agreement with their lender — such as a bank — when it comes to how they are reporting deferred payments, she says.

""Get as much detail from the lender, from the creditor, as possible about what a deferral will mean and what their practices as far as reporting it — so, whether it will impact somebody's rating or their score or not,"" says Arbour. ""And if there is any issue or concern, deal with the creditor first, getting as much written information as possible.""

Arbour noted that deferrals are not an automatic license to skip payments — not only must a formal agreement be struck, but many lenders may have explicit instructions on how interest or even late fees accrues while payments are halted.

Taylor Little, chief of Vancouver-based alternative lender, Neighbourhood Holdings, says that many people skipped payments based on reading about deferral programs, without actually checking to make sure whether the lender was offering deferrals or some other type of payment plan instead. Doing that can hurt a credit score, and likely won't be counted as an error, he says.

When checking with lenders, Arbour says people should collect a copy of the agreement, a file ID or reference number, and the name of the agent with whom they spoke, in case this information is needed to file a credit score dispute down the road.

If a consumer notices something that might be wrong on their credit score —such as a deferred payment being counted as ""late"" — the lender is once again the first stop, she says.

""Going back to the creditor themselves is a good first step,"" she says. ""[Equifax and TransUnion] have worked closely with the Canadian Bankers Association, with the lenders, everybody to try and come up with a way to report any deferrals, whether it was mortgages or credit cards, in a way that wouldn't penalize the consumer. But the onus ultimately was on and is on the creditors to change their systems.""

In addition to requesting a fix from the lender, consumers can ask Equifax or TransUnion to investigate a mismarked payment, through a credit report update form or investigation request form. Separately, consumers can also now put a ""consumer statement"" to a credit report to signal to lenders that something is being disputed. Equifax Canada gives an example: ""Be advised that the negative accounts on my credit report are related to the Covid-19 pandemic. I intend to make these up as soon as I can find a job.""

Keeping on top of errors — and being quick to correct them if they happen — is easier if consumers stick with a routine and understand the parts of the credit scoring process, says Arbour. For example, free services that offer credit monitoring offer more frequent updates and are different from Equifax or TransUnion's free yearly reports. Those annual reports from Equifax or TransUnion are also different from the formal scores checked by lenders in a ""hard"" credit check, she says.

She advised that consumers can take advantage of both credit monitoring services and free yearly reports.

""There's no sort of one size fits all answer — very often mortgages don't actually appear on credit reports,"" says Arbour. ""[Mismarked deferrals] haven't been brought up as a concern just yet. . . . I think come September, it might be a different story. Once deferrals are over, unless people are checking their credit report, they won't notice it unless they're in a situation where they're having to renew their term or renegotiate a rate or a debt management program.""

“While we are not at the same critical levels of PPE supply that we experienced a few months ago, it is concerning that a significant majority of continuing care organizations are concerned about their ability to maintain adequate PPE levels in the coming months,” says Jen Lyle, CEO, SafeCare BC. “Organizations should be focussed on providing great care, not worrying whether they will run out of PPE. This means the sector and government need to continue working together to ensure adequate levels of PPE for all healthcare workers.”

In response to the critical shortage of PPE, SafeCare BC launched its Operation Protect initiative, which in four months collected more than 1.2 million items of PPE from generous individuals and businesses. In addition, we sourced out new suppliers of PPE for our members. But the supply of donated PPE cannot be sustained, as the pandemic continues.

Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau announced Thursday that the government has signed eight agreements worth nearly $50 million to help align the needs of food banks and other community groups with what farmers and producers can supply.

article continues below

In an interview with The Canadian Press, Bibeau called the program a ""win-win-win.""

""It's reaching three objectives,"" she said.

""The first one to feed the people in need, second to support our farmers by buying some of their surplus at the cost of production and the third one was avoiding food waste.""

The organizations receiving the money include Food Banks Canada, Second Harvest and the Quebec group La Tablee des Chefs.

Altogether, approximately 12 million kilograms of everything from fish to fowl will be purchased from food producers and then redistributed under the $50-million food surplus program announced by the Liberals earlier this year.

The near shutdown of the hospitality industry has meant a sharp decline in the number of places to sell perishable foods.

That has led to litres of milk being dumped down drains, potatoes going bad in storage and farmers facing higher costs to hold on to animals they had nowhere to sell if slaughtered.

At the same time, food banks have reported sharp increases in the number of people seeking assistance, having lost their jobs due to the pandemic, and there were calls for the federal government to find a way to match up the two.

Lori Nikkel, the chief executive officer at Second Harvest, said pre-pandemic, an estimated 58 per cent of all the food produced for Canadians was going to waste.

That number was definitely pushed higher by COVID-19, she said, and she applauded the federal government's leadership in spooling up the program.

Second Harvest uses an online platform, FoodRescue.ca, to link up organizations that need food for their programs with farmers and producers who have surplus goods.

They received $11 million from the government to expand that program to include paying producers directly for their food, and ensure the groups on the receiving end have what they need to process, distribute and store it.

Nikkel said the money will go fast, and she hopes the federal government will consider a new round of funding at a later date as the need will not go away.

""The commodities are going to change,"" she said.

""Who we are helping now may not be the people we are helping tomorrow.""

Bibeau said the government will keep an eye on whether the demand from organizations, and oversupply from producers, remains in the coming months.

""We'll keep the door open in the sense that for now, we feel it's a very worthwhile program, and we look forward to seeing how it will evolve in the coming weeks.""

Ten per cent of the product being purchased by the surplus program is being sent to northern communities.

Among the projects focused on those is one with Fisher River Cree Nation in Manitoba, which received $10.8 million to catch millions of kilograms of walleye and redistribute the fish to more than 75 Indigenous communities.

Since the start of the novel coronavirus pandemic, Kitchener, Ont.-based education technology product maker InkSmith has made one “major transition” after another.

First, InkSmith, which makes 3-D printers, laser cutters, virtual reality headsets and robotic kits for educational uses, saw business decline as schools closed across Canada due to COVID-19. It also watched as the manufacturing plants in China that made its products shut down as the pandemic spread.

Then, being made aware of the need for made-in-Canada personal protective equipment, it started a new company, The Canadian Shield, making face shields and surgical masks. The 10-person company hired 300 employees in four months, became manufacturing experts, and leased a new 50,000-square-foot facility sight unseen.

“All you can do is laugh because it’s that insane,” says Jeremy Hedges, founder and president of InkSmith and The Canadian Shield.

Now, the company is taking this new manufacturing expertise and applying it to its original InkSmith business and bringing the manufacturing of its educational technology products back home instead of having them made overseas.

“With everything that’s happened with The Canadian Shield, we are going to onshore all that production [for InkSmith],” Mr. Hedges says.

InkSmith will assemble its 3-D printers and manufacture its robotics kits in Canada starting this fall.

“That’s a pretty major transition for us and it’s pretty exciting,” he says.

The rapid shifts at the company since March are “hard to believe,” adds chief technology officer Doug Braden. “It was surreal to say the least.”

The company saw the lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) in Canada as a “crisis” and thought that it could help, Mr. Braden explains.

In late March, Dr. Neil Naik with the Kitchener-Waterloo Academy of Medicine came to InkSmith and told Mr. Hedges about the shortage of PPE that would face the region, Ontario and Canada over the next few weeks. He suggested the company use its laser cutters and 3-D printers to make face shields.

“We had a huge stock of machines that we could just unbox, toss on tables and start going,” says Mr. Hedges, and within hours they turned InkSmith’s 5,000 square foot office into a “micro factory” making face shields.

The plan was to donate as much as they could to local hospitals. But it took an hour to 3-D print the headband and only 30 seconds to cut the plastic shield with the laser cutter.

“It was the definition of not scalable,” Mr. Braden says. However, “we knew we could figure this problem out.”

Mr. Hedges and his staff worked on a fully laser cut design while calling on the community to 3-D print headbands, which resulted in 20,000 face shields being donated locally.

The company quickly received its Medical Device Establishment Licence, which made it a legal manufacturer of face shields and it immediately received an order for 350,000 face shields from Ontario. Knowing the company needed to ramp up production, it bought five clicker die-cutting machines that could punch out several plastic shields at once – and bought 12 more once they saw they worked.

“We went from making 100 shields a day to 10,000 shields a day within six days,” Mr. Hedges says. “It’s an old school technology… we just kind of repurposed it to meet this crazy need.”

Within about a month, The Canadian Shield had orders for at least 11.5 million face shields from hospitals, the Ontario and federal governments, Mr. Hedges says. “But it also meant we had to scale up enormously.” By then it was churning out 100,000 face shields per day.

So, the company leased a 50,000-square-foot facility, brought in more machines, including computer-controlled pneumatic die cutters and travelling head presses, started hiring staff and punching out more and more shields every day. “We had to modify [the designs] on the fly,” Mr. Braden says.

That boosted production to at least 200,000 shields a day. “That’s what we can pack and ship out the door,” Mr. Hedges says. Although, in one day, the company made 257,000 shields, “which is kind of nuts,” adds Mr. Braden, considering only weeks before it had made none.

With a background in tech and robotics, the team quickly tried more than a hundred prototypes to find the most effective way to make face shields, he says. It was also able to hire people with the right manufacturing, supply chain or engineering experience who were out of work due to the pandemic, Mr. Braden adds.

“In some ways, The Canadian Shield is the ultimate use case for how design thinking works in action,” Mr. Hedges says.

This experience means InkSmith now has the capability to manufacture its products in the country.

“We have this huge labour force and entity that we can now turn to manufacturing [InkSmith’s] original products here in Canada. Something I always dreamed of doing was bringing our production here to Waterloo and we’re going to do that this fall,” he says.

Everything is getting set up now and InkSmith, with the help of a local manufacturer that has excess time on its production line, will make printed circuit boards for its robotics kits and 3-D printers in Waterloo. As well, InkSmith is looking at purchasing its own circuit board production line – called an SMT or surface mount technology machine – from a local company.

“It can all be done here,” Mr. Hedges says.

By taking this new expertise and bringing InkSmith’s electronics manufacturing back to Canada “we’re hopefully turning a new page,” Mr. Hedge says. “That’s what we’re going to get out of this pandemic. I think we’re going to see this huge push at the government level to have products made in Canada.”

He says Canada is not that far behind in manufacturing and with automation – where machines make most items – it can be cost effective to make products here.

The pandemic highlighted “the fragility of international supply chains,” says Mr. Braden, and he’s seen some of startups fold because their production offshore shut down.

Bringing manufacturing back to Canada from China “is difficult but it’s not impossible,” says Dan Breznitz, the Munk Chair of Innovation Studies at the University of Toronto. “It is feasible, it should be done but it’s a systemic problem of the whole system.” It’s also a promising way to help boost job creation in Canada at a time where many are out of work.

The key is for a company to have people with the right skills to manufacture goods efficiently to keep costs contained, and have access to the right people to maintain the production lines and the suppliers to keep the company supplied with raw products, Mr. Breznitz says.

“I highly urge our governments at both the federal and provincial level to seize this opportunity and make it happen,” he says, because it takes an entire supply and manufacturing chain to make it successful.

“If COVID-19 taught us just one thing is that we have to rely on ourselves a little bit more … in times of crisis,” he says.",1344,0.9665224006153248,business

The COVID-19 pandemic hit at the worst time of year for Toronto-based agricultural technology startup Ukko Agro Inc.

Winter and early spring are when farmers make key decisions about what resources they need to plant, grow and harvest their crops in the coming months. It’s also an essential time for Ukko Agro to sell its digital tools that help farmers optimize pesticide, water and fertilizer usage to operate more sustainably.

“Agriculture is a high touch-point industry. A lot of farmers expect you to come to their fields, spend some time, explain what you do and then sign up,” says Ketan Kaushish, co-founder and chief executive officer of Ukko Agro, which has clients across North America and parts of Europe, specifically Belgium and Sweden.

With international travel complicated by the coronavirus and many farmers unwilling to take in-person meetings amid the pandemic, Ukko Agro – alongside many businesses – has been forced to shift its sales strategy online.

While online selling often isn’t the same as being there in person, businesses like Ukko Agro benefit from providing software that can be easily exported to new and existing customers around the world.

“The advantage is you don’t have to deal with export issues of physical product delays at borders, or stopped shipments,” says Stuart Browne, an instructor in the MBA and Master of Finance programs at York University’s Schulich School of Business.

Although many companies are spending less due to the economic uncertainty caused by the pandemic, Mr. Browne says there are more opportunities for Canadian software businesses at home and abroad given the global shift toward doing business online.

“They don’t have any borders, which means anyone can access them for the most part,” says Mr. Browne, who is also CEO of Pycap Venture Partners, a Toronto-based venture capital and corporate finance firm. “What good entrepreneurs should be doing is going into the market and finding problems and creating solutions,” both now during the pandemic and in general economic times.

Toronto-based Act Analytics Corp., which offers an environmental, social and governance (ESG) portfolio analytics platform for registered investment advisers in North America, the United Kingdom and Australia, has seen its sales strategy interrupted by the inability to pitch its product in person at conferences and other events.

However, the company is taking advantage of more businesses operating online during the pandemic, as well as the growing interest in sustainable investing.

Story continues below advertisement

“People have used the recent market volatility as an acid test for ESG investing – and sustainability has never been more discussed in light of COVID and the Black Lives Matter movement,” says Act Analytics co-founder and managing partner Mike Unwin. “On the marketing and sales side of things, a new virtual world and a new focus on IT infrastructure have played into the hands of many SaaS [software as a service] and e-commerce companies like ours.”

Not having to cross borders with a physical product “is a huge advantage for us being exporters of cloud-based software,” Mr. Unwin says. “There’s no limit to the places we’re getting interest from. It’s truly global.” He says the interest is coming from places such as the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Switzerland, France, Hong Kong and mainland China.

Mr. Unwin has also noticed increased interest from existing and potential clients around the online customer experience, including the ease of use of the company’s analytics tools. Act Analytics is working on expanding its digital presence, including marketing, distribution networks and partnership opportunities.

“We’ve seen a lot of people coming into our environment, purchasing and trying the product,” he says. “People are having to rely more on their technology …. I think, generally, people are more comfortable interacting and doing commerce over the internet, which is favourable to us.”

Still, Mr. Unwin is looking forward to the day when his team can meet clients in person again as part of their operations.

“We’d like to meet the people we do business with,” he says. “Once the world opens up again we can do more of that … I think there’s little substitute for meeting someone in person and generating a genuine relationship. I think that’s still something that people crave. It helps them become comfortable with a new business partner.”

When the pandemic is over and business returns to relative normal, Ukko Agro’s Mr. Kaushish expects to find a balance between selling his software in-person and online.

“We have to figure out [the right mix] between using digital tools and meeting farmers in-person,” he says. “It might take some time for farmers to use digital tools to get acquainted with and purchase new products, but it will eventually happen.”

In the meantime, Ukko Agro is hoping to capitalize on the growing interest companies have in using online products to run their business. The company is building up its online sales tools and both improving and expanding its products to help reach new international markets.

“[The pandemic environment] has shown us that we don’t need to be on the ground to enter new markets,” Mr. Kaushish says, adding that his company is having discussions with companies in Brazil and Argentina. It also has its sights on potential customers in other parts of Europe.

“The mindset is changing [around using technology], and hopefully we see the positive effect in the long term,” he adds. “If everything goes online, nothing stops us from working in South America and [elsewhere in] Europe … I believe companies that build simple and reliable technology-based products will be the ones that win in this new world.”",960,0.909948902055544,business

The government says landlords and renters need to work out a payment plan with the extra payment due with the monthly rent.

The province has also extended its prohibition on rent increases, stopping landlords from raising rents until December.

It says anyone who was issued an increase should continue to pay the current amount.

The rental supplement remains available until the end of August at $500 a month for families and $300 for renters without dependents.

The government says it has helped more than 86,000 households with rent payments during the pandemic.

Wilkinson says the B.C. government will have to match the funds and it will determine how much BC Ferries and other transit providers will receive.

Provincial Transportation Minister Claire Trevena says the province is working closely with BC Ferries, BC Transit and TransLink to understand the challenges they're facing before allocating the money.

Trevena says the decisions will be based on considerations that put the public interest first, including restoring service to pre-pandemic levels and keeping fares affordable.

B.C. has earmarked up to $1 billion to match federal funds for public transit and local governments.

""We want to be able to work with BC Ferries, but we don't think that it is in the best interest, in the public interest, at the moment, when we're building out of COVID, to be raising fares,"" Trevena said during a briefing on Tuesday.

""We are working, as we can, with the information that BC Ferries will provide us, as well as (BC) Transit and TransLink, to make sure that all three agencies can continue in a strong way into the future,"" Trevena said.

The Canadian Ferry Association has said that BC Ferries saw an 80 per cent decline in traffic over three months between March and May, amounting to losses of up to $1.5 million per day.

BC Ferries is a private company run by a not-for-profit corporation but is recognized as provincially owned under federal tax law.

The designation meant it was excluded from the federal government's wage subsidy program.

As the COVID-19 pandemic started to spread, Tim Hortons reviewed its advertising plans and decided they no longer made sense as store closures, wide-scale layoffs and physical distancing upended life in Canada.

Instead, the coffee chain went back to the drawing board for two new ads. One informs customers how to buy doughnuts, double doubles and other products without going inside a restaurant, while the other follows Tim Hortons trucks delivering free coffee and doughnuts to essential workers.

“When we looked at what media we had committed to, we said: ’There’s a better way,“’ said Hope Bagozzi, chief marketing officer at Restaurant Brands International, the parent company for Tim Hortons.

Corporate spots acknowledging the pandemic have proliferated on TV breaks in recent weeks as companies grapple with how to fill previously purchased ad slots and what, if anything, they want to to say. How they proceed varies from brand to brand, but no one wants to risk appearing tone deaf during a national crisis.

“A lot of advertising — whether we want to admit it or not — is built on what has worked in the past,” said James Ansley, executive creative director at Grey Canada.

“It feels like right now, the rule book has been completely thrown out and we’re all trying to find our way through this.”

In the early days of the pandemic, Ansley saw companies do things that “felt a little bit ... lacking in meaning,” such as spacing out their logos in a nod to physical distancing. McDonald’s Brazil, for example, separated its golden arches mid-March, but later reversed the decision after facing criticism.

Companies are now trying to do something meaningful, said Ansley, by trying to help people feel safe and secure.

Utilitarian ads are one such attempt.

Tim Hortons released one in late March with an employee explaining drive-thrus are open and that app and delivery partners are accepting orders.

That ad was designed as “an accessibility spot” to answer questions the company was receiving from customers, said Bagozzi.

It’s notable that such ads aren’t geared toward selling products.

Ford Canada, for instance, created an ad thanking workers, and closing with information on how customers leasing or financing vehicles through its credit program could receive help.

BMO ran an ad thanking “all the front-liners for keeping our lives moving” without mentioning any banking services. A&W created an ad with a similar message of gratitude to its restaurant staff, essential workers and everyday Canadians “staying home to help stop the spread” that doesn’t show anything more than the fast-food chain’s spokesman, presumably in his own home, with a partial logo visible on the wall behind him.

The company wanted the gratitude to be authentic, genuine and dominant, said CEO Susan Senecal.

“That’s how we felt at that moment in time and we just wanted to express that completely,” she said. “We didn’t think anything more was necessary.”

A&W scrapped its original plans in this “very unusual set of circumstances,” Senecal said, and decided a message of thanks worked better.

The brands Ansley works with have “taken the foot off the pedal as far as pushing product,” which he thinks is the right move as staggering numbers of people apply for emergency government assistance.

More than one million jobs disappeared in March, according to Statistics Canada, and the unemployment rate increased 2.2 percentage points to 7.8 per cent.

“There’s a lot of people that are facing those realities,” Ansley said. “To go out with messaging that is tone deaf to that, I think, is completely wrong.”

Some brands have paused all their advertising in light of the pandemic, while others are trying to figure out if they have something to say, he said.

“I think really it’s just being true to your brand and your brand’s purpose.”

An example is a Dove Canada ad that presents a series of headshots of health-care workers, many of their faces showing indents from wearing their protective masks. The tagline “courage is beautiful” appears with the company’s logo and a list of donations the company is making to such workers.

The company’s long-runing “real beauty” campaign bills itself as a movement challenging traditional notions of attractiveness.

“That’s what makes it really powerful,” said Ansley. “It’s timely. It is a beautiful message. But most importantly, it just stays true to who they are as a brand.”

Similarly, Tim Hortons showcased its corporate values with the footage of real employees offering coffee and doughnuts to health-care workers, said Bagozzi.

The company didn’t know how it would use the footage when it first gathered it in March, she said, but after seeing the reaction decided to share it broadly.

“There was just such a nice reciprocal generosity and gratefulness that we were like, ‘Oh my gosh, this is so lovely. It’s so Canadian. We definitely want to share this.”

Story continues below advertisement

As the pandemic unfolds, it’s unclear what the future holds for advertising.

Tim Hortons ran a new ad recently offering a free pack of Timbits if customers spend at least $10. It’s intended as a nice gesture for families buying a meal, said Bagozzi.

The eatery is also looking at the activities it has planned for the rest of the year, especially the next few months, and asking what is most relevant and appropriate to be doing, she said.

The same can be said for A&W’s future advertising plans.

“As the situation continues to evolve, we’ll continue to think about what’s the most important thing to say next and try and do a good job of that,” said Senecal.

Since the pandemic began, Statistics Canada reports that Canadians spend far more time online than ever before. Activities that once required us to venture outside are now performed in front of a computer screen. Similarly, workers and employers seeking professional advice on their workplace rights are searching for that advice online. Increasingly, this is cause for concern.

Sales pitches

Internet-based marketing has become so pervasive that it can be hard to distinguish between a sales pitch and a genuine description of the law. Based on my observations, about half of the top search results produced by the leading search engines are advertisements, and half of those advertisements are paid for by companies looking to sell products or services that are not directly relevant. Companies or workers looking for legal advice can quickly be led far off into the wrong direction.

For example, when I searched for “employment standards act advice”, the first several results were paid advertisements that appeared to mimic government websites but were actually networks that claimed to put me in touch with a lawyer who would quickly answer my questions once I paid a small fee. The problem with these websites is that the “lawyers” who respond to such inquiries are generally not in Canada, and they may not even be lawyers at all. Be careful not to fall into these traps.

Advertising rules

Lawyers in Canada are governed by provincial regulatory bodies that place strict limits on how they are permitted to advertise online. For example, lawyers within Ontario are required to use a clear disclaimer when referring to past successes and they are forbidden from referring to awards or honours which were not credibly obtained by a legitimate third party. These rules are designed to protect consumers from being misled.

However, when researching for legal content online, it can be hard to detect an imposter. There is little stopping nonlawyers from advertising products or services, or even providing legal advice. These businesses dodge the regulatory requirements imposed on Canadian lawyers because they are not bound by them. For example, there is an international company offering workplace law advice to Canadian employers in Alberta, B.C. and Ontario. It does not actually consist of locally licensed lawyers because it does not follow any of the advertising rules in place. Without these safeguards, the general public has no way to verify that certain professional standards are met – and no one to complain to if not.

Jurisdictional issues

Each jurisdiction in Canada has its own unique employment standards legislation. There are also important distinctions between provincially and federally regulated employees (i.e. employees working in banking or telecommunications) that are critical to obtaining correct advice. Therefore, while it may be tempting to research a quick answer to “how much termination pay am I entitled to”, the correct answer first requires a proper understanding of the relevant jurisdictional framework and background terms of employment. When I speak with any prospective client, I have a comprehensive checklist of questions that I first need to have answered before I can confidently provide accurate advice.

Changes in the law

Even before COVID-19, workplace law was an extremely dynamic area, with constant changes to the law. However, since the pandemic began there is an almost-daily barrage of new developments and legislative amendments. Information posted online months or even weeks ago may no longer be precise. Search engine results are intended to be relevant – but they are not necessarily accurate.

The wrong question

Most internet searches for legal information are from individuals looking for a quick and simple answer to a legal problem they face. What is a constructive dismissal? How much severance pay should I receive? However, as any physician will tell you, the problem with self-diagnosis is that the underlying condition that you believe you have may be wrong. A temporary layoff may be a constructive dismissal for some employees. But if you are searching for whether it is a wrongful dismissal, which is a different legal concept, you may not receive the right answer.

Similarly, nuances in the law often require a more detailed explanation. There are actually separate and critically different meanings for severance pay in Canada. If you miss this distinction, your entire understanding of the concept will be wrong.

Unionized workers

Unionized employees cannot sue for wrongful dismissal but instead must file a grievance through their union. Without first qualifying this distinction, the answers to just about every online search for union workers will not be applicable to their matters.

The Internet is great for obtaining historical data points and a general direction of what to do next. But it is not a panacea for your workplace legal troubles. There is no substitute for actually conversing with a lawyer who can understand the nature of your problem and the dispute. Most law firms are now easily able to provide advice remotely.

When asked about some international investors starting to shun the oil sands, Mr. Kenney declared it was a passing fad, the “flavour of the day.”

It’s been a long day.

The oil sands have become a global climate-change lightning rod, the bitumen of northeastern Alberta called the “tar sands” and branded the dirtiest oil anywhere. The image is unfair, but it has become a reality that Alberta and Canada must address.

Story continues below advertisement

It seemed less pressing in years past, when it was only a few Hollywood stars helicoptering aghast over oil sands mines. Opposition has since expanded, and today the list of those who feel it financially prudent to take up the mantle of oil sands skeptic includes some of the world’s biggest money managers, banks, insurers and, yes, even oil companies.

The shift began several years ago. In 2017, Royal Dutch Shell, a long-time oil sands investor, sold most of its holdings. HSBC in 2018 backed away from financing oil sands projects. Earlier this year, BlackRock, the world’s largest money manager, said it would exclude oil sands firms from several funds, calling it and coal “the worst offenders … from a climate perspective.” And in May, Norway’s sovereign wealth fund cut holdings of Canada’s oil sands producers, deeming their greenhouse gas emissions “unacceptable.”

In the past several weeks, Zurich Insurance Group pulled out as lead insurer of the Trans Mountain pipeline, Deutsche Bank said it would not fund new oil sands projects; and Total, the French oil company with two large oil sands holdings, put out a news release titled “climate ambition” and said it would produce less from the oil sands than previously planned.

Mr. Kenney’s instinct has been to fight back by lashing out. He accused HSBC of “hypocrisy.” He established a countermarketing “war room,” but it has been a flop, persuading no one. Its response to the Norwegians involved putting out a series of “facts” and calling the divestment “misinformed at best.” In late July, Alberta’s Energy Minister lambasted Total’s move as “poorly informed and short-sighted.”

It’s true Alberta and Canada have robust regulatory systems, are taking real action on climate change, and that Indigenous people are active in the business of the oil sands. Conservatives love to say that, compared with countries such as Angola or Saudi Arabia, Alberta oil is “ethical oil.” All true. Yet international opinion is, nonetheless, moving against the oil sands. Countering that narrative will be difficult.

It is also true the moves against the oil sands are largely symbolic corporate marketing campaigns, in response to pressure from activists. Deutsche Bank still does business with oil companies. Norway’s sovereign wealth fund is financed by oil revenues. Oil companies, including those in the oil sands, are in the portfolios of many BlackRock funds. Total’s oil sands stake is still producing more than 100,000 barrels a day of Canadian bitumen.

Using the oil sands to check a climate-action box is an easy, cost-free PR win for some corporations and politicians. It’s why Barack Obama vetoed the Keystone XL pipeline in 2015. That did nothing to temper America’s voracious appetite for oil, or its (at the time) booming fracking industry, but it got environmentalists off his back.

For Canada and Alberta to change the narrative, words will not be enough. Zesty rejoinders will fall flat. In the writing business, there is a saying: Show, don’t tell. Alberta spends a lot of time telling.

More show, please. Action is essential. The oil sands are getting cleaner – emissions per barrel are falling – but, to secure the future, they have to get cleaner, faster. To shake the “stigma,” the head of Canadian Natural Resources recently said, meeting emissions reduction targets is crucial.

Mr. Kenney’s first act in office was to eliminate the consumer carbon tax in Alberta. He then watered down Alberta’s industrial carbon tax and fought Ottawa for weaker rules on methane. Canada, meanwhile, may have a nationwide carbon tax, but its 2022 level of $50 a tonne is not especially high. It is not a signal of major ambition.

Two-thirds of Canada’s oil production comes from the oil sands. Alberta and Canada need to show the world this country is serious about reducing oil sands emissions, if we want to keep selling bitumen. Show, don’t tell.

Since March, the COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc on the economy, spurring widespread closures of businesses to curb the spread of the virus. That has prompted millions of applications for CERB, an alternative to employment insurance rolled out in April.

Without things like CERB and B.C.’s evictions moratorium, Carol-Ann Flanagan, with the Society to End Homelessness in Burnaby, said service providers were spared the full potential of the economic downturn and the spike in demand for services that would have followed.

But that doesn’t mean there hasn’t been an increase in people seeking those services. Flanagan pointed to the society’s outreach resource centre. The centre opens every Thursday morning at Southside Community Church (7135 Walker Ave.) and, announced last week, every Monday morning at St. Timothy Anglican Church (4550 Kitchener St.).

There, patrons can access food bank bags, harm reduction supplies and meals, and they can see an outreach worker.

“We are used to seeing 100, 120 people a week on that one morning,” she said. “But now I’m also seeing more families, and that’s because of COVID.”

In all of July, the centre saw 538 single patrons, along with 74 families.

April, on the other hand, was an outlier in the opposite direction – the centre only saw about 160 the entire month.

“Everybody was frightened. A lot of people have health issues, and so they’re compromised, so they could not come,” she said.

April’s numbers average out to around 40 people per week. By comparison, the centre saw about 100 singles and 25 families in the first week of August.

As a property owner and council member, you have the legislated obligation under the Strata Property Act to maintain and repair common property and common assets. Your owners also approved a budget including landscaping services, which is also a lawful instruction to implement the contracts wherever possible. Regardless of the size or type of a strata corporation, annual operations plans are the best method to ensure the obligations of inspection, maintenance and repairs are implemented. An operations plan will summarize the components and assets of your strata corporation, which can easily be converted from your deprecation report, and identify what level of service or inspection and maintenance are required as part of your annual operations, and what components or systems are managed on a long-term basis.

If your strata corporation fails to maintain common property and common assets, and an owner suffers a loss, the owner is likely in a position to seek damages against the strata corporation either through the courts or the civil resolution tribunal. If you have failures relating to building systems or assets that result in insurance claims, your insurance provider is likely going to advise you of this risk, put you on notice of increased costs for claims or advise you of their inability to renew your insurance. Common areas of neglect for strata corporations are drainage and sanitary systems, roofing systems and electrical systems. Most items that are out of sight are often not a priority, but these key components often result in avoidable claims and damages, and a significant disruption to owners. Sanitary lines and drains for example, should be flushed professionally at least every three years if not more frequently. Likely due to the increased occupancy periods this year with the pandemic restrictions, there has also been an increase in sewer backups, but the most common attributable factor is simply aging building systems that are neglected.

Sewer backup is one of the most severe problems, and accessing buildings during the lock down is a greater problem, as the plumbing contractor will require access to strata lots as well.

General inspection and maintenance of operational building components is the best method to prevent losses, claims, unnecessary damages and, in many cases, often extend the life of building components. Roofing systems cover 100% of our investments, yet most property owners undertake inspection or maintenance on an annual basis. A qualified inspector or roofer can identify deficiencies and damages that can be easily and quickly addressed to ensure good performance of the roofing system and extend the life of the roofing system if routine service is conducted.

Routine maintenance of hot-water boilers will extend the life of the boilers and ensure they are performing at their best efficiency levels reducing energy consumption and cost. If your roof fails, this is now an emergency repair. Damages have been caused, the cost for after hours response is significant and the repair is short term rather than a co-ordinated approach to maintenance and renewals. The attitude of waiting until a component fails before we have to fix it is a false economy.

Create a schedule of all your building components and determine what services you require and the frequency of servicing. For more information on operations plans and samples, go to choa.bc.ca and view the webinar on operations plans.

The Canada Revenue Agency expects online services to be fully restored by Wednesday after fraudsters used thousands of pilfered usernames and passwords to obtain government services.

About 5,600 CRA accounts were targeted in what the federal government describes as “credential stuffing” schemes, in which hackers used passwords and usernames from other websites to access Canadians’ revenue agency accounts.

The suspension of CRA’s online services comes as many Canadians are relying on the revenue agency’s website to access financial support related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

People can still apply for benefit programs including the Canada Emergency Student Benefit and the Canada Emergency Response Benefit by calling 1-800-959-8281, said Annette Butikofer, chief information officer of the revenue agency.

In addition, employers can apply for the latest wage subsidy as planned, she said during a briefing Monday on the cyberattacks.

“We know employers are counting on these funds.”

The government is advising Canadians to use unique passwords for all online accounts and to check for suspicious activity.

The Canada Revenue Agency expects its online services to be fully restored by Wednesday after fraudsters used thousands of stolen usernames and passwords to obtain government services. About 5,600 CRA accounts were targeted in what the federal government describes as ""credential stuffing"" schemes, in which the fraudsters use identifiers and passwords from other websites to access Canadians' accounts with the revenue agency. The Canadian Press

Federal officials have been grappling for the last week with the credential stuffing attacks, made possible through information that was previously stolen from non-government accounts.

The technique, often beginning with huge caches of usernames and passwords found in the darker reaches of the internet, takes advantage of peoples’ tendency to reuse passwords.

Fraudsters then use automated web bots to hammer websites with various credentials until they hit upon the right combination and get in, said Marc Brouillard, acting chief information officer of Canada.

Story continues below advertisement

Once in, the attacker can take over these accounts and steal personal information or undertake activities as that user, he told the briefing.

The first of three attacks in the last week took aim at the GCKey service, which is used by about 30 federal departments and allows Canadians to access services like the My Service Canada account.

By using the previously stolen usernames and passwords, the perpetrators were able to fraudulently acquire about 9,000 of the some 12 million GCKey accounts, one-third of which accessed federal services and are being further examined for suspicious activities, Mr. Brouillard said.

Affected GCKey accounts were cancelled, and the government is contacting users whose credentials were compromised with instructions on how to obtain a new GCKey.

Separately, CRA’s system was hit by credential stuffing attacks. The perpetrators were able to use previously hacked credentials to access the CRA portal. They were also able to exploit a vulnerability that allowed them to bypass the CRA security questions and get into thousands more accounts.

In addition, early Saturday morning, the CRA portal was directly targeted with a large amount of traffic trying to attack the services through credential stuffing.

“Out of an abundance of caution the CRA portal was shut down to contain the attack and implement measures to protect CRA services,” Mr. Brouillard said.

Credential stuffers are difficult to detect because they are not trying to sneak through a back door, he said.

“They are applying credentials just like normal users. So it’s very hard to detect that pattern from all of the good traffic. But we have systems to monitor and look for these behaviours and identify when patterns don’t seem to make sense and that’s how this particular [attack] was identified.”

The government is looking at greater use of two-factor authentication, where a user trying to log in to a system enters not only a password but receives a message with a code or link they must act on before being allowed in.

But putting this in place for all programs could be challenging, Mr. Brouillard suggested.

“We also have to worry about making our systems accessible and easy to use, so it is a balancing act,” he said. “We’re looking at ways of strengthening our systems to be able to address these issues.”

Several federal agencies are investigating the incidents and since their work is ongoing, nothing will be said about the suspected perpetrators, said Scott Jones, head of Canadian Centre for Cyber Security.

The RCMP was notified of unusual activity Tues., Aug. 11, Ms. sButikofer said.

“The confidence and trust that individuals and businesses have in the CRA are the cornerstones of Canada’s tax system,” she said.

She said the revenue agency’s teams have been “working around the clock to resolve these issues and protect the confidential information of Canadians.”

Accounts of affected individuals have been revoked and letters have been sent to these people, she added.

Asked during the briefing if the government would apologize, Mr. Brouillard sidestepped the question.

“It’s not a matter of being sorry or not sorry,” he said. “Of course, this is not something we want to happen. But we are reacting to those attackers and addressing them and mitigating those services as much as possible. And that does include supporting Canadians.”

An expression of regret did, however, come from Lori MacDonald, chief operating officer at Service Canada.

“Certainly we apologize for any inconvenience on behalf of the government of Canada caused to any of our clients,” she told the briefing.

All CRA My Account users are encouraged, once services have been reactivated, to enable e-mail notifications as a security measure, Butikofer said. This allows taxpayers to be contacted by e-mail if their address or direct-deposit information has been changed on CRA records.

“These notifications act as an early warning to Canadians of potentially fraudulent activity on their accounts.”

Since our purchase, the strata council has done nothing but obstruct our attempts to conduct alterations and block our ability to consolidate our two strata lots, and has insisted that we will be required to pay higher strata fees.

They have refused to grant permission for the removal of a section of wall between the units, even though we have obtained a structural engineering report and a building permit for the work. The wall is not structural and does not contain any services, such as plumbing or venting, that could affect our two units or another strata lot.

This was a significant investment intended to raise our family in an affordable setting and has turned into a disaster. Are there some options to force the strata council to co-operate with our request and resolve this?

Maria and George C., Vancouver

Strata corporations are naturally reluctant to allow the removal of walls between units or above and below units.

There are many buyers who try to flip units quickly by doing quick-fix alterations and changes. Then the next buyer comes along and discovers there are problems with mechanical services, the walls were, in fact, structural and supporting, the ventilation has significantly changed or the plumbing — water delivery or drainage — has been altered.

Both the new owner and the strata corporation are often left with damages and liability to remedy the unauthorized alterations.

Owners who want to remove all or part of a wall that is a common boundary between two strata lots require the written approval of the strata corporation.

Provided the owner complies with building regulations and any applicable municipal or regional bylaws, and does not interfere with the provision of utilities or other services to any other strata lot or common property, and provides copies of any required building permits to the strata corporation, the strata corporation must grant the permission.

Documents and plans certified by an engineer that verify the scope of the work in detail, address building-code requirements, and include the required building permits would be a minimal standard for a strata council to request.

If the strata council does not act reasonably, Strata Property Act provisions can be enforced with an application through the Civil Resolution Tribunal.

It would be beneficial to request a hearing with the strata council, which can be conducted electronically. You may wish to retain a lawyer to be present at your hearing to determine what conditions, if any, are not being met, or if the strata is simply refusing to comply with the act.

The unit entitlement or size of the two strata lots remains the same, as well as the voting rights of one vote per strata lot. There is no increase in strata fees, as the habitable area of each strata lot has not been changed. As the owner, you continue to pay the same strata fee entitlement for the two strata lots.

Any other changes within the strata lot, such as removal of a kitchen or update or remodelling of bathrooms or internal walls and rooms, all require the permission of the strata corporation. Detailed drawings and plans should be provided to help the strata council make a decision.

Changes to electrical systems, plumbing and ventilation can also have a significant effect on the use and enjoyment of other strata lots.

During the COVID-19 restrictions, many strata corporations are encouraging owners to delay alterations to strata lots to reduce construction activity within their buildings and reduce the transiency of contractors and trades.

The level of caution your strata council is exercising is prudent; however, under normal conditions, they do have an obligation to grant permission within a timely manner.

Last month, the provincial government announced that renters will be expected to pay rent in full on Sept. 1, and renters with outstanding rent payments from March 18 to Aug. 17 will have until at least July 2021 to pay back what they owe.

The first repayments will not start until October at the earliest.

The terms of the repayment plan must include:

Amount of outstanding rent

Start date of the repayment plan

Amount of each installment

Dates for each installment

The repayment installments must begin at least 30 days after the date that the landlord gives the plan to the renter.

The plan must also give renters until July 2021 to repay the amount owed, unless the landlord and renter agree to a longer repayment period.

And while the rent will be paid back in equal installments, the province says that renters and landlords have the option of agreeing to smaller amounts being paid each month, in the beginning of the repayment process.

The installments must also be paid on the same date that rent is due.

Meanwhile, landlords are temporarily prohibited from increasing rent until December 2020. According to the province, if a renter has been issued a notice of rent increase for an earlier date, they shouldn’t pay the increase and instead continue to pay their current amount until December.

The Temporary Rental Supplement also remains available until Aug. 31.

To date, the supplement has assisted over 86,000 households with paying their rent during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Renters still experiencing a loss of income may also qualify for the Rental Assistance Program or the Shelter Aid for Elderly Renters – programs which provide ongoing rental subsidies to low- and moderate-income families and seniors.",336,0.9881121369539806,business

Fossil fools

Re Alberta Is Losing The Oil Sands PR War (Editorial, Aug. 13): The Globe and Mail’s editorial rightly points out that Canada’s carbon tax, aimed for $50 a tonne by 2022, is not a signal of major ambition. The government would need to increase the tax past 2022 to reach $210 a tonne by 2030 to meet its Paris targets, according to last year’s final report from Canada’s Ecofiscal Commission.

However, I find the editorial misses the mark in its argument that greening Alberta’s oil sands will somehow give it a shot in the global market. Oil sands are among the most expensive oil sources in the world. Its staying power has always depended on a high price a barrel, which is not happening any time soon, if ever, because of the oil glut caused by the pandemic, cheaper oil sources and clean energy growth, to name a few reasons.

Cheryl McNamara Toronto

“When asked about some international investors starting to shun the oil sands, Mr. Kenney declared it was a passing fad, the ‘flavour of the day.’”

My parents lived in a small coal-mining village in Yorkshire that had its heart ripped out by Margaret Thatcher 30 years ago. There was no “just transition” in those days.

Let not our fossil-fuel workers be led to disappointment and despair by fossil fools.

Listen locally

Re Site C Dam Underscores Need For More Time-sensitive Approach To Project Approvals (Aug. 13): I want to endorse contributor Adam Pankratz’s argument that to “prioritize local voices when gathering feedback” is essential, including for reducing excessively long timelines for project reviews. My experience in Canada’s pipeline industry confirms that a pre-regulatory, multi-stakeholder involvement process has unique value.

Story continues below advertisement

This type of sustained, inclusive process powerfully facilitates the earning of trust and strengthening of relationships, while better understanding and addressing local concerns. It does this through a meaningful sharing of control, as well as information, in an atmosphere of mutual respect.

This usually paves the way to a more calm, collaborative and technically informed discussion of all relevant issues.

Such stakeholder involvement tends to achieve dispute-resolution goals by combining the scientific rigour of environmental impact assessments, the economic rationality of cost-benefit analysis and the procedural fairness of quasi-judicial hearings, as well as the democratic and good neighbour principles of priority participation by representatives of communities most directly put at risk.

Re Canada Needs Its Own ‘Build Back Better’ Plan (Report on Business, Aug. 14): Contributor Robert Asselin calls on the Canadian government to match Joe Biden’s industrial policy framework with one of its own. If someone wrote a book about Canadian industrial policies over the past several decades, I believe they would find big outlays of public funds, jobs for friends of the government and firms that received public funds being bought out by U.S. companies, happy to benefit from Canadian subsidies.

Every incoming government claims they have the secret for Canadian economic development. Arthur Kruger, the arch-mandarin with several deputy minister jobs on his CV once said that what Canadian governments should do is limit themselves to providing the infrastructure – good transportation, education and so on – and leave the rest to the private sector.

Current industrial policies deserve some responsibility for the low level of Canadian productivity – about 25 per cent lower than the United States.

CRA insecurity

Re Thousands Of CRA, Government Service Accounts Disabled By Cyberattacks (Aug. 17): Government services have been pushing people to sign up for online accounts for years. To increase the online take up, the Treasury Board of Canada simplified the process by getting people to access federal services with a unique GCKey credential. To make it even easier, you can register for those services by using your banking credentials. This is a tremendous technical fit! One login and one password can now give people online access to all those banking and government services.

The Treasury Board says now that the recent attacks “took advantage of the fact that many people reuse passwords and usernames across multiple accounts.” Do you see the paradox? They blame Canadians for reusing their login and password, but also enabled a system that does just that: same unique credentials for a large number of critical services.

Whoever dreamed of the GCKey system must surely work with the best security experts. Except they forgot the golden rule: In IT security, the weakest link is the person behind the keyboard. If everyone is pushed online by their government, access needs to be designed for the most tech-vulnerable people, not the tech savvy. But do not hold your breath, because the GCKey system will stay even if it is dangerous for my grandmother.

Camp X security

Re Canadian Women’s Army Corps Created (Moment in Time, Aug. 13): My aunt Cecile didn’t join the Canadian Women’s Army Corps. But in the spring of 1942, she did approach Tommy Drew-Brook, the Canadian director of British Security Co-ordination, in the same Toronto building where she worked as a teller. She offered her considerable clerical skills to assist in the war effort.

By June, after a thorough review of her background by the RCMP, she was ensconced at Camp X, enciphering and decoding BSC messages and cables for the famous Hydra coding machine.

One day in the 1970s, she revealed to me that she went through the basic training all Camp X “agents” received. So, her superiors considered her qualified to move to Manhattan, where she sat outside the office of BSC chief Sir William Stephenson for the rest of the war, doing “clerical work” while guarding the door! She was only 27.

Punting the ball

Re CFL’s Board To Discuss Fate Of Season After Bid For Federal Loan Falls Through, Sources Say (Aug. 17): Our government has no problem giving WE $43-million to dole out just less than $1-billion for a kids’ volunteer program, but it can’t give the CFL a $30-million interest-free loan. Maybe if Margaret Trudeau was paid to sing the national anthem and Bill Morneau’s family got a flight, hotel and tickets to the Grey Cup, it might get the loan approved.

Terry Duguid, a Winnipeg MP and parliamentary secretary for Western Economic Diversification Canada, says the COVID-19 pandemic has created uncertainty for many food-related businesses.

He says the government intends the funds to help them weather that and be well-positioned for future business.

The Liberals have been under sustained pressure from farmers and food producers to do more to address the issues the COVID-19 pandemic has created for the sector.

Among other things, there have been outbreaks of the illness among farm workers and in processing plants, and sharp declines for certain products due to the near shutdown of the entire hospitality industry leading to an oversupply of food with no markets.

While the federal government initially responded with a $252-million bailout package, they were criticized for including in that some previously announced money.

The funds being announced today comes from the budgets of the various federal economic development agencies, which focus on supporting hyper-local initiatives.

In some cases, the funding represents deals that were in the works well before the pandemic, or is being given to the companies in the form of repayable loans.

Duguid said while some of the money may have been earmarked pre-pandemic, it doesn’t discount the benefit it will bring to businesses.

“This is about today, this is about COVID, this is about a difficult time but it is also about the future,” he said.

But the introduction of artificial intelligence and other advanced technologies promises to challenge this century-old model. In fact, this could be an opportunity to rethink a post-work component of the model that may no longer fit: retirement.

Why our perception of retirement is outdated

The idea of retirement was invented in 1881 by Otto von Bismarck, then-minister president of Prussia. According to Bismarck, “those who are disabled from work by age and invalidity have a well-grounded claim to care from the state.” The idea took nearly a decade to implement, but the official age of retirement was eventually set at 70. Other countries followed this model. But in the 1880s, the life expectancy in Prussia was also 70. The benefits were designed to last people a year, at best.

In Canada, the average retirement age is 64, but the life expectancy is now 82 (and rising). Moreover, the number of people over the age of 65 is expected to double by 2036. Canadians, in combination with a small supplemented income from the federal government (if you qualify), have to save enough money to last almost 20 years without a salary. Economically speaking, both government budgets and citizen savings accounts are becoming more strained.

Studies suggest that early retirement is not good for our health. In 2019, U.S. researchers concluded that “pension benefits and retirement actually resulted in reduced cognitive performance,” with the largest indicator being delayed recall, an early sign of dementia. In fact, the OECD has recommended the eventual elimination of all mandatory retirement policies.

Moreover, age alone does not necessitate retirement. Indeed, the World Health Organization has confirmed that “age is not a reliable indicator when judging a worker’s potential productivity,” and that “policies enforcing mandatory retirement ages do not actually help create jobs for youth.”

But most compellingly, Harvard Business Review concluded that the concept of retirement itself may be flawed. The islands of Okinawa in the East China Sea are home to the people with the longest disability-free life expectancy in the world. Okinawan women are three times more likely to reach the age of 100 than North American women. In the Okinawa Islands, the concept of retirement simply does not exist. According to the Harvard Business Review, “literally nothing in their language describes the concept of stopping work completely.” Instead, the Okinawa people have ikigai, “the reason you wake up in the morning.” In other words, the thing that drives you and is fundamentally critical to your existence. Even after controlling for variables such as diet, age and education, a seven-year study conducted by Tohoku University’s Graduate School of Medicine revealed that 95 per cent of seniors with ikigai lived until the end of the seven-year study, compared to 83 per cent of those without an ikigai.

How artificial intelligence can help

By 2030, the most dominant form of work is forecasted to be independent contracting – self-employed individuals who are contracted for specific projects or services – for both blue-collar and white-collar jobs. This is because organizations will need to stay nimble to adapt to the dynamic state of technology. Hiring workers for specific tasks and projects instead of hiring full-time employees allows for more flexibility. However, since independent contractors are self-employed, this presents an opportunity for people to control the capacity of their workload and redefine the work week around a schedule that works for them, a solution touted by Harvard Business Review for managing a multigenerational workforce. For someone over 65, this could mean taking on a project that requires only one day of work a week, for example, or only working in the afternoons.

Other examples of making jobs more accessible to an older workforce include:

Modified tasks: Physically taxing jobs, such as manufacturing lines, that still require human involvement can be accompanied by collaborative robots to help older workers with tasks that are physically complex or require heavy lifting. Nissan has successfully taken this approach.

Remote work: For more knowledge-based jobs, video-conferencing platforms and communication tools have enabled remote work. This may be a more favourable option for older workers.

Rethinking retirement is not about taking away people’s opportunity to finally rest, but about empowering people with the choice to live life in a way that works for them. It can be a way that allows all of us to find – or hold onto – our ikigai.

The Innu Nation has filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission alleging the federal government spends more money removing children from homes than keeping families together.

Gregory Rich, grand chief of the Innu Nation, which represents the Innu of Labrador, said in a statement Tuesday Canada’s child welfare system has had devastating consequences.

The complaint, which was filed in June, says the federal government gives Newfoundland and Labrador more money for the foster care system compared with the funds it provides to help families.

Story continues below advertisement

A 2016 Canadian Human Rights Tribunal decision found the federal government’s unequal funding for child welfare services discriminated against children who live on reserves. That ruling called for “immediate relief” for First Nations children.

Mr. Rich, however, said funding from Ottawa remains inadequate and Innu children are suffering.

He said the federal government spends 10 times more money placing children in foster care compared with investments into community-based prevention services that help keep families united.

“Innu Nation is taking action to stand up for our children,” he said in the Tuesday statement. “And the least the federal government can do is what the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal has ordered.

“Until that happens, our children and families are facing the consequences, and that means more lives lost or destroyed.”

Mr. Rich said one Innu child out of every 10 has been taken out of their home as a result of the current funding system.

A 15-year-old Innu boy from Natuashish died by suicide in May at a government-approved group home in Happy Valley-Goose Bay, Mr. Rich said. The teenager’s death led to renewed calls for the long-awaited inquiry into the treatment of Innu children in the care of Newfoundland and Labrador’s child protection services.

Story continues below advertisement

The provincial government and Innu leaders formally agreed in 2017 to hold an inquiry after the suicide of 16-year-old Thunderheart Tshakapesh earlier that year. Mr. Rich said the death of the teenager in May is the “the latest tragedy that has devastated our families in so many ways.”

The human-rights complaint alleges an Innu agency created to help children was denied funding because it didn’t provide foster care services.

According to the Innu Nation’s filing with the human-rights commission, Ottawa said the agency, called the Innu Round Table Secretariat, did not meet the federal government’s requirements for needs-based funding. Ottawa also said funding from the federal government had to be delegated by the province.

That decision has created bureaucratic hurdles that are “illogical, unduly onerous, arbitrary … and unnecessary,” the Innu Nation alleges.

Paramount Resources Ltd. said Monday the amalgamation of Strath Resources and Cona Resources is not in the best interests of shareholders and exercised its right of dissent under Alberta Business Corporations Act. The move means Paramount is entitled to a cash payment of the value of its common shares.

Waterous Energy Fund (WEF), run by former investment banker Adam Waterous, announced last week it is merging its heavy oil and natural gas companies and has bought a large stake in a privately held oil sands producer to gain economies of scale and maintain access to capital.

The new Calgary-based company, called Strathcona Resources Ltd., will produce about 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, around two-thirds of which is in the form of condensate and heavy oil. The rest is natural gas.

According to Mr. Waterous, WEF invested $1.5-billion in six transactions to create Strathcona Resources. The last acquisition was Cona’s purchase of debt-hobbled Pengrowth Energy Corp. early this year, which brought with it the Lindbergh steam-driven heavy oil project near Cold Lake, Alta.

Paramount president and chief executive Jim Riddell did not return requests for comment, but the company said in a statement it didn’t think the amalgamation – nor the process under which the deal was approved – were in the best interests of shareholders.

Mr. Waterous told The Globe and Mail in an interview Tuesday he was “surprised” with Paramount’s decision, given WEF received a comprehensive fairness analysis from ATB prior to the merger.

“We had other very large, very sophisticated shareholders in WEF that had different interests in each business [Strath and Cona], and we had unanimous support for this,” he said.

In 2018, Strath bought Paramount’s oil and gas producing assets in the Kakwa region of northwestern Alberta for $340-million, with half paid in cash and the rest by 85 million common shares at $2 each.

The deal gave Paramount 15.6-per-cent ownership of Strath and a seat on its board of directors, but Mr. Waterous said the merger would have seen Paramount’s share of the new business slip back to single digits.

Paramount held common shares of Strath valued at $170-million prior to the amalgamation, according to investment analysts Stifel First Energy.

However, Stifel also noted the value of those shares likely fell in the face of the global economic slowdown and oil price retreat because of the COVID-19 pandemic. That decline was reflected in Paramount’s second-quarter results, which valued its “level three” investments (including its stake in Strath) at $97-million at the end of June.

Paramount’s net debt sat at $810-million at the end of the second quarter, which Stifel said would make any sort of cash injection a positive move for the energy company.

The hundreds of millions in developer “contributions” that the City of Vancouver has relied on for years to pay for housing, parks and child-care centres has dried to a trickle as builders refuse to agree to the same levels of fees in a collapsing real-estate market.

Builders say they have not been able to move projects forward because the city is still asking for the same kinds of contributions that were being negotiated at the height of the market.

That flow of money, which depends on leveraging Vancouver’s valuable real estate by allowing more density on key sites in exchange for developer payments out of their increased profit to pay for needed community services, has dried up in the past 18 months.

Story continues below advertisement

It dropped from $706-million in 2018 to $86-million in 2019 and a dribble so far in 2020, according to city reports and industry analysts. That includes both cash and in-kind contributions, such as social-housing units or child-care spaces that are included in a project and then turned over to the city.

What is still being collected is coming from projects where the community-amenity contribution, or CAC, is a non-negotiable amount for that area. Missing are the larger contributions that typically come from big, complex condo projects, usually downtown, where the price per square foot is set after complex calculations about the project’s finances.

As well, some developers who had contribution agreements prior to 2019 are putting those projects on hold.

The last major project with an agreed-upon community-amenity contribution, a condo tower in Coal Harbour, had its CAC set at $325 a square foot at the end of 2018. Another one near BC Place stadium was set at $315 in that pre-2019 period.

Builders say the city is continuing to ask for the same levels of contributions as it was getting in 2018, even though the market has slowed significantly. As well, the province has layered new taxes onto expensive or “speculator” homes, which is putting more downward pressure on prices.

“The city has said ‘We think you can sell for more than you’re saying.’ We say that isn’t working,” said Anne McMullin, the CEO of the Urban Development Institute, which represents most of the large developers in the region.

But the city’s head planner, Gil Kelley, said the city has to find a way to pay for growth in the city and it can’t function by just reducing or eliminating those amenity contributions in slow markets.

Story continues below advertisement

“We are really trying to protect the public’s interest to make sure new growth pays it share,” Mr. Kelley said.

As well, he said, the current council has made it clear it wants more housing affordability – therefore more of a contribution from developers – in every project, not the same or less.

But the tussle over what to do about Vancouver’s real estate golden goose has produced a near standoff between city staff and many developers.

Reliance Properties Ltd. CEO Jon Stovell said he has had a project on hold for a year as his team and the city’s real estate department, the group that assesses how much a developer should have to “contribute” back if its project gets rezoned to allow a lot more building on the site, can’t agree on an amount.

Mr. Kelley, who has the final say on staff recommendations about what CAC should be charged for a project, said Monday the city has just issued this week some new guidelines on how community-amenity contributions should be calculated to provide more transparency and certainty.

And he said the city is willing to consider some new approaches, recognizing that no one has a real handle on what condo prices are these days because there are so few sales.

Story continues below advertisement

One would be to reduce the required contribution from previous high levels, as long as that builder committed to starting construction within a certain period. “We don’t want to negotiate lower CACs than we did in 2018 and then not have them build for seven or eight years,” Mr. Kelley said.

Another option is to set a high CAC, based on the sales price city staff claim that builders will get, but delay the payment until the project has enough sales at high prices to go ahead.

The bigger conundrum facing Vancouver, Mr. Kelley said, is that many developers are switching their projects for the foreseeable future from condos, which they’re having a hard time selling, to rentals, which Vancouver never seems to have enough of. Rental-project developers typically pay much lower or no CACs at all.

Jason Reed/Reuters

Australian mining magnate Gina Rinehart’s Hancock Prospecting Pty is hoping a charm offensive, from annual fundraising parties to local refurbishments at a golf course, will help overcome opposition to a massive new coal mine in Canada’s Rocky Mountains.

Hancock unit Riversdale Resources’ Grassy Mountain mine, which is forecast to produce 4.5 million tonnes of steelmaking coal per year, would span 2,800 hectares and could set a precedent for new projects in the region. Opponents say the project would harm wildlife and water in the area.

In June, the province of Alberta, home to most of Canada’s oil reserves, rolled back 1970s-era restrictions on open-pit coal mining to jumpstart an economy hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic and plunging oil prices.

Story continues below advertisement

The proposal for Grassy Mountain predates that change. But Alberta’s move is at odds with Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s effort to wean the country from coal and comes as a growing number of banks, insurers and investors shun the fossil fuel due to climate concerns.

Public hearings are slated to begin in October for the Grassy Mountain, which requires federal and provincial approvals.

Hancock is among a raft of Australian companies with projects in the region, aiming to ship coking coal from Alberta to Asian markets. Atrum Coal and privately held Montem Resources are also pursuing nearby mines and exploration ventures, as is private developer Cabin Ridge Project Ltd.

The company has sponsored annual Australia Day fundraising bashes, and also opened a newly rebuilt golf course this month, accompanying eight new holes at the local Crowsnest Pass Golf Club. The work helped clear the way for a coal loadout near the course.

Hancock, which took over the firm that owned Grassy Mountain last year, matched funds raised at this year’s event to support a local senior’s association in Crowsnest Pass, Alberta.

Still, landowners remain worried about water use and habitat destruction in an ecologically sensitive mountain corridor renowned for postcard scenery and wildlife.

“I think 10 years down the road the water will be polluted to the point that we may not be able to grow crops,” said alfalfa farmer Norm Watmough, 76, whose holiday cabin abuts the mine lease. “It’s going to destroy southern Alberta.”

Story continues below advertisement

Hancock declined to comment and referred questions to filings in which the company details its plans to treat wastewater.

Landowners said they are worried that selenium from waste rock could leach into nearby waterways. The company has said in filings that it plans to pump water with high selenium and nitrate concentrations to saturated zones in pits and build waste rock dumps at higher elevations to minimize risks.

Miners have welcomed Alberta’s move to loosen environmental protections to increase open-pit mining along the Rockies’ eastern slopes.

Canada has committed to eliminate coal-fired power by 2030 and last month said it would assess climate impacts of new thermal coal mines and exports.

Coking coal is “less of a concern at the present time than thermal coal,” Canadian Environment and Climate Change Minister Jonathan Wilkinson said. “But to the extent that there are significant (project) impacts that can’t be mitigated, then obviously that becomes a lot more challenging.”

Three producers of The Ellen DeGeneres Show have exited amid allegations of a dysfunctional workplace that harboured misbehaviour including sexual misconduct and racially insensitive remarks.

Executive producers Ed Glavin and Kevin Leman and coexecutive producer Jonathan Norman have “parted ways” with the long-running daytime series, a spokesperson for producer Warner Bros. said in a statement Monday.

An internal company investigation of claims about the show was prompted by a BuzzFeed News report in July based on 36 interviews with ex-staffers, who complained about or said they witnessed improper and unfair treatment.

Story continues below advertisement

Most of the allegations were tied to executive producers and senior managers, including Glavin, Leman and Norman, BuzzFeed News said. The people making the claims against them were not identified.

A representative for Leman didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Monday. Representatives for Glavin and Norman couldn’t immediately be found.

In statements to BuzzFeed News after the July 30 story was published online, Leman denied “any kind of sexual impropriety” and Norman said he categorically denied the accusations.

DeGeneres informed staff of the shakeup Monday in a video conference call, according to Variety, which first reported the development. She said she found claims about the show’s environment to be “heartbreaking,” the trade publication said, citing unidentified sources.

The comedian and host had sent a memo to her staff after last month’s BuzzFeed article, recalling her early promise of ensuring a workplace where “everyone would be treated with respect.” Something changed, she said, “and for that, I am sorry.”

The show debuted in 2003.

In a separate July statement, Warner Bros. said parent company WarnerMedia’s investigation revealed what it called “some flaws in the show’s daily management.”

Story continues below advertisement

Although not all of the allegations were corroborated, the studio said it was “disappointed that the primary findings of the investigation indicated some deficiencies related to the show’s day-to-day management.”

No details were specified at the time, and Warner Bros. had no further comment Monday beyond confirming the producers’ departures.

Canada’s official fiscal watchdog says the federal wage subsidy program might cost $14-billion less than the government predicted.

A new report today by Parliamentary Budget Office analyst Ben Segel-Brown estimates subsidizing wages for companies during the COVID-19 pandemic will cost $67.9-billion through the end of December.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau estimated in his July fiscal report it would cost $82.3-billion.

Story continues below advertisement

Mr. Segel-Brown says that figure was prudent at the time because of economic uncertainty and continuing work to update the program’s rules.

The Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy encourages employers to keep their workers on the payroll even as work slows because of the pandemic by offering to cover as much as 75 per cent of wages.

The program was initially just for three months, but it has since been extended and the amount of the subsidy now ranges from 10 per cent to 75 per cent depending on how much a company’s revenue have dropped each month.

The report also expects another $500-million in foregone payroll contributions such as employment insurance, but the costs are offset by an expected $9.1-billion in corporate taxes on the wage subsidy.

That would mean the ultimate cost of the program could be around $59.2-billion.

More than 285,000 employers have been approved for the subsidy as of Aug. 9, and Ottawa has paid out $26.5-billion to date. More than 800,000 employees have seen their wages subsidized.

The maximum weekly benefit in the first four months was $847. That amount will get smaller for most employers each month, until it hits $226 in November. Some companies whose revenue are most affected by the economic shutdowns can apply for a top-up that could increase the amount.

More than 12 million eggs will be redistributed via an emergency federal program designed to help farmers faced with too much food and nowhere to sell it due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau announced Thursday that the government has signed eight agreements worth nearly $50-million to help align the needs of food banks and other community groups with what farmers and producers can supply.

In an interview with The Canadian Press, Bibeau called the program a “win-win-win.”

Story continues below advertisement

“It’s reaching three objectives,” she said.

“The first one to feed the people in need, second to support our farmers by buying some of their surplus at the cost of production and the third one was avoiding food waste.”

The organizations receiving the money include Food Banks Canada, Second Harvest and the Quebec group La Tablee des Chefs.

Altogether, approximately 12 million kilograms of everything from fish to fowl will be purchased from food producers and then redistributed under the $50-million food surplus program announced by the Liberals earlier this year.

The near shutdown of the hospitality industry has meant a sharp decline in the number of places to sell perishable foods.

That has led to litres of milk being dumped down drains, potatoes going bad in storage and farmers facing higher costs to hold on to animals they had nowhere to sell if slaughtered.

At the same time, food banks have reported sharp increases in the number of people seeking assistance, having lost their jobs due to the pandemic, and there were calls for the federal government to find a way to match up the two.

Story continues below advertisement

Lori Nikkel, the chief executive officer at Second Harvest, said pre-pandemic, an estimated 58 per cent of all the food produced for Canadians was going to waste.

That number was definitely pushed higher by COVID-19, she said, and she applauded the federal government’s leadership in spooling up the program.

Second Harvest uses an online platform, FoodRescue.ca, to link up organizations that need food for their programs with farmers and producers who have surplus goods.

They received $11-million from the government to expand that program to include paying producers directly for their food, and ensure the groups on the receiving end have what they need to process, distribute and store it.

Ms. Nikkel said the money will go fast, and she hopes the federal government will consider a new round of funding at a later date as the need will not go away.

“The commodities are going to change,” she said.

Story continues below advertisement

“Who we are helping now may not be the people we are helping tomorrow.”

Ms. Bibeau said the government will keep an eye on whether the demand from organizations, and oversupply from producers, remains in the coming months.

“We’ll keep the door open in the sense that for now, we feel it’s a very worthwhile program, and we look forward to seeing how it will evolve in the coming weeks.”

Ten per cent of the product being purchased by the surplus program is being sent to northern communities.

Among the projects focused on those is one with Fisher River Cree Nation in Manitoba, which received $10.8-million to catch millions of kilograms of walleye and redistribute the fish to more than 75 Indigenous communities.

Demand at the Food Bank has increased around 32 per cent since March, said Duncan Chalmers, community engagement and grants co-ordinator.

“And our food rescue programming has increased around 66 per cent,” he said. Every day, about 8,000 pounds of fresh, perishable food is collected and redistributed through more than 65 partner organizations within the Food Share Network.

“As COVID restrictions continue and government supports such as the CERB [Canada Emergency Response Benefit] begin to expire, we expect to see a continued or even elevated degree of need as we move into the fall,” Chalmers said.

Pre-COVID, the food bank helped about 6,000 individuals per month, with the larger network assisting 40,000 people each month, he said.

More families, especially single-parent families, are turning to the food bank, he said.

Seniors or those concerned about seniors they know are also contacting the agency in higher numbers, he said.

Although food stocks are stable right now, “as emergency funding continues to diminish we envision an increased need for donations as we move into the fall and the unknown season of what’s next” regarding COVID, he said.

As with all organizations, the pandemic has altered the way the food bank operates.

Instead of people showing up at the 625 Queens Ave. location to view available dry goods and perishables and choose products in a market setting, they now collect pre-packaged hampers, passed over by staff in the parking lot.

People can also pick up fresh produce at that location as well.

Hampers with non-perishable food are packed in the organization’s 13,500-square-foot Esquimalt warehouse.

The number of employed staff members has dropped to about 20 from 30, as some services are not being offered at this time, such as programming in the building, Chalmers said.

Numbers at the food bank have gone down as well. Prior to the pandemic, about 50 volunteers helped out daily, out of a pool of more than 350, Chalmers said.

Now a smaller team of about 15 to 20 people comes in “pretty much every day,” he said. “Good to keep amount of people coming in and out of the Mustard Seed to a minimum and keep our work bubble small.”

The agency accepts both food and financial donations. Financial donations are preferred, as it can stretch each dollar through purchasing agreements with wholesalers, he said.

Among the organizations benefitting from the Food Share Network is Living Edge, which also receives help from other community-oriented agencies.

It partners with local churches to offer free fresh groceries, breads and other items at weekly markets throughout the community. Churches rely on hundreds of volunteers put on the markets.

People are not required to show identification, said Deborah Price, Living Edge administrative assistant.

Markets are held in locations such as Esquimalt, Central Saanich, downtown, Quadra Street. These days everyone is following health and safety protocols, Price said.

The markets do more than provide essentials — they foster friendships as well as a sense of community, she said.

“It is really doing more than just feeding people.” she said. “It is connecting people and giving people hope and know that they are not in this alone.”

What is COVID-19?

COVID-19 symptoms are similar to other respiratory illnesses, including the flu and common cold. They include cough, sneezing, fever, sore throat and difficulty breathing.

The best way to prevent potential transmission is to wash your hands for at least 20 seconds, avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth, cough or sneeze into a tissue or your sleeve, avoid contact with people who are sick, and stay home if you are sick.

This is a developing story.

Legislature in Victoria, B.C., on Friday August 14, CHAD HIPOLITO/The Canadian Press

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh is calling on Ottawa to provide the provinces with billions in funding for child care – a demand that could help determine whether the minority Liberal government survives.

With the support of the Liberals, the NDP passed a motion this week calling on the federal government to immediately transfer $2 billion to the provinces for child care.

Singh is now upping the ante, calling for another $10 billion over the next four years.

Singh says $2 billion is needed this year just to ensure there are enough child-care spaces available to allow parents – particularly mothers – to go back to work now that restrictions to curb the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic are being relaxed.

He says another $10 billion over the next four years is necessary to ensure universal, affordable, accessible child care for all.

With the Bloc Quebecois threatening to bring down the Liberal government this fall, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau can’t afford to dismiss the demands of New Democrats, whose support could be the key to avoiding defeat on a confidence motion.

“The federal government must acknowledge that if we want a recovery, we need to make sure women can get back to work and that means assuring that there’s affordable and accessible child care,” Singh told a news conference Friday in Victoria, B.C.

He noted the Liberals have been promising to bring in universal child care for more than 20 years.

“Now we want to see action. It’s not enough to say the words. We need to see Prime Minister Trudeau and the Liberal government back it up.”

The Liberals, with 156 seats, are 14 votes shy of a majority in the House of Commons. Support from the NDP’s 24 MPs would ensure the government’s survival should the Bloc, Conservatives, Greens and Independent MPs join forces to bring it down.

Singh did not frame his call for child-care funding Friday as a condition for NDP support.

In a written statement later to The Canadian Press, he said: “This isn’t about us or our support. This is about the government earning the confidence of people across this country.

“They do that by keeping their promises, by working with us to fix (employment insurance) permanently so people get the help they need, and by standing by their support of our call for an immediate investment in child care so parents can go back to work knowing their kids are safe at school or at child care.”

Among the NDP’s priorities is ensuring that employment insurance is expanded sufficiently to ensure no jobless Canadian is left in the cold once the last eligibility period for the $2,000-per-month Canada Emergency Response Benefit ends on Sept. 26. The government has promised a “seamless transition” back to employment insurance that leaves no one behind but has yet to reveal its plan for doing that.

A recent analysis from the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives shows that of the 4.7 million Canadians receiving the CERB as of Aug. 2, 2.9 million would get less benefits or nothing at all under the existing employment insurance system.

Moreover, it said women account for 57 per cent of the CERB recipients who are at risk of being ineligible for employment insurance.

It’s not clear that the Conservatives, who have been the most vociferous critics of the Liberal government, would back a Bloc motion of non-confidence.

But New Democrats are relishing the possibility that they’ll be able to drive the agenda this fall as the Liberals’ only significant dance partner.

Back in 2005, the NDP forced Paul Martin’s minority Liberal government to boost social spending by $4.6 billion over two years in return for supporting that year’s budget.

The company already accepts credit cards. But having the tap function for both debit and credit cards is new. Passengers will also be able to use Apple Pay and Google Pay on smartphones, B.C. Ferries spokesperson Tessa Humphries said.

New PIN pads are being installed throughout B.C. Ferries operations this spring, with smaller terminals first to get the new technology.

“The larger terminals will happen towards the end of the month but by the end of March, we do expect to have debit ability at all the terminals,” Humphries said.

“We are aware and recognize that it [debit payment] is something that customers have been asking for quite some time and so we are excited that we can improve that experience and offer more payment options.”

B.C. Ferries anticipates ticketing will take less time for customers using the tap option, which has a $100 limit.

Credit cards — Visa, MasterCard and American Express — are already accepted for fares. Credit and debit cards can also be used on board the vessels.

B.C. Ferries starting offered a debit option on ferries in fall 2018.

Using debit for fares has not previously been available to passengers on major routes although it has been offered for northern routes which require reservations, Humphries said.

But with the busy southern routes, a debit option without a tap would have added a couple of seconds per transaction. On a long weekend or during the popular summer season, those seconds could add up to delays at terminals, she said.

“So we wanted to make sure that we did this right and that we allowed for pin pads that had the tap and pay capability before we rolled it out fleetwide,” Humphries said.

B.C. Ferries did tests that found between 75% and 80% of transactions fall under the $100 limit, she said.

The cost of adopting the new PIN pads is not being released, she said.

Debit is also an option now at certain smaller terminals and at self-service ticketing kiosks for foot passengers.

Smaller terminals already accepting debit for fare purchase are at Mill Bay, Brentwood Bay, Port Hardy, McLoughlin Bay (Bella Bella), Prince Rupert and Skidegate.

Self-service kiosks for walk-ons are at Tsawwassen, Swartz Bay, Horseshoe Bay, Departure Bay, Duke Point and Campbell River.

B.C. Ferries carries more than 22 million passengers and eight million vehicles annually. It has 37 vessels in its fleet, using 47 terminals.

Kabir Joshi, an organizer with the two groups, said the demonstration was just one of a continuing series of community-organized events to prevent property management companies from evicting vulnerable tenants.

“This conversation has been happening for six months,” Mr. Joshi said, pointing out calls from housing activists to freeze rent payments going as far back as March.

“People who are just holding on by the skin of their teeth to continue existing in this city … this pandemic was gonna push them out.”

The Ministry of the Attorney General of Ontario did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Last month, Queen’s Park passed Bill 184 – the Protecting Tenants and Strengthening Community Housing Act – which received widespread condemnation from housing-rights activists who say the law gave landlords excessive power to evict tenants.

Under the new law, landlords can offer a direct repayment plan to tenants who are behind on rent without going through the Landlord and Tenant Board.

The province has said the bill actually helps tenants, but critics and legal analysts have warned that the law would permit landlords to use a tenant’s refusal to sign onto a repayment plan as justification to evict.

At the end of July, Toronto city council voted 22-2 to mount a legal challenge against the bill, citing concerns over the potential for vulnerable tenants to be coerced into a high-interest repayment plan or face eviction and potentially homelessness.

Paterson Hodgson, a tenant at Westlodge Towers in Parkdale and housing-rights organizer, is not confident elected officials will make much of a difference in the battle against pandemic evictions.

“There’s always opportunity for politicians to support their constituents, but in my relatively short life, I haven’t seen them do a lot,” she said.

“Community organizing, regional-based organizing is showing results that we don’t get from politicians. We don’t have to wait for them to step up, we can do it ourselves.”

Although she hasn’t been served a notice of eviction yet, Ms. Hodgson said she is currently behind on rent, and has repeatedly been asked to sign an unreasonable repayment plan by her landlord.

Ms. Hodgson, a work-from-home illustrator, said it has been difficult getting in contact with everyone in her building because of physical distancing restrictions owing to COVID-19, but she believes dozens of her neighbours are in a similar situation.

The five Nuu-Chah-Nulth First Nations are upset that Ottawa decided to give a surplus allocation of salmon — which arose this year due to reduced recreational fishing during the COVID-19 pandemic — to commercial fishers rather than to the First Nations.

Clifford Atleo, lead negotiator for one of the nations who is also called Wickaninnish, says he feels sports and commercial troll fishers are given more rights to fish in the waters off the west coast of Vancouver Island.

He says the latest decision to shut First Nations fishers out of an opportunity to catch more chinook salmon this year shows systemic racism is ""alive and well"" within the federal fisheries department.

""We feel very strongly we're not being dealt with fairly, we know we're not being dealt with fairly,"" Atleo said.

""It's just another layer of disappointment on the part of how the government deals with us. The government doesn't realize that their attitude toward our people is dyed-in-the-wool ... And I think the government — sometimes they don't realize they're being racist. They've got age-old policies that have never changed.""

A 2018 B.C. Supreme Court ruling directed Ottawa to take a more ""generous approach"" to allocations of chinook salmon to the First Nations given the importance of this species to the Nuu-Chah-Nulth people.

The ruling from B.C. Supreme Court Justice Mary Humphries noted that the government's salmon allocation policy at the time gave recreational fisherman priority to fish for chinook and soho salmon ahead of the First Nations and advised the fisheries minister to reassess this policy.

Despite this ruling and changes that have since placed the First Nations at a higher priority than sport fishers, the Ahousaht, Hesquiaht, Tla-o-qui-aht, Ehattesaht and Mowachaht/Muchalaht nations say their yearly fishing allocations have not increased.

This year, the five First Nations were told they could fish 7,724 chinook, which amounts to just 1.5 fish per person for the 5,000 members of their communities.

COVID-19 brought a new dynamic to the salmon allocations this year, as fewer sport fishers were able to come due to pandemic restrictions. This means the recreational fleet is expected to catch 15,000 less salmon than was forecasted for this year, according to figures provided by the department.

None of this surplus is going to the First Nations.

""As per approved management plans, the Area G (commercial) harvest is adjusted based on the projected recreational harvests which results in an increase of 15,000 for 2020,"" said department spokesperson Athina Vazeos.

Fisheries Minister Bernadette Jordan was unavailable for an interview, but her spokeswoman, Jennifer Kuss, noted the improvements made in giving the five nations a higher priority in the yearly salmon catch allocations, as directed by the courts.

""This change ensures that food, social, and ceremonial (fishing) continues to be prioritized first, and additionally prioritizes the Five Nations rights-based sale fishery over the recreational and commercial fishery,"" Kuss said in a statement.

The Nuu-Chah-Nulth First Nations argue Ottawa could have provided some of the unused catch from this year to their people to help them support their remote communities. But Atleo said fisheries officials would not even engage in discussions about it.

""The government is trying to say they consult with us, they negotiate with us. They create their fishing plans, put it on the table and it's like take or leave it,"" Atleo said.

""All we want to do is be part of the economy, part of looking after ourselves without depending on government. We don't think that's a lot to ask.""

NDP MP Gord Johns, whose riding takes in the West Coast fishing shores, said he finds it ""disgusting"" the Trudeau government has repeatedly highlighted its desire to restore the Crown's relationship with Indigenous Peoples but has still fought many legal battles with these nations over their fishing rights.

""Indigenous people in our communities rely on this fishery for their economy, for their food security, for their culture. It's part of their way of life. These are salt water people and they rely on the salmon and to be denied their right is shameful, it's disgusting that the government is taking this approach.""

The First Nations are calling on Ottawa to revisit its decision on the surplus salmon for this year to allow them a portion of the additional catch.

""The government has an opportunity to fix this with these (surplus salmon) to come with a fair opportunity to exercise their commitment, in the judge's words, for a generous allocation to the nations and to start moving forward with reconciliation,"" Johns said.

The minister's spokeswoman says Jordan takes any allegations of systemic racism ""very seriously"" and that Ottawa is working with the five nations on a reconciliation agreement on fisheries resources, which is intended to broaden their access in the area, Kuss said.

""The road to reconciliation is a long journey, and Canada is committed to moving forward together. The department has spoken with the five nations on the reallocation of (salmon catch) on multiple occasions and that open dialogue will continue.""

The asylum seeker from Ivory Coast works as a security guard in hospitals and long-term care homes in the Montreal area, where he watched many of his colleagues stop coming in as deaths linked to COVID-19 began to mount this spring.

But while Nguessan Bi kept working, he said he found out Friday that he would be excluded from a new government program to fast-track the permanent residency applications of some asylum seekers working on the front lines during the pandemic.

""Why (not) us? We who gave our hearts and our love... Why are we abandoned?"" he said in an interview at a protest camp across the street from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Montreal riding office Saturday. ""What did we do to deserve this?""

Ottawa announced Friday that asylum seekers working in specific jobs in the health-care sector would be eligible for permanent residency without first having to wait for their asylum claims to be accepted, as is typically the process.

Immigration Minister Marco Mendicino said the move came in response to public demand for so-called ""Guardian Angels"" — many in Quebec — to be recognized for their work.

""They demonstrated a uniquely Canadian quality in that they were looking out for others and so that is why is today is so special,"" Mendicino said in an interview Friday afternoon.

But asylum seekers and their supporters say Ottawa's plan excludes thousands of workers without permanent status in Canada who have laboured on the front lines during the pandemic, often at great personal risk to themselves and their families.

That includes security guards and janitorial staff, factory workers, and farm labourers, among others.

""I have friends who worked with me in security that abandoned (their posts) because they were afraid of getting infected. But I stayed,"" said Nguessan Bi.

He said he wants Trudeau and Quebec Premier Francois Legault to do something to help asylum seekers who are not eligible for the new program.

Several dozen people rallied in front of Trudeau's office on Saturday to demand permanent residency for all asylum seekers.

""It's an act of recognition. They deserve status,"" Joseph Clormeus, a member of Debout pour la dignite, a Montreal advocacy group that organized the rally, told the crowd.

Anite Presume, a Haitian asylum seeker who came to Quebec in August 2017 from the United States, was among the protesters.

She works in a medication factory, and said she kept working during the pandemic despite the risks.

""To take the bus, we were all stressed, but we still went to work because it was essential. They needed medication for the hospitals,"" she said in an interview.

She said she has not received a response yet to her application for asylum in Canada, and lives under a cloud of uncertainty and stress about her future.

""It's a feeling of rejection,"" Presume said, about not being included in Ottawa's regularization program. ""They rejected us as if we did nothing.""

To apply for residency under the new program, applicants must have claimed asylum in Canada prior to March 13 and have spent no less than 120 hours working as an orderly, nurse or another designated occupation between the date of their claim and Aug. 14.

They must also demonstrate they have six months of experience in the profession before they can receive permanent residency and have until the end of August 2021 to meet that requirement.

The program was the result of negotiations between the federal government and Quebec, who have had a strained relationship on the question of immigration, and in particular the asylum claimants, in recent years.

Public support has been building for asylum seekers' demand for permanent residency after it was revealed that refugee claimants were among those toiling in Quebec's long-term care facilities, which were hard-hit by COVID-19.

The promise of new arrivals comes as Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, warned Friday that a fall surge of COVID-19 cases could overwhelm the health-care system, including its supply of critical care beds and ventilators.

article continues below

""What we know based on what we learned from other countries and cities that had a devastating impact in that initial wave, if you exceeded that capacity the mortality goes up really, really high,"" she said.

Flu season and other respiratory infections common in the fall could put added pressure on the system if COVID-19 flares up in a big way.

Tam said there were many lessons learned from the spring, when the government was ill-prepared and without enough protective equipment for health-care workers, and feared a massive surge of COVID-19 would overwhelm the health-care system.

""We are much better prepared than we were before,"" she said.

In March, Canadians watched in horror as northern Italy's COVID-19 outbreak overran its health-care system, leaving doctors to choose which patients got a ventilator and which were left without one. That experience, coupled with warnings it could happen here too, compelled federal and provincial governments to order thousands of new ventilators.

But much like surgical face masks and N95 respirators, Canada didn't already produce many ventilators domestically, and getting them from international sources is tough when global need for new ventilators is in the hundreds of thousands. So Canada asked firms here if they could step up, and out of that four new consortiums to build ventilators were formed.

A fifth contract was signed with Thornhill Medical, a Toronto firm that at that point was making about 50 of its portable breathing machines a month.

In all, Canada ordered 40,328 ventilators, for an estimated $1.1 billion, and as of Friday, it had just 606 in hand.

Paul-Emile Cloutier, the president of national health-care advocate HealthCareCAN, said there is concern about the status of the government's orders for personal protective equipment and ventilators ahead of the possibility COVID-19 will surge again in Canada this fall.

""Details are crucial as we prepare for the expected next wave of COVID-19,"" he said.

Procurement Minister Anita Anand said Friday the government is pushing on to get the entirety of the orders in place. A statement from her department said ""Canada currently has sufficient ventilators to meet current demands"" and that the ones on order are to bolster existing Public Health Agency of Canada stockpiles, as well as the units already in hospitals and provincial warehouses across the country.

But Health Canada won't say how many ventilators the country now has in total. It will also not disclose any modelling for how many could be needed in a worst-case scenario situation. In March there were about 5,000 ventilators nationally, and another 500 in the national emergency stockpile.

Canada's ability to plank the COVID-19 curve in the spring meant warnings about running out of ventilators never came to fruition.

John Walmsley, the executive vice president at Starfish Medical in Victoria, said that took the pressure off his new coalition, Canadian Emergency Ventilators, Inc.

""We have a little bit more elbow room to do things in a bit of a controlled manner but I would say we're looking to get it done this year,"" he said.

""We're all concerned about a second wave and being ready for that and so we're on board to deliver for that.""

Canadian Emergency Ventilators is still waiting for Health Canada approval before it can start shipping its promised 7,500 machines. It submitted the documents in June and it is taking a bit longer than expected to get the green light.

Once that happens, the Public Health Agency of Canada would have to test the product, and then the units that have already been built could be shipped, said Walmsley. He is still hopeful to fill the order by the end of the year.

Thornhill Medical CEO Lesley Gouldie said her company's partnership with Linamar, a manufacturer based in Guelph, Ont., has been a great success. Thornhill is to provide 1,020 machines to Canada, and has shipped 27 so far.

Gouldie said Linamar can make as many as 100 of the units a week, but getting the supplies for the 1,500 parts that make up their portable device proved to be difficult in a pandemic.

""The limiting factor is the supply chains,"" Gouldie said.

She said the kinks are mostly worked out now, and she expects to ship enough machines each week to fulfil their contract by early December.

Rick Jamieson, the CEO of FTI Professional Grade, said they expect to fulfil their entire contract for 10,000 ventilators by Dec. 12. FTI is one of several companies in a consortium called Ventilators for Canadians, which has already delivered 132 ventilators. Another 120 are on track for delivery next week and 240 in the last week of August.

""We have activated a fourth shift to increase production knowing that a second wave is likely this fall and winter,"" said Jamieson.

Montreal's CAE received Health Canada approval for its new ventilator on June 17, and said that day it expected to begin shipping ""hundreds each week."" It has a contract to deliver 10,000.

The final company, Vexos, was the last to sign a contract, and had to submit its product to Health Canada as well, and began shipping in late July.

The federal government announced Friday that Canada and the U.S. agreed to keep the border closed for another month. Despite increased pressure from families like McCall's and others, Ottawa has yet to loosen the limits on who is allowed to enter the country.

Immigration Minister Marco Mendicino said in an interview he knows that many people are in heartbreaking situations and he sympathizes with them.

He said he is reflecting on whether more exemptions need to be made as the government seeks to meet its twin objectives of commitment to family reunification and protecting public health.

""The measures that we've put in place at the border are helping to reduce the spread of the virus and that is saving lives,"" he said.

""We have to balance both of these important objectives and commitments and we will do that.""

McCall had been trying for months to get his adult children up from the U.S. to care for their ailing mother Donna.

Urgent requests to the Immigration Department for some kind of exemption to the existing rules went unanswered.

So, the McCalls decided to do what they said, in retrospect, they should have done many years ago — apply for Canadian citizenship for the kids.

Donna was Canadian, John is American, though his family has roots in the area they now call home.

While immigration officials did eventually put a rush on Canadian citizenship papers for the two children, the documents didn't make it time: Donna died last Monday.

John McCall said he knows his isn't the only case where border restrictions are keeping families apart in life-or-death situations.

""My only goal now is to say, please don't let this happen to anyone else,"" he said, dissolving into tears.

Their son Ian, 33, said that before COVID-19, his family had gone back and forth across the border with ease, and while they'd talked about getting their citizenship, it just didn't seem urgent.

He said he's not angry the restrictions are in place, but wishes officers had shown more leniency while there was still time.

Saying goodbye to your mother over video chat isn't something anyone should have to go through, he said.

""There are no words to describe how hard it is,"" he said.

When the border initially closed back in March, there were very limited exceptions to who was allowed in, beyond Canadian citizens and permanent residents.

Those restrictions were eased in June to allow for some relatives to enter, a move Mendicino pointed to in the interview as proof of the government's commitment to family reunification.

Adult children of citizens, like the McCalls, were not on the list. Mendicino did not explain why when asked on Friday.

Others caught in limbo include people whose common-law relationships don't meet the definition of those that is set out in immigration law.

Many affected people have banded together into an advocacy group that held a press conference on Parliament Hill last Wednesday demanding change.

They've also tabled a petition in the House of Commons with over 5,300 signatures.

""We ask that a timetable and plan be developed to safely reunite our families, said David Poon, a Regina doctor whose partner is stuck in Ireland.

""The NHL was allowed a quarantine plan to keep themselves and their families safe — where is the one for Canadian families?""

COVID-19 restrictions have severely limited weddings and office work since March, hitting the clothing retail and rental sectors particularly hard.

The three Island stores — including Nanaimo’s Brook’s Landing Mall and Westshore Town Centre in Langford — were shut down in March and reopened with reduced staff in late June.

Lawrence Larsen, manager of the Uptown store, said the three Island locations will continue to operate.

At least two stores — both in Surrey — have not reopened.

Larsen said the Uptown location is operating without 40 per cent of its usual staff.

He said sales since reopening have been “consistent, but overall the business is really down” from previous years.

Dinesh Lathi, chief executive of Tailored Brands, said in a statement to clients over the weekend the pandemic has altered the way people live and work.

“It means fewer in-person meetings, wedding celebrations and special events. Simply put, people are staying home more, and our clothes are better suited to being out and about,” Lathi said.

He said the company is “making major shifts” by creating a leaner structure to adapt to the realities of today’s retail environment.

“In July, we announced some store closures. However, we will continue to have stores across Canada operating as usual. Nothing about our decision to seek Chapter 11 protection changes that.”

Meanwhile, Lord & Taylor, the oldest retailer in the U.S., also said it was seeking bankruptcy protection over the weekend, lengthening the list of major retail chains that have faltered during the pandemic.

Household names, many longtime anchors in malls, were already struggling to keep up with consumers moving to online sales.

Lord & Taylor, which began as a Manhattan dry goods store in 1824, was sold to the French rental clothing company Le Tote Inc. last year. Both filed for bankruptcy protection, separately, on Sunday.

Lord & Taylor says it’s looking for a buyer.

Tailored Brands was struggling even before the pandemic lockdowns smothered any demand for suits or ties.

It wasn’t alone.

Last month, Brooks Brothers, the 200-year-old company that dressed nearly every U.S. president, filed for bankruptcy protection. Its rival, Barneys New York, is being dismantled after filing for bankruptcy last year.

Dozens of retailers, big and small, have filed for U.S. Chapter 11 protection this year. The pace through the first half of 2020 far exceeds the number of retail bankruptcies for all of last year. About two dozen U.S.-based chains have sought bankruptcy protection since the pandemic started.

Others include J. Crew, J.C. Penney, Neiman Marcus, Stage Stores, and Ascena Retail Group, which owns Lane Bryant in addition to Ann Taylor.

Meanwhile, cash problems prevent WorkSafeBC from assisting employers with COVID-19 personal protective equipment (PPE).

BC NDP cabinet members won’t discuss the issue but the Liberal opposition is livid.

WorkSafeBC put out a request for proposals (RFP) August 4 seeking 250 stress balls; 3,000 pens, 50 microfleece hoodies; 50 soft-shell jackets; 1,000 tote bags; 500 embossed, leather-bound journals; 250 ball caps; 250 tumblers, 1,000 lanyards; 250 power bank chargers; 500 reflective safety flashers and 250 stainless steel water bottles.

Items were to be branded for WorkSafeBC – which has adopted the slogans, ‘We’re doing our part’ or ‘I’m doing my part’ in its COVID-19 messaging.

The request was published on the BCBid site for government contracts this week.

The workplace safety regulator is in charge of setting and enforcing the rules for reopening businesses closed by the pandemic.

However, WorkSafeBC can’t afford to help businesses buy protective equipment because it has lost much of its $2.9 billion surplus in the recent stock market collapse, it was revealed in May.

That meant WorkSafeBC didn’t have a surplus to give employers partial refunds for masks, gloves, Plexiglas shields and other safety gear, NDP Labour Minister Harry Bains said at the time.

Bains’ office referred questions about the swag RFP to the regulator. Requests to Premier John Horgan were unanswered.

“It’s pretty bizarre,” Liberal opposition labour critic John Martin said. “It’s odd.”

He said thousands of businesses are struggling with increased operating costs and revenue, they need all the help they can get right now to keep their doors open.

“[Bains] really needs to explain this spending for swag,” the Chilliwack MLA said.

WorkSafeBC director of government and media relations Craig Fitzsimmons said current contracts for branded, promotional merchandise expire Jan. 31.

“We are seeking proposals through an open, fair, and transparent competitive bidding process,” he said.

He said the merchandise has two main purposes – for purchase by staff or for WorkSafeBC booths at health and safety conferences.

“The budgets for branded merchandise are set within WorkSafeBC departments, depending on their needs,” Fitzsimmons said.

He said the quantities listed in the RFP are estimates only to allow interested suppliers to propose pricing.

“The eventual contracts will be a standing agreement and purchases will be made on an as needed basis,” her said. “This means that if there isn’t a need for the branded merchandise, we won’t be buying any.”

Fitzsimmons stressed WorkSafeBC is aware many businesses are struggling during the pandemic.

“That’s why WorkSafeBC has allowed employers who pay their premiums quarterly to defer payments for six months,” Fitzsimmons said. “WorkSafeBC also announced in late May that it was waiving premiums on wages paid to furloughed workers of employers receiving the Canadian Emergency Wage Subsidy.”

He said that change was retroactive to the March 15, 2020, start date of the subsidy and will continue for the duration of the program.

Martin said he understands having promotional merchandise available but said the timing couldn’t be worse.

“Put it on ice,” Martin said.

The agency’s priority right now should be worker safety, he said, noting the Liberals have proposed subsidizing PPE up to 30% of premiums.

On the WorkSafeBC finance side, Fitzsimmons said, “WorkSafeBC continues to exceed its target funding level, despite the volatility from the COVID-19 pandemic, with current funding estimates in the 145-150% range.”

“At this point, WorkSafeBC does not have a reliable estimate of expected investment income, premium revenues or claims costs for the year,” he added. “As such, we will not know the final impact of COVID-19 on our financial position for some time.”

The federal fiscal snapshot in July projects a pandemic-induced deficit of $343-billion in 2020-21 and a debt-to-GDP ratio jumping to 49 per cent from 30 per cent. Don’t forget provincial debt, too. An Ontarian’s combined government debt-to-GDP ratio will push toward 100 per cent of GDP and beyond.

Such a high debt burden is an ailment that will become threatening when the economy returns to normal operations and interest rates rise. Just as we have done with the COVID-19 pandemic, we should address this ailment head-on. Fortunately, there is an evidence-based treatment plan.

Story continues below advertisement

The least painful treatment is to rely on economic growth to reduce our debt burden. However, it is risky to rely on growth alone when interest rates will eventually rise. Our second option is to control future spending once our economy returns to more normal conditions.

However, with an aging population, an unrelenting growth in health care spending and major climate change challenges, containing spending growth will be challenging.

Our third and most painful treatment is for governments to find more revenue.

If Canada has to raise additional taxes, we should be mindful of how exactly we do so. Not all taxes are created equal, and some taxes have a significantly more negative impact on our economy than other taxes. Relying on taxes that are a drag on growth creates a vicious cycle and further impairs our ability to manage our debt burden. More painful remedies would be required, such as squeezing, spending and then having to raise taxes further anyway.

So, what are the most – and least – harmful taxes from an economic perspective?

Personal and corporate income taxes are generally very inefficient ways of raising tax revenues. Although often attractive politically, further increases to personal and corporate income tax rates should be avoided, since that would worsen work and investment disincentives. Moreover, recent research suggests that reducing high marginal personal and corporate income tax rates in Canada could actually result in higher personal and corporate income tax revenues.

Some politicians market high progressive income tax rates as a tool to reduce income inequality in Canada. At best, this only addresses a symptom of income inequality, not the underlying root causes, such as access to education and health care and an open and flexible labour market. As an alternative, gradually increasing the tax rate on income from capital and capital gains could be used to address inequality in income and wealth.

Story continues below advertisement

Recently, we have heard calls for introducing a wealth tax in Canada to raise revenue and reign in income inequality. Many countries – notably in Europe – have tried to introduce a wealth tax and have largely abandoned it. Their experience has been that wealth taxes do not raise significant revenue, are difficult and expensive to administer and ultimately harm economic growth.

Consumption taxes, such as the goods and services tax or harmonized sales tax, are better choices for raising additional revenue while limiting the negative effect on economic activity. We recognize this is a populist flash point, but appropriately designed, consumption taxes can be progressive. Therefore, increasing consumption taxes should be the main source for raising additional tax revenues.

Taxing the digital economy is another option. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s efforts to create an international digital taxation framework are on life support, so Canada should examine how to tax the digital economy itself.

Following Quebec’s lead to subject e-commerce businesses located outside the province to its consumption tax is a start. It can generate significant revenue and level the playing field with conventional businesses.

Finally, governments worldwide are making significant efforts to ensure the economic recovery is a “green economic recovery.” Further increases to carbon taxes would make a positive contribution and can provide more revenue for managing our debt.

We have listened to our public-health experts in dealing with the medical aspects of COVID-19. We should now draw on economic and fiscal expertise in ensuring our economic recovery from COVID-19 is successful and robust.

Fisheries and Oceans Canada has estimated returning sockeye would hit a record low this year, with about 283,000 fish or fewer making it from the ocean to their Fraser River spawning grounds.

Just last month, the department estimated 941,000 sockeye would return, though it noted salmon forecasts were highly uncertain, in part because of a lack of understanding of the effects of warming ocean waters.

The council, made up of the B.C. Assembly of First Nations, the First Nations Summit and Union of B.C. Indian chiefs, says Indigenous communities that rely on the salmon for food face the greatest impacts, but the department has consistently prioritized commercial fishing.

Representatives with the Department of Fisheries and Oceans were not immediately available for comment.

First Nations fishing rights are protected by the Constitution and the council says the federal government has failed in its duty to ensure they have priority access to salmon.

Robert Phillips with the First Nations Summit says Indigenous leaders have been calling on Ottawa to save the salmon for decades and it's time for full jurisdiction over salmon stocks to be transferred back to First Nations.

Five Nuu-Chah-Nulth First Nations on Vancouver Island have also accused federal fisheries officials of systemic racism after the government decided to exclude them in the allocation of 15,000 extra salmon this year — a surplus that arose because fewer people were fishing recreationally during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Salmon returning to the Fraser River also face the added hurdle of making it over a massive landslide along a remote stretch of the river north of Lillooet.

A pneumatic pump and tube system and the construction of a fish ladder have been installed to help salmon over the five-metre waterfall created by the slide.

In an update last week, Fisheries and Oceans said water levels have dropped sufficiently in recent days to allow fish to pass over the slide on their own steam.

A Department of Fisheries document from 2017 says total adult returns of Fraser River sockeye are highly variable ranging from 2 to 28 million, with an average of 9.6 million, between 1980 and 2014.

BC Hydro had wanted to build Site C for decades. It had already built two big dams on the Peace River, completed in 1968 and 1980. BC Hydro’s DNA is dams, and it hadn’t built a new one since 1984. By 2010, the BC Liberal government of the day had become gung ho for Site C, the most expensive build in the province’s history.

The bill at the time was about $6-billion. Then it was $7.9-billion. By the time the Liberals approved it in late 2014, after they had exempted it from an independent review, the bill was $8.8-billion. Once construction got under way, then Liberal premier Christy Clark vowed, in her own words, to push the project to the point of no return.

Story continues below advertisement

The NDP had long opposed Site C and, when the party gained power in 2017, it ordered a review by the B.C. Utilities Commission – which is what should have been done years earlier. About $2-billion had been spent by then.

The review found that BC Hydro’s forecast of future demand was “excessively optimistic,” and said “increasingly viable alternative energy” such as wind and geothermal could provide similar benefits. But the commission did not issue a firm yes or no, although it noted that another $2-billion would have to be spent if the project was halted for good.

Former NDP premier Mike Harcourt at the time said Site C was a “clear, unmitigated disaster.” Still, at the end of 2017, NDP Premier John Horgan decided to go ahead – as the budget spiked to $10.7-billion – believing the project was too advanced to stop.

It was the classic sunk-cost fallacy, colloquially described as throwing good money after bad.

Cost pressures kept on bubbling, a constant upward push. The official news landed in late July: BC Hydro admitted it is in big trouble. The project is at risk, starting with the budget and schedule. There are significant issues with worker safety, the environment, litigation and relations with Indigenous people, who are opposed to the project. There are also daunting geotechnical problems, and the COVID-19 pandemic hasn’t helped, either.

With $5.1-billion spent as of the end of March, Site C was already $400-million over its 2017 budget. BC Hydro is working to “re-baseline” the numbers. An overhauled budget is expected later this fall. No prizes will be awarded for predicting several billion will be added to the tally.

This sort of saga is all too typical when it comes to large hydro projects. Newfoundland and Labrador’s Muskrat Falls is a nightmare that has brought the province to the financial brink. This will not be the case in B.C. – its fiscal position is arguably the strongest among all the provinces – but the exact same mistakes were made. Political leaders and a Crown corporation built on hydro dams wanted a glamorous new project. The promoters overstated the benefits. They underestimated the risks. They ignored the alternatives. And, worst, they skirted a real review.

Story continues below advertisement

This series of errors is standard around the world. Research from Oxford University, published nine months before Ms. Clark approved Site C in 2014, concluded “large dams in a vast majority of cases are not economically viable.”

At this point, what’s needed is a true accounting of what Site C will cost British Columbians. When the number lands this fall, the NDP government will have to reckon with the situation. Shutting the project down would be extreme – and extremely expensive. It is probably beyond the point of no return. That should, however, not be taken as a given. The sunk-cost fallacy still looms – throwing many more billions at what’s turning into a cash bonfire.

Site C is supposed to deliver electricity that could power a half-million homes for many decades. Dams have supplied years of low-cost energy to B.C. But they are an antiquated and destructive technology – Site C will flood 55 square kilometres of land – at a time when the cost of wind, solar and other renewable energy have plummeted.

One could argue that Mr. Horgan made the wrong call in 2017. One could definitely say Ms. Clark and her BC Liberals were reckless when they approved Site C in 2014. But those decisions are in the past. The only thing to do now is take a clear-eyed look at the present. Once a new, robust budget is in hand, all options must be on the table.

""You've got buyers who care more about just getting product than they do about the price,"" he said in an interview.

""The companies have purchase orders sitting on the desk and it's, like, when you get product, send it to us, and just tell us what we owe you. Buyers don't care. Right now, it's an absolute panic, a scramble to get product.""

The run-up over the past several weeks has demolished the previous North American record high of US$650 set in mid-2018, he said, adding prices for other building products are rising just as quickly.

Homebuilders say increases this year to date will translate into $8,000 to $10,000 more to build a typical single-family house in Canada.

Jayman Built Homes will have to consider passing on its higher costs to customers when lumber supply contracts expire at the end of August, said president and chief operating officer Dave Desormeaux.

""Most builders, I believe, would just pass it on and increase the price of a home for the cost of the materials,"" he said, adding his firm, which plans to build about 700 homes this year in Edmonton and Calgary, has the capacity to absorb short-term commodity fluctuations.

""Right now we're not affected but, come Sept. 1, when we're building houses, it's going to be a huge increase for us because we've eaten it (higher prices) along the way.""

But Bobby Richardson, whose Woodlands Mountain Homes builds five or so custom homes per year in Bow River Valley communities west of Calgary, says he has no choice but to pass his higher costs on to current customers.

The rise in demand comes from increased interest in renovations by people working from home during the pandemic, said Mason, along with a strong housing market in Canada and the U.S. fuelled by people's renewed appreciation of having their own homes and aided by extremely low interest rates.

Supply, meanwhile, has fallen as several mills in British Columbia were closed over the past year due to a shortage of wood fibre after a mountain pine beetle infestation and recent wildfires. Those mills aren't likely to reopen soon, he said.

Many North American mills curtailed production temporarily earlier this year because of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns.

Lumber production was about 1.6 billion board feet lower in April and May compared to the same months in 2019, said analyst Paul Quinn of RBC Dominion Securities in a report. That's equivalent to removing about 4.5 per cent of total 2019 production in North America.

""We expect that actual demand was higher than production in both April and May due to strong R&R (renovation) demand, which resulted in distributors drawing down inventory levels,"" he said, adding the tight market could persist even though most curtailed mills have returned to production by the end of June.

""With new residential construction returning with a vengeance in June-July, we expect that even normal supplies would be wholly inadequate to meet demand.""

Canadian lumber production declined by 18.9 per cent in May, he said, with B.C. production down 26.2 per cent year-over-year to 677 million board feet. In the U.S., production fell by 6.8 per cent.

In a research report, CIBC analysts point out that current lumber prices are just two per cent less than the all-time peak in November 1996 when the price for two-by-fours hit US$480 (or US$775 in today's dollars after adjusting for inflation).

Canadian lumber producers coming off better-than-expected second quarter financial reports are making gains on the commodity price rally as investors flock to snap up their shares.

On Friday, West Fraser Timber Co. Ltd., Interfor Corp. and Canfor Corp. all rose to new 52-week high stock prices on the Toronto Stock Exchange.

Colliers noted that the “thin levels of transactions” in the second quarter totalled $200 million with the sale of 12 properties across the country. This compares with 36 sales and a total dollar volume of $666 million in the second quarter of 2019.

Four of the transactions were hotels in Vancouver and Victoria, bought by B.C. Housing to temporarily shelter homeless people. The province paid a total of $107 million.

B.C. Housing was also responsible for the single largest deal this year, with its purchase of the 110-room Howard Johnson hotel on Granville Street for $55 million, a price that pencils to about $500,000 per room.

At the start of the third quarter, B.C. Housing also purchased the American Hotel on Main Street, Vancouver, for $17.9 million.

For the first half of this year, hotel sales volumes in Canada totalled $500 million, down from $830 million in the first six months of 2019.

The hotel industry is suffering from pandemic-related travel restrictions that has seen international overnight visitors plunge 92 per cent in the second quarter compared to a year earlier.

All conferences booked into hotels have been cancelled or gone online since the pandemic began.

Nationally, the revenue per available room in Canadian hotels, a key industry metric, is down 54.9 per cent this year compared to 2019, Colliers reports.

Hotel occupancy fell to a record low of 12 per cent in April before recovering to an average of 28.9 per cent in early July, still about half of the rate a year earlier.

In 2019, 16.75 million

non-residents crossed into Canada by car from the U.S., representing 67 per cent of total travel to Canada by US citizens.

For the month of April 2020, just 46,596 non-residents crossed into Canada by automobile, down 97 per cent from the 1.1 million visitors during the same period last year, according to Statistics Canada.

The Canada-U.S. border has been closed to all but essential travel since March 31.

The closure currently remains in effect until Aug. 21, but it could be extended.",425,0.9700895309083268,business

It’s the concept of self-insurance — providing a means for condo residents to manage their own insurance coverage.

They now rely on insurance companies who last year started jacking rates up by a shocking degree and raised deductibles even more, in the face of losses in that market.

article continues below

Many strata councils have to share some of the blame. The losses stem mostly from constant water-damage claims, 11,000 in the peak year of 2018.

Many of them arise from lax strata boards adopting a habit of relying on insurance rather than maintaining properties properly.

The NDP government has introduced legislation in response to the skyrocketing premium and deductible increases. But the measures simply won’t make much difference to thousands of residents who this year are paying several times more than they did last year, for far less coverage.

The bill was introduced simply because the government had to do something. The crisis is so acute — and the effects are going to be so pervasive — that some kind of action had to be started. So officials put together a few marginal changes to buy some time until there’s a better idea.

There’s already a potential one at hand that needs a close look. A handful of readers suggested self-insurance to me during earlier coverage of this crisis in March.

Now an MLA is endorsing the concept.

Liberal critic Mike de Jong explored self-insurance as an option in the legislature last week and talked himself into supporting it.

Now all he has to do is talk the government into the same position. That will be an uphill struggle. NDP ministers don’t normally look to Liberals for good ideas. They shunned legislation the Opposition proposed to deal with the condo crisis.

But the problem is so serious, they might have to broaden their horizons. And the COVID-19 emergency has overtaken some of the old battle lines, which might change the dynamics.

Recalling the origins of the credit union movement after the Second World War — when farmers couldn’t get loans from banks they essentially started their own — de Jong said: “ They took matters into their own hands.”

He said the idea of pooling resources and looking after each other has merit on the condo scene.

Particularly because B.C. is the only place in Canada that provides the legal framework needed for such a scheme.

Entities created to insure certain limited pools are called “captive insurance companies.” There about 20 of them in B.C., the only such designated ones in Canada. Most are obscure firms that provide coverage to a very small class of clients.

It would be a big change and take a huge amount of work to create such an arrangement. It would also likely need transitional funding from government to get started.

De Jong said: “I believe it’s possible. I don’t think it’s possible on the fly. I think it requires a commitment from the government.”

Condo residents now are facing a situation where de Jong characterized insurance companies’ attitude as: “Take it or leave it. We don’t like the risk profile. Those are our rates. Too bad for you if they’re going to increase 70 per cent, 200 per cent, 300 per cent or 400 per cent.”

He said in a self-insurance scheme strata boards would be “pretty guarded” about the damage claims it accepts and more motivated to keep maintenance up to date because payouts would be made out of residents’ own pockets, rather than some overseas insurance company.

“This is something that I believe is worth pursuing. What we have now is not acceptable.”

The NDP bill currently being debated would allow strata boards to dip into contingency funds to pay premiums and toughens requirements for maintenance reporting. It generally requires more disclosure by strata councils and imposes more clarity.

It doesn’t tackle runaway premium hikes.

The closest model to what de Jong outlined is the Municipal Insurance Association of B.C., which covers all local governments.

It was developed after a similar insurance crisis in the 1980s and has offered dependable rates for years, even returning dividends to members.

A condo self-insurance plan would be many times bigger and more complicated than that. But there aren’t any better ideas around at present.

Deputy chief economist Brian Yu says despite values plunging to levels not seen since the early 1980s, home prices have stayed firm because fewer properties were available for sale.

He predicts median prices could rebound to about $710,000 before slipping to around $540,000 late this year or early in 2021.

Yu says unemployment, business and health concerns will further weaken the market, while population growth, which has traditionally propped up the sector in B.C., will slow to a trickle next year, dampening sales.

He says a second wave of COVID-19 has the potential to shave home prices by 15 per cent as more owners already hit by the pandemic's first wave are forced to sell during a second downturn.

The report released Tuesday notes positive developments as B.C. enters the third phase of its recovery plan including restarts in the accommodation, spa, film and television industries.

Vacancy rates could also climb as high as three per cent over the next year, writes Yu, ""providing an opportune time for renters to negotiate rental rates before the market tightens up again.""

Tim Walz's administration said Tuesday it will appeal the latest approvals by state utility regulators for Enbridge Energy's plan to replace its old and corroding Line 3 crude oil pipeline across northern Minnesota.

The state Commerce Department faced a Wednesday deadline to ask the Minnesota Court of Appeals to take another look at the project. Environmental and tribal groups opposed to the pipeline have already filed their appeals.

Walz said in a statement that the state must follow ""the process, the law, and the science"" for any project that impacts Minnesota's environment and economy.

""The Department of Commerce's appeal is a part of that process, and it is important to ensure clarity in the steps that Minnesota takes to evaluate and approve projects like this one,"" Walz said.

House Republican Leader Kurt Daudt of Crown said Walz was ""wasting taxpayer resources in an attempt to stop this project.""

""Instead of helping the one in four Minnesotans unemployed along the Line 3 route, the Governor has once again chosen to obstruct and delay this critical project and the thousands of jobs it would bring to Northern Minnesota,"" Daudt said.

Calgary, Alberta-based Enbridge says its planned $2.6 billion investment will put 4,200 people to work in union construction jobs while boosting tax revenues for the state and communities along the route.

The company called the Walz administration's decision disappointing. The project has undergone six years of review, more than 70 public meetings and a 13,500-page Environmental Impact Statement, the company said.

But Enbridge said it remains confident that the courts will uphold Minnesota regulators' approvals and that it will continue to pursue the remaining permits with a goal of starting construction as soon as they are received.

Supporters and opponents of the project had stepped up pressure on the state government in recent days. Opponents rallied outside the Capitol and the official Governor's Residence on Tuesday to urge him to keep up the fight, while supporters brought petitions and replica pipes to the Capitol last Thursday to urge no more delays or appeals.

Enbridge says replacing the aging pipeline, which was built in the 1960s, is the safest option for maintaining the oil supply to Midwest refineries.

Opponents have long argued that the Canadian tar sands oil that the replacement pipeline would carry would aggravate climate change, and that spills could endanger sensitive waters and wetlands in the Mississippi River headwaters region where Native Americans harvest wild rice and claim treaty rights.

The Public Utilities Commission reaffirmed its support for the project in February. The commission originally approved the environmental review and issued a certificate of need and route permit in 2018. But the Minnesota Court of Appeals sent the review back to the PUC for further study on the potential risks of an oil spill in the Lake Superior watershed. The Commerce Department then conducted additional modeling and concluded in the final review that there was little chance of a spill reaching the lake.

However, the department joined with other opponents in petitioning the commission to reconsider anyway. They argued that new evidence had emerged in the meantime, including a drop in oil demand due to the coronavirus pandemic. Commerce specifically argued that Enbridge had failed to conduct a legally adequate long-range demand forecast. But the commission rejected those arguments and voted 4-1 to reaffirm its support for the project.

The Commerce Department said in a statement it would appeal because Enbridge did not introduce a long-term demand forecast that the PUC could evaluate, and because the commission had shifted the burden of proof from Enbridge to the department and others to show that demand for oil transmitted by Line 3 would decrease during the forecast period.

Line 3 starts in Alberta and clips a corner of North Dakota before crossing northern Minnesota en route to Enbridge’s terminal in Superior, Wisconsin. Replacement sections in Canada and Wisconsin are already in service.

The project has been politically sensitive for the Democratic governor’s administration at a time when Republicans who control the Minnesota Senate have been flexing their political muscles. Republicans generally back the project while Democrats have been split.

Commerce Commissioner Steve Kelley is expected to face questions about Line 3 at a Senate confirmation hearing Friday.

Those reliable cash cows — booze and gambling — are still delivering, but to a lesser degree. And the new member of the herd — legal cannabis — is just hitting its stride.

With governments facing decades of deficits, they’ll be nurturing those profit centres while simultaneously leaning on sin taxes for years to come, and probably inventing more.

The new pop tax on sweet carbonated drinks ($30 million a year) was delayed until the end of September, but it’s a taste of things to come.

The bar and restaurant closures in the spring made for a big drop in liquor revenue to the government. But that was offset by a spike in retail purchases, which has now levelled off.

The continuing shutdown of casinos is costing government more than $20 million a week and has since they were closed in mid-March. But cannabis sales are holding steady month by month.

With far more stores open this year compared to last, B.C.’s cannabis revenue will more than double compared to the inaugural year.

That’s likely the only revenue stream in the entire government that will be higher this year than last, although it’s only because of the slow roll-out of the legal cannabis market in the first year.

A recent overview in the legislature showed the Liquor Distribution Branch held to its original budget plan in the first quarter, but it’s unlikely to continue. Even though bars and restaurants have resumed, service is curtailed and patronage is down.

Last month the government started selling liquor to restaurants at the wholesale price, eliminating a markup. That saves operators up to 25 per cent of the cost and will last until next spring. It will cost the government about $28 million over the period in lost revenue. Attorney General David Eby said the LDB is currently projecting a $1.1 billion profit, down slightly from it’s pre-pandemic estimate.

“But there are a number of trends that could play out differently,” he said. Retail sales won’t like make up for hospitality sector reductions for the rest of this year, he said. It all depends on infection rates and any public health closures that may arise.

On the cannabis side, there’s nothing but growth potential. With 19 government stores now open and more than 250 private ones up and running, the money is flowing in. Business leaders are already eyeing the new sector as one that can help rescue the economy. The provincial chamber of commerce recently urged government to drop the red tape and open it further to create more jobs.

Eby said cannabis is forecast to bring $350 million in revenue this year. Last year’s sales were $135 million, he said.

“That is money that is not going to organized crime. Also, that $350 million in product was grown by licensed producers that do not bypass hydro utilities, cause house fires and other public health issues with remediating grow-ops in residential areas.”

There are still widespread reports of illicit sales in First Nations’ jurisdictions where the required permits and authorizations aren’t in place. Public Safety Minister Mike Farnworth confirmed it is illegal, but was vague about what’s being done about that, saying it’s a “complicated complex” issue.

The estimate is that more than half the marijuana consumed in B.C. is now sold legally. Farnworth considers that a win, but opposition critics warned the black market is still booming.

The picture in the gambling sector isn’t nearly as rosy. B.C. Lottery Corp. was targeting almost $1.4 billion in net revenue this year, but will fall well short. The casinos were closed March 13 and Eby said it’s up to Dr. Bonnie Henry when they re-open. In normal times they produce $23 million a week in revenue.

BCLC and casino operators have submitted safe reopening plans but Eby said if they do re-open they won’t likely meet previous revenues. The government has committed to maintaining the community grants that flow from that revenue at the same level as last year, $140 million.

The same guarantee doesn’t apply to the bigger sums that flow into the treasury for general use.

The company reported on Tuesday that second-quarter revenue fell to US$9.8 million on production of 4,200 barrels of oil per day from US$41.8 million and 9,700 bpd in the first quarter.

It said it had closed the oilfield from May 7 to July 15 due to the global oil price collapse and government measures to prevent spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.

According to its website, PetroTal is the second-largest crude oil producer in Peru, with 2019 exit production of 13,300 barrels per day and a target to reach 20,000 bpd this year. It is domiciled in Calgary but lists its Houston office as its head office.

Companies in the news:

Suncor Energy Inc. — Shares in Suncor Energy fell Monday after it reported it will be early September before bitumen production resumes at its base oilsands mining operation in Fort McMurray, Alta., following a fire on Friday. The Calgary-based company's stock fell by as much as 37 cents or 1.6 per cent to $22.20 on Monday after it released an update on operations in the wake of the blaze in the extraction area of the mine. Suncor said its two upgraders at the oilsands project are working at minimum rates to process strip-mined bitumen inventory, as well as production piped in from its other operations that use steam to produce bitumen from shallow wells.

Paramount Resources Ltd. (TSX:POU). Up 13 cents, or 4.19 per cent, to $3.23. Oil and gas company Paramount Resources Ltd. is demanding a cash payout for its shares in Strath Resources Ltd. when it is merged with another private firm. Calgary-based Paramount says neither the amalgamation nor the process followed were in the best interests of Strath and its shareholders and it is exercising its ""right of dissent"" under the Alberta Business Corporations Act to be bought out for fair value. It didn't specify a price. In 2018, Strath bought Paramount's oil and gas producing assets in the Kakwa region of northwestern Alberta for $340 million, with half paid in cash and the rest by 85 million common shares at $2 each. The deal gave Paramount 15.6 per cent ownership of Strath and a seat on its board of directors.

Ivanhoe Mines Ltd. (TSX:IVN). Down a penny, or 0.19 per cent, to $5.14. Canadian miner Ivanhoe Mines Ltd. says a worker was killed Sunday at its Kamoa-Kakula Copper Project in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Ivanhoe says the fatality occurred underground while a contractor's employee was moving a drilling rig at the Kakula north workings. It says the senior management team is working with government authorities on an investigation of the accident. The Kamoa-Kakula project is a joint venture in which Ivanhoe Mines and Zijin Mining Group each hold 39.6 per cent and the DRC government owns 20 per cent.

Anne Tennier, who heads the occupational health centre, says organizations are looking for information and guidance.

The ultimate goal of the course, dubbed ""Pandemic Planning: Reopening for Business"" and available at the centre's website, is to minimize the spread of infection while getting Canadians back to work.

The outbreak forced thousands of businesses to close their doors and implement work-from-home policies, but many are starting to contemplate how to return to the workplace while maintaining public health protocols.

Unifor, which represents about 20,000 Canadian workers between the three companies, said the recent COVID-19 pandemic has stoked uncertainty about future job security as economies struggle.

article continues below

""This round of talks is especially unique and challenging,"" said the union, on its website outlining the auto talks. ""This year's contract talks will pivot on good jobs and future investment.""

Ford also said that ""global economic uncertainties"" have stressed the importance of maintaining jobs in Canada.

""We'll be asking our employees to work with us to help shape this new reality together,"" said spokeswoman Rose Pao in a statement.

The negotiations will focus on collective agreements that expire Sept. 21. The union said that it will identify on Sept. 8 its ""strike target"" — the manufacturer it will target first to set a pattern for the other agreements.

Unifor national president Jerry Dias says he will be on the lookout for any attempts by the manufacturers to use COVID-19 as an ""excuse."" He says other than improving wage increases, he expects major battlegrounds will be a new product investment from Ford in Oakville, putting a stop to outsourcing Ford parts depots, and restoring the third shift in Fiat Chrysler's Windsor and Brampton facilities. Dias is also eyeing the 2023 expiration of major programs in GM's powertrain operation in St. Catharines.

While recent trade policy changes, when enacted, will improve the state of play, Dias says the government needs to do more to attract electric vehicle investments to Canada.

""This is an industry that pays a lot of taxes,"" says Dias. ""And it's a lot of jobs. So everybody's going to have to start to row together in the right direction.""

Ian Lee, associate professor of management at Sprott School of Business at Carleton University, says the economic pressure on the auto industry has created an uphill battle for unions.

""GM, Ford, FCA, I think they're increasingly in the driver's seat,"" says Lee.

""Unifor, in these upcoming negotiations, they're in the fight of their life. I think that there is not going to be so much on wages. I think it's going to be, 'Can we save the plants that are left?'""

The new round of negotiations come as the industry is still dealing with fallout from the novel coronavirus. For example, FCA plants in Canada were down from March 18 to May 4, and GM plants were closed between March 16 and May 25, after which they gradually reopened.

Like previous recessions, auto sales also sputtered during the early months of the COVID-19 outbreak. DesRosiers Automotive Consultants Inc. said that auto sales plunged 48 per cent year-over-year in March, but by July, sales had fallen just 4.9 per cent, the smallest decrease since the pandemic began.

Nonetheless, DesRosiers predicted that annual sales rates will remain flat for one to two years.

The new negotiations will be set against the background of the new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which went into force July 1.

The deal included a provision that a significant percentage of the value of a car be produced by workers earning the equivalent of at least US$16 per hour, something the Canadian government said could improve Canadian automotive manufacturing's competitiveness compared to that of Mexico.

While some trade policy changes, when enacted, will improve the state of play, Dias says the government needs to do more to attract electric vehicle investments to Canada.

""This is an industry that pays a lot of taxes,"" says Dias. ""And it's a lot of jobs. So everybody's going to have to start to row together in the right direction.""

Between 1999 and 2017, Canada dropped to the No. 10 auto manufacturing country in the world, down from No. 4 in 1999, Unifor previously estimated.

""Mexico is building smaller cars, in a threat to Canada. But I've argued that the biggest threat to Canada is not Mexico. It's the southern United States,"" says Lee.

""In the American South, it's not only wages that are lower ... taxes are lower, state taxes are lower, land costs are lower, cost of living is lower.""

In 2016, GM was targeted by the union, which cited the company's financial surplus and asked for new allocations for vehicles and powertrain and better incentives for new hires and retirees.

The agreements, which can be hundreds of pages in length, ended up converting 700 jobs at GM and securing a $713-million investment and 500 jobs from Ford, among other issues.

Last year marked the culmination of downsizing at a GM plant in Oshawa, Ont. The plant east of Toronto now has about 300 workers, down from about 2,600.

""There's going to be a great temptation for the three companies: When they close down these particular cars as a segment, they will not replace them. If you don't replace them, you close up a plant,"" says Lee.

GM, in a motion last week, alleged that Fiat Chrysler used foreign bank accounts to bribe union officials so they would stick GM with higher labour costs.

But in a response, the Italian-American automaker fired back, calling GM’s claims ""defamatory and baseless.""

GM alleged in its motion that FCA spent millions on bribes by stashing the money in foreign accounts. The assertion that there is new evidence came as GM asked a federal judge to reconsider his July dismissal of a federal racketeering lawsuit against Fiat Chrysler.

In trying to revive the lawsuit, GM alleged that bribes were paid to two former United Auto Workers presidents, as well as a former union vice-president and at least one former GM employee.

In its response, Fiat Chrysler said the judge should deny GM's motion. GM, FCA said, has to know that the prospect of getting the judge to overturn the dismissal is slim to none. ""So this motion is apparently a vehicle to make more defamatory and baseless accusations about a competitor that is winning in the marketplace.""

FCA denied allegations by GM that FCA paid two ""moles"" to infiltrate GM and send inside information. The company also denied that foreign bank accounts were involved. ""That GM has extended its attacks to individual FCA officers and employees, making wild allegations against them without a shred of factual support, is despicable,"" FCA lawyers wrote.

GM's claims are based on the alleged existence of foreign bank accounts, which are legal, Fiat Chrysler wrote. ""There is not one well-pled allegation in the proposed amended complaint (by GM) that these foreign bank accounts were used to pay bribes or facilitate any other illegal conduct,"" FCA's response said.

GM contends that bribes were paid to former United Auto Workers Presidents Dennis Williams and Ron Gettelfinger, as well as Vice-President Joe Ashton. It also alleges money was paid to GM employees including Al Iacobelli, a former FCA labour negotiator who was hired and later released by GM.

GM alleges that payments were made so the officials would saddle GM with more than $1 billion in additional labour costs.

Gettelfinger, whose name had not come up previously in a wide-ranging federal probe of UAW corruption, vehemently denied the allegations in a statement and said he had no foreign accounts. Williams’ California home was raided by federal agents but he has not been charged. Iacobelli, who is awaiting sentencing in the probe, also denied the claims.

In July, U.S. District Judge Paul Borman in Detroit tossed out GM’s lawsuit that alleged that Fiat Chrysler paid off union leaders to get better contract terms than GM.

He wrote that GM’s alleged injuries were not caused by FCA violating federal racketeering laws, and that the people harmed by the bribery scheme were Fiat Chrysler workers.

GM’s motion contended that payments were made to accounts in places like Switzerland, Luxembourg, Italy, Singapore and the Cayman Islands. The accounts were set up to avoid detection in the federal criminal probe, according to the motion. The accounts were discovered recently by private investigators working on GM’s behalf, according to court records.",538,0.9889782438069757,business

The rich — who have largely been able to cocoon themselves from the wrath of the global pandemic — continue to extract the services, and even lives, of the poor for their comfort.

That grotesque distance between the haves and have-nots lies naked and exposed by COVID-19 around the world.

Toronto’s own public health data offers irrefutable numerical evidence of a common story of affluent travellers unintentionally bringing COVID-19 in and being able to benefit — unintentionally, instantly — from a lockdown, leaving poorer bodies, racialized bodies, residing in smaller homes, in underserviced neighbourhoods, ripe for the picking by the virus.

Many of them work jobs deemed “essential.” So essential that without them, society falls apart at the seams. These are jobs that are appreciated with a minimum wage. That topsy-turvy prioritizing — touted as a trickle-down economy that rewards the rich first — is the driver of systemic oppressions.

Unintentionality is the secret of the invisibility of the system, which requires simply that people with privilege do what they’ve always done, to not think, not critique, not disrupt the status quo.

If the oppressed in rich countries have suffered, those in poorer nations have suffered exponentially more.

It’s clear we are all connected; when immigrants lose their precarious jobs in wealthy countries it causes a domino effect downstream. Almost a third of Bangladesh is flooded. But this year, by the time the swollen river waters spilled over in June, people were already low on food; many had stopped working due to the pandemic and relatives abroad who send money home had lost jobs.

Countries around the world are witnessing overlapping disasters.

Mexico, the nation wracked by poverty despite a high gross domestic product, is overwhelmed by hurricanes and storms even while it tracks as the third-highest in the world for COVID-19 fatalities with more than 52,000 deaths.

As awareness of interconnectedness of the issues and of the people rises and sparks action, so does the backlash, bearing down on all those who dissent.

The U.S. repeatedly deployed armed troops to quell widespread and mostly peaceful anti-Black-racism protests that are now in their third month.

In Zimbabwe, where the inflation rate is more than 700 per cent and doctors and nurses from dilapidated hospitals are on strike, the president has clamped down on dissenting voices; his security forces allegedly abducting and torturing opposition party members.

The Philippines sent millions of citizens back into a partial lockdown to give overwhelmed health-care workers a break. But in April its trigger-happy president publicly said he had asked armed forces to “shoot dead” anyone who violated the restrictions. This was just as Manila residents were rallying to demand food aid after millions of workers lost their jobs.

Meanwhile in India, with 1.8 million COVID-19 cases amid the onslaught of a fierce monsoon that has already displaced millions, the country is reeling. That hasn’t forced it to ease its grip on Kashmir, which is now marking a full year since India revoked its partial autonomy, stripped it off statehood, incarcerated even pro-India leaders and imposed a harsh shutdown. COVID-19 gave the government an excuse to impose further lockdowns. This week, it tightened the noose on Kashmir by imposing a two-day curfew in its capital city to clamp down on planned protests.

The Kashmiri lockdown consists of the Indian police and paramilitary forces roaming the streets with assault rifles, laying razor wire across bridges and placing steel barricades across roads.

Already-wretched neighbourhoods are being blighted everywhere.

We bear witness to a failing world, misaligned with loftier principles of egalitarianism it claims to cherish, a world that is not even sustainable.

It seems obvious that we can’t keep building solutions in self-interest at the expense of others. Our streets here, filled with protests, may give the impression that we — the ordinary folks — are rising, are being heard. The rest of the world shows just how easy it is to quell protest. More people need to rise, continuously so, passing the baton from group to group.

Otherwise, darker disparities loom. The politics of capital have always been about the politics of power.

We may be dystopian already but perched on the verge of worse, ceding all control to the obscenely rich. Amazon’s Jeff Bezos made $34 billion US during the pandemic from March to May and Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg made $25 billion.

The handful of other billionaires did pretty well, too, unemployment be damned. As if that is not vulgar enough, Bezos is likely to become the world’s first trillionaire in a few years.

All hail the new kings.

thancock@uvic.caDr. Trevor Hancock is a retired professor and senior scholar at the University of Victoria’s School of Public Health and Social Policy.","Several years ago two American economists, Anne Case and Angus Deaton — the latter a Nobel Prize winner — made a startling observation: The overall death rate among middle-aged American whites had been increasing in recent years. This ran counter to the general trend of decreasing death rates in America in the 20th century and was opposite to the trend for middle-aged African Americans.

As they dug into the data, they found the increase in deaths was almost entirely found among those without a bachelor’s degree and was mostly due to three factors: suicide, drug overdoses and alcoholic liver disease. They labelled these the “deaths of despair,” a label that stuck. Clearly, something was going badly wrong among working-class white Americans.

article continues below

In their new book Deaths of Despair and the Future of Capitalism, they provide an in-depth analysis of these diseases of despair. It is a story, they write, “of lives that have come apart and have lost their structure and significance.” It is a story “of worse jobs with lower wages; of declining marriage; and of declining religion.”

While they recognize there have been changes in values and social norms that have contributed to the breakdown, they focus on the “external forces that have eaten away the foundations that characterized working-class life as it was half a century ago.”

These include declining wages — down 13 per cent betweeen 1979 and 2017, while increasing overall nationally by 85 per cent; low rates of job creation for those without a degree and “worse jobs” — part-time, out-sourced, insecure, with no sense of belonging or pride.

The creation of worse jobs is made possible in part by the low level of unionization in the U.S. The Bureau of Labour Statistics reported 10.3 per cent of wage and salary workers were union members in 2019, down from 20.1 per cent in 1983. For comparison, OECD data for 2018 show rates for the five Nordic countries highlighted below ranged from 92 per cent in Iceland to 49 per cent in Norway; it is 26 per cent in Canada.

Case and Deaton note: “Deterioration in job quality and detachment from the labour force bring miseries over and above the loss of earnings.” For one thing, “men without prospects do not make good marriage partners.” Moreover, they note, communities deteriorate; as wages decline, jobs are lost and businesses close, the revenues needed to provide services such as schools, parks and libraries decline.

Add to that “the loss of meaning, of dignity and of self-respect that come with the loss of marriage and of community,” and you have a recipe for disaster.

Behind all this, I think, run two broad themes: The cult of individualism in the United States that downplays the importance of community and the collective, and neo-liberal economics, rooted in individualism and in a cynical disregard for people, prioritizing profits and the enriching of the wealthy.

Contrast this with the five Nordic countries, which ranked in the top 10 in the World Happiness Report every year since 2013, occupying the top three spots for three of the past four years. America, in comparison, ranked 18th in 2019. A chapter in the 2020 report is devoted to what makes the Nordic countries exceptional.

In essence, it’s a story of coming together, not coming apart. In general, the Nordic countries provide “easy access to relatively generous welfare benefits,” while “the labour market is regulated to avoid employee exploitation.” They also have high-quality governments and public institutions, with, in particular, a high quality of democracy, and as a result governments are trusted.

Other factors include low levels of inequality, a high sense of autonomy and freedom, and high levels of social trust and cohesion. In short, the Nordic countries have found a recipe for success, and it shows in the fact that on average they have four years more healthy life expectancy than the U.S.

America, it seems, has lost touch with the philosophy of one of its founders, Thomas Jefferson, who wrote in 1809 that “the care of human life and happiness and not their destruction is the first and only legitimate object of good government.” Creating despair among the poor while enriching the elites is utterly inconsistent with this view. Time for a rethink.

We obtained the disclosure forms in advance, read the minutes and bylaws closely, and were aware in advance the insurance was increasing by 250% due to the location and type of construction of the building.

article continues below

We just received notice of the Annual General Meeting (AGM) to be held electronically in August, and other than routine business, the annual budget is increasing by 27% to address a deficit from the previous year and the significant increase in insurance.

What we find alarming is that the strata fees for September, if approved, include the increase from May to August as the fiscal year for the strata corporation ends April 30.

We did not find the increase unreasonable, because the fees appear artificially low, the 27% increase for the first four months is due and payable all at once in September adding $486 to a monthly fee of $607.

The back charge for the first four months is being called a retroactive fee. Why do we have to pay for a period of fees when we were not the owners?

Is the retroactive fee enforceable?

— Lillian & Dave M.

There have been several Civil Resolution Tribunal decisions on this issue that originally deemed the status of retroactive fees was unenforceable. However, the B.C. Supreme Court has “disagreed” with the tribunal’s conclusions and upheld the practice in the matter of fiscal year strata fees involving a “commercial strata development.”

The dispute primarily focused on the interpretation of the Strata Property Act and whether a strata corporation who was charging the additional increase of fees for the period of the fiscal year that had already passed, was compliant with the legislation.

In the court’s view, there was nothing in the strata corporation’s approach to strata fees that placed it offside the act. A subsequent “adjustment” to the fees paid in the period between the end of a fiscal year and the passing of the budget for the next fiscal year, is not a retroactive charge.

The tribunal based its determination in large part of the notion that the strata fee information required to be disclosed in a Form B or Form F would be inaccurate if a prospective purchaser of a strata unit obtained those forms (a Form F remains “current” for a period of 60 days after it is issued) prior to the approval of a new budget. The buyer would be led to believe that the seller’s strata fee payment obligation was up to date when in fact it was not.

With the greatest of respect to the tribunal, the judge disagreed. An owner’s strata fee obligation does not arise until it is approved at the AGM. The Form F (and indeed the Form B) will have been accurate when issued. There is no requirement in the Act that strata fees be paid in equal installments.

Plainly, the schedule of strata fee payments can require equal monthly installments, or installments that include adjustments to make up a deficit between what was paid and what would have been paid had the budget for the current fiscal year been in place at the commencement of the current fiscal year.

Fees for one month may be different than for other months. Ultimately, the budget approved for the fiscal year becomes the obligation of the strata corporation to collect that amount through a schedule of fees due monthly as adjusted; however, not every strata corporation collects fees monthly or on the same schedule. Always read the bylaws of a strata corporation, especially resort properties if you are concerned about the payment of strata fee.

Many strata corporations hold their AGM after the fiscal year end as they wait for the completed financial reports to determine budgetary needs for the following year.

The AGM must be held within two months of the fiscal year end, unless there is an emergency order as we are currently under, which extends the period to four months.

If the AGM is held prior to the end of the fiscal year, financial projection statements must be prepared and circulated to the owners in advance of the AGM as well as a completed financial report within eight weeks of the end of the fiscal year. While it is advantageous to convene the AGM as early as possible to execute the next year’s budget, the total amount owing by each strata lot for that fiscal year is the same total whether you approve the budget before the fiscal year end or after.

When the strata corporation issues notice of the meeting, the fee schedule required by the Act showing either an adjustment in the next month or over the balance of the year is included, which by default is ratified by the owners when they approve the annual budget by majority vote.

If we did nothing, hundreds of thousands of Canadians, especially older people, might die and the health care system would be overwhelmed, jeopardizing the health of many other people with other health problems. Flattening the curve will reduce the peak of the epidemic, spreading it out over a longer period of time. This also buys us time to find treatment or a vaccine.

So around the world today and across Canada borders are closed, as are schools, universities, libraries, rec centres, cafés, pubs and many businesses, large and small. Our communities and societies have been brought to a halt, or at least to a dramatic slowdown, and our economies are in a tailspin.

But many might be concerned that the public-health and societal effort to contain COVID-19 comes at a huge cost to society, that it is triggering a global recession, that it might even lead to a depression. Could it even be the case that the social and economic disruption we create will kill or sicken more people than does the disease?

After all, the Great Depression in North America and Europe was a time of great misery and despair. Surely that was bad for health. Surprisingly, it seems that was not the case; in fact, the opposite was true.

A 2009 paper co-authored by a leading American social epidemiologist, Ana Diez Roux at the University of Michigan, examined life and death during the Great Depression.

They found “population health did not decline and indeed improved during the Great Depression of 1930-1933” and that death rates “decreased for almost all ages, and gains of several years in life expectancy were observed for males, females, whites and non-whites — with the latter group being the group that most benefited.”

This is not to say there are no ill-effects of a recession or depression. They note that among the six main causes of death, accounting for about two-thirds of all deaths in the 1930s, “only suicides increased during the Great Depression.” Today, at a time of industrial decay in some parts of the U.S., we have seen an increase in deaths from the “diseases of despair” — alcohol and drug use (especially opioids) and suicide — among lower-middle income middle-age men.

But contrary to our expectations, they note, “years of strong economic growth are associated with either worsening health or with a slowing of secular improvements in health.” Moreover, they added, this “was first noted decades ago, but was largely ignored until recently.”

The reasons for increased deaths during economic expansions, they report, include “increases in smoking and alcohol consumption, reductions in sleep and increases in work stress” as well as increases in “traffic or industrial injuries … [and] atmospheric pollution.”

As I have noted before, there are many businesses and many ways of making a profit that can harm health. Just recently, I reported that a joint WHO-UNICEF-Lancet Commission had identified commercial activities as one of the three greatest threats to children’s health, along with climate change and poverty; all are influenced by this COVID-19 recession.

Environmental scientists have already noted a dramatic reduction in air pollution and carbon emissions in China and Italy, and this will soon become worldwide. Indeed, Stanford University environmental resource economist Marshall Burke suggested in early March that the reduction in air pollution in China might have already saved more lives than the COVID-19 epidemic had cost.

We can already see the reductions in traffic on our local roads, which will not only reduce air pollution and carbon emissions but crashes and injuries.

If this goes on for months, as it might, we will likely see increasing need for government support for laid-off workers, strengthening support for some form of guaranteed income and/or shelter — basic requirements for health — is met. Coupled with that we can expect reduced demand for more “stuff,” as people adjust to lower incomes.

It might be that with this combination of reduced consumption and reduced environmental harm, coupled with societal commitment to ensuring the meeting of basic needs for all, we will find ourselves unintentionally creating the well-being economy we need in the 21st century.

First, dried beans flew off the shelves. Then, public health orders closed thousands of restaurants. Luxury takeout took off. Baking sourdough became a national pastime. Now sidewalk patios are springing up like mushrooms. Nobody knows what’s next for the food industry.

“We’re walking through a dark room with our hands out in front of us, trying to feel everything out until things settle down,” says restaurateur, businessman and Top Chef Canada judge Mark McEwan.

Few in the sector have as broad a perspective as McEwan, whose Toronto-based company, the McEwan Group, includes a catering business, manufacturing, high-end grocery stores and several fine-dining restaurants.

He’s concentrated on building an online shopping platform for groceries and pre-prepared meals, subsidizing half the cost of pickup and delivery in order to build customer loyalty.

“We try to make it memorable,” he says. “We send people a lot of free samples and try to be helpful on the phone.”

That exceptional experience includes stocking the best ingredients. McEwan believes importing high-quality European products has given his stores a leg up during challenging times.

“I think when people have a meal together now, it’s more of a special occasion that demands special ingredients,” he says.

“I carry a lot of European products in the retail stores. I’m very supportive of local ingredients, but I’m also supportive of imported European food because it’s produced to such an exceptional standard. My clients love it. I love it. I’ll never go totally local: It’s about finding a marriage of the two.”

Certain products have been smash hits in isolation. McEwan says his stores can’t import doppio zero flour, made from Italian durum wheat, fast enough. His clients have been exploring canned cuttlefish and anchovies from the Spanish region of Galicia. Belgian chocolate has proven popular as a socially distant snack.

And as consumers have more time to prepare their own meals, he’s been pleased to see more demand for ingredients like French vinegar, German redcurrant jelly, Italian olive oil and Portuguese chorizo that form the base of slow-cooked European classics like pot-au-feu, beef bourguignon, sauerbraten and paella.

“It’s great because when I’m looking for inspiration, I turn to the old cookbooks more than I do modern ones,” McEwan says. “They lean mainly on European products. You can pick up Julia Child and start recreating some French standards. You can do the same for Italy, Germany, Portugal, Spain, Poland. There’s just such a rich history, you don’t have to reinvent the wheel.”

The key appeal of food from the European Union (EU), says McEwan, is the consistency and quality. There’s a high level of government supervision of the food system, and buyers can look for blue and yellow European Union Geographical Indication labels that prove products are made in a certain place and to a certain standard.

“The fact that people are interested in European standards and quality levels is the most exciting trend,” he says. “It’s going to last. It’s a sign that we’ve matured as a society when it comes to food; we don’t get caught up in fads, it’s all about the ingredients and the backstory. That in itself is a European attitude.”

The WE Charity scandal has pretty much killed the federal government’s planned $900-million Canada Student Service Grant (CSSG) program. It’s probably fair to say that, in reference to a classic Monty Python sketch, it’s the dead parrot of summer relief programs.

But while the time for launching a summer program has passed, there is no reason the government could not develop a better one for the fall. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau should ask the Canadian Armed Forces to do what WE cannot.

Story continues below advertisement

First, to avoid some of the mistakes brought to light by the WE fiasco, the government needs to be very clear what it means by “youth.” Part of the reason the CSSG went sideways was because of confusion over this critical point. The initial program announcement said it was for high-school graduates up to the age of 30. But asking WE, a charity that deals almost exclusively with children under 18, to administer the program seemed to signal something else.

People were, rightly, second-guessing the mandate from the start.

Fortunately, the CAF has expertise developing and administering programs for young people older than 18 and for youth under 18.

In the over-18 category, the CAF’s summer Bold Eagle program for Indigenous persons could serve as a model for a new initiative. Bold Eagle participants get all kinds of unique experiences, and can earn $4,200 in cash and academic credits. They have no obligation to stay in the armed forces when the program is over (though they are well-prepared to transfer into a reserve unit should they wish).

The CAF’s Full-time Summer Employment Program is another operation that could be used as a model for creation of an effective short-term youth development program that provides participants the opportunity to serve their communities, gain skills and earn money.

In response to the pandemic, the Prime Minister should immediately ask the CAF to develop a special reservist program for youth who have recently left high school. Such a program could work toward the original CSSG program goal of encouraging participation in national service and providing practical work experience and career development skills.

It could be short term (six or eight months) and, like the existing reserve programs, could allow participants to drop out at any time. The program would not be able to provide the usual sort of training and experiences that a typical reservist would experience in non-pandemic times. But the CAF is full of professionals who live by the motto “improve, adapt and overcome,” and an effective program could no doubt be created if they were asked to step up to the challenge.

Story continues below advertisement

In the under-18 category, if the government really was thinking of a program for youth still in high school, there is still time to address that audience, too.

Again, the CAF could be part of the solution since it already has about 5,000 Cadet Instructor Cadre officers administering the Cadet Program. These CIC instructors are specifically trained to work with youth between 12 and 18 and they come from all walks of life – some are veterans but many are accountants, software developers, teachers, entrepreneurs, musicians, mechanics, doctors, parents and so on.

The Cadet program – once described by Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan as “the best youth leadership program in the country” – already has more than 50,000 Canadian youth participating in it but could be scaled up to include more.

With many parents covering homeschooling duties in addition to their jobs, any program that helped engage youth in positive civic development would undoubtedly be welcomed support. Youth would also be able to earn high-school credits in return for their participation.

It is puzzling that the resources of the CAF were not immediately considered when developing the CSSG, or when thinking of ways to help Canadian youth positively respond to the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In April, Mr. Trudeau used military metaphors to describe the challenge faced by the country. Now perhaps it is time to drop the metaphors and to ask the military what they can do to help. They are, after all, already on the payroll.

“COVID-19 isn’t going away any time soon,” said Minister of Social Development and Poverty Reduction Shane Simpson. “Essential costs are increasing in many cases so this is an opportunity to ease that pressure and we see it continuing so we’ll go through December.”

The seniors supplement for a single person is an unfathomably low $49.30 a month, said B.C. seniors advocate Isobel Mackenzie. With the supplement, it becomes $349.30 a month for the lowest-income seniors living on about $19,000 or less a year. For context, a minimum-wage job would bring in about $26,000 a year.

Mackenzie said the boost is substantial and in her mind hasn’t received the attention it’s due.

“It’s very significant for the group of people receiving this money, it’s a lot of money for very low income people,” Mackenzie said.

For a senior couple the supplement would be $120.50 and $49.83 for a spouse receiving the federal Old Age Security allowance.

“We have to find a way to continue to support these really low income seniors after COVID,” said Mackenzie.

“They were struggling before COVID, and they’re going to struggle after COVID and hopefully this will be a catalyst or a way to address this lowest income group of seniors.”

The temporary $300 crisis supplement is extended four months September through December to low-income seniors receiving the B.C. Seniors Supplement and income assistance and disability recipients residing in special care facilities.

The B.C. Senior’s Supplement tops up the federal government’s Old Age Security and/or the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS).

The B.C. Seniors Supplement is not available to people who are already receiving federal employment insurance or the $2,000 monthly Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB).

No low- or no-income people are still disproportionately affected by this pandemic, said Simpson.

The top up considers that seniors are paying more in prescription dispensing fees, additional travel costs for seniors avoiding public transit due to health concerns, and delivery fees for groceries.

Mackenzie said seniors are also spending more on groceries because they can’t shop around for the best prices as they did prior to the pandemic and seniors who relied on accessing the internet for free at public libraries are now having to order internet services.

Earlier this year, the Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced a $2.5 billion one-time, tax-free top-up payment to help 6.7 million seniors absorb costs related to COVID-19.

For April to June 2020, the maximum combined payment from OAS plus GIS is $1,514.78. The maximum for OAS is $613.53 OAS and the maximum for GIS is $916.38 GIS per month, for a single person.

The federal one-time lump-sum payment saw seniors who receive Old Age Security in Canada receive a $300 payment. Those who receive the guaranteed income supplement for low-income seniors saw an additional $200.

At the beginning of the pandemic, it seemed futile to talk about the history of sharing in Canada. How could the story of federal efforts to create a fairer nation possibly compete with news of health crises and government stumbles?

But then I realized: Now is the perfect time to explain how we came to share after decades of fierce disputes among the richer and poorer provinces and their weary citizens. Without sharing, we would not have national social programs. Without sharing, the federation might have disintegrated. Without sharing, we could not pull each other up or even trust each other and our governments throughout today’s pandemic.

The history of that crucial decision is tangled, crossing time to the pre-Confederation discussions of the 1860s, and crossing oceans to Australia, which hastily cobbled together a model program for sharing among states after disgruntled Western Australians voted to secede in 1933. Today we call our version of that approach by the fusty name of equalization. But the distribution of federal revenues from all taxpayers to the poorer provincial governments since 1957 has been a lifesaver that has enabled all provinces to provide adequate medical and social care through troubled times without exorbitant rates of taxation.

Equalization was not an easy sell to the wealthier provinces when prime minister Louis St. Laurent outlined his prudent approach in the mid-1950s. The federation had somehow survived to that point with a clumsy system of subsidies, which mostly purported to treat each province equally, but never really worked. Federal politicians surreptitiously manipulated the system to funnel more funds to the poorer provinces. The money was never enough. With the Great Depression, even the richer provinces could barely cope with relief payments for the jobless and their families. They wanted their taxpayers’ money for themselves, while the poorer provinces pleaded with Ottawa for any funds to dodge default.

The search for a better way attracted some of the most eccentric and talented Canadians of their generation, who argued, plotted and sometimes drank together. A Royal Commission even devised a convoluted model for sharing that was partly based on the Australian approach. Nothing worked. Politicians could not agree: They were angry with each other. But by the 1950s, impatient Canadians were demanding the good life promised after their sacrifices in the Second World War. They wanted hospital care, improved pensions, better post-secondary schools and, most of all, medicare. But the poorer provinces could not participate in national shared-cost programs without financial help. So St. Laurent created unilateral grants based upon the key tax revenues in two wealthy provinces, raising the poorer governments to the average of the richer ones. (Ottawa now uses fiscal capacity as a determinant.)

Today, equalization grants are the often overlooked ties that really bind Canadians to each other. During the pandemic, Ottawa and the provinces have created massive spending programs that target individual needs. But the existing equalization funding has already strengthened the social fabric, enabling poorer provinces to enhance their medical and social care in hard times.

The principle of sharing permeates our 21st-century federation. Until the pandemic, Alberta Premier Jason Kenney complained about Ottawa’s generosity to the poorer provinces: Alberta does not receive equalization because of its relatively high per-capita fiscal capacity. Now University of Calgary economist Trevor Tombe calculates that “for the first time in 55 years, Alberta will be a net receiver in the federation.” (It will still not receive actual equalization because of its relatively strong economy, however.) Newfoundland and Labrador, which did escape reliance on equalization in this century, is now teetering on the brink of default. But whether through reforms to the equalization program or other transfers, Ottawa will almost certainly have to extend more aid to the floundering province; it has already guaranteed $7.5-billion in debt.

In contrast, the European Union, which is an uneasy monetary union but not a fiscal one, spent four acrimonious days in mid-July to agree upon an unprecedented stimulus package to help member countries to bolster their slumping economies. The recovery package is a mixture of grants and low-interest loans. Even then, the richer northern members were openly distrustful of how the poorer southern members would spend their windfall.

The often-fractious Canadian federation is certainly not without defects – and the now-convoluted equalization program is flawed. But since Ottawa sent out the first equalization cheques in April, 1957, that willingness to share has encouraged social unity and mutual trust. We save ourselves when we save each other.

Canada’s decision to increase its humanitarian aid to Lebanon recognizes the country already faced significant turmoil before last week’s explosion and will need long-term support, International Development Minister Karina Gould said Tuesday.

The Liberal government was criticized last week for promising only an initial $5 million – including $2 million to match donations from Canadians – to help the people of Lebanon struggling to recover from the deadly blast in Beirut.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced an additional $25 million Monday evening, which will go to humanitarian aid agencies and organizations that work in the region.

The funding to match donations has now been expanded to a maximum of $5 million.

Gould said in an interview with The Canadian Press that Ottawa realized more would be needed and requests from international aid organizations would start coming in.

“We just made the decision to increase it knowing that the appeals will be coming out shortly, they will be significant, and we want to ensure that Canada is ready to be able to respond in as timely a manner as possible,” Gould said Tuesday.

The Aug. 4 blast is believed to have been detonated by thousands of tonnes of ammonium nitrate stored for seven years at a portside warehouse. More than 150 people were killed in the explosion, thousands more were injured and an estimated 300,000 residents were left homeless.

Canada’s additional aid was announced just hours after Lebanese Prime Minister Hassan Diab announced the resignation of his government following days of angry protests. He blamed the blast on “the result of endemic corruption.”

Canada has been a long-standing partner in bringing assistance to the people of Lebanon before the explosion, Gould said, including an allocation of $47 million this year alone, made through trusted partners, to address the pre-existing crisis.

“Canada will continue to be there. That’s one of the reasons why we announced the additional $25 million: recognizing that the situation in Lebanon was already significantly challenged before the explosion last Tuesday, and now it’s only going to be even more difficult because of this.”

Story continues below advertisement

The country has been led by a political ruling class, made up mostly of former civil war-era leaders, and it is being blamed for incompetence and mismanagement that contributed to the explosion.

This has sparked protests of anger, which led to clashes between security forces and demonstrators Saturday in central Beirut over the weekend.

Gould said Canada is monitoring the situation on the ground, and is providing consular assistance to Canadians in Beirut, thanks to the reopening of the Canadian embassy in the Lebanese capital on Monday.

She could not provide details about Canadians in Lebanon who may want to come to Canada, citing a lack of clarity about this information at this time.

Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press

Allan Lanthier is a retired partner of an international accounting firm and has been an adviser to both the Department of Finance and Canada Revenue Agency.

The federal government has introduced sweeping changes to the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy. CEWS has been extended to December, 2020, and the requirement that an employer suffer a revenue decline of at least 30 per cent has been repealed.

Starting in July, an employer that has any revenue decline at all is entitled to a subsidy, even if the decline is unrelated to COVID-19. The new rules will be a windfall for many large and profitable Canadian corporations.

Story continues below advertisement

When CEWS was introduced, retroactive to March, 2020, the government decided to subsidize the wages of both active employees and those who were laid off. The same rules applied to both categories: In general terms, if an employer’s revenue declined by at least 30 per cent in any four-week period, it received a 75-per-cent subsidy for all wages paid in that period. The argument was that, in the early stages of the pandemic, subsidies should apply for both furloughed individuals and, to minimize further layoffs, for active employees.

CEWS was extended in late July. The 75-per-cent subsidy rate has been replaced for active employees by lower rates starting in July. But there was little need to continue subsidizing businesses for active employees: The economy is recovering and many employers are saying they can’t find enough workers, not that they have too many and are considering a second wave of layoffs. And with any revenue decline now giving rise to the subsidy, tens of millions of dollars will be given to businesses that don’t need the cash.

One example is Rogers Communications Inc. Rogers has announced that, for its quarter ended June 30, 2020, it had a revenue decline of 17 per cent as compared with 2019. But we won’t be starting a GoFundMe page – Rogers had net income of $279-million for the quarter and paid $252-million of dividends. Nonetheless, the revenue decline should deliver handsome cash subsidies to the company.

For the month of July, 2020, Rogers will compare its revenue with July, 2019, (or with the average revenue for the months of January and February, 2020, if that gives a better result). Rogers has 25,000 active employees, and if it has a 17-per-cent revenue decline in July, it should receive a subsidy of about $25-million for that month.

Or consider Royal Bank of Canada. The bank has more than 70,000 active employees in Canada. For its quarter ended April 30, 2020, the bank reported a revenue decline of 10 per cent. If that decline persists into the month of July, the bank should receive a subsidy of about $40-million – this even though the bank earned $1.5-billion in its most recent quarter and paid dividends of the same amount.

Twenty-five million here, 40 million there, and pretty soon you’re talking about real money. There is no mischief on the part of these companies: Management has a fiduciary responsibility to the company’s stakeholders – shareholders, employees and customers – to claim any amounts that are legally due. It is government policy that is out of whack.

Some smaller businesses may retain a few active employees as a result of the new subsidy. However, the subsidy will not be relevant to employment decisions of large and profitable corporations, and the subsidy for active employees will therefore not protect existing employees to any significant extent.

Story continues below advertisement

There was a much simpler solution: The subsidy should have been eliminated for active employees, with an exception for small business. Small firms are always at greater risk of failing – and terminating employees as a result – than large corporations.

A number of other countries, including Britain, Denmark and Australia, have introduced wage subsidy programs. While the rules vary from country to country, there are few countries that subsidize the wages of active employees.

The new rules provide much needed support for individuals who are still out of work and that is appropriate. But with the economy on the mend, there was no reason to continue doling out cash for employees who are active and working productively in a business.

The government had many weeks to develop rules that provide wage support in a sensible and fiscally responsible way. It failed in that effort.

Scientifically sound, the inflation rate doesn’t square with the lives a lot of us live. Inflation has been a virtual non-issue for decades, but we all have significant, high-visibility costs in our lives that have risen a lot. Home insurance and postsecondary education are two examples.

Get ready for more. The official inflation rate in June was 0.7 per cent, but costs here and there are starting to creep higher. One of the ways this is happening is through what are being referred to as “COVID fees” – extra amounts tacked onto your bill for goods and services to cover costs related to the pandemic.

A restaurant my wife and recently visited in Ottawa says on its menu that a $5-per-guest fee will be added to bills to help cover extra costs from meeting COVID-19 regulations. According to news reports, dental offices and hair and nail salons have been adding similar fees in amounts between $7 and $18 to cover the cost of masks, gowns and other equipment.

Businesses are as much a victim of the pandemic as households. But if the pandemic hit you hard in a financial way, it can seem insensitive or worse when a business asks you for extra money.

A lot of people can afford it, though. Just look at the latest statistics on consumer spending.

TD Economics reported Monday that personal spending increased 5.4 per cent on a year-over-year basis for the first week of August. Remove spending categories that face restrictions because of physical distancing (travel and entertainment, for example), and you have spending growth of 18 per cent. Spending growth was described as healthy in all provinces, notably in Toronto, thanks to the lifting of economic restrictions.

RBC Economics has already said that people spent 3 per cent more in July, the first year-over-year increase since the pandemic began. “While spending in many categories was flat in July, spending on self-care and dining improved,” RBC said.

Like individuals, businesses have received government financial support during the pandemic. But between extra costs incurred to stay open and the burden of physical distancing, some businesses are struggling to survive.

A parliamentary committee was told last week that many businesses in the hospitality industry have lost between 70 per cent and 90 per cent of their revenue as a result of the pandemic. Roughly one out of seven small and medium-sized businesses said they were at least thinking about closing or declaring bankruptcy at the end of June, according to a survey by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business.

At the end of March – let’s hope that was the pandemic’s nadir – I published a list of 27 ways for the financially fortunate to help out in my free e-mail newsletter, Carrick on Money. One reader said it was “the most important article you’ve ever written,” and many others were supportive as well.

COVID fees are another way the financially fortunate can help out. The outdoor patio of that restaurant with the $5-a-person COVID fee was really pleasant. Paying an extra $10 to help ensure this kind of socializing remains on the table, so to speak, seemed fair.

Paying an additional fee to dentists may seem a bit much, but consider that dental practices also employ hygienists, receptionists and others. The COVID fee you pay to have your teeth cleaned helps keep these people safe and employed.

What businesses owe their customers is clear, prominent disclosure of their COVID fees. Customers should see the fee when they walk into a store or restaurant, and have it clearly listed in their bill.

Also, COVID fees have to end at some point. A backlash is coming if they turn into a new version of the fuel surcharges that transportation companies introduced when energy prices were high and then left in place when oil prices fell.

If you can’t afford to pay a COVID fee, say so. There’s no shame in having lost a job or income in a pandemic. But if you’re in the majority who can pay, then accept the fee with grace. Consider it a way for the financially fortunate to support the businesses we rely on and enjoy.

A lawyer for some of the Sandy Hook school shooting victims’ families accused Remington Arms on Tuesday of using its new bankruptcy case to try to wipe out their lawsuit over how the company marketed the rifle used in the massacre.

An attorney for Remington denied the allegation during a phone conference call presided over by a federal bankruptcy court judge in Decatur, Alabama.

Also Tuesday, the judge, Clifton Jessup Jr., denied the families’ request to create a committee – comprised of people who are suing Remington over the use of its products – that would have a say in the bankruptcy proceedings. The judge, however, allowed one lawsuit plaintiff – not the Sandy Hook families – to sit on the main committee of unsecured creditors.

Story continues below advertisement

David Elsberg, a lawyer for the families, said Remington is trying to rush an auction of its holdings, leave the families out of the process and has not included their lawsuit or other lawsuits over its products in the new bankruptcy case it filed late last month. He said the bankruptcy case is so new that many people who may have claims against the company may not even know about the case.

“The families have grave concerns about the speed, the breakneck speed, that the debtors (Remington) are setting up for the sale,” Elsberg said. “There won’t be, there simply can’t be, a full and fair process unless this high-speed train that we’re on slows down.”

Despite the bankruptcy case being filed only last month, Remington – the nation’s oldest gun maker, based in Madison, North Carolina – already is planning to sell off its holdings in a Sept. 17 auction. The company has a plant in Huntsville, Alabama.

It’s the company’s second bankruptcy filing in two years. Remington, weighed down by lawsuits and retail sales restrictions following the Sandy Hook school shooting in 2012, listed assets and liabilities of between $100 million and $500 million, and between 1,000 and 5,000 creditors, in its new case.

A gunman using a Bushmaster AR-15-style rifle made by Remington killed 20 children and six educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, on Dec. 14, 2012.

A survivor and relatives of nine victims of the shooting are suing Remington in Connecticut Superior Court, saying the company should have never sold such a dangerous weapon to the public and alleging it targeted younger, at-risk males in marketing and product placement in violent video games. The lawsuit has been put on hold because of the bankruptcy case. Remington denies the lawsuit’s allegations and says it is immune from being sued under federal law.

Jessup on Tuesday approved a schedule for the Sept. 17 auction that allows the Sandy Hook families and others to object to the sale by Sept. 1. He dismissed the families’ objection to the schedule.

Story continues below advertisement

Nancy Mitchell, a lawyer for Remington, told the judge that Elsberg’s comments about the company trying to rush the process and exclude the families were not true.

A lawyer for the United Mine Workers of America union also expressed concerns Tuesday about retired Remington workers losing their benefits because of the bankruptcy. Jessup allowed a union representative to sit on the unsecured creditors committee, but as an ex-officio member with a voice but no vote.

The judge also gave a spot on the committee to the parents of a Montana teenager who died in 2015 from a gunshot wound from a Remington rifle – giving lawsuit plaintiffs a voice and vote. Sharon and Randall Teague are suing the company, saying their son was carrying the hunting rifle at their Seeley Lake home when it fired accidentally because of a defective design and killed him.

Remington, in court papers, has denied the Teagues’ allegations and questioned whether their son’s death was a suicide.

""This is me. I am 'Pipe Nation,'"" she said with a laugh Monday during an interview with The Canadian Press in Sundre, Alta., a picturesque oil town nestled near the Rocky Mountains.

article continues below

""I've been working in the oil and gas industry for about six years. I took a break when the bust happened and did a little serving, a little bartending but always went back to the oil and gas,"" added Gamble, who is 24.

""My father, my grandfather and my great grandfather were all in the oil and gas industry as well.""

Sundre is set to become the fictional community of Hardwell. The drama will focus on day-to-day hardships labourers face, with Gamble's character as the leader of a pipe gang — workers who position and align the pipe, preparing it for the weld. In real life, Gamble has held a number of jobs in the industry including welding.

But this is her first acting part since middle school.

""I always wanted to become an actor because I always thought pretending to be someone and falling into a character is a lot of fun and being someone else,"" she said.

""Unfortunately that's not the direction I went to until now when I got handed this beautiful opportunity that my little-girl dream could come true.""

Filmmaker and director Raoul Bhatt says he wanted a mix of both professional and amateur actors on set, and he's not concerned about the lack of experience from some of his cast members. He sees it as an asset to the project.

""I needed this to be believable and I needed someone with a certain language, a certain grit, combined with people who have actor experience,"" said Bhatt, adding 480 people showed up for the casting call. ""I wanted someone who's believable, honest, sincere and lives in the moment.""

Bhatt, who grew up in Edmonton, has a soft spot for the energy sector and says the show is meant to spotlight the colourful nature of the individuals.

""They're just beautiful people and to showcase that beyond the Dow Jones, beyond just the oil and gas numbers to human struggle, conditions and overcoming adversity and the determination of these characters is what the show is about,"" he said.

Bhatt, a software engineer who self-funded the pilot, has worked as a cinematographer and producer for the Daytime Emmys, as well as with Universal Studios' ""Jurassic World"" and a number of music videos.

He understands there are plenty of people out there who are not fans of the oil and gas industry.

""We are leaning toward pro but again that's for the viewer to decide. If you're against the oil and gas industry that's your opinion but I really hope this creates an emotional connection with the characters.""

Filming of the pilot will be completed by the end of August. Bhatt said he is in negotiations with a couple of streaming services for a 10-episode season.

A storage lot for oilfield equipment in Sundre is one of the regular sets. In addition, a portion of farmland in Sundre has been cleared for the actual building of a mini pipeline to add to the realism of the show.

Bhatt isn't short on technical advisers. Gin Ford, who plays the character Dee, has been a pipeline welder for the past 10-plus years. She has no acting experience but intends to use the show as a vessel for female empowerment and women in the energy industry.

""I'm not here for fame or recognition. I am actually here to make a voice for women in trades. Here's the moment for me to be a voice,"" said Ford.

""I've been called the pipeline princess and it's like, you can roll onto site and right way it's 'this girl's out here to work?'"" she said.

""I definitely want to highlight you can look like you want and you can still work in a male-dominated industry. It doesn't matter if you've got the nails, the lashes, the hair or the Barbie image.""

Ford said the show is meant to be raw, but it's not reality TV or a documentary.

""I'm not going to lie. My mom's probably going to tell me to wash my mouth out with some soap,"" Ford said, noting her character is tough-talking, confident and keeps up with the guys.

Mike Vickers plays Ryan, an East Coaster who moved to Alberta to make his fortune in the oil industry. Art imitates life for Vickers who moved to Alberta from Cape Breton.

""When I read the script it was my life. I fell in love with this. It's going to really showcase that true oil and gas grit, the struggles we all face and how we overcome it together as a family,"" Vickers said.

""There's so much opportunity to better the image of this industry and it's how we all come together is how we're going to do this and tell this story.""

Filming in Sundre is expected to wrap up by Aug. 24 and will finish in Nisku, south of Edmonton, by the end of the month.

Serving specialty goods from throughout the 27 European Union (EU) state members has become more than a business for the pair; it’s a passion.

Macikova hails from Vranov Nad Topl’ou in Eastern Slovakia, while Forgac is originally from Bratislava, the country’s capital. The pair launched YourOh! Deli in December 2018. (The name is meant to sound like “Euro.”) The 900-square-foot shop quickly became a neighbourhood draw with products from all over Europe – represented on a map that adorns one shop wall.

Operating in a multicultural region like B.C.‘s Lower Mainland, a 45-minute drive from Vancouver, YourOh! Deli has a diverse clientele. Many shoppers have roots in Eastern Europe, including Romania, Croatia, and the Czech Republic. For this reason, the deli stocks a variety of food products that allow customers to connect with their culture, while helping others discover the true taste of Europe for the first time. Think Pawelek chocolate bars from Poland; Erfrischungsstäbchen lemon-orange chocolates from Germany; Burek cheese pies, popular in Croatia and Slovenia; Slovakian Oštiepok smoked sheep cheese; or Hungarian peppers stuffed with sauerkraut.

As was the case for so many businesses, COVID-19 introduced new challenges for YourOh! Deli. Macikova and Forgac initially curtailed their hours, developed an online ordering platform and offered private shopping to ensure their clientele could continue to access the high-quality European goods they treasured during the pandemic’s darkest hours.

What the couple found, however, was that the overwhelming majority of customers still wanted to shop in person, to look at labels and designations and read about the products – despite limitations and lineups presented by physical distancing orders. Currently, up to three people are permitted in the store at a time, and it’s not uncommon to see customers waiting patiently outside for their turn. Macikova and Forgac attribute this to carrying authentic European goods and working hard to continually diversify their EU offerings to ensure variety for their clientele.

“The most important element in solidifying our client base has been adapting to our customers,” Forgac says. “We’re constantly branching out, contacting new suppliers and importers and bakeries and meat producers.”

Luckily, The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), has opened even more opportunities for businesses like YourOh!, making storied European products readily available to Canadian food retailers and consumers alike.

“We have a huge number of customers from Eastern Europe who are extremely passionate about the foods they grew up with,” he says. “So, for them to come in and find items they are familiar with is huge. And for them to know that we will do what we can to seek out and bring in items we don’t have in stock is forging the whole ‘neighbourhood European deli’ mission we set out initially.”

More and more, people want to know where their food comes from. With traditional and authentic European foods, customers should look for EU Geographical Indications. The distinctive red and yellow stamp identifies that the ingredients, production and preparation of a product are all from or took place in a specific geographical area. The blue and yellow stamp is used to identify the products in which a particular quality of production is attributed to its geographic origin. These labels ensure that what customers are buying is authentic and of the highest quality standards.

For Macikova and Forgac, the foods they carry act as a bridge between people and places. By stocking the best of Europe, they aim to help satisfy consumers’ appetites for food that offers a real experience, combined with high safety standards – that feeds their souls as much as their stomachs.

Re Site C Dam Underscores Need For More Time-sensitive Approach To Project Approvals (Aug. 13): Finally, someone has detailed a prime cause of Canada’s failure to develop meaningful infrastructure projects and enhance job opportunities in many areas of the country. Bill C-69 has been repeatedly mentioned as an enemy of development, particularly in the West.

I find it ironic that this legislation has not been changed, even though the Liberal government was willing to assist an engineering firm that does a great deal of work in this area of the economy – one headquartered in Quebec. This seems to be a flagrant example of bias against provinces that are more dependent on natural resource development.

Re Turning Hotels Into Shelters: Proponents Say Idea Gives Homeless People Dignity And A Chance To Get Lives Under Control (Aug. 10): COVID-19 has exposed the gulf between those fortunate enough to have the space to practise physical distancing and those who experience homelessness. This is why the hotel program run by the House of Friendship in Kitchener, Ont., is so important, and similar programs in Toronto have provided a much-needed lifeline.

When coupled with onsite care from registered nurses and nurse practitioners, the unique needs of homeless people can be met, whether they need mental health and addiction services, treatment for chronic conditions such as diabetes, proper foot care or help with other ailments.

Nurses agree with the House of Friendship’s Jessica Bondy that more funding – from all three levels of government – is urgently needed so this model can continue. We should also fast-track supportive and accessible housing to build permanent solutions.

Only then can we ameliorate the suffering of persons experiencing homelessness, by providing them with the dignity of beds, pillows and safe places to sleep.

Re Optometrists Turning Patients Away In Fee Protest (Aug. 12): To the public, it looks like the Ontario Association Of Optometrists have a vision problem with their job action to send patients to emergency rooms. Only those with an impaired vision of society wouldn’t be able to see that taking serious time away from ERs during a pandemic mostly makes their profession look bad.

Although they are seeking better funding for eye care, they seem more to be exploiting a public crisis for personal gain. The OAO should get a new eye chart that forces them to look beyond their myopic self-interest.

Tony D’Andrea Toronto

As an optometrist in Ontario, I’d like to present clarification on our fight for long-term access to patient care.

Our cause is about funding and investment in an essential health care service. It’s been 30 years of almost no increases in funding, plus a pandemic that is limiting our ability to see patients and wiping out our revenues. We’re desperate and are doing our best to protect our patients and ourselves in a dire situation.

Overhead costs for service delivery (that is, staff, rent, leases, utilities, insurance, medical equipment) are approximately $90, while OHIP reimbursement is less than half that for urgent eye care services, which are paid $25 or less. This is unsustainable.

Story continues below advertisement

Our profession has no options for conflict resolution, such as arbitration. Since 1990, we find that the Ontario government has not paid a fair share of service overhead in this sector.

We can’t change the past, but we can protect eye care for the future. This government should do better than its predecessors and collaborate with Ontario’s doctors of optometry for a sustainable eye-care funding model that will help save eye care in the province.

Re Amid Turmoil, Human-rights Museum Appoints New Head (Aug. 11): As the Canadian Museum of Human Rights brings the treatment of its workers into line with its own social mission, and as an institution in the service of society, it should also consider the rights of museum visitors.

Contemporary museum architecture and exhibition design often force visitors into a linear exhibition experience – sometimes referred to as the tyranny of the curatorial storyline. The design of the CMHR encourages this, rather than empowering visitors with, say, serendipitous choice or conscious self-selection of topics and subjects.

For schoolchildren, content selection should align with various sensitivities such as age, class curriculum, cultural backgrounds and learning styles. Such choices would be best made by professional educators rather than curators or tour guides.

Re Dubas On The Hot Seat After Early Playoff Exit (Sports, Aug. 13): Two weeks ago, I had never heard of Columbus goalie Joonas Korpisalo. Since then, he shut out the Leafs twice and broke a three-decade-old record with 85 saves in an NHL playoff game.

Leafs naysayers have already weighed in: Fire general manager Kyle Dubas, fire coach Sheldon Keefe, trade everyone not named Auston Matthews and start over again. Here’s the thing: Hot goaltending in hockey is like hot pitching in baseball. It is what it is.

Sarah Moritz is a Canadian writer based in Beirut.

I moved to Lebanon in March, 2019, to pursue my graduate degree, which means I have experienced the thawra (revolution), economic crisis, COVID-19 and now the explosion, which has torn apart my home of Beirut. Through this I have learned to understand the magnitude of the resilience of the people in Lebanon, and why it is an attribute that has rightfully served as a point of pride. There is a reason why Beirut’s favoured symbol is the Phoenix – something that dies and is reborn, rising in its beautiful splendour again, from its own ashes. This power is made much more astounding, though, when you realize the resilience is a result of a population living under a regime that seems to do everything it can not just to stymie progress, but to prevent comfortable basic existence. The care those in Lebanon have for one another is genuine, but it is also necessary for survival – because it is understood by many that it is better to support and help one another, than to rely on the government for anything.

I witnessed this during the revolution, which is still continuing and has now been fired up by the indescribable fury triggered by the explosion. People take care of one another in person and virtually, organizing and providing everything from medical aid, food and protective gear, to mental-health support. After the explosion, self-initiated mobilization from local businesses and civilian groups, such as Muwatin Lebnene and Rebuild Beirut, involves taking surveys regarding the needs of individuals and families, and providing support in the form of first aid units, relief funding, equipment for anyone who wants to help clean destroyed streets, homes and local businesses, and generally connecting affected individuals with those who can help. This is while the government has not only done nothing to help clean and rebuild or offer services to their people, but has in some cases refused to release the bodies of those who died in the explosion to their families until the fines held by the deceased, such as unpaid traffic tickets, have been paid.

When it comes to postexplosion realities beyond the governments astounding historical and current disregard for their own people, I could talk about the dire situation with regards to poverty prior to the explosion, and how the explosion has exacerbated these realities. I could talk about what the loss of the grain silos and damage to the port, coupled with a government-imposed dependence on imports, means for the rapid growth of food insecurity in the economically devastated country with its hyper-inflated currency. I could talk about the garbage crisis that has been continuing unaddressed for years, which the rubble from the destruction will increase, or about how the general lack of electricity will now only get worse with the destruction of the country’s primary electricity provider. But they are related to an overarching and grave reality. Whether the ammonium nitrate was set off on purpose or not, or by whom, is also not the focus here – it is the fact that not only did the political elite know about the massive quantities being stored, they did nothing to remove it, and have refused to take any responsibility for what happened. All of this can be boiled down to the severity of the corruption, and serves as a reflection of the astounding arrogance that has developed as a result of what the elite clearly see as their invincibility.

This is why I believe a postexplosion Lebanon must include very significant international engagement with the country’s corrupt government and banking systems. Without addressing what has gotten the country to the horrific place it now finds itself in, and without meaningful international help to disassemble the cascading, iron grip of the elite, a future that the people of this country deserves will not be possible. The newly appointed “technocratic” government and its new Prime Minister, Hassan Diab, resigned, but the long-term political heads who have been responsible for, and profiting from, the people’s degrading situation for decades still predictably refuse to budge. Governments everywhere must refuse to engage with the political elite (including bankers) domestically and abroad. They have to insist on the resignation of every Lebanese ambassador and other political representatives in their respective countries. The offshore accounts of the political elite must be frozen immediately. Their assets, such as their luxurious homes, need to be seized, and an independent investigation into the explosion at the port (or, as it is also called, the “Cave of Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves”) needs to be held.

The explosion is not just catastrophic, it was avoidable, and a terrifyingly accurate embodiment of how entrenched corruption is within the government and its clientelist networks that run (or run into the ground) every part of the country. This is not a case of “Middle Eastern exceptionalism” but is a result of a colonial-created system that has been enthusiastically carried by political elite, some of whom are warlords or war entrepreneurs. And the power structure has been left unchecked for decades, not because consociational sectarian systems successfully result in fair and effective long-term governance (studies and history show they don’t), but, perhaps, because the level of human suffering in Lebanon caused by it has not been enough to warrant pressure to change (a system, according to the 1989 Taif Agreement, that was supposed to be temporary).

It took one of the biggest non-nuclear explosions in history for the suffering of the people of Lebanon to get international attention, and, while the people in Lebanon are resilient, they have been making it clear since Aug. 4 that they are beyond exhausted of having to be. Since the explosion, the people have been manually cleaning up the city their own government destroyed, they have been rallying to feed those who need it and they are working to find shelter for the 300,000 who have been left homeless – by themselves. So just imagine what this country would be capable of if the people had a government that did not hold their feet down on the backs of their necks and force them to breathe under water.

It is my possibly idealistic hope that this catastrophic event will finally push the international community to force the elite from their seats and seek justice in courts that will punish them for the true criminals they are. And, as I write this, we wait for the parliamentary meeting on declaring a state of emergency, which, if it happens, will mean further oppression of anyone who speaks out against the corrupt regime. International interference that acts in the best long-term interest of the people is what is necessary to create the opportunity for a positive future the people of Lebanon deserve, and one, 2enshallah, the current generations will be alive to see.

For almost 70 years, Behrends Group in Edmonton built its success by producing and designing cast bronze, aluminum and brass plaques, signage, works of art, memorials and interpretive displays. That changed in March when COVID-19 brought their operations to a grinding halt. Its foundry and manufacturing facility went quiet as orders for products dried up. To remain viable, the small business had to pivot and adapt.

“The pandemic slowed everything down to a crawl,” says company president Gen Russo, who has worked for Behrends for more than 30 years. “Projects were put on hold and there was not much work. Then some of our clients started requesting sneeze guards – something we had never built before.” Fortunately, the business already had the equipment on hand and the capability to make the transition.

Behrends also expanded its printing services to meet the new need for safety and social-distancing protocol signage. Russo says a typical large building needs as many as 500 to 600 signs, thus creating a big demand.

Story continues below advertisement

“As a small business, you have to be able to quickly respond to what’s happening in the marketplace. So, when the pandemic hit, we adapted and created new products using the talent and skills of our great staff,” says Russo. “And because of that, we were able to keep all of our 30 employees working.”

He credits his company’s ability to navigate through the pandemic to having strong relationships with customers, suppliers and advisors, including its insurance partners. “We asked for advice from our network and they came through with the assistance that helped us make good decisions,” Russo says.

Recently, Behrends decided to switch from its insurance provider of 20 years to Foster Park Brokers. Russo liked their high level of service, competitive rates and proactive approach. For example, his insurance broker suggested bringing in experts on risk management, to help Behrends avoid potential disruption of its operations as the business evolved.

Mark Wiens, the president of Foster Park Brokers, sees this kind of client education as part of his company’s role. “It’s unrealistic to expect our clients to understand the nuances in the wordings of insurance policies,” he says. “That’s our job as brokers. The more we understand the operations and risk tolerance of our clients, the better job we can do when it comes to providing them with the right advice.”

Open this photo in gallery Amber Bracken

There is no one-size-fits-all solution and an insurance broker can help a business ensure it has enough coverage as its operations evolve. Wiens adds that ongoing risk assessments can help address potential blind spots like cyber protection, which is becoming increasingly important as many small businesses shift to online sales.

“Business owners often have to make quick decisions which can unintentionally affect their risk. This is happening now, more than ever, as small businesses adapt and pivot their operations due to the pandemic,” he says.

Small businesses that have started manufacturing health-related products because of COVID-19 may also face a variety of new safety and risk exposures – some of which they may overlook. That’s where a broker and insurer can step in, work with the business to identify potential exposures and provide a plan to manage them.

Petra Hoerrmann, an underwriting director representing Northbridge Insurance who insures Behrends, says the three parties working closely together is key, especially in extraordinary times like these.

“It’s a unique time for everyone,” she says. “Many of our small business customers had to quickly evolve their operations and we evolved right along with them. With Behrends, that meant ensuring constant communication, answering questions quickly and sharing information and resources that we felt could help them safely navigate change.”

For Behrends, having the support of trusted partners made it possible for the company to quickly shift its focus to supporting the needs of its customers and community.

As Russo explains, “My insurer continues to help protect our business in uncertain times. That has given us a lot of confidence as we move forward.”

Chrystia Freeland, who was sworn in Tuesday afternoon after Bill Morneau resigned late Monday, will have to manage a COVID-19 recovery that is still very much under way, with more than 40 per cent of the three million workers who lost jobs due to the COVID-19 pandemic still unemployed as of mid-July.

The path forward for jobless Canadians is still taking shape. Fewer than one-third of the 4.7 million people who were receiving the $2,000-per-month Canada Emergency Response Benefit at the beginning of August would qualify for Employment Insurance when CERB ends on Sept. 26, according to the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, though the government has promised to ease EI eligibility rules.

The unemployment rate currently sits at 10.9 per cent, according to Statistics Canada's July labour force survey, which noted almost twice as many people were unemployed than in February.

Meanwhile, the spectre of protectionism continues to loom large after U.S. President Donald Trump reimposed tariffs on Canadian aluminum earlier this month — Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden also harbours protectionist sentiments — further complicating trade relationships.

Key to the task of drafting a budget will be weighing whether to patch up a frayed social safety net or to broaden it with reinforced rope.

""There are huge challenges in terms of how our social safety net has actually been exposed through COVID to be kind of thin and narrow,"" said Sheila Block, a senior economist at the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives.

""Years and years of underinvestment in public services have really come back to bite us.""

Potential changes to employment insurance — thresholds for hours worked, payment amounts and inclusion of self-employed and gig economy workers — fall under the purview of the employment minister, ""but eventually it lands on the finance minister,"" Block said.

Debt presents another dilemma for Freeland. Ottawa has been pumping money into the economy since March, resulting in a projected debt of $343 billion, an increase of more than 1,000 per cent from the previous year.

Much of that spending has gone toward a federal wage subsidy for troubled businesses, which has been extended until at least December. Further extensions and tweaks to the program — it will cost the government an estimated $67.9 billion through the end of the year, according to a report last week by the Parliamentary Budget Office — will rest largely in Freeland's hands.

Fiscal policy is already running ""at full throttle,"" said Bank of Montreal chief economist Douglas Porter, with the 2020-21 federal debt-to-GDP ratio headed about 49 per cent compared to 31 per cent currently.

The longer-term issue is whether the surge in spending linked to the coronavirus will morph into a more permanent trend, with attendant tax and debt implications, he said.

Despite a drastic uptick, the debt-to-GDP ratio remains well below danger zones highlighted by the International Monetary Fund and the highs of the mid-1990s, when it reached two-thirds.

Interest rates are also at historic lows, which means the borrowed cash comes cheap.

Morneau's resignation could portend a doubling down on a ""'fairness' agenda,"" with ""more fiscal activism"" the likely outcome, said Derek Holt, vice-president at Scotiabank Economics.

""The timing works well, as resigning in August gives plenty of time for a material shift in the fiscal stance before the unconfirmed fall budget or update and Throne Speech,"" Holt said in a research note.

The Business Council of Canada on Tuesday urged the government to set clear fiscal targets and rein in spending given a projected net debt in 2020-21 of $1.2 trillion, saying in a letter to Freeland that ""interest rates will rise eventually.""

CEO Goldy Hyder said there is an ""urgent need"" for Ottawa to pivot to an ""economic growth and prosperity agenda,"" with an eye to structural issues ranging from an aging population and climate change to ""regulatory obstacles that go well beyond pipelines.""

Freeland brings to the table a background steeped in financial journalism — she penned the 2012 book ""Plutocrats: The Rise of the New Global Super-Rich and the Fall of Everyone Else"" — and delicate trade negotiations with the U.S. during her nearly two-year stint as foreign affairs minister.

""Her communication skills and prior background as a financial journalist and policy wonk will serve her well in the role as will her global mindset. Freeland could well be the country’s best — if not only — chance at a female prime minister within a reasonable time horizon,"" Holt said.

Some previous finance ministers have landed in the role after prominent business careers, including Morneau and Paul Martin, but others such as Jean Chretien, Jim Flaherty and John Manley took on the title without any executive experience.

""Being a titan of industry in particular in these times is not necessarily the best qualification for a finance minister,"" Block said, citing inequality and the pandemic as the towering economic issues of the day.

""I think there’s a great deal of uncertainty, and that’s something that the finance minister will also have to deal with.""

At 42 years old, it was her first full-term pregnancy after experiencing two preterm births – of which neither child survived.

Kone, who lives in a rural village in the southern region of Mali, says Born on Time’s program, implemented by Save the Children in Mali, was essential to keeping her informed about her reproductive health, supporting her throughout her pregnancy and helping her deliver her son safely.

“Thanks to the assistance of the program, I was more confident knowing that I had support. I am happy that this baby is safe,” Kone says.

With many of us spending less time behind the wheel these days, while also managing household budgets, the CAA MyPace™ auto insurance payment program is a great way to pay-as-you-drive and save. The program gives you the freedom to pay only for the distance you need, and nothing more.

CAA MyPace is a simple way to potentially reduce what you’re paying for insurance without changing your driving habits. Introduced in 2018, CAA MyPace is Canada’s only pay-as-you-drive insurance payment program, and many customers enjoy 40 to 60 per cent savings annually on their auto insurance due to their lower mileage.

How does CAA MyPace work?

Enroll in the program, and pre-pay a base rate to cover your car while it’s parked, plus the cost of insurance for your first 1,000 kilometres. Plug in a simple device that stays in your vehicle and keeps track of your mileage. Drive as you normally would, and coverage in 1,000-kilometre increments is reloaded automatically, notifying you each time.

You can even monitor your usage by downloading the CAA MyPace app to your smartphone or by logging in to the online portal.

Whether you’re driving short distances, or keeping your vehicle parked for prolonged periods of time, if you’re driving less than 9,000 km per year, cost savings should be one of your rewards.

One impact of the COVID-19 crisis is that many people are looking for an alternative way forward, as Guardian columnist George Monbiot noted in his July 25 column reporting on recent U.K. polls.

But as a society or community we are not even talking about what we are facing, except in the rather narrow sense of climate change.

While there is some evidence that we are slowly coming to grips with the reality of climate change, there are large and powerful pockets of resistance everywhere. Largely that resistance is rooted in and propagated by the fossil fuel industry and its ancillary industries, such as the automobile industry. It is then supported by the right-wing ideologues who are in thrall to corporate capitalism in general and the fossil fuel industry in particular.

Even when the situation is understood, there is still a vast gulf between our understanding and our intentions, and then between our intentions and our actions. Governments continue to support the fossil fuel industry, providing a wide range of subsidies.

Globally, this amounted to about $320 billion in 2019, according to the International Energy Agency.

Here in Canada, subsidies totalled at least $600 million in direct support from the federal government in 2019, according to the Winnipeg-based International Institute for Sustainable Development, and a lot more in unquantified tax breaks and incentives and in provincial subsidies.

Clearly, the message on climate change is not getting through. Small wonder we are on track to miss not only the ambitious 1.5 C target for global warming, but the 2 C target of the Paris Accords.

But there is far less understanding that climate change is but one of a number of massive and rapid global Earth system changes that we have created — all of them happening at the same time. On top of climate change, we continue to deplete natural resources such as ocean and freshwater fisheries, forests, fresh water, farmland and topsoils.

We continue to produce vast quantities of solid waste, especially plastics and paper, as well as liquid and gaseous wastes, leading to high levels of air and water pollution.

We continue to produce and widely disperse a vast array of pesticides and other toxic chemicals, many of them persistent, resulting in the contamination of soils and food chains.

Perhaps most seriously, we have triggered a sixth Great Extinction, with plummeting population counts in many species and growing rates of extinctions.

But since we depend on the Earth’s natural systems for the very basis of life and health, we are endangering ourselves as well as myriad other species.

If those natural systems start to collapse, or change rapidly, the social and economic implications are profoundly troubling.

Yet governments everywhere are not truly understanding the situation.

They don’t act as if this were the case, that we face a potential, indeed an actual existential crisis. In fact, we are barely even talking about it, as a community or a society.

We — or at least our governments — continue to pine for business as usual and plan for economic growth; they can’t wait for us to go roaring back — in Justin Trudeau’s unfortunate, but accurate, phrase — to how we were before COVID-19.

The urgent need to have widespread community conversations about what it means to be a region with a markedly reduced ecological footprint is why we recently registered Conversations for a One Planet Region as a non-profit organization in B.C.

The lack of an appropriate set of values is why our fall series will focus on what our guiding values should be and how we shift community and societal values.

I will discuss both our plans for expanding and deepening the understanding of our situation and the discussion of appropriate guiding values next week.

The credit reporting agency said in a quarterly report that credit card balances fell 12.3 per cent in the second quarter compared with the same period a year ago.

Reduced opportunities for spending during the lockdown may have contributed to the drop, said TransUnion's Matt Fabian, but he also noted that people are dipping into savings or retirement funds rather than relying on credit cards.

""Recent feedback from our survey seems like the folks that say they're still experiencing a lot of financial hardship continues to drop. And there's a lot more certainty in terms of the response, in terms of what they're going to do. Consumers have fortified themselves,"" said Fabian.

TransUnion uses the credit bureaus' national consumer credit database as source material for its quarterly report.

Applications for new credit also grew at a slower-than-usual pace amid reduced access to branches during the lockdown, uncertainty around employment and a pullback on new offers from lenders.

The report did note that credit balances for Millennials and Gen Z consumers grew 0.8 per cent and 5.9 per cent, respectively, as those consumers have less buffer in the form of savings, investments or retirement funds. Overall instalment loan debt also rose by 3.9 per cent in the second quarter to $175.4 billion, up from $168.8 billion a year ago.

Mortgage debt is on the rise, TransUnion said, with new mortgages, renewals and refinances up 29 per cent from a year ago and a 5.3 per cent annual increase in the total volume of mortgage debt.

""The spring, that's usually the big mortgage season or the big home buying season. With people not being able to go out, and constraints around travelling and visiting homes and looking at new homes, once some of those lock downs were lifted, we've seen sort of a real surge,"" Fabian said.

""Certainly for some consumers that have existing mortgages, deferrals were an option, and a lot of consumers opted to take it … certainly for a lot of people, a mortgage might be one of the biggest monthly or biweekly expenses that they'd have.""

Despite a 4.3 per cent rise in total outstanding debt in Canada, which stood at $1.9 trillion in the second quarter, Fabian says delinquencies have risen less than expected, as about 2.6 million Canadians, or 9.2 per cent of credit consumers, have at least one active deferral.

Delinquencies also were on the rise for personal loans, which TransUnion noted are ""partly fuelled by alternative lenders who have been slightly more aggressive in issuing personal loans to below prime consumers.""

""We have seen delinquency rates go up a little bit, but a lot less than we had expected… and I think part of that is the deferral and forbearance processes that are in place with the lenders as well as the support from the government,"" said Fabian.

""Delinquency tends to be a long-tail thing where it takes a while. People have exhaust all their options before they will start to continuously skip and miss payments. As deferrals come off and the government subsidization ends, we expect to see some delinquency spike.""

To hear it from oil sands critics, politicians and activists, Indigenous people in the oil sands are a contradiction. Surely, they cannot exist. Or if they do, they are surely victims of a predatory resource industry, or are colonized sellouts.

So I thought I’d share my own story.

Story continues below advertisement

I’m an Ojibwe woman. Life was very hard growing up. I was brought up in an abusive environment, and my family was mostly dependent on government assistance for income. I ran away from home several times as a teenager to escape this lifestyle. I did complete high school although there were only a handful of other Indigenous students in my graduating class. Most of my Indigenous peers quit at middle school. I eventually moved to the city, married young, went to college, which I paid for myself, had children and got divorced. I often worked two or three jobs to support my family and still struggled to make ends meet.

One day, I decided to apply to work in the oil sands in Fort McMurray. I didn’t know anyone there but I was determined to make a change – and yes, of course, as with almost any job, there were financial motivations. I applied to dozens of places even though I had no experience. Only one contractor showed interest, but that was enough to get me trained as a heavy equipment operator. I have since moved up, and now I work at a large company.

The thing that has always contributed to my work ethic was my upbringing and the racism I faced. Ever since I was a child, I’ve heard all the epithets and slurs: “lazy Indian,” “welfare bum,” and accusations that I was only hired because I’m Indigenous. The oil sands are certainly not immune to such thinking. But I’ve used these attacks to motivate me to work extra hard and not give anyone a reason to hold those negative comments against me.

It should be said, however, that the oil sands have evolved since I came here almost nine years ago. People seem more professional, and I’ve seen far less tolerance for racism. There are more women and non-Indigenous people of colour working on site. People who don’t understand the oil sands may hold perceptions that resource-industry workers are crude, uneducated and dirty people who don’t care about the environment, but from what I’ve seen, none of that is true.

There’s been growing concern about the violence faced by Indigenous women in this country, and that’s a good thing. But when people try to focus their energy to separate Indigenous women from the resource industry, that’s a mistake. I’ve never once felt unsafe while working here. For me, the best way to protect myself and to be independent is to give my family and myself the privilege of options in life – and for me, that has come from working in this industry.

My dream is to ultimately recruit, mentor and supervise Indigenous people to work in the oil sands with heavy equipment. I’d like to see more Indigenous women work in oil and gas, so we are not deprived of these opportunities to earn a good livelihood and support our families because other people are making decisions for us.





Story continues below advertisement

I’m tired of politicians and activists speaking about Indigenous people as if we only have one voice, one culture, one worldview. Everyone has the right to speak up for what they believe in. But we must stop speaking about Indigenous people as if we all fit one stereotype. Let’s work to support one another and empower our people to make their own choices. For me, Canada’s resource sector was a great choice, as it’s a great place to create opportunities, and I don’t want to see these jobs taken away from Indigenous people, or any Canadians.

I have broken the cycle of government dependency, violence and poverty. I have my own voice. I refuse to be a victim of my circumstances. Most of all, I have choices, and I choose to declare that I’m a proud Indigenous woman working in the oil sands.

Conservative challenges

Re Scheer Offers Advice For His Replacement (Aug. 13): Andrew Scheer believes that a prime minister can be a social conservative, and that only the Trudeau Liberals demonize such views. As a card-carrying Conservative, I say that we lost the last election precisely because Mr. Scheer would not publicly support existing abortion rights and LGBTQ equality.

I am already convinced the Liberals will also win the next election, because some of Mr. Scheer’s would-be successors have stated that, as prime minister, they would allow backbench MPs to bring forth anti-abortion legislation. We are never going to beat the Liberals in this day and age, especially in the large cities and suburbs, until we finally make peace as a party with existing abortion rights and LGBTQ equality.

Re School Ventilation Systems Need Upgrading, Especially Amid COVID-19 (Aug. 13): Television producers should be clamouring to create a series based on the ongoing tragicomedy now playing out at Queen’s Park. It could be called “Seinford,” a show about nothing good.

An appropriate first episode would be about a character, let’s call him Doug, called “The Irony Ring,” focusing on a school-size version of the imaginary band of safety that worked wonders for so many of Ontario’s long-term care residents and migrant farm workers.

That could be followed by an instalment featuring one of his cohort, let’s call him Stephen, describing the painstaking planning, attention to detail and concern for the well-being of children that has gone into Ontario’s school reopening. This one could be titled “Let’s Give This A Shot, At Least.”

Undoubtedly, viewers would look forward to the spring of 2022, when the series finale (“The 43rd Ontario General Election”) will air, and where but a small minority would have said: “Gotta love the PCs.”

Tear down, build up

Re If We’re Cancelling Historical Villains, Why Not Norman Bethune? (Aug. 10): The call for statues to be taken down should not be one that begs the erasure of history, but instead one that demands a closer look.

At its core, it is an act of questioning who gets to write history and for whom it gets written. By confronting dominant narratives, we reveal the stories of those who have been oppressed and marginalized – stripping away the paint and seeing the tapestry before it becomes whitewashed.

When statues celebrating colonialists and slaveowners are removed, the acts should open space to examine cultural memory, not forget it. This is the way that we can hope to understand the traumas of the past, and work toward creating a more equitable present.

One nation under God?

Re The U.S. Presidential Election Is Blurring The Lines Between Saints And Sinners (Aug. 14): I have always been interested in reading about the development of the separation between church and state as part of Western civilization. It seemed to be one factor that enabled Britain to introduce religious tolerance as a government policy centuries ago. My sense is that this historical development was the major enabler of liberal democracy.

The separation of church and state is also the enabler of a robust realpolitik going back to Machiavelli. Contributor Michael Coren illustrates this point using the U.S. Attorney-General’s combination of a personal Catholic faith opposed to capital punishment with a public pursuit of policy furthering the death penalty. He must be putting the representation of his party’s voters first, for the “greater good.”

Corporate conundrum

Re Taxes May Be The Prescription To Treat The Ailment Of The Coming Debt Crisis – But Which Taxes? (Report on Business, Aug. 10): Contributors Peter van Dijk and Glen Hodgson of the C.D. Howe Institute first describe higher personal taxes as harmful and inefficient, then recommend that consumption taxes (such as GST or HST) should be the progressive choice for supplementary government revenues. Pray tell, who are those consumers but us personal taxpayers!

If we are to make raising taxes to reduce debt a countrywide effort, each segment of our economic culture should carry its fair share of the load. For instance, corporate taxes now account for less than 15 per cent of the federal government’s combined total tax revenues, while personal taxes make up close to 50 per cent (and much more when consumption taxes are factored in).

Story continues below advertisement

Stephen Harper reduced the GST by two percentage points and cut corporate taxes from 22 per cent to 15 per cent, effectively removing about $20-billion to $30-billion a year from tax revenues – a good place to begin if this recovery plan is truly intended to equally share the pain.

Re Canada Can’t Take Four More Years Of Trump (Aug. 13): If one goes back and forth over the border enough times, sooner or later one will encounter “liberal” Canadians who feel superior or more liberal than those of us on the southern side. Frankly, it should go both ways.

On the northern side, there have been two-and-a-half decades of nothing but white, male Liberal and Conservative leaders. Here, we have had one woman run for president, and two Democratic women and one Republican woman run for vice-president. Nancy Pelosi has been head of the Democrats in the House of Representatives. And we had a Black president.

So I challenge Canadians to beat that. Isn’t it time Canada caught up to the United States?

The Montreal-based, French-trained chef and entrepreneur peppers his conversations, his cooking and his classes with stories.

“When I’m giving a cooking class, I tell a story about a Nonna in Italy,” he says. “She’s going to cook a simple polenta for her family, and you know what? That’s what we’re making today, it’s going to be delicious, use authentic ingredients and you can make it, too.”

Through his cooking lessons and social media channels, Garnier’s students enthusiastically cook polenta, vegetarian polpette and fresh pasta. Throughout all aspects of La Guilde Culinaire, the chef’s boutique and culinary school in Montreal’s Little Italy, he places emphasis on quality ingredients, taste and technique, skillfully blending local Quebec ingredients with the fine European foods he loves, like Italian Pecorino Romano (PDO) and Spanish Jamón Serrano (PGI).

“Each of these products have their stories,” Garnier says. “The tastes are always honest and authentic, and come with their own history and perfected technique based on years of producer experience, history and tradition.”

Garnier shares the stories of these flavours with his students, too. “I love the tradition of charcuterie from the Baltics and get my students to taste the dry sausages and cold cuts with local beer,” he says. “Or I send them to Montreal’s great cheese stores to look for the flavour profiles in the same kind of cheese from different countries, like Feta cheese (PDO) from Greece and Bulgarian traditional soft cheeses. When they start to detect these differences…they’re truly learning and enjoying.”

With both his large-event catering services and grab-and-go lunch counter in downtown Montreal suspended for the moment, La Guilde Culinaire’s online kitchen equipment and pantry ingredient boutique – stocked aplenty with authentic European Union’s (EU) goods, like Paella rice from Valencia, Spain and infused vinegar and olive oils from France – has become the power engine of the business. “We’re shipping four to five times more during this time than pre-COVID,” the chef says. “Everyone is cooking at home now.”

This offers a unique learning opportunity for Garnier’s students – more than ever before, Canadians are making moments in their own kitchens, uniting over quality local and imported ingredients and sharing meals made with love. By bringing the best European imports into the homes of Canadians, Garnier has brought many back to their roots, while taking others into a new world of taste.

With The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) in place between the European Union and Canada, European products are within easier reach than some might expect for importers, retailers and consumers in Canada. Whether cheeses, meats, olive oils, fruits, produce, confectionery, beer or wine, European products are uniquely positioned to meet the changing preferences and appetites of the Canadian shopper, who places an ever-greater premium on quality, safety and authenticity.

Garnier leverages the accessibility to EU products in his cooking philosophy, based on what he calls his “little drawers of taste”: banks of flavour that he keeps in his mind from his travels and training and uses to inform every dish. Finding the correct, authentic ingredients to fit in each drawer has been essential to his creative process as a chef. “Think about olives from Greece or Spain, and combining them with Quebec pork – it’s terrific,” he says. “Or pistachios from Italy and local double cream. You’ll make the most delicious ice cream you’ve ever had.”

Knowing where an ingredient is coming from is key. Garnier looks for European Union Geographical Indications – products carrying the blue or yellow seal Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) and Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) confirming a product’s origins and authenticity – to ensure that what he’s buying is the real deal.

“I tell my students to get all the information they can about a product before they buy it and serve it to their friends and family,” Garnier says. “Then they can tell the story of the origins of the food and the history of the producers. That’s as much part of the sharing as the cooking.”

“I’m always going to put love into my food,” the convivial chef adds. “And with European ingredients, we can always share a great story, too.”

An internal company investigation of claims about the show was prompted by a BuzzFeed News report in July based on 36 interviews with ex-staffers, who complained about or said they witnessed improper and unfair treatment.

Most of the allegations were tied to executive producers and senior managers, including Glavin, Leman and Norman, BuzzFeed News said. The people making the claims against them were not identified.

A representative for Leman didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Monday. Representatives for Glavin and Norman couldn't immediately be found.

In statements to BuzzFeed News after the July 30 story was published online, Leman denied ""any kind of sexual impropriety"" and Norman said he categorically denied the accusations.

DeGeneres informed staff of the shakeup Monday in a video conference call, according to Variety, which first reported the development. She said she found claims about the show's environment to be ""heartbreaking,"" the trade publication said, citing unidentified sources.

The comedian and host had sent a memo to her staff after last month's BuzzFeed article, recalling her early promise of ensuring a workplace where ""everyone would be treated with respect."" Something changed, she said, ""and for that, I am sorry.""

The show debuted in 2003.

It was midway through March when Joe Moscato, vice president of sales and marketing at Aurora Importing, noticed pantry items like dried pasta, polenta, rice, canned tomatoes, canned beans, tuna and olive oil flying off shelves.

Seemingly overnight, demand for staples skyrocketed by up to 400 per cent as lockdown orders fell into place and Canadians pivoted to eating every meal at home. Staff across the family-run importing and distributing company worked around the clock to meet rapidly changing consumer demands for their favourite European foods.

Aurora was far from alone in the challenges it faced: COVID-19 disrupted the entire global food supply chain, affecting everyone from the workers planting and harvesting crops to the grocery store clerks stocking shelves.

Looking back, Moscato credits the company’s ability to rise to the challenge to its legacy as one of the largest, most reliable, well-resourced importers of authentic European goods into Canada.

“We have longstanding partnerships with many of our suppliers and producers,” Moscato says. “Despite the onset of COVID-19 in Europe and here in Canada during the first outbreak in mid-March, we were well-positioned to supply the market’s unprecedented demand.”

For many consumers, spending time at home has underscored the importance of high-quality imported ingredients. Increases in demand for popular products meant many goods were hard to get ahold of; but Moscato and his team at Aurora worked hard to ensure that Canadians were able to connect with the European foods they’d come to know and love.

In fact, keeping up with consumer needs has always been a part of Aurora’s DNA: In 1955, Nunzio Tumino, a new immigrant from Sicily, opened a grocery store in the west end of Toronto. On his trips back to Italy, Tumino’s immigrant customers often asked him to bring back the foods they missed. He started supplying other local retailers with specialty European foods like oils, canned tomatoes and pasta, and eventually, Aurora became one of the first major importing companies in Canada.

To this day, the organization continues to be driven by a desire to unite members of the European diaspora with foods from their roots while offering other Canadians the opportunity to explore new cuisines. Though Aurora began with Italian products, they’ve expanded and now source foods from all over Europe, including ale beer from Germany, and speculoos biscuits from Belgium (or ‘speculaas’ if from the Netherlands.)

Open this photo in gallery SUPPLIED

“Italian is who we are at our core and that will never change,” Moscato says. “But as the Canadian demographics continue to evolve and diversify, so do we.”

Products like Aurora’s play as vital a role on Canadians’ shelves as they do within the national economy: According to Sylvain Charlebois, professor and senior director of the Agri-Food Analytics Lab at Dalhousie University, Canada’s unique weather patterns pose limits to what’s possible to produce from home. Imports are left to fill in gaps.

Story continues below advertisement

“Our growing season is limited compared to many other nations,” Charlebois says. “We’re at the mercy of mother nature.”

He adds that importing food strengthens Canada’s economy as a whole. “As a trading nation, you can benefit from relationships you build abroad,” he says. “Maybe the initial intent is to buy [food from other countries], but you may end up buying other stuff and building relationships with companies that eventually buy more products from Canada.”

This became easier after the 2017 passage of The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) between Canada and the European Union (EU), which offers protection for European and Canadian foods with Geographical Indications (GIs), ensuring that products are from where they say they are. For example, Aurora products like Aceto Balsamico di Modena (PGI) – a vinegar from the Modena region – and Pomodoro San Marzano dell’Agro Sarnese-Nocerino (PDO) – tomatoes grown under the shade of Mount Vesuvius in San Marzano sul Sarno – are labelled with GIs to confirm their geographic authenticity. These EU labels guarantee the authenticity of products, as well as their high quality and strict production standards.

This kind of protection is vital given the sheer diversity of Europe, its cultures and its culinary traditions, Charlebois notes.

More than 200 refugee claims have been filed in Canada by asylum-seekers from Lebanon in the first three months of the year, with claimants alleging political persecution in a country that’s been plunged into chaos by a corrupt government and a collapsing economy.

That number of refugee claims so far this year is a significant increase from the previous two years. In all of 2019, 552 people made a claim against Lebanon, and 439 claims were made in all of 2018, according to statistics from the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada.

Bassam Azzi, an immigration and refugee lawyer in Ottawa, said his office has heard from Lebanese citizens in Canada who are seeking ways to stay and also from people in Lebanon who have asked for advice on how to immigrate to Canada. He said the 202 claims filed in Canada this year could include people who are stateless in addition to Lebanese citizens.

“Because of the situation that’s going on in Lebanon – the economic crisis, the financial crisis – … people are just, in their own words, they’re ‘fed up’ and they don’t see Lebanon as a safe place for them to stay,” he said.

Mr. Azzi said those who are already inside Canada could be visitors, students or temporary residents and may have been politically active in Lebanon and fearful of returning because they criticized the government. Some, he said, have been threatened, so they have inquired about making a refugee claim. Others have said they are not politically active but are worried about living conditions.

Mr. Azzi said he is expecting to hear from “many more” people in Lebanon who are interested in immigrating to Canada or claiming asylum here after last week’s explosion in Beirut’s port that obliterated the facility, caused extensive destruction, killed at least 160 people and injured about 6,000 others.

Lebanon’s Prime Minister Hassan Diab resigned on Monday, saying in a televised speech that corruption in the country is “bigger than the state.”

Mr. Azzi said calls from people in Lebanon began in October, 2019, as citizens took to the streets to protest continuing corruption in government and banking.

“I think it is very sad what’s going on in Lebanon. I think the people are suffering,” he said, adding that many in Lebanon do not have access to basic services; there is limited access to health care as well as daily power shortages.

Lama Mourad, an assistant professor at Carleton University and an expert on Lebanon, said the uprising in October saw Lebanese civil society call out people in power in ways that hadn’t been seen before, and as a result, people are more worried about their physical safety and their lives.

“People are concerned; there are documented cases of activists and scholars having been taken to court or have been physically beaten for calling out corruption among the banking sector, in particular, and the Lebanese politicians and the intersection of the two,” Prof. Mourad said.

She said the increasing numbers of refugee claims in Canada is the result of how politicians and the banking class have responded toward activists, journalists and others who have spoken out.

Bessma Momani, a professor at the University of Waterloo, said even before the explosion, people in Lebanon felt there was no hope left in the country.

“I have no doubt that the vast majority of Lebanese are trying to find an exit strategy, and they will try to reach out to existing family. There’s more Lebanese in the diaspora than there are inside the country, quite literally more living outside than inside, and so they will be reaching out to family networks abroad,” she said.

On Monday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced an additional $25-million to assist people in Lebanon in the wake of the explosion. This brings Ottawa’s aid to a total of $30-million.

Kevin Lemkay, a spokesperson for Immigration Minister Marco Mendicino, said the federal government is working with partners such as the Red Cross to help meet the urgent needs of those affected by the explosion.

He added that Canada has been able to prioritize and resettle urgent cases from asylum seekers.

”All eligible asylum claimants receive a full and fair hearing on the individual merits of their claim at the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada. We will continue to work with the [United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and International Organization for Migration] and domestic organizations to maintain Canada’s commitment to offering asylum to the world’s most vulnerable,” he said.

If you were at The Taphouse Coquitlam or Charlie Hamiltons Pub on the dates/times listed on our public exposures page, Public Health recommends self-monitoring for symptoms of COVID-19. https://t.co/HPGyL5u3aV pic.twitter.com/RehjMyTVq4 — Fraser Health (@Fraserhealth) August 11, 2020

In both cases, the health authority is warning the public through its new exposure portal, a step it triggers when contact tracers are “unable to reach or identify all potentially exposed via contact tracing.”

However, if you were at either location during the times and dates indicated, it does not necessarily mean you’ll develop the symptoms of COVID-19.

Anyone who visited the the two bars are asked to monitor themselves for symptoms.

“If you develop any symptoms of COVID-19, please seek testing and then self-isolate. Please call ahead and wear a mask when seeking testing,” notes Fraser Health.

The Tri-City News has attempted to reach both businesses but has not yet received a reply. But according to promotional material on both bars' social media channels — and an Aug. 10 recorded voice message on Charlie Hamiltons Pub's voice mail — they appear to have remained open in the intervening time.

In its Facebook post, The Taphouse Coquitlam wrote it had not received information about the exposures until recently.

“It is important to mention that we wish this information was shared with us sooner, so we could have shared it with you sooner,” wrote management. “Regardless of this, we are doing everything in our power to trace any possible exposure to our guests and staff members.""

Fraser Health advises that there is no risk to anyone who attended either of the establishments outside the flagged dates and times.

The Tri-Cities' latest publically acknowledged exposures come amidst a steady stream of new infections across B.C. In an ominous reversal Tuesday, Aug. 11, B.C. reported more new cases than Ontario (46 versus 33). At 472 infections, the province now has the highest number of active COVID-19 cases in three months.

First Person is a daily personal piece submitted by readers. Have a story to tell? See our guidelines at tgam.ca/essayguide.

Bodies are so unruly. We like to think we have control over them: that we can schedule meltdowns and malfunctions, or that we can eat to beat disease and ingest enough teas and tinctures for our bodies to remain docile and adherent to our commands.

But I’ve learned that’s not how it works.

Story continues below advertisement

I sat on the toilet one morning recently and noticed the sticky note on the wall looking back at me. “Pee in container!” I had written on it. “Darn,” I thought, “I really do need reminders more than I want to admit.” I ran upstairs and grabbed the large orange collection container I had picked up at the lab the day before. I shut the toilet lid and put the container on top for next time.

Just over a year ago, I had a kidney stone removed surgically. The procedure went fine but afterward, I developed sepsis – the body’s extreme response to a severe infection – and endured a frightening and painful week in hospital. When I was better, I committed to doing everything I could to avoid that experience again. And so began the referrals and tests to figure out why I am apparently very prone to kidney stones.

Collecting your urine in a giant orange container for 24 hours is one of the tests used to understand kidney stone formation, and I have completed it only somewhat successfully four times now. You’d think with each passing urine collection that I would get smarter, more practical, a urine specimen whiz. But every time the test comes due, I find myself dumbfounded as to how one goes about collecting urine in a three-litre jug while carrying out the rest of their day.

This lack of insight doesn’t surprise me, though. I’m a registered nurse who has taken care of a lot of people, and I can’t tell you the number of times I have asked patients to fit an unrealistic medical something-or-other into their day, always crossing my fingers they’ll succeed. “Please take this pill, on this day, at this time, with this food but not that food, and not if you are going to be in the sun, and don’t forget to drink lots of water.”

The urine collection container is handed to you in a large brown paper bag that looks like it might contain enough burgers and fries to feed a family. However, the lack of grease on the bag makes it obvious you’re trying to hide something other than emotional eating. When I take the bag from the lab receptionist and it crinkles loudly in my hand, I always find myself looking left and right as if I might find an even bigger sack to quickly hide the obvious quirkiness of how I will be spending my next 24 hours.

The paper bag masking the unsightly container reminds me of what we do with our bodies all the time. We think we can hide what we don’t want others to see by creating elaborate versions of ourselves using clothing and makeup and showcasing our favourable traits. Underneath the costumes, though, and despite all the supplements, lives a human body with its own calendar of mishaps and its own agenda.

Really, the body we inhabit is an entity unto itself. It doesn’t always align with the human energy that lives inside, which can be due to anything from rapid aging or unforeseen illness. And at some point in all of our lives, we are destined to come face to face with what is happening within our bodies. To step back and realize we are only human. To ask for help from our friends, neighbours and families. To be humbled when they show up for us, change our sheets and bring us soups. To seek counsel from experts. And hopefully, in the process, to learn how to say, “Thank you for caring about my unruly body.”

The 24-hour urine collection container instructions ask that you keep the container and its contents refrigerated. This is a conundrum because my fridge has no obvious spot for a massive jug of pee. Large jars and yogurts on the top shelf. A 12-pack of something fizzy, butter and bowls of cut-up fruit and veg on the middle shelf. And on the bottom shelf goes all the rest. The jug won’t fit in a crisper drawer – I’ve tried. An entire fridge reorganization is required in order to house the specimen, and I never remember to do this the night before. At 6 a.m. on collection day, there I am perched in front of the fridge laying off expired Worcestershire sauce and furloughing items that will last at room temperature for a day or so. All this in hopes of creating a welcoming spot for a container of urine but not welcoming enough that the jug could be said to be enjoying a cozy experience with the milk and O.J. It is pee, after all.

Through enduring painful experiences – whether it be sepsis or other physical or mental-health challenges – you gain a new perspective. You realize that you can, in fact, be stopped in your tracks. That you don’t have a say in everything. And with the treatment and tapering of excruciating pain comes the realization that idleness and existing in a state of neutral calm can be a beautiful thing. We don’t need to always be numbing the in-between moments with distractions.

Enduring pain and coming out the other side teaches you to let go a little, to take yourself a little less seriously, to stop putting on the costumes day after day. You learn that life at its best is a constellation of millions of small moments: moments that can be hard, moments that can be awful, moments that are always fleeting. You strive to make the most of your moments. To make them worthwhile. To make them joyful. To make them lasting. To make them as warm as the pee that runs down your leg when you miss the orange jug.

COVID-19 is the illness caused by the novel coronavirus.

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness in people and others cause illness in animals. Human coronaviruses are common. They are typically associated with mild illnesses, similar to the common cold.

article continues below

COVID-19 is a new disease that has not been previously identified in humans. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people, and more rarely, these can then spread from person to person through close contact.

There have been two other specific coronaviruses that have spread from animals to humans and which have caused severe illness in humans: SARS and MERS.

How worried should I be?

The illness caused by COVID-19 is generally mild, especially for children and young adults. However, it can cause serious illness: an estimated one in five people who catch it needs hospital care, and in severe cases, infection can lead to death.

Older persons and persons with pre-existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes) appear to develop serious illness more often than others.

According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe ailments might take three to six weeks to rebound. In mainland China, where the virus first exploded, more than 80,000 people have been diagnosed, but more than 60,000 already have recovered.

There are also ways to reduce your risk of catching it.

How likely am I to catch it?

The risk depends on where you are and whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there. For most people in most places, the risk of becoming infected remains low. On Vancouver Island, for example, there have been eight cases, as of Monday.

Complying with any local restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings helps to reduce the risk of catching or spreading COVID-19.

In B.C., the government is asking people who have been travelling overseas to self-isolate for 14 days and watch for symptoms. Gatherings and events of more than 250 people have been cancelled.

What symptoms should I look out for?

Common symptoms include fever, cough and difficulty breathing. Some people have developed pneumonia in both lungs.

That said, those who are infected with COVID-19 might have little to no symptoms, and many symptoms are similar to those of a cold or flu, so you might not realize you have COVID-19.

It appears that it could take up to 14 days for symptoms to appear after a person is exposed to the virus.

What should I do if I feel sick?

If you are sick, the first thing you need to do is stay home, away from others, says provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry.

People experiencing symptoms such as a fever, dry cough or difficulty breathing are asked to contact their primary-care providers or call HealthLink B.C. at 811 to be assessed. People who require follow-up will be directed to call a testing clinic, where a triage nurse will reassess them to determine if an appointment for testing is needed.

Do I need to get tested?

Only if you are told to get one by your primary care provider or HealthLink B.C. Those who are symptom-free don’t have to be tested for COVID-19, even if they have been travelling abroad.

Isn’t the flu worse than COVID-19?

In terms of sheer numbers, influenza has a greater impact than the new coronavirus.

According to the World Health Organization, annual flu epidemics are estimated to result in about three million to five million cases of severe illness. Seasonal flu kills far fewer than one per cent of those infected.

For comparison, there were 142,539 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 5,393 deaths as of Saturday. The mortality rate of COVID-19 is estimated to be between one and four per cent.

Both the flu and COVID-19 cause respiratory disease and spread the same way, via small droplets of fluid from the nose and mouth of someone who is sick. Influenza appears to transmit more efficiently, with people who are not yet sick being major spreaders of the disease.

However, COVID-19 appears to cause more severe disease than seasonal influenza. Because it is new, no one has immunity. That means more people are susceptible to infection. And unlike the flu, there are no vaccines or specific treatments for COVID-19. (However, clinical trials are underway and several vaccines are in development.)

How does the virus spread?

Coronavirus is transmitted via larger liquid droplets when a person coughs or sneezes. For that reason, the virus is not thought to be airborne — transmitted through particles floating in the air. However, you can become infected if you are in close contact and these droplets enter through the eyes, nose or throat.

It can be spread by touch if a person has used their hands to cover their mouth or nose when they cough. That’s why you should cough or sneeze into your arm, avoid shaking or touching hands, and wash your hands regularly.

You can also catch it by touching an object with the virus on it, then touching your mouth, nose, or eyes before washing your hands. Again, wash your hands regularly.

Because it’s a heavier droplet, it only spreads about one metre through coughing or sneezing. It’s not clear how long the virus lasts on surfaces.

It is most likely to be transmitted by infected individuals to people they live with, spend time with in close indoor settings, or by sharing food.

Can you become sick from someone before they show symptoms?

Health officials still are investigating whether the virus can be transmitted to others if someone is not showing symptoms. Experts believe it is possible, but rare.

How can I keep from getting sick?

Provincial health officer Bonnie Henry advises “doing all those things that we need to do at this time of the year to prevent transmissions of infections,” including cleaning hands regularly, covering your mouth with your sleeve, not touching your face and eyes, staying away from others and staying home if you’re sick.

Wash your hands, regularly and thoroughly, using soap and water or using an alcohol-based hand rub. Wash them for at least 20 seconds, and be sure to include your wrist, fingertips and between your fingers.

Practise social distancing, keeping at least one metre (three feet) away from others, especially anyone who is coughing or sneezing.

Don’t touch your eyes, nose or mouth. Your hands touch a lot of surfaces and can pick up viruses, which can then be transferred to your eyes, nose or mouth — where they can enter your body and make you sick.

Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a disposable tissue. Throw out the tissue immediately.

Stay away from COVID-19 hotspots — areas where the virus is spreading widely. There is a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in these areas.

Regularly clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces, and do not share food, drinks or utensils.

Should I wear a mask?

If you are sick, wearing a mask helps prevent you from passing on illnesses to other people.

If you are not sick, it might be less effective to wear a mask in the community.

What is social distancing?

It’s not forever, but provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry is asking people to distance themselves from others, at least a metre — about the distance that the novel coronavirus droplets spread through coughing or sneezing can travel.

If you are at a gathering of a few people, consider sitting in every second seat. Avoid hugging, kissing and shaking hands.

“Right now, we need to keep our hands to ourselves, keep our germs to ourselves,” Henry said. “Make it OK within our family groups and within our religious and social groups that we [greet one another] from a distance right now. We look people in the eyes. We smile in the same way that we have before.”

What is self-monitoring?

Self-monitoring means watching your health and the health of your children for symptoms such as fever, cough and difficulty breathing.

Anyone who self-monitors is asked to avoid crowded public spaces and places where you cannot easily separate yourself from others if you become ill. Individuals who are self-monitoring are allowed to attend and work in school and participate in regular activities.

I’ve been travelling — what should I do?

B.C. has asked anyone who has been out of the country to self-isolate.

Self-isolation means avoiding situations where you could infect other people to help prevent the spread of infections.

Stay at home and limit contact with others for 14 days. That means not going to work or school.

Monitor yourself daily for symptoms such as fever, cough or difficulty breathing for these 14 days. If you develop symptoms, call HealthLink B.C. (811) or speak with your health-care provider to discuss any need for testing and follow-up.

People who have self-isolated can return to normal activities after 14 days if they have not developed any symptoms.

If you’re concerned that you might have been exposed to the virus because you recently travelled to one of the affected areas — such as Washington state, Italy, China, or Iran — call your health-care provider, if you have one, or 811 to speak to a nurse who will help guide you through the process.

Can I still travel?

The federal governments have issued a global travel advisory, telling Canadians to avoid non-essential travel abroad.

Travel could be severely interrupted because many governments are imposing entry, exit and movement restrictions, the Foreign Affairs Department said. Canadians outside the country should consider an early return, it said.

To limit the spread of COVID-19, many countries have put in place travel or border restrictions and other measures such as movement restrictions and quarantines. Airlines have cancelled flights. New restrictions could be imposed with little warning. Your travel plans might be severely disrupted and you might be forced to remain outside of Canada longer than expected.

Contact your airline or tour operator to determine options for cancelling or postponing your trip.

The Government of Canada is advising that you avoid all travel on cruise ships due to the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, until further notice.

Cruise passengers include travellers from around the world who might be arriving from areas with known or unknown spread of COVID-19.

The virus can spread quickly on board cruises due to the close contact between passengers. Older people and people with a weakened immune system or underlying medical condition are at a higher risk of developing severe disease.

Should I be stocking up on food?

The Canadian Public Health Agency recommends stocking up on non-perishable food items, so that you do not need to go shopping if you become sick or if there is a larger outbreak.

It is easier on the supply chain if people gradually build up their household stores instead of making large-scale purchases all at once. To do this, you can add a few extra items to your grocery cart every time you shop.

Some good options include easy-to-prepare foods such as dried pasta and sauce, canned soups and canned vegetables and beans. It’s also good to have extra pet food, toilet paper, facial tissue, feminine hygiene products and diapers, as applicable, on hand.

The reason for stocking up on these items is not necessarily because you will need to self-isolate. Having these supplies on hand will ensure you do not need to leave your home at the peak of the outbreak or if you become ill.

Even if we shred our garbage beyond recognition, our waste still says volumes about us. So to speak.

In fact, if somebody really wants to learn about us, they can probably find out more about us than we know ourselves.

It’s happening already. As of last month, for example, local researchers began plumbing this daily data dump for signs of COVID-19 among us. Researchers from the University of Victoria have partnered with local tech company Pani Energy to collect and analyze sewage samples taken from local pumping stations to detect incipient outbreaks of COVID-19.

It’s the start of a project to monitor and report to public- health authorities on data gathered from wastewater treatment plants across the province. The goal is to develop an early warning system to alert health authorities when outbreaks are on the point of happening in a region.

When a person is infected with the coronavirus, the virus’s DNA shows up in that person’s poo days before they start feeling ill and even if they have no symptoms. Monitoring Victoria’s sewage for traces of the virus can yield an accurate, community-level picture of emerging infection rates up to days — possibly a week — before doctors and hospitals start seeing people needing treatment.

The researchers can’t pinpoint the person or even the household putting the viral DNA into the system. All going well, however, they’ll be able to identify areas within the region that are sloughing higher viral loads, based on where samples are sampled and how much DNA each sample contains. There’s a bit more involved than that, of course.

Sewage offers up a honey wagon-load of information about us. In another case of secrets revealed, the B.C. Centre for Disease Control used samples from sewer overflows and wastewater treatment plants, as well as municipal raw sewage discharge to track the spread of norovirus to shellfish farms on the coast. Thanks to those efforts, a 2018 norovirus outbreak linked to farmed oysters lasted just six weeks, compared with the previous, pre-tracking, outbreak in 2016-2017, which lasted five months.

Last year, Statistics Canada scooped the poop in five cities over 12 months to reveal cannabis and illicit drug use rates and patterns. The study exposed none of Victoria’s secrets, but it did out Halifax residents as the study’s top pot consumers. Montreal residents came in second and Toronto third. Vancouver and Edmonton ranked lower for weed use, but showed high meth and opiate use.

Cocaine use didn’t spike regionally, but the wastewater data suggested use of cocaine goes up in the summer, drops during the fall, then increases again in the winter.

Sewage epidemiologists have also plumbed what our behinds leave behind to glean information about the medications we take. Standard recommended-dose data allows the researchers to estimate how many people contributing to a sewage-collection system are taking birth control pills, antidepressants, antipsychotics, pain relievers, chemotherapy and so on. They can do this, because anything we eat that our bodies don’t metabolize and absorb flushes out the other end.

The information potential of our waste streams is immense. Consider how University of Washington researchers used whale poop to investigate resident-orca population health. They determined the sex, age and health of individual whales, as well as what and how much they were eating. The scientists also measured the animals’ reproductive, metabolic and stress hormone levels, and the amount and variety of parasites, environmental toxins, and hormone-disrupting chemicals the animals carried.

So many secrets could come to light thanks to what comes out of where the sun doesn’t shine.

The walking trail we’d been using since the pandemic had transformed our neighbourhood gym into a sterile prison was broad and flat, and I’d begun this particular March morning’s stroll by sprinting like a toddler, leaving my wife behind and feeling free and blissfully noncontagious, when her phone rang.

“Come back,” she shouted, ending the call. “I’ve decided.”

This was not a good sign. I knew her boss had planned to confront her with the same tough choice countless other Canadians had been forced to make recently. “Maybe you should think about this a bit more,” I suggested as I rejoined her. “We haven’t had our coffee yet.”

She smiled slightly, but the look on her face told me to prepare. It said I was about to discover, up close and personal, what happens to a happily unremarkable, largely untroubled life when one’s significant other becomes an essential worker in an existential fight nobody saw coming.

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis, public figures across Canada have extolled the courage and dedication of those who put themselves in harm’s way to keep the rest of us fed, clothed, sheltered and as healthy as possible. And rightly so. But the examples they’ve selected are, for the most part, seasoned professionals who are trained to deal with this sort of thing: paramedics, doctors, nurses.

My wife, Ruth, was none of these. She’d been two months into a part-time, semi-retirement gig at a Halifax grocer when she picked up that call from work. She had no special skills to offer, and no one would blame her if she quit. Still, her boss entreated, could she remain a little longer? Would she consider sticking around to “make things right” for folks?

I could think of a dozen reasons why she should not. There was the constant handwashing, clothes-laundering, the countertop-bleaching, for three. And that was just for openers.

“You think civilians have it rough,” I railed. “Just wait till you’re a bone fide foot soldier on the front lines of the COVID wars. What about your children, grandchildren, sister, nieces? While we’re at it, what about me? How ready do you imagine I am to contract one of the most perniciously virulent diseases in all of human history? What’s more, you don’t have to do this.”

She smiled again: “Yes. I do.”

There are approximately 175,000 minutes in four months. Since March, I’ve counted every one of them as the country’s regions, provinces, cities, towns and institutions have progressed through various stages of self-isolation, physical distancing and outright lockdown. Grocery stores do not, and never will, enjoy that option. They are, for lack of a more novel word, essential, and so are the people who work for them.

Naturally, then, I began my COVID-19 sojourn pretty much as I had expected: in nearly constant fear for my wife’s health, safety and well-being. But as day marched into night, and the various precautionary routines we had deployed seemed to hold up, I began to breathe again. Even more unexpectedly, I began to see the benighted world through my wife’s tender, tolerant eyes.

When pollsters phoned, I asked them how they were doing. When my lawyer demanded his money, I told the truth: It’s in the mail. I smiled at the Ford pickup truck with the lousy muffler. I talked to strangers.

I don’t recall the exact moment when I fully realized that I had been utterly wrong-headed about all of this. It might have been the time Ruth came home after a long shift to tell me the story about the customer who, after observing a woman ahead of her in line struggle with loose change, pulled out a credit card and paid the entire bill.

It might have been after I heard tales of the store’s staff rallying behind their colleagues faced with especially recalcitrant shoppers, or anecdotes about patrons flashing warm smiles and cracking jokes just to raise the level of civility in the joint.

It might have been after learning about these flashes of common virtue and any number of other tiny generosities – this way to a clean public toilet; that way to a better price; over there for a cash-only check out – that the truth about my wife finally dawned on me. She really is contagious, if patience, attentiveness, usefulness and compassion are communicable. I should be so lucky.

As Canadians, we may need to appreciate this more now as our children prepare to return to school and various provincial “bubbles” of relaxed social interaction inflate and test the limits of our thoughtfulness, but these are lessons in grace that have always been with us, waiting to be learned in whichever times we find ourselves.

Tomorrow, we’ll walk the trail again. This time, I’ll hang back a bit, and see if I can catch a little more of what’s going around, of what’s essential.

There are several different movement disorders that affect the face, some of which can cause tics, which is what it sounds like you are describing. Tics can occur by themselves, or in the context of another neurological condition. A good example of this is Tourette’s syndrome, which has a wide range of clinical expressions and does not always look the way it is portrayed in movies.

Some movement disorders are related to medication use, so a neurologist evaluating you would do not only a careful exam, but a thorough review of past medication use.

Dear Dr. Roach: I’ve heard of a new treatment for enlarged prostate. It’s called PAE. I understand it is a procedure that restricts blood flow to the prostate, causing it to shrink. Have you heard of it and any downsides?

W.G.

Prostate artery embolization uses plastic beads to block the arteries in the prostate, causing cell death and shrinkage of the prostate. In theory, that will improve symptoms of enlarged prostate.

It is a new procedure, and the benefits and risks are not as well understood as they are for more commonly used procedures. Complications, especially urinary retention, can happen up to 26 per cent of the time. Post-PAE syndrome has been described. It includes a burning sensation, nausea and vomiting. Given the lack of certainty about the relative effectiveness about this procedure compared with traditional options, the American Urological Association has recommended PAE be used only in the setting of a clinical trial.

Dear Dr. Roach: Can you get irritable bowel syndrome by living in a tropical climate? I moved to South Florida 15 years ago and have had this problem ever since. When I go up North, I have no symptoms within 24 hours. My gastroenterologist, who moved his practice from Pennsylvania to Florida, said he has never seen so many patients with IBS since his move. He has said he suspects there may be an irritant in the air or water that causes this. Any thoughts?

Anon.

IBS is a very common condition and is frequently not formally diagnosed. Ten to 15 per cent of North Americans meet criteria, and more women have it than men in North America. There have been several studies looking at geographic distribution of IBS, but there is no definitive increase in warmer climates.

The underlying causes of IBS are not known precisely, and no clear irritant in food or water has been found. Stress might cause IBS to worsen, so that’s a possibility. You might also be eating differently when you go back to Pennsylvania.

R.H.

I am sure you must be frustrated with the lack of diagnosis and continued symptoms.

Abdominal migraine does indeed cause recurrent abdominal pain, and many people with it have had extensive evaluations before the diagnosis is made. However, migraine of any kind starting in the 60s is uncommon. Abdominal migraine is more common in children. Further, most people with abdominal migraine have other migraine syndromes, such as headache, though it is possible to have abdominal symptoms alone.

The location of abdominal migraine is most commonly around the umbilicus.

Pain often begins suddenly and lasts an hour or more. The pain must be associated with at least two of the following: nausea, vomiting, headache, loss of appetite or pallor (the medical term for the unhealthy pale appearance of a person who is acutely ill).

Often, if the diagnosis is suspected, a trial of anti-migraine medication can confirm the diagnosis if successful.

There are many. Of course, a thorough evaluation for other causes of abdominal pain are mandatory before making the diagnosis of abdominal migraine.

One good place to read more is on Yale Medicine’s webpage for abdominal migraine, yalemedicine.org/conditions/abdominal-migraine/.

Dear Dr. Roach: I am a healthy 71-year-old woman of normal weight. I had a pacemaker put in back in December 2019 due to heart block. I had a low heart rate of 37, which caused periodic shortness of breath and trouble walking for exercise without becoming dizzy and lightheaded and feeling like I would pass out. Things are much better since the pacemaker was put in, but I still feel like my heart rate goes high quickly with little exertion, such as just walking to the mailbox. My cardiologist says that should improve as I continue to exercise more. Should I be concerned?

P.B.

Your cardiologist is very likely correct. People with heart block, like many heart issues, often subconsciously decrease their exertion.

This leads to deconditioning, and a regular exercise program is the correct treatment. If you aren’t getting back to normal, the cardiologist may want to take a look at heart function with an echocardiogram.

Last year I started to have asymptomatic PVCs. I also have prediabetes and mild high blood pressure. I am on 100 milligrams of Lopressor twice daily. I had a negative stress test. My cardiologist wants to reduce the frequency of the PVCs to less than 10%. Is there any good scientific rationale to this approach?

R.D.

article continues below

Premature ventricular contractions — PVCs — are early heartbeats. An average person might have 500 of them daily. You are having a great deal more than average: more than 10% of your beats. If you have 100,000 heartbeats daily, that’s more than 10,000 PVCs.

Too many PVCs may cause symptoms in some people, but it can also cause damage to the heart, leading to heart failure in a few people. That kind of heart damage is more common in people with longer “runs” of PVCs, which you apparently don’t have.

While there are medications to stop them, it’s not clear that doing so is a good idea. Old trials, using medication to stop PVCs around the time of a heart attack, showed that people were more likely to get dangerous rhythm disturbances if treated.

I reviewed the newer data and discussed with a colleague in electrophysiology, Dr. Gregg Shander. He, like other experts in the field, will not treat people who have no symptoms and no abnormalities in the structure or function of the heart by echocardiogram, but he would recommend a follow-up echo in six months to be sure there has been no deterioration in heart function. The beta blocker (metoprolol) you are on for high blood pressure is also one common treatment for PVCs. I don’t know of any reason to treat you further. Ask your cardiologist to explain the rationale.

Dear Dr. Roach: I’m 21 years old, and I have had trouble getting and maintaining erections since 2017. I don’t smoke or drink alcohol. What might be the possible cause?

I.A.

Erectile dysfunction is a common problem in older men, but it’s very uncommon in teenagers and young adults.

There are four major systems involved in erectile function. The heart and blood vessels need to be adequate, and while this is frequently a problem for older men with blockages, it would be rare but not impossible for a man your age.

The nerves to the penis need to be intact, and nerve damage from trauma could occasionally cause this problem. You would have known about a nerve problem after the trauma began.

Although it’s rare, I have had dedicated bicyclists note decreased erections after spending all day on the bike. The hormones of the body need to be in balance.

Low testosterone is a big issue and you should be checked, but high estrogens and prolactin also can cause ED.

Your doctor should consider testing all of these hormone levels. I’m glad you don’t smoke, but heavy cannabis use can lower testosterone enough to cause ED, even in young men.

Finally, the brain is called the primary sex organ in humans for good reason: Psychological or relationship issues can cause difficulty with erections. Most 21-year-olds are transitioning from their pediatrician or adolescent medicine specialist to an adult medicine doctor, but any GP should be able to evaluate what might be going on.

Many people experience cracking in the skin of the heel. Dry skin is the most common cause, and proper footwear, regular moisturizing and avoiding excess washing with harsh soaps and hot water all may help. If the problem continues, it is more likely an inflammatory condition like eczema than it is a fungal or bacterial infection. Making the proper diagnosis will help guide treatment, which may include steroid ointments or even glue to repair the cracking. A podiatrist or dermatologist would be a good first stop.

Dear Dr. Roach: My 80-year-old wife recently began to have tremors in her left leg while walking with her walker. After looking at MRIs of her back, her orthopedic doctor said everything looked OK and recommended she see a neurologist. Can a neurologist help?

B.R.

Tremor in one body area should indeed be evaluated by a neurologist. The list of possibilities is too long to summarize, but knowing that the tremor is restricted to one leg and only occurs with movement will help the neurologist start to narrow down the possibilities.

Once she has a diagnosis, then the neurologist can discuss the options for treatment.

Twenty-nine organizations have signed a letter expressing concern that the permission requested by the navy would amount to “high levels of harassment” of southern resident killers whales, of which there are only 72.

Deborah Giles, a research scientist at the University of Washington’s Center for Conservation Biology, said testing and training activities have the potential to disrupt the whales’ foraging, breeding, socializing and resting habits.

“When you’re talking about a population that is desperate for food and nourishment, any sort of disruption in foraging is something to take seriously,” Giles said, adding the whales could be forced to travel out of their habitats for food, which is already scarce.

Giles works for the non-profit Wild Orca, which has signed the letter, along with environmental groups such as Friends of the San Juans, Save Our Wild Salmon and Orca Network.

The letter, addressed to the permitting office of the National Marine Fisheries Service, states that potential harassment by Navy activities could affect the entire population of southern resident killer whales.

“Given the small size of the endangered southern resident orca population today, and the fact that they travel in groups, harm to a single individual orca can easily mean a population-level effect,” the letter says.

The U.S. Navy has had authorization for decades to conduct testing and training in the waters of the Pacific Northwest, including in the Strait of Juan de Fuca and Puget Sound. The current permit, which authorizes activities such as testing and training with sonar, firing torpedoes and dropping bombs from aircraft, expires in November.

John Mosher, an environmental planner for the navy, said applications to renew authorization generally include changes from previous years because of updated equipment and new systems. The navy is looking at expanding some activities, including the use of sonar, which can temporarily deafen orcas.

The navy’s proposal also projects that training and testing activities would result in 51 potential incidents per year that disturb a southern resident killer whale’s behaviour, up from two per year previously.

Mosher said the increase is due in part to an increased use of sonar, as well as a change in the understanding of where the whales spend their time.

Giles and others who signed the letter are concerned that any increase in disturbance to the whales could have a significant impact on the species’ survival.

“Increasing the navy’s testing and training activities at this time is counter to what the endangered southern resident orcas need to have a chance at recovery. Without bold and immediate actions, the southern residents are likely to go extinct. Everything we can do now to protect the southern resident orcas is critical,” they write.

The U.S. Navy is still consulting with the National Marine Fisheries Service and revising its application to renew authorization, and will continue to look at how to mitigate the impacts of naval activities on southern resident killer whales, Mosher said.

“The Navy has had a large presence in the Northwest for decades. We do not have any history of adverse impacts on the marine environment. So our protective measures have been effective over time, and I think we’ve demonstrated that we can be good stewards,” Mosher said.

A final environmental impact assessment is expected in the fall.

In today's Ministry of Health briefing, Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Réka Gustafson, B.C.'s deputy provincial health officer, reported 236 new cases in B.C. since last Friday, Those include:

100 new cases from Aug. 14 to 15

88 new cases from Aug. 15 to 16

48 new cases in the last 24 hours

There have been a total of 4,594 cases in British Columbia since the pandemic began. Of those, 1,419 cases have been in the Vancouver Coastal Health region. Currently, four people are hospitalized in B.C. with COVID-19, three of whom are in intensive care, and 3,653 people have fully recovered. There have been two new health-care facility outbreaks, including one at the Arbutus Care Centre in the VCH region. The outbreak at the Joseph and Rosalie Segal Family Health Centre has been declared over. In total, nine long-term care or assisted-living facilities and one acute-care facility have active outbreaks. There are no new community outbreaks, however there continue to be community exposure events, including in Vancouver Coastal Health, and on flights into and out of British Columbia. Check the Vancouver Coastal Health Public Exposures page for the locations and times of known possible exposures to COVID-19 to the public in our region.

Stay home if you're sick

Dr. Gustafson spoke about the ability of the virus to spread with very mild symptoms, especially for young adults. Many people may not even realize they have COVID-19 and inadvertently spread it to others; to friends, colleagues, family members or vulnerable people in the community. She issued a reminder: if you are informed by public health teams that you are a close contact, it is essential you stay home for the full 14-day self-isolation period. With the number of people in B.C. with COVID-19 today, we are at a time that we all need to be particularly alert to how we are feeling. You may feel well enough to see friends or go into work. However, if you are feeling ever so slightly unwell, stay home from work and gatherings. Our COVID-19 champions are the people who choose to stay home and stay away from others when feeling even the slightest bit sick. Making the choice to stay home is choosing to keep yourself and those around you safe.

Updated guidelines for masks in schools

Earlier today, the Ministry of Education announced updated health and safety guidelines to help ensure a consistent province-wide approach to keep schools safe for all students, teachers and staff during the COVID-19 pandemic. Under the guidelines, masks will be required for staff, middle and secondary students in high traffic areas such as buses and in common areas such as hallways, or anytime outside of their learning group whenever physical distancing cannot be maintained. Exceptions will be made for students who cannot wear masks for medical reasons. The guidelines also cover the key components of delivering K-12 education during the pandemic, including curriculum, report cards, supports for students with disabilities/diverse abilities, and finance and operations. In order to support staff and students to meet this expectation, the ministry is providing additional funding to school districts that will support the purchase of up to 1.5 million masks, enough for every public-school staff member and student to have at least two masks.

Limit contact

Only one healthy person should provide care.

Do not share personal items with the ill person, such as toothbrushes, towels, bed linen, utensils or electronic devices.

Use a separate bathroom from the ill person, if possible. If not possible, the ill person should put the toilet lid down before flushing.

Some people may transmit COVID-19 even though they do not show any symptoms. Wearing a mask, including a non-medical mask or face covering (i.e. made with at least two layers of tightly woven fabric, constructed to completely cover the nose and mouth without gaping, and secured to the head by ties or ear loops) can help protect others around you.

Prevent contact with animals, as there have been several reports of people transmitting COVID-19 to their pets.

Protect yourself

If possible, people who are at higher risk of serious illness from COVID-19 should not care for someone with COVID-19. These people include elderly persons, those with chronic medical conditions (e.g. heart disease, diabetes) or compromised immune systems.

If you need to be within 2 metres of the ill person, wear personal protective equipment: a medical mask disposable gloves eye protection

Wear disposable gloves when touching the ill person, their environment and soiled items or surfaces.

Avoid re-using medical masks or gloves.

Clean your hands often for at least 20 seconds, especially after contact with the ill person and after removing gloves, face masks and eye protection.

Dry your hands with disposable paper towels. If not available, use a reusable towel and replace it when it becomes wet.

You can also remove dirt with a wet wipe and then use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol.

Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.

Wearing masks Medical masks are recommended for COVID-19 patients in the home and for protection for those providing direct care to COVID-19 patients at home.

N95 respirators must be reserved for healthcare workers and should not be used for caregiving at home.

If medical masks are not available, non-medical masks or face coverings (i.e. constructed to completely cover the nose and mouth without gaping, and secured to the head by ties or ear loops) can be worn by the ill person, if tolerable. This will cover their mouth and nose, and may prevent respiratory droplets from contaminating others or landing on surfaces.

A non-medical mask or face covering may also be worn by those providing direct care to COVID-19 patients at home. However, wearing a non-medical mask or facial covering in the community has not been proven to protect the person wearing it.

Strict hygiene and public health measures, including frequent hand washing and maintaining a physical distance of at least 2 metres from the ill person, will reduce the chance of being exposed to the virus.

Non-medical cloth masks should be carefully removed when soiled or damp, laundered in hot water and then dried thoroughly.

Hands must be cleaned before and after putting on and removing a mask.

Keep your environment clean

Place used medical masks, gloves and other contaminated items in a lined container, secure the contents and dispose of them with other household waste.

Place possibly contaminated laundry, including non-medical cloth masks and facial coverings, into a container with a plastic liner and do not shake. Wash with regular laundry soap and hot water (60-90°C), and dry well. Clothing, linens and non-medical cloth masks and facial coverings belonging to the ill person can be washed with other laundry.

At least once daily, clean and disinfect surfaces that people touch often, such as toilets, laundry containers, bedside tables, doorknobs, phones and television remotes.

Use only approved hard-surface disinfectants that have a Drug Identification Number (DIN). A DIN is an 8-digit number given by Health Canada that confirms the disinfectant product is approved and safe for use in Canada.

When approved hard surface disinfectants are not available, for household disinfection, a diluted bleach solution can be prepared in accordance with the instructions on the label, or in a ratio of 5 millilitres (mL) of bleach per 250 mL of water OR 20 mL of bleach per litre of water. This ratio is based on bleach containing 5% sodium hypochlorite, to give a 0.1% sodium hypochlorite solution. Follow instructions for proper handling of household (chlorine) bleach.

If they can withstand the use of liquids for disinfection, high-touch electronic devices (e.g. keyboards, tablets, smartboards) may be disinfected with 70% alcohol (e.g. alcohol prep wipes) at least daily.

Monitor yourself for symptoms

If you have always used the recommended precautions, then monitor yourself for symptoms for 14 days following your last close contact with the ill person.

Quarantine (self-isolate) at home for 14 days from your last exposure and contact your local public health authority if you have no symptoms but: cared for a person who has COVID-19 without the recommended personal protective equipment live with or had close physical contact (e.g. intimate partner) without using the recommended personal protective equipment live with or have had regular close contact (within 2 metres) with a person who has COVID-19 up to 48 hours prior to symptom onset or while they were symptomatic and not isolating had direct contact with the body fluids of a person who has COVID-19 (e.g. were coughed or sneezed on) without the recommended personal protective equipment



If you start to develop symptoms, isolate yourself as quickly as possible and contact your local public health authority for further instructions.

Symptoms of COVID-19

Symptoms of COVID-19 can vary from person to person. Symptoms may also vary in different age groups. Some of the more commonly reported symptoms include:

new or worsening cough

shortness of breath or difficulty breathing

temperature equal to or over 38°C

feeling feverish

chills

fatigue or weakness

muscle or body aches

new loss of smell or taste

headache

gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting)

feeling very unwell



Children have been more commonly reported to have abdominal symptoms, and skin changes or rashes.

In severe cases, infection can lead to death.

Symptoms may take up to 14 days to appear after exposure to COVID-19.

Evidence indicates that the virus can be transmitted to others from someone who is infected but not showing symptoms. This includes people who:

have not yet developed symptoms (pre-symptomatic)

never develop symptoms (asymptomatic)

While experts know that these kinds of transmissions are happening among those in close contact or in close physical settings, it is not known to what extent. This means it is extremely important to follow the proven preventative measures.

If you or your child become ill

If you are showing symptoms of COVID-19, reduce your contact with others:

isolate yourself at home for 14 days to avoid spreading it to others if you live with others, stay in a separate room or keep a 2-metre distance

visit a health care professional or call your local public health authority for information on getting tested call ahead to tell them your symptoms and follow their instructions



Children who have mild COVID-19 symptoms are able to stay at home with a caregiver throughout their recovery without needing hospitalization. If you are caring for a child who has suspected or probable COVID-19, it is important to follow the advice for caregivers. This advice will help you protect yourself, others in your home, as well as others in the community.

If you become sick while travelling back to Canada:

inform the flight attendant or a Canadian border services officer

advise a Canada border services agent on arrival in Canada if you believe you were exposed to someone who was sick with COVID-19, even if you do not have symptoms this is required under the Quarantine Act the Canada border services agent will provide instructions for you to follow



Check if you have been exposed

Have you been on a recent flight, cruise or train? Check the listed exposure locations to see if you may have been exposed to COVID-19.

You can also join the effort to limit the spread of COVID-19 with Canada's free COVID Alert app. It notifies you if someone you were near in the past 14 days tells the app they tested positive. Download COVID Alert.

Take care of your mental health

The COVID-19 pandemic is new and unexpected. This situation can be unsettling and can cause a sense of loss of control. It is normal to feel sad, stressed, confused, scared or worried in a crisis. Make sure to care for your mental and physical wellbeing and to ask for help if you feel overwhelmed.

Getting tested

Since the signs and symptoms of COVID-19 can be absent, mild, severe or can look like the flu or other illnesses, the only way to confirm you have COVID-19 is through a laboratory test.

For information about COVID-19 testing in your area, contact your local public health authority.

If you have tested positive

If you've been tested for coronavirus and receive a positive test result, you must isolate at home, whether you have symptoms or not.

If you have symptoms (symptomatic), you must

isolate at home (as soon as your symptoms start), and remain isolated for 14 days or as directed by your public health authority

If you do not have symptoms (asymptomatic) you must:

isolate at home as soon as you receive the confirmed laboratory test, and remain isolated for 14 days or as directed by your public health authority

as directed by your public health authority if you did not have symptoms when you got tested, but then develop symptoms during your 14-day isolation period, you must restart your isolation time

Refer to your public health authority to find out how many days you should remain in isolation.

Treating coronavirus

Most people with mild coronavirus illness will recover on their own.

If you are concerned about your symptoms, you should self-monitor and consult your health care provider. They may recommend steps you can take to relieve symptoms.

Vaccine, therapeutics and medical devices

We do not yet have a vaccine to prevent COVID-19, but research and development are underway. Health Canada has introduced innovative and agile regulatory measures that will speed up the review of COVID-19 health products while still meeting standards for:

safety

quality

efficacy

Flu vaccine

If you have received a flu vaccine, it will not protect against coronaviruses, but will help prevent the flu. Getting the flu could make you more vulnerable to other infections.

Getting the flu vaccine will not increase your risk of illness from coronavirus. For more information, please refer to this recently published Canadian research study.

About coronaviruses

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness in people and others cause illness in animals. Human coronaviruses are common and are typically associated with mild illnesses, similar to the common cold.

COVID-19 is a new disease that has not been previously identified in humans. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people, and more rarely, these can then spread from person to person through close contact.

There have been 2 other specific coronaviruses that have spread from animals to humans and which have caused severe illness in humans. These are the:",908,0.7265536711172003,covid-19

Ardern said Auckland, the nation's largest city, will be moved to Alert Level 3 from midday Wednesday through midnight Friday, meaning that people will be asked to stay at home, while bars and many other businesses will be closed.

""These three days will give us time to assess the situation, gather information, make sure we have widespread contact tracing so we can find out more about how this case arose and make decisions about how to respond to it once we have further information,"" Ardern said at a hastily called news conference late Tuesday.

""I know that this information will be very difficult to receive,"" Ardern said. ""We had all hoped not to find ourselves in this position again. But we had also prepared for it. And as a team, we have also been here before.""

She said that travelling into Auckland will be banned unless people live there and are travelling home.

She said the rest of the country will be raised to Level 2 through Friday, meaning that mass gatherings will be limited to 100 attendees and people would need to socially distance themselves from each other.

Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield said the infections were confirmed after a person in their 50s went to their doctor on Monday with symptoms and was swabbed twice, testing positive both times. Six other people in the person's household were then tested, with three more positive results.

""Importantly, the person has no history of overseas travel,"" Bloomfield said, adding that the source of the infections remains unknown.

Until Tuesday, the only known cases of the virus in New Zealand were 22 travellers who had recently returned from abroad and were being held in quarantine at the border.

The country has been praised globally for its virus response.

New Zealand initially got rid of the virus by imposing a strict lockdown in late March when only about 100 people had tested positive for the disease. That stopped its spread.

Life had returned to normal for many people in the South Pacific nation of 5 million, as they attended rugby games at packed stadiums and sat down in bars and restaurants without fear of getting infected. But some had warned that the country had become complacent.

New Zealanders have never routinely worn masks, but authorities have been urging people to buy them just in case.

Back in June, provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry shared graphic models of what the COVID-19 virus would do in BC if our social interactions rose over 60 per cent. The steeply rising number of new cases now looks a lot like the 70 to 80 per cent models we were shown two months ago, and that isn’t good news.

article continues below

There are a lot of reasons why BC may be starting to lose its grip on pandemic control. Some point to young people, or alcohol, or summer barbecues; others cite the lack of mask wearing, people not staying home when sick or not bothering to keep social circles small. Some blame tourists. Some argue that stress and fatigue are making us complacent. All of these may be true to varying degrees.

Simply put, the biggest challenge in the pandemic response might just be human nature. We are social beings, and limiting our human connections has been extremely difficult. Maybe not surprisingly, our local COVID-19 survey found that feeling disconnected from family and friends was reported as the biggest negative impact of the pandemic, more than worry, health or finances.

It seems only natural, then, that we would feel fearful or angry or simply tired of the threat and precautions that separate us. Given all the harms of social restrictions, it is also natural we would resist and test these limits.

As the risk appeared to fade, at least temporarily, our leaders knew they needed to help promote a new balance of isolation versus connections and commerce. Only time will tell if we have collectively found that balance, but we do know we will need to adapt and make changes if we haven’t.

Thankfully, we know what to do if cases continue to rise. We’ve seen how much we can reduce the spread of this virus when we diligently practice physical distancing, stay home when sick and wash our hands. Additionally, we now know masks (when used properly) can reduce virus transmission in situations where distancing isn’t possible. Finally, critically, we can now do testing (and contact tracing if positive) for anyone with potential symptoms of COVID-19.

Truly, we have the tools we need to help us manage this virus until we have a vaccine or effective therapy (likely many months away), but it requires the majority of us to make changes to our daily routines and behaviours. We need not be perfect in our efforts, but the more intentional and consistent we are as individuals and communities, the less likely we will see widespread closures again.

While it may be in our natures to be social, it is also our nature to look out for one another. Local residents who answered our survey overwhelmingly reported that they worry more about their loved ones getting sick than they do about themselves. Sometimes we are motivated to change not for ourselves, but for those around us.

So here we are. Fall is going to bring unique challenges to navigate during the pandemic, such as school reopening, more indoor time and influenza season. As a city and region, and as health-care workers, we hope to meet these challenges with clarity, care and compassion. And we hope to meet them together.

Be calm, be safe, and be kind.

Also, party buses - now?","If you are wondering how party buses are still on Vancouver's streets in the middle of a pandemic, you are not alone.

Despite strict guidelines outlining the maximum allowable number of people in many stores, clubs, and restaurants, the rules are decidedly murky about how many people may occupy a vehicle.

article continues below

WorkSafeBC Media Spokesperson Ivy Yuen tells Vancouver Is Awesome in an email that guidance to employers in the transportation sector during the pandemic includes a hierarchy of controls.

""The first level of protection is physical distance, which may include occupancy limits or rearranging work spaces. If physical distancing is not possible, other levels of protection include installing barriers, such as Plexiglass, implementing rigorous cleaning and disinfecting practices, and personal protective equipment, such as masks,' writes Yuen.

That said, Yuen also notes that it is up to employers to assess the risks to workers and implement measures to prevent the transmission of COVID-19 in the workplace.

To assist employers with the COVID-19 Safety Plan, WorkSafeBC has developed safety protocols for the transportation sector during the pandemic. However, the agency notes that the nature of this sector can make it difficult to exercise adequate physical distancing, particularly in smaller vehicles. And while employers are expected to limit the number of customers, a party bus can hold as many as 35 people.

Some of the companies that V.I.A. reached out to said that they have 35 to 30 person party buses, but that they are reducing the number of passengers to ensure physical distancing. However, in some cases, as many as 25 people could still be booked on a 30 person bus. With the total number of passengers reduced by a mere five individuals, it is difficult to imagine that there could be adequate physical distance between bus occupants.

In addition, many party bus companies do not require that passengers wear masks.

For restaurants, WorkSafeBC guidelines clearly state that no more than six persons may occupy a table. When it comes to the transportation sector, there is no specific number. As such, the maximum number of allowable occupants for a given vehicle may vary significantly depending on what the employer feels is appropriate.

Here are some of things people are saying on social media about party buses operating in B.C. during the pandemic.

Thank you for being an intelligent person! People like you (& me) will help us all get through this pandemic by following Dr Henry's rules.

“We do know that younger people are very likely to have very mild illness,” said Henry.","While some people can develop severe illness from COVID-19, others may have impacts lasting weeks or months – even if they were never hospitalized, and had a “relatively mild illness.”

That’s according to Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.’s provincial health officer, who added that young people are telling of symptoms such as “fatigue – like difficulty even sitting up – profound fatigue that lasts for a long period of time.”

Meanwhile, for people who have pneumonias, longer-lasting symptoms have included difficulty breathing and shortness of breath that can “last for a long time,” she said, during Thursday's COVID-19 media briefing.

There’s also a sub-group of people, more likely men than women – although Henry said the reasons for this aren’t completely understood – who have increased clotting in their blood which can lead to clotting of the arteries around the heart as well as heart attacks, challenges with brain injury or pulmonary embolism.

Some of those effects can happen “weeks later,” said Henry.

Young teenagers and young adults also aren't immune to longer-term impacts. There's a post-viral syndrome – seen in this demographic around the world – that can cause inflammation of the blood vessels, she said.

According to the U.S. Centres for Disease Control (CDC), MIS-C syndrome is a condition where body parts – such as the heart, lungs, kidneys, skin, eyes or gastrointestinal organs – can become inflamed.

The CDC notes that the syndrome has been seen in children.

While B.C. hasn’t yet seen any positive cases of MIS-C syndrome, Henry said health officials have been watching for it.

“So we are learning more, and we are learning that there can be long-term impacts that can be quite severe even for young people, that last – we only have months to go (by) right now – but that have lasted for many weeks and months for some people,” she said.

No evidence of virus mutation

Henry said there’s no evidence that the virus has mutated in B.C., although that’s something that has been seen in other places.

And when it does mutate, it does so “relatively slowly” compared to other viruses like influenza, which change rapidly.

“There’s a couple of reasons why that’s important,” said Henry. “It means that immunity is likely to last for a longer period of time. It also means that the chances of a vaccine being effective for a longer period of time, and in a broader population, is slightly more likely. So that (mutation) is something we watch really, really carefully.”

Virus is ‘quite stealthy’

While young people are more likely to have milder symptoms of COVID-19, some older patients in long-term care have also shown little to no symptoms at all, according to B.C.’s top doctor.

“We do know that younger people are very likely to have very mild illness,” said Henry.

“Having said that, we also found a very similar thing in elderly people, particularly our elders in long-term care – that sometimes they have very little to no symptoms at all, mostly things like fatigue, or they may not have had a fever, for example.

“So this virus has proven to be quite stealthy in that way, and that makes it a challenge for us. That’s why it’s so important that we reduce our potential for getting exposed in the first place.”

She also stressed the importance of getting tested, as people may not recognize they have symptoms of the virus.

“That’s why we’re saying, (any symptoms), go get tested, particularly if you’ve been at one of the exposure events, and people know who they are,” said Henry, adding that the province has done over 3,800 tests in the last 24 hours.

Some of those tests were people who tested positive Thursday.

The plan was for the national app to roll out first in Ontario, while the prime minister signalled B.C. would follow soon after as an early partner in the venture.

Two months after that announcement, the national COVID Alert app has not been deployed beyond Ontario’s borders, although Canadians are free to download it regardless of their location (CBC reports it’s been downloaded 1.9 million times).

And instead of next hitting the West Coast as originally appeared to be the case, the Atlantic provinces will be the next to adopt it, while Alberta has confirmed it’s shifting from its own app to the national app.

“I’m very much surprised and at the same time puzzled,” said Mimik Technology Inc. CEO Fay Arjomandi.

She addressed a House of Commons standing committee May 21 to brief parliamentarians on the Vancouver company’s own contact-tracing app, Pandimik.

The federal government ultimately opted for an app developed in collaboration between the Canadian Digital Service, the Government of Ontario, BlackBerry Ltd. and Shopify Inc.

But Arjomandi told BIV she made it clear to those in the federal government her company’s contact-tracing would be ready to roll out much sooner, hence her surprise by how long it took for Ontario to launch the app.

She said the made-in-B.C. app has been enjoying quick adoption by enterprise clients eager to get employees back into workplace quickly while keeping their data secure and private.

But Arjomandi said privacy concerns remain over the COVID Alert app, such as issues in which users find themselves redirected from the app to a web portal to submit personal data.

B.C. provincial health officer Bonnie Henry told reporters she’s not sure when the app will make its debut on the West Coast while it still undergoes some “tweaking” in Ontario.

“We are supportive of having a single app in Canada,” she said, describing contact tracing as the “bread and butter” of public health.

“We’ve been working with them on how we can tailor it to be a tool that supports the work that we’re doing in contact tracing.”

But Henry said individuals on the ground – those that can talk to potential COVID-19 patients about their risks and steps they need to take next – remain the best resources for contact tracing.

“There’s no electronic magic bullet that can take that away,” she said.

“We’re hopeful it will be something we’ll be able to use to supplement and support our contact tracing.”

Earlier this week the province announced it was hiring 500 temporary contact tracers to work within individual health regions.

If a user tests positive for COVID-19, a health-care professional helps the patient anonymously upload their status on the COVID Alert app. The app will then alert other users who’ve been in close contact with the COVID-19-positive patient.

No personal information is ever shared and no location services information is collected.

Trudeau said the federal government consulted with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada, and has insisted the app itself would not share any identifiers such as a phone number or address.

Instead, the app generates a randomized code used for alerts.

The code is stored in what the prime minister described as a secure national database.

The Pandimik app used by enterprise clients tracks and logs the proximity of individuals’ devices to one another.

If an app user discovers they’ve tested positive for COVID-19, they’re able to alert other app users with whom they’ve shared close contact via an alert that would appear on those other devices.

Mimik does not report the location of users to third parties and it does not retain users’ personal information.

Instead, the company uses edge-computing technology to ensure all data remains on the users’ respective devices.

Arjomandi said adoption, anonymity and adaptability will be the key to any contact-tracing app’s success in Canada, adding that a national app’s effectiveness will likely require at least half the general public to download it.

The app will also need to be able to interact with multiple health care partners across the provinces while maintaining data security, she said.

“I don’t have a crystal ball,” Arjomandi said, referring to a potential successful deployment in B.C.

“Time will tell but they [federal government] already made indications – it’s the end of August and we don’t have it anywhere else. It’s Ontario only.”",734,0.9685649208518815,covid-19

She was tested for COVID-19 on the Wednesday, less than a week after the exposure.

Former Powell River resident Kendyl Oele, a 26-year-old personal trainer who now lives in Calgary, became seriously ill after contracting COVID-19 at a spin class in July.

“It’s not a far-off issue,” said Oele. “It’s happening and it’s happening in your own backyard. If I can be that resource for people to understand, I’m so happy to do that.”

On a Friday in early July, Oele attended an early morning spin class in an underground studio in Calgary. She said she has been very aware of COVID-19 previous to when she became ill. She had gone to that particular spin studio a handful of times before she became ill and felt “pretty safe” at the facility.

“On that particular day that I did contract it, there was a fan there that had not been there previous to that and the fan did make me feel a little uncomfortable,” said Oele. “I just happened to be on the bike near the fan.”

She said when she was at the class, she was with a group of people who are highly physically active and in tip-top shape.

“You wouldn’t be able to go to the class if you were not so, so I kind of thought I was in a population that would be healthy,” said Oele. “I was assuming risk but I thought the risk was quite low. Unfortunately, that wasn’t the case.”

Oele said the onset of her symptoms was quite sudden. She said most of the doctors she spoke with couldn’t believe they manifested themselves so quickly. The theory is because she was close to the fan, the viral load she was subjected to was quite high.

While the spin participants were physically distanced, and it was clean, unfortunately that day, there was a fan, and Oele wishes in hindsight that she had walked away.

She said she began to feel the effects of COVID-19 about three days after her exposure. She was notified by the spin studio on the Monday afternoon following the class that there had been a COVID-19 exposure, and by Monday evening, she was feeling “a little bit off.” She went into isolation that night. She was tested for COVID-19 on the Wednesday, less than a week after the exposure.

By the time she was tested, she was having trouble breathing. She called Alberta Health Services and was advised she needed to go to emergency, so she went straight to the hospital after calling 811. She was tested at emergency and it took fewer than 24 hours before she heard a positive diagnosis.

Her boyfriend also was tested, but his results came back negative.

While Oele was sitting in emergency, she said she was not fighting for breath but she had a feeling of heaviness in her chest. She said when speaking, she would be taking in a deep breath after each sentence. She said that was the only symptom she had up until that time, other than a runny nose.

While waiting for her COVID-19 test, Oele said she was rocked with a fever, chills and a headache.

“When I came home, I pretty much just fell asleep and then I was sleeping all day Thursday,” said Oele. “I pretty much knew that I had it. There was no thought in my mind that I randomly picked up a sickness. When Alberta Health Services called me and told me that I tested positive, I had kind of come to terms with the fact that I had COVID-19.”

Oele said her thinking was that she was in a demographic where she would be okay, so she was preparing for the worst but expecting the best.

“I’m very lucky that was the case,” she said. “When they told me I was positive I felt scared but also prepared.”

Oele didn’t expect her isolation to be so strict. She said she is very fortunate in that she has a bedroom with an en suite attached, so she did not leave her 200-square-foot space for the full length of the quarantine.

“I was stuck in the bedroom and the only time the door was opened was for food,” said Oele. “When it was open I had to wear a mask and anything was allowed to come in, but nothing was allowed to leave, so I had garbage bags that I had sealed with my plastic cutlery and paper plates.”

Contracting COVID-19 turned Oele’s life upside down. She said the worst period was the Thursday and Friday after exposure.

“My fever was constant,” she said. “I’ve had bad flus in the past but I genuinely felt like I’d been in a car accident. It took everything out of me to just stand up and go to the bathroom. I was sleeping about 16 hours a day and the only thing that would wake me up was when my Advil wore off. I would have such a severe headache.”

On the following Saturday, just a little more than a week after exposure, she began to feel better, but the breathing difficulty intensified. She said she was so fortunate that she never got to the point where she was actually gasping for air. Breathing was laboured, although it never hurt. Oele said it felt like something was pushing on her chest.

She said going from being so physically fit to not being able to stand for more than five minutes was shocking and made breathing so much harder.

Recovery is a slow process and Oele, more than a month later, is still dealing with a lot of after-effects. She’s been out of quarantine almost three weeks nowand feels about 80 per cent. Oele said her taste receptors are pretty much gone, as is her sense of smell. She still has trouble taking long walks with her dog, and with any uphill or stairs, she has to take breaks.

Oele said health professionals are currently monitoring her for blood clots and it’s possible her heart could become enlarged as well. She said the odds are quite low, given her demographic, and she will be getting checked out to make sure she’s okay physically.

“The point I really want to get across is that I, in a demographic where, if I get COVID-19, I am expected to be fine,” said Oele. “It’s supposed to be a bad flu and we come out of it completely fine. That has not been my experience. I would not wish this on anybody.

“I’m continuing to struggle and if I’m being honest, I don’t see an end in sight for my struggles in the near future. I think I’m going to be dealing with this for some time and I want that known. It’s a life-changing event.”",1112,0.9119173560961275,covid-19

The country’s collective reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic may have something to do with these numbers, as our medical services have been tested like never before.

The fact that Canadians are proud of the health-care system does not mean that we do not see opportunities for improvement. This month, we asked Canadians about their overall impressions and saw some numbers tending in a positive direction.

In January 2019, one in four Canadians (25%) thought Canada’s health-care system worked well and called for minor changes to make it work better. This month, three in 10 Canadians (30%) share this feeling. In British Columbia, the number of residents who agreed with this point of view increased from 30% in 2019 to 35% now.

There is a sizable gender gap when it comes to having near total satisfaction with the health-care system. While 36% of men in Canada feel this way, the proportion falls to 24% among women.

As was the case last year, the bulk of responses (55%) point to Canada’s health-care system having some good things but requiring many changes. Only 9% of Canadians articulate the notion that the health-care system has so much wrong with it that we need to completely rebuild it – including 20% in Atlantic Canada.

The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a greater appreciation of health-care workers, and Canada has been immune to the equipment shortages that are plaguing other nations. Across the country, three in four Canadians (76%) expressed confidence that the health-care system would be there to provide help and assistance if they had to face an unexpected medical condition. While this represents a three-point drop since January 2019, maintaining this level of assurance in the middle of a pandemic is eye-catching.

There is some fluctuation when Canadians ponder the biggest problems facing the health-care system. Just under a third (31%, down two points since January 2019) point the finger at long wait times. A shortage of doctors and nurses is second on the list with 26%, up eight points and outlining the desperation of Canadians who have endured the retirement or relocation of their family physician.

There is a silver lining on the issue of bureaucracy and poor management, which dropped from 24% last year to 13% in 2020. Fewer Canadians express concerns over inadequate resources and facilities (8%), a lack of focus on preventive care (6%), a lack of a wider range of services for patients (also 6%) and insufficient standards of hygiene (3%).

Not all Canadian provinces react the same when it comes to the challenges the health-care system faces. Quebecers and Ontarians are more likely to cringe at long wait times. British Columbians are torn between delays in delivery and finding a doctor. Alberta has the highest proportion of residents (20%) who blame bureaucracy and poor management, although that is down significantly from what we found in 2019 (33%).

A crisis is palpable in Atlantic Canada, where a shocking 46% of residents say a shortage of doctors and nurses is the main problem. This might explain why one in five residents of these provinces want to completely rebuild the health-care system.

At a time when our focus is starting to shift about how to pay for the assistance that the federal government has authorized for Canadians struggling because of the pandemic, there is little appetite for a reduction in medical expenditures. Three in four Canadians (75%) reject the federal government making cuts to health-care funding to reduce government debt.

We also continue to see few Canadians believing that medical services would be superior under a different framework. Across the country, just 30% of Canadians think health care in Canada would be better than it is now if it were run by the private sector.

Canadians aged 55 and over are less likely to endorse a move towards privatization (22%) than those aged 35 to 54 (29%) and those aged 18 to 34 (37%). The flirtation with a private system is also bigger in Eastern Canada (39% in Quebec, 30% in Ontario and 29% in the Atlantic provinces) than in Western Canada (24% in British Columbia, Manitoba and Saskatchewan and 23% in Alberta).

While some countries around the world have seen their health-care systems exposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the way Canadians feel about medical services in the country did not go through an overwhelming shift. The desperation from Canadians who are awaiting a meeting with a specialist remains, but fewer than one third believe our health-care delivery should echo what most Americans have. •

COVID-19: THE NATIONAL PICTURE

Education: With back-to-school season coming up in a few weeks, big questions remain about how online learning will work for elementary students and their parents. To take part, many young children may need a parent or caregiver to serve as a learning coach, which isn’t an option for many families, distance-education expert Michael Barbour of Touro University California told The Globe.

Economy: When the Canada Emergency Response Benefit runs out this fall, economists warn that it could chill consumer spending and complicate Canada’s economic recovery, The Globe and Mail’s Matt Lundy explains. The federal government is trying to ease the post-CERB shock with expanded employment insurance and a “parallel benefit” for contract workers and others who don’t qualify for EI.

South Korea has been one of the world’s coronavirus mitigation success stories but it has suffered repeated spikes. So far, 306 Koreans have died of COVID-19. United States: Clusters linked to student housing and off-campus parties have raised alarms at U.S. universities resuming their fall semesters, including the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, which is switching to remote learning on Wednesday to contain the virus.

Essential resources

COVID-19, or the novel coronavirus, has killed thousands of people around the world since early this year. Later in this guide, you’ll see an overview of how the world is mobilizing to stop its spread and save lives, but first, here are some essential links answering key questions about how all Canadians can help. We have a daily coronavirus newsletter.

Watch: How can you stop the spread of coronavirus in your community? The Globe offers pointers on hygiene and physical distancing.

What we know so far about the disease

Symptoms

The new illness that emerged last December in China – officially called COVID-19, previously known as 2019-nCoV – is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. Corona means “crown” or “halo” in Latin, describing the viruses’ typical shape when seen under an electron microscope. The common cold is a type of coronaviral illness, but it tends to cause nasal congestion, which COVID-19 doesn’t always do. COVID-19′s symptoms (dry coughing, fever and aches) resemble more serious and dangerous coronaviruses, like SARS and MERS. Initially the symptoms can also look like flu, which is caused by a different virus type, but don’t let the similarity fool you: COVID-19 is far more dangerous (more on that below).

Human coronaviruses most commonly spread from an infected person to others through: The air by coughing and sneezing Close personal contact, such as touching or shaking hands Touching the eyes, nose or mouth after touching an infected surface Rarely, fecal contamination WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS OF THE VIRUS? Headache Dry cough Fever In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death SOME FACTS ABOUT THE VIRUS Belongs to large family of viruses that cause illnesses ranging from common cold to more severe diseases such as MERS and SARS Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people There are no specific treatments for coronaviruses, but symptoms can be treated MURAT YÜKSELIR / THE GLOBE AND MAIL, SOURCE: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Health Canada, WHO Human coronaviruses most commonly spread from an infected person to others through: The air by coughing and sneezing Close personal contact, such as touching or shaking hands Touching the eyes, nose or mouth after touching an infected surface Rarely, fecal contamination WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS OF THE VIRUS?

How COVID-19 CAN KILL YOU

COVID-19′s death rate varies considerably from country to country and among age groups, but even conservative estimates put it tens of times higher than seasonal influenza (0.1 per cent), though generally lower than SARS (10 per cent). The graphics below offer a step-by-step explanation of COVID-19′s lethal effects on the body in severe cases.

VIRUS The virus enters the lungs and attaches itself to cells which make up the lungs’ protective lining. CELLS RNA RECEPTOR VIRUS Once attached to a cell’s receptor, the virus injects its RNA into the cell, providing it with the blueprint to build copies of the virus. IMMUNE CELL INFECTED DEAD The infected cell eventually self-destructs, releasing the virus to infect neighbouring cells. Exponential growth in infected cells triggers an excessive response by the immune system. Immune cells sent to fight the virus begin to destroy both infected and healthy cells. ALVEOLI BACTERIA BACTERIAL INFECTION If enough of the protective lining is destroyed, it leaves the alveoli – the tiny air sacs via which breathing occurs – vulnerable to bacterial infection. This can lead to severe respiratory problems, making mechanical ventilation necessary to help the patient survive. The immune system can become overwhelmed while the bacteria multiply. If bacteria enter the blood, they can overrun the body and cause death.

Transmission

Though SARS had a higher death rate than COVID-19, it infected and killed far fewer people (8,098 infections and 774 deaths worldwide, according to the U.S. CDC’s estimates). One possible reason for this is that unlike SARS, whose carriers generally knew they were sick, the new coronavirus is transmissible before symptoms develop. On average, it takes about five days for people infected with COVID-19 to show symptoms, according to a U.S.-based team’s estimates published in the Annals of Internal Medicine. SARS’s incubation period was longer, about 10 days.

Testing

Health officials in Canada and other countries have a test to make sure whether a patient has COVID-19 or some other illness. Depending on where you live in Canada, these may be available either at dedicated clinics or in at-home visits from health officials. If you start showing the symptoms of COVID-19, contact your local health authority or family doctor and do as they advise.

Physical distancing

Various governments have introduced new limits on public assembly and events since the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic in mid-March.

Public gatherings: Provincial governments have used state-of-emergency powers to limit public assemblies to just a few people, and will use fines or other penalties to enforce that. Check our guide of the rules by province and territory to see what it’s like near you.

Essential businesses: Most provinces issued lists of businesses deemed “essential” and barred others from operating, except as work-from-home or e-commerce operations. Since June, a lot of the closed businesses have reopened under stricter rules for physical distancing.

Schools: Most provincial governments have closed their K-12 public school systems, though Quebec’s and B.C.‘s have reopened in limited form. High schools, junior colleges and universities have moved to e-learning and many are not planning to reopen until September.

Travel restrictions

International travel: The United States and Canada suspended non-essential border traffic, except for essential supply chains, on March 20. Canada had already barred most non-American foreign nationals from entering and restricted international air travel to the airports in Vancouver, Calgary, Toronto and Montreal. Canadians abroad are urged to come home and self-isolate for 14 days, but only if they’re asymptomatic: Airlines will refuse passage to anyone showing COVID-19 symptoms.

Interprovincial and intercity travel: Getting on a train, plane or bus has been an increasingly complicated process across Canada, and masks may be mandatory if you’re using one of those. Some provinces and territories closed their borders, and have reopened them only selectively, such as the “Atlantic bubble” that will allow free movement among Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick starting July 3.

Federal economic relief

Since mid-March, the Trudeau government’s stimulus measures have grown to tens of billions worth of direct supports and tax deferrals, which Ottawa has continued to add to or extend. The measures include:

Canada Emergency Relief Benefit: A $2,000-a-month, 16-week emergency benefit to pay workers whose income drops to zero, even if they have been furloughed by employers but technically still have jobs.

Businesses of any size, including charities and non-profits, are eligible if they can show a 30-per-cent revenue drop or more.

The shifting epicentres

Since the virus emerged last year, three countries – China, then Italy, then the United States – have taken turns as the most infected ones on the planet. Here’s how their governments have responded.

China

Last December, authorities in Hubei province initially dismissed warnings of a new virus, and even punished the Wuhan ophthalmologist who tried to sound the alarm. But within weeks, when the outbreak was spreading fast, China put millions of people in Wuhan and its environs under near-total quarantine, just as the Lunar New Year travel season was getting under way. Chinese lawmakers also banned the trade and consumption of wild animal meat, the suspected source of the virus. As the quarantines brought China’s economy to a standstill, local governments faced conflicting demands to bring people back to work but still prevent the spread of COVID-19. In March, after the number of new Chinese cases levelled off, travel restrictions began to lift. Since then, China’s focus has been on preventing the reintroduction of COVID-19 from other countries, leading in some cases to discrimination and violence against foreigners.

Italy

COVID-19 hit northern Italy’s Lombardy region fast and hard in February after hospital staff failed to isolate a super-carrier who visited them several times. Soon, Italy had hundreds of cases, then thousands, and many countries across Europe and Africa traced their first COVID-19 cases back to the Italian epidemic. After local quarantines and the closing of schools and universities failed to stop the virus’s spread, by early March, the Italian government put Lombardy under a total lockdown – measures that were soon extended nationwide, affecting 62 million Italians. The quarantine required most Italians to stay home, prohibited public assembly and non-essential travel and closed pools, theatres and sporting events. Additional measures announced on March 11 also closed all stores except groceries and pharmacies. Soon, Spain, France and the Czech Republic instituted Italian-style quarantine measures. Italy’s lockdown began to ease in May, and since June travel within Europe has slowly reopened.

United States

Through February and early March, U.S. President Donald Trump, who is up for re-election later this year, generally told Americans that they were not at great risk from COVID-19 and economic activities should go on as normal. He also contradicted public health officials on everything from the virus’s fatality rate to the risks posed by workers who come in sick. Meanwhile, U.S. health officials performed far fewer tests than other jurisdictions, including Canada. Under mounting pressure to act, Mr. Trump declared a national state of emergency in mid-March and prodded Congress to pass three relief packages worth trillions of dollars. But by the end of April, when his home state of New York remained the worst-affected in the country, Mr. Trump allowed federal lockdown recommendations to lapse. Since then, he and his supporters put state governments under mounting pressure to reopen quickly, even as cases began to surge again in June thanks to new outbreaks in different states.

How do I ‘flatten the curve’?

When diseases reach uninfected populations, a graph of the new infections will generally follow a curve: Infections rise, then peak, then fall. You’ll see a lot of officials talk about “flattening the curve,” or preventing the peak infections from exceeding their health systems’ ability to handle them. A big part of this is physical distancing: Avoiding public gatherings, staying home from work or school and changing social habits, like waving instead of shaking hands. If front-line health workers are spared from a sudden and overwhelming increase in new cases, lives will be saved. And when the pandemic is over, those workers will be better-equipped to act once there’s a vaccine available for the new disease, like the one researchers are racing to develop for COVID-19.

HOW TO ISOLATE AT HOME WHEN YOU HAVE COVID-19 Isolation means staying at home when you are sick with COVID-19 and avoiding contact with other people to help prevent the spread of disease to others in your home and your community. If you have been diagnosed with COVID-19, it is expected that you take the following measures. AVOID CONTAMINATING COMMON ITEMS AND SURFACES At least once daily, clean and disinfect surfaces that you touch often, like toilets, bedside tables, doorknobs, phones and television remotes. Do not share personal items with others, such as toothbrushes, towels, bed linen, utensils or electronic devices. CARE FOR YOURSELF Monitor your symptoms as directed by your health-care provider or Public Health Authority. If your symptoms get worse, immediately contact your health-care provider or Public Health Authority and follow their instructions. LIMIT CONTACT WITH OTHERS Do not leave home unless absolutely necessary, such as to seek medical care. Do not go to school, work, other public areas or use public transportation (e.g. buses, taxis). Arrange to have groceries and supplies dropped off at your door to minimize contact. KEEP YOUR HANDS CLEAN Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, and dry with disposable paper towels or dry reusable towel, replacing it when it becomes wet.

Jean Robert Ngola Monzinga became the subject of public outrage in May when Premier Blaine Higgs said an “irresponsible” medical professional brought the coronavirus into the small community of Campbellton. The doctor’s identity soon leaked on social media.

The outbreak has caused two deaths and dozens of infections. Dr. Ngola has denied being its source.

On July 8, the RCMP served Dr. Ngola with a notice to appear in court on Oct. 26 to face a charge of failing to comply with an order under the province’s Emergency Measures Act, which the Premier invoked in March to combat the pandemic.

The doctor’s lawyer, Joel Etienne, confirmed on Monday that he had received the notice, and said Dr. Ngola is innocent. He also noted that the charge is not criminal but “regulatory” and closer in nature to a “traffic ticket.”

“Jean Robert is not patient zero, Jean Robert did not do anything illegal, Jean Robert did not break any provincial legislation,” Mr. Etienne said. “Jean Robert should not have been singled out and scapegoated.”

The controversy stems from a trip to Quebec that Dr. Ngola took during the week of May 10. The family physician had to pick up his daughter from a Montreal suburb when her mother left the country for a family emergency. On his return trip, he stopped in the city of Trois-Rivières to meet with two fellow doctors about future work in the province.

When he returned to New Brunswick, he did not self-isolate but returned to work at the Campbellton Regional Hospital the next day, out of a sense of obligation to his patients, he said in a June interview. He later tested positive for COVID-19, as did at least one of his patients.

Provincial policy requires health care workers who live and work in New Brunswick to self-isolate for 14 days if they return from outside of the province. There are exceptions for those who live across the border in Quebec and, in some cases, for health professionals coming from outside the province to work temporarily in New Brunswick.

Mr. Etienne argued that because health workers entering the province with no quarantine was routine at the time, Dr. Ngola did nothing wrong.

“He fell within the ambit of the law, he followed the protocols that were in place, and he was diligent in every step that he took,” Mr. Etienne said.

Dr. Ngola has said that the accusation “destroyed” his life amid threats to his safety and racial abuse. He is now working as a doctor in a small town in Quebec.

Kei Nishikori, the 2014 U.S. Open runner-up, tested positive for COVID-19 on Sunday and said he will pull out of the tune-up tournament at Flushing Meadows that starts next week.

Nishikori posted what he called “some unfortunate news” on his mobile app.

While he is withdrawing from the Western & Southern Open – a hard-court event usually held in Cincinnati but moved this year to the U.S. Open site in New York because of the coronavirus pandemic – he did not say what his plans are for the Grand Slam tournament that begins Aug. 31.

Canada needs the public health equivalent of Own the Podium.

At the Montreal Olympics in 1976, Canada became the first host nation to fail to win a gold medal. It repeated the feat 12 years later, in Calgary. After that, the country’s amateur sports program took a hard look at itself. A generation later, in Vancouver in 2010, Canadian athletes won 14 gold medals – a record for most first-place finishes, ever, by any country at a Winter Olympics.

Canada today has to shoot for something similar, only on a much more important field.

Round 2 against COVID-19 begins now. Canada’s goal for the coming months should be to make this country the world leader at returning to a high level of economic activity, while maintaining a low level of COVID-19. Getting Canada back on its feet, while keeping the pandemic on the floor, will not be easy, but it is possible. A new study published this week in the Canadian Medical Association Journal suggests how.

Researchers with the Public Health Agency of Canada modelled four different “interventions” aimed at preventing new waves of infections. They concluded that, if Canadians continue to practise prudent physical distancing, and if governments simultaneously up their game on testing and contact tracing, it should be possible to keep infection levels low.

Studies like these are always to some extent guesstimates, since what is being modelled – millions of people having billions of interactions – is so exceptionally complex. What’s more, as the researchers note, “key epidemiologic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 remain unknown.”

Nevertheless, based on what is known, the researchers estimate that if Canada were to do nothing, 64.6 per cent of Canadians would become infected with COVID-19 over the next year and a half. If Canadians continue to practise physical distancing to the same degree as today, and if governments continue to test, contract trace and isolate cases with the same degree of success as now, then the spread of the virus’ will be reduced, but only slightly.

However, the study says that, if governments up their game, the expected infection rate will plummet.

Canadian public health authorities currently detect and isolate only 20 per cent of people infected with COVID-19, according to the researchers, and are only able to track down 50 per cent of those people they came into contact with. That’s because many infected people have mild symptoms or none, and they consequently never know that they are infected. Our testing and contact-tracing systems are only seeing – and quarantining – the tip of the iceberg.

But what if they saw more? The study estimated what would happen if public health authorities were able to consistently identify 50 per cent of the infected, and track down 100 per cent of their contacts. With “enhanced case detection and contact tracing,” the expected infection rate would fall to just 0.4 per cent of Canadians.

And if better gumshoe sleuthing by public-health authorities were paired with millions of individual Canadians continuing to practise physical distancing, the projected infection rate falls to just 0.2 per cent.

Again, this is just a model; these predictions come with no money-back guarantees. Nevertheless, they represent a reasonable take on the current state of an evolving understanding of how best to prevent the spread of this virus.

The study suggests that Canadians must still do their part, by keeping their distance, wearing masks (the impact of which is not considered by this study), and not getting together in large groups.

But beyond that, returning life to something close to normal, without reinvigorating the virus, is up to governments. They’ve got to make the right choices, and among those is devoting sufficient money, intelligence and obsessive attention to detail to enhancing the nation’s capacity for testing and contact tracing.

If public-health authorities do not up their game, by finding and isolating a much higher share of future COVID-19 cases and contacts, then the study suggests that the health of the economy, and of Canadians, will again be in jeopardy.

Unless and until there is a vaccine, beating COVID-19 will not be about one big thing. It will be about many little things, diligently repeated, millions of times.
