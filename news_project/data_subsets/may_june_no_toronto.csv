""Initially, the owlets would only stick their head out of the nest for a short while before crawling back into the nest,"" Lavoie told CTV News Vancouver.

""They're very well camouflaged with Mom always standing guard while the dad searched for food but also stood guard on a nearby tree watching for predators like the eagle who would love to whisk away an owlet or two for a quick snack.""

Soon, the owlets were ready to emerge from the nest and stretch their wings, Lavoie said. The father owl would start hooting, a signal to the young owls it was relatively safe to come out of their nest. First, they would fly just a short distance, with Mom by their side. A few weeks later, Lavoie observed them flying to a tree a bit farther away.

""The owlets stuck together, always flying to the same tree as one another,"" Lavoie said. ""They often snuggled up to one another, possibly to stay warm and safe.""

As the owlets have practised flying, they've also learned to hunt, he said.

""A fellow photographer has actually seen a male owl drop a rat in the field so the owlet can swoop in and learn to pick it up,"" Lavoie said.

A thrill for Lavoie was the chance to get an elusive shot of the male adult owl carrying a dead rat in its beak, preparing to share the tasty morsel with the owlets.

Every May the Crime Writers of Canada name their Arthur Ellis Award Winners for excellence in Canadian crime writing.

Those awards were announced Thursday night in Toronto. Although COVID-19 concerns caused the cancellation of the normal awards gala, the winners were no less honoured.

The best crime novel award was won by Michael Christie for his novel Greenwood. His story is told in the future and the past, and reveals a tragedy that bonds two boys over the course of time. It is a family story that grows over time to include omissions, half-truths and outright lies. This is not the only honour secured by Greenwood; it was also long listed for the prestigious Scotiabank Giller Prize last fall.

The best crime first novel award went to Philip Elliott for Nobody Move, a hard-boiled crime story set - where else - but Los Angeles. A debt collection turned double murder fuels the plot that draws in the debt collector, his mob boss employer, an ex-assassin, the femme fatale, and of course, police.

Author Robin Harlick served as one of the judges this year and praises the quality of the work submitted.

She says “For the most part the entries were well-written with good story telling and engaging characters.”

In fact, she says there are more Canadian crime writers out there than she realized, “many of which would stand up to the best in British or American crime writing, a standard often used by avid crime fiction readers.”

Harlick was also pleased to see that many of authors set their books here in Canada.

In a genre where location is often a character in its own right, she says there is persistent pressure from international publishers to “set crime fiction anywhere else other than Canada.”

Other winners included: best crime novella, won by Wayne Arthurson for The Red Chesterfield. Arthurson’s award was sponsored by Mystery Weekly, an online monthly journal of short crime fiction based in London, Ont.

The best crime short story was won by Peter Sellers for Closing Doors.

The best French crime book honour went to Andree A. Michaud for Tempetes.

The best juvenile or young adult crime book went to Keep This to Yourself by Tom Ryan.

The best nonfiction crime book was won by Charlotte Gray for Murdered Midas: A Millionaire, His Gold Mine, and a Strange Death on an Island Paradise.

And the Unhanged Arthur award for an unpublished manuscript wen to The Dieppe Letters by Liz Rachel Walker.

The pandemic may have eliminated the annual Arthur Ellis gala, but some of the winners are doubtless conducting their own physically distanced celebrations.

And being writers, they may be considering this odd circumstance for future plot lines.",[]

It’s been seven years since Marilyn Reid last saw and spoke to her husband John. It was in February of 2013 that he was brought to Victoria Hospital via ambulance, suicidal and in crisis.

“When we got him there I was very relieved and I thought he was safe and in good hands.”

John, a veteran of the Canadian Armed Forces suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and was having suicidal thoughts.

“He was in the hospital in crisis and was there a week in crisis and then was released, but nobody contacted me to tell me that he was leaving the hospital. I was actually in shock.”

Reid says she received a phone call from the hospital, one that forever changed her life.

“The only phone call I got from them was to tell me that he was deceased and that he died on hospital grounds. He took his life, just very shortly after they released him.”

Reid says after seeing the CTV News story last week about a suicidal woman going missing after being discharged from Victoria Hospital, she knew she had to speak out.

“I cant believe that people are being released from the hospital and their loved ones aren’t being contacted. It’s been a few years since my husband died and I can’t believe this is still going on.”

The London Health Coalition believes the care for mental health patients is only going to get worse if there continues to be a lack of services and funding for mental health care.

“We in this community have already suffered from losing so many beds, thousands literally,” says Peter Bergmanis from the London Health Coalition. “There was the London Psychiatric Hospital and the St. Thomas Psychiatric Hospital that are vacant. So where are these people supposed to go?”

Reid agrees more funding and services would be key, but in the interim would like to see hospitals contacting family before discharging mental health patients.

“I, in my heart feel if I could have seen him and talked to him again that the outcome would’ve been entirely different.”

Policies differ from hospital hospital when it comes to notifying family of patient discharge.

In a statement the London Health Sciences Centre said, “Our care providers work with patients to support their discharge, including calling their families/supports when needed. We welcome families sharing their concerns with us, and we are committed to working with them directly.”

Meanwhile St. Thomas Elgin General Hospital states, “When a patient presents in the Emergency Department, they are triaged by a nurse and assessed by a skilled emergency physician. Based on the assessment, a decision to admit or discharge would be made. The decision to notify a family member is determined through a conversation with the patient. This process remains unchanged during COVID.“",[]

Mental health patient in crisis released from hospital more than once,'Celine Zadorsky',2020-05-01,"LONDON, ONT. -- Kristin Legault suffers from severe bipolar disorder. It was earlier this year she shared her success story with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Legault says for the first time she was seeing a positive change with her mental health, but that all changed months ago.

“Because of the coronavirus all of my ECT treatments were discontinued,” says Legault. It’s been around two months without ECT treatments and her mental health has severely declined.

Just two weeks ago, she was suicidal, and police and ambulance were called when she attempted to take her life at her grandparents home in St. Thomas.

She says, “I saw a GP (general practitioner), I wasn’t formed and I didn’t see a psychiatric nurse. Actually they were more concerned with my physical health than my mental health.”

Legualt says about two hours after arriving at St. Thomas Elgin General Hospital via ambulance, she was discharged without a next of kin being contacted.

“They just gave me directions on how to leave the hospital and I walked around Elm Street in St. Thomas at 2:30 a.m. by myself in my pyjamas.”

Her grandmother, Joanne Donkers, found her and got her home safe.

“She just walked out of hospital and I think that’s totally wrong. She could’ve gone anywhere and she was in real crisis and needed help.”

CTV News reached out to St. Thomas Elgin General hospital for comment, hospital communications staff replied via email saying:

""When a patient presents in the Emergency Department, they are triaged by a nurse and assessed by a skilled emergency physician. Based on the assessment, a decision to admit or discharge would be made.

""The decision to notify a family member is determined through a conversation with the patient. This process remains unchanged during COVID.""

Days later and still feeling suicidal, Legault’s GP sent her to the London Health Sciences Centre's (LHSC) Victoria Hospital on a form for mental health crisis care.

She said again, less than two hours later she was released from the emergency department.

Her grandmother, who found her outside Victoria Hospital, says their family is desperate for help.

“We are not equipped to take care of Kristin in crisis. We do the best we can but we really think there should be more help for her.”

Legault says she’s feeling hopeless, “I feel like - Am I ever going to get better? Is anyone ever going to help me?”

Continuing coverage

Following a report on Thursday about a suicidal woman who went missing after being discharged from LHSC, CTV News has received a number of emails from mental health patients who also felt their concerns weren’t taken seriously.

We will be continuing our coverage on the state of mental health care next week.

CTV News will be speaking with a woman whose husband committed suicide immediately after being discharged from hospital.

She shares why she believes concerns she raised years ago are still not being addressed.",[]

Below you will find the latest figures from Ottawa Public Health on all current COVID-19 outbreaks in the city. These data are compiled from the daily reports from Ottawa Public Health unless otherwise stated. If an institution is not listed, that means it has never experienced an outbreak of COVID-19 as of the most recent reporting.

Since April 1, a single staff or resident case of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 is considered an outbreak in A long-term care home, retirement home, or other non-hospital congregate setting.



Since May 10, 2 staff or patient cases of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 within a specified unit within a 14-day period where both cases could have reasonably acquired their infection in hospital is considered an outbreak in a public hospital.

Ottawa Public Health warns these data may differ from other numbers published elsewhere due to data entry lag, different reporting sources, or download times. Please note these numbers are preliminary and will continue to change as new information is received, and quality assurance work takes place.

As health officials work to sort out the particulars around what specific industries and sectors will need to do in order to re-open safely, British Columbians have been given a high-level road map as to what will relaunch, and when.

Led by provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry, the multi-phase plan which has been dubbed “the new normal” will rely on whether B.C. sees a required decrease in the number of new daily COVID-19 cases.

As long as British Columbians don’t let up on the basics – frequently washing hands, practising physical distancing, avoiding any non-essential trips, staying home when sick, and taking a careful approach to broadening social circles beyond those currently in their household – there has been much hope voiced by health officials that there could be overnight camping, movie theatres and other social activities returning in coming months.

“We need to have a slow and thoughtful reset, we do not want to undo all that we have done,” Henry said on Thursday (May 7).

ALSO READ: Here’s what is considered an essential service in B.C.

The plan to re-open parts of B.C., curated by Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix, will meet its first test in a few weeks, as the province moves to “Phase Two” with the re-opening of libraries, in-person counselling, restaurants and more.

Henry has made it clear that bans will be reintroduced if she sees a resurgence in cases.

Here’s a timeline of how the province plans to phase in various services.

Phase Two, mid-May:

Re-scheduling elective surgeries and other health services

Dix announced this week that health authorities have already started calling patients who were forced to reschedule an elective surgery due to hospital restrictions and so bed space remained open in case of a spike in COVID-19 cases.

Meanwhile, other medical services such as dentistry, physiotherapy, registered massage therapy and chiropractors will also be able to safely re-open. This includes physical therapy, speech therapy and similar services.

In-person counselling will also be able to resume under physical distancing protocols.

Hair salons and personal services

Welcome news for most: Salons, barber shops and other personal service establishments will be able to accept clients. The decision by health officials comes despite a growing petition signed by some stylists and barbers asking the province not to “single them out” by opening first.

Restaurants, cafes and pubs

In late April, a group of restaurateurs were asked to create a proposed plan on how the industry could re-open safely. Since mid-March, restaurants and pubs of all sizes have been operating only as take-out and delivery services due to concerns of physical distancing.

A possible blueprint, created by the BC Restaurant and Foodservices Association, on how businesses will have to adjust floor plans, seating arrangements and even the handling of cash, is currently before WorkSafeBC, which will be the final green light before dine-in options can return.

Henry has said that ensuring public trust is a second piece in the puzzle. The proposed plan includes a course that business owners and employees will have to undergo, and if passed, get to place a sticker on their front window.

Recreation and community spaces

Phase Two is also set to include the re-opening of museums, art galleries and libraries, as well as recreation spaces.

Parks, beaches and outdoor sites can also open. As with all other sites, physical distancing must be possible, as well as places to properly wash hands. In some cases, this could mean a cap on the number of visitors at any given time.

Health officials have OK’d some non-contact sports, such as soccer and lacrosse.

B.C. Parks has announced some trails will re-open to day use on May 14, with camping reservations to relaunch on May 25 through the Discover Camping online portal.

Office work spaces

Returning to the office will be likely for many British Columbians, but will have to be under measures that reduce the density of employees within certain areas.

Health officials have suggested that employers may stagger shifts, place physical barriers in between desks and space, and ensure hand sanitizer is available for staff.

All employers should have sick-day policies in place so employees don’t attend work when ill, and consider providing work from home options when possible, to reduce contact intensity.

Child care and education

As parents and caregivers prepare to return to work, the province is anticipating an increased need in child care support.

Child care has been considered an essential service, meaning that was not forced to close down like other businesses. Officials have said that in-classroom education will involve its own set of phases – yet to be released – that will allow kids back in the classroom before others.

“With weeks left in the school year, we anticipate many kids will not return to the classroom until September,” the province confirmed.

Phase Three, June to September

If transmission rates of COVID-19 remain low or in decline, Henry has said that further restrictions will be eased under enhanced measures.

While large-scale events, such as parades or mass gatherings will remain off the table through the summer and possibly into next year, the province is hopeful that British Columbians will be able to go to the movies again, starting in July.

Hotels and resorts

The hotel industry has been hard-hit due to a decrease in overall travel both inter-provincially and internationally, forcing many to shutter.

In Victoria and Vancouver, some have entered agreements with the province to serve as temporary housing for hundreds of homeless people currently living in three large encampments.

Exactly what protocols will be put in place in order for hotels and resorts to open safely have not been released, but will likely involve enhanced cleaning and limited guests. The World Health Organization and Henry have suggested that the bacterium does not live on surfaces for longer than hours to days, but specifics have not been confirmed by researchers.

Camping

Overnight camping will be available across B.C.’s parks beginning June 1. Meanwhile, some private campgrounds have remained open through the pandemic.

Film industry

It’s no surprise that Hollywood North has suffered due to border closures and physical distancing measures. Filming across B.C. tends to pick up in the spring and summer, specifically for Hallmark Christmas movies.

Health officials hope that in June or July that domestic productions will be able to resume.

Entertainment

In July, British Columbians may be allowed to head to the movies or attend a symphony, so long as transmission rates stay low.

While large concerts and festivals are off the table, movie theatres and smaller venues will have to follow current bans on gatherings being less than 50 people. Physical distancing also calls for at least two metres between individuals or strangers.

Education

The next school year will still be feeling the impacts of COVID-19, according to B.C.’s plan.

In September, Kindergarten to Grade 12 students will see a “partial return” to school. It’s too soon to say exactly what that will look like.

Post-secondary students could see a mix of online and in-class lectures, with a likely cap on attendance in larger-sized classrooms.

Phase Four, to be determined

It’s unclear when B.C. will enter Phase Four of the provincial plan, because it relies on the development of a widely available vaccine – which has yet to be created – the province reaching herd immunity, or a broad successful treatment that can manage COVID-19 symptoms.

Henry has said that B.C.’s goal is not to reach herd immunity because too many people, particularly seniors, run the risk of seeing adverse impacts of the virus and high numbers of cases would place too much pressure on the health care system.

The BC Centre for Disease Control has warned it could take years for a vaccine to be developed, tested and widely implemented.

However, when that does come, B.C. health officials will look to allowing conventions, live audiences at professional sports, concerts, night clubs and casinos and international tourism. Those sectors will also have to create individually tailored plans that meet the necessary health requirements.

When long-time chef Nicholas Waters first started Toque Catering in 2013, he never expected it to take off.

“To be honest, I thought I’d be doing one function a weekend,” he says with a laugh. “I didn’t think anything of it. Then all of a sudden, it turned into an animal.”

Toque grew from just five full-timers three years ago to a staff almost 30 strong today, and the wealth of talent in Nick’s kitchen is enviable.

“We run with 10 to 12 executive chefs full time in the kitchen,” he says. “It’s one of the best teams I’ve ever worked with.”

About the same time Toque took off, Nick relocated to Metchosin, and the locale has been ideal both personally and professionally.

“The bigger we’ve gotten, the more local we’ve become,” he says.

Toque is booked at least a year in advance, so Nick and his team have been able to approach local farmers well ahead of season to plan out orders, translating to reliable income for the small agriculture sector, as well as premium ingredients.

And though Nick says he doesn’t want to grow too big too fast, there are definitely some new and exciting directions coming down the pipe.

“Stay tuned!”

The 7 Sins

Envy:

Whose shoes would you like to walk in?

I am on my own journey in life and wouldn’t change a thing, good or bad, but I would love to be Michel Bras in Normandy, France for a day. He has been my favourite chef in the world since I was 18! His book is still better than most out there and it’s almost 20 years old.

Gluttony:

What is the food you could eat over and over again?

That is definitely a hard one, but I would say gyoza. No matter whether I’m at a pub, home or a high-end restaurant, 10 out of 10 times I will order it if it’s on the menu.

Greed:

You’re given $1 million that you have to spend selfishly. What would you spend it on?

I would travel all through Europe and eat and drink and just eat and drink until it was gone. Spain, Portugal, France, Italy — let’s face it, the money would be gone by then!

wrath:

Pet Peeves?

Everything, almost … but the freezers and coolers being a mess has to be the one that makes me think I’m going to have a heart attack.

sloth:

Where would you spend a long time doing nothing?

Spain.

Pride:

What is the one thing you’re secretly proud of?

It won’t be a secret anymore if I say this, but it would be the team — chefs, dishwashers, operations, planners, on-site service staff, rentals and anyone else I’m missing — and the culture we’ve been able to create at Toque. I am grateful every day that I get to work alongside a very, very talented group. I actually like working with them all and don’t have a bad thing to say. They’ve all become my family.

Lust:

What makes your heart beat faster?

Being on-site when shit hits the fan — like a barbecue falls off the top and an oven doesn’t work, etc. That shit turns me on when you come out of it unscathed and everything went perfectly, except your soul becomes a little darker!

I love the unknown and being able to make something out of nothing. The best was four or five years ago when the guys got me an Easy-Bake Oven for Christmas. They said, “Well, it’s on. Let’s see what you can do with this!’”

Don Denton/Boulevard Dining bar and kitchen in Ingrid Jarisz condo.

Despite being on my first home tour in a long time, stepping into this Sayward Hill condo feels like slipping on a favourite pair of shoes.

I take in the compass rose laid out in the bricked pathway outside and the oversize nature photos in the tidy lobby. I make a note of the territorial hummingbird that buzzes past and the light feel of ocean in the wind. And when Ingrid, the homeowner, meets me at the front door to lead me down to her unit, I’m thrilled that she’s as warm and lovely as I’d expected by her emails.

We walk into the condo, past a home office and a den with a spectacular ‘70s-era couch, both lulling me into a “condo” mentality, and then, I stop in my socked feet, utterly surprised.

The kitchen, beautifully balanced with white and oak cabinetry and stainless steel appliances, is large and open enough to accommodate a tightly turned Viennese waltz, if the dancers are sure-footed.

The unit is just over 2,000 square feet, she tells me, a perfect middle ground between downsizing from house living and not sacrificing space and storage for something easier to manage.

But this kitchen. Oh, this kitchen. It’s bright and airy, with oodles of natural light. The quartz countertops are smooth while still adding texture, and the marble honeycomb tile lining the wall beneath the cupboards is warm with gorgeous colour variations. It all comes together in a very chateau feel, and it’s just wonderful.

For Ingrid’s “foodie” daughter and son-in-law, there’s a six-burner gas range and double wall oven, as well as the double-door fridge and walk-in pantry. There’s also an extra built-in beverage centre with a bar fridge and a built-in coffee machine, an upgrade that Ingrid and her husband took immediate advantage of.

“We’re coffee snobs!” she admits with a laugh. “Waking up to the sunrise and turning on the coffee machine — it’s my favourite thing!”

On the other side of the counter sits a fantastic dining table with black accents and clawed feet in the open dining area, ready to expand in the event of company, and the living room sets up a surprisingly expansive view of Cordova Bay, given that the development borders the thick trees of Sayward Hill Park.

The master bedroom comfortably fits a king bed and dresser and comes with its own larger-than-life view, where Mount Baker is currently peeking up above a thin line of clouds. Ingrid disappears behind me as I take in the view, and after a moment I follow, thinking we’ll have a quick look at the closet and pocket en suite before returning to the tour.

What I’m not expecting is to come around the corner into a long, luxurious master en suite complete with double sinks, beautiful soaker tub, roomy glassed-in shower, heated tile floors and so much cupboard and drawer space I think I actually go a little green with envy.

“There’s so much storage. I haven’t even filled up all the space yet,” she says, opening a few of the cupboard doors.

Just on the other side of the bathroom door is a walk-in closet that could rival most of the other Hot Properties closets I’ve seen over the years. I’m so surprised by the size that I don’t notice it’s also a walk-through until Ingrid points out the laundry room at the other end.

“It’s a really efficient design,” she says, and adds that the connection from the walk-in closet to the laundry room was an element that was brought in after talking to residents of other buildings in the development.

The entire Sayward Hill project spanned almost 20 years, Ingrid tells me, with the first development finished in 2001. Amazingly, the entire development team stayed consistent from the first ground breaking to the completion of the last condo building. The same builders, the same architects, the same plumbing contractors, the same designer, everyone stayed involved, making for an almost unheard-of level of synergy throughout the build.

And not only that, but after each phase was complete, the team made a dedicated effort to get feedback from the people actually living in the spaces, and then sat down and round-tabled ideas to implement in the next stages.

“We would all sit together, including the architects, and we would design the light switches,” says Ingrid, smiling. It allowed for a natural evolution of the project, and a number of details that make this particular condo stand out.

As well as the double access to the laundry room, the guest bedroom is situated on the opposite side of the condo to add a sense of privacy for visitors, and there’s a pocket door that can close off the bedroom and bathroom for added separation. A barn door can separate the small home office tucked between the den and the kitchen. And one of my favourite features is at the front entrance: the hallway wall curves gently wide and away the further you come in, leading you into the rest of the house and creating an immediate and welcoming sense of space. The design is subtle and natural enough that I didn’t actually notice it at first, which makes sense the more time I spend here.

Compared to some of the houses featured in Boulevard, Ingrid’s condo is relatively compact, but it never feels cramped, or that anything was sacrificed in the name of efficiency. More than that, the design as a whole feels effortless. I’m instantly so comfortable, so at home, that I have to remember to look for the details.

“Kimberly has an elegance about her,” says Ingrid, quick to praise interior designer Kimberly Williams, also involved with the project since day one. “Her design is timeless.”

“All the projects on Sayward Hill were definitely designed with longevity in mind,” says Kimberly. “Durability and flexibility are extremely important in executing good design. We try to stay true to classic elements, which equates to timeless designs. I am so very proud of this project!”

“This is a development that’s near and dear to my heart,” adds Ingrid.

Having worked selling the units for the past 20 years, she’s seen their evolution and their unmatched quality.

“It felt like my second home. This is the last piece of the puzzle, and it feels right to be here now. This feels like the pinnacle of Sayward.”

Maple Ridge Pitt Meadows Community Services helps community members of all ages, even during a global pandemic.

The way JoAnne White sees it, the role of Maple Ridge Pitt Meadows Community Services is to offer unwavering support.

The non-profit organization helps community members of all ages, but as an Early Childhood Educator, White focuses on young children and their families/caregivers.

“We want to continuously support families in our community,” White says. Under normal circumstances that would mean a wide variety of programming at the Family Place Community Parenting Centre and outreach supports, but White and her team are getting creative during physical isolation.

Busy Bags: Thanks to support from the Sandbox Project, Costco, and Superstore, White and her team have delivered bags full of resources, books, science activities, colouring sheets and crafts, right to families’ doors. “It’s a way to help families stay healthy, interactive, and as harmonious as possible.”

We can talk about the things parents are struggling with, and maintain some parent support.” Community Parenting Program helps with paperwork for programs like B.C. Housing and income assistance, and can do contact-less drop off to help get forms signed and submitted. “We want to help families reach their full potential, and we support them along that road.”

May’s warm temperatures have had many dreaming of cool dips at the lake, quiet paddles in nature, and family memories made around a campfire.

And with this year’s travel likely spent close to home – and away from the crowds – B.C. is in a unique position to offer just that.

Here, pull into your own carefully selected RV site or cabin right on the lake, and find everything just as you want it – and WHERE you want it! The 66-lot shared interest lakefront development boasts 45 fully serviced RV lots and 20 cabin sites, on the shores of this pristine lake.

Even better, enjoy the confidence of year-round security and winter snow removal for the main road, and lodge access, with the option of site-specific removal at the owner’s request.

Realtor Angela Evennett with Royal LePage Wolstencroft Realty in Langley has some fun with her three sons in the yard. Being a part of the greater community family is important to Angela, along with understanding your family’s housing needs.

When it came time to decide where to lay down roots with her family a little over 20 years ago, Angela Evennett didn’t hesitate in choosing Langley.

While the Township and City – even Fort Langley – have grown since she arrived, it continues to be a great place for families, she says. The current global health challenges notwithstanding, in Langley there are numerous options for public and private schools and post-secondary education, easy access to Vancouver or the U.S., and plenty of community amenities close by.

Angela, one of the area’s leading Realtors with Royal LePage Wolstencroft Realty, is familiar with the need for space for growing families. As a single mom bringing up three boys in the Fraser Valley, she says, “I’ve always felt I relate well to first-time buyers, those going through life changes, empty nesters or people starting over again.”

Whether you’re seeking your “forever home,” looking to downsize or take advantage of low interest rates to invest in property locally, Angela brings much to the table.

Expert on seniors’ specialized real estate needs – From retirees downsizing from a larger home to adult children entrusted with probate or estate sales, real estate involving seniors’ homes takes a special set of skills. In addition to having 13 years’ experience, Angela is a certified Seniors Real Estate Specialist and understands issues of importance to elder clients and their families, from financial implications to the physical layout of a home.

Eventually referred to the care of specialists, including Dr. Elaine Mah, an obstetrician, gynecologist and surgeon at Langley Memorial Hospital, an ultrasound revealed a 15-centimetre uterine fibroid.

Shortly after diagnosis, while waiting for surgery, Tary was back in hospital: the fibroid had gotten so big her body was reacting to toxins it was creating. Dr. Mah surgically removed the fibroid using a process similar to a Caesarian section that let Tary recover in about six weeks, and share her gratitude to the Langley Memorial team:

“Listen to your body – just because they’re often considered ‘women’s problems’ doesn’t mean potential symptoms should be ignored,” Tary says. “If I hadn’t gotten mine looked at it could’ve gone very badly – I could have gone septic. We need to make women’s health less of a stigma and more normalized.”

Dramatic changes for women’s health care

From fertility support and maternity care to cancer diagnosis and innumerable other conditions like Tary’s fibroid, women’s health care is front and centre at Langley Memorial Hospital’s medical imaging and BC Cancer – Breast Screening and mammography clinic.

Site co-ordinator Tammy Karoway has worked in medical imaging for more than 30 years, and has seen the dramatic evolution in the diagnostic and treatment tools her team have to treat the women in their care.

“When I started, cancer was still seen as a death sentence for many. Now, advances in technology to diagnose cases and new, less invasive treatments have made a huge difference in survival rates,” Karoway says, noting that for patients waiting for diagnosis or treatment, where every minute feels like a week, tools to make those happen quicker are vital.

At Langley Memorial, in a typical day, the medical imaging team performs:

hysterosalpingograms, looking for fallopian tubes blockages impacting fertility. In fact, sometimes the exam itself can actually become therapeutic if the contrast opens a blockage and resolves the issue.

female-focused ultrasound exams – scanning breasts to review lumps and performing pelvic studies to help identify issues within the reproductive system.

ultrasound supporting the hospital’s Fetal Maternity Clinic, to ensure baby is well and there’s enough fluid for baby to stay safely inside for a few more days.

breast biopsies under ultrasound after a patient has had a suspicious mammogram.

support for new studies showing the preventive health benefits of review images of dense breasts, which can be more prone to tumours.

The ability to care for women in their community goes a long way to easing the burden on patients and their families – reducing the need to travel to larger centres for diagnostics or treatment, Karoway notes.

Since all instructors from Continuing Education at the University of the Fraser Valley are already experienced in online program delivery, you can learn from the comfort of your own home, at times that work for you. This flexibility is especially welcome for students also balancing work or family commitments.

Why blended learning works

“Through the blended learning format, incorporating online learning, group projects and independent studies, students can be confident that they’ll get the resources they need – and the learning experience they want,” explains Carolyn MacLaren, UFV’s Director of Continuing Education.

While some students take advantage of single courses to complement their existing knowledge, others apply those courses to a full program. And because the courses are accredited through UFV, some credits can also be “laddered,” or applied to a degree program later on.

Real world applications

The University of the Fraser Valley’s Continuing Education business and management courses bring real world benefits for those navigating today’s continually evolving business world.

For an office manager now also responsible for their company’s human resources, courses exploring HR issues, such as hiring for performance, or employment development and training provide valuable skills for their new role.

“Through these courses, you’ll learn to more efficiently and effectively tackle these roles,” MacLaren says. “And these will all be useful in your career long-term.”

Labour relations is another huge interest right now – whether it’s protocols for hiring following COVID workforce adjustments or accessing some of the various government programs available.

Intrigued by what you’re learning? Take your career in a new direction by completing the full certificate program.

Similar opportunities await in Management Skills, Records Management and Public Relations – another vital skillset as businesses get their message out to current and potential customers.

“Businesses haven’t had a lot of time to plan for messaging as they move through this pandemic, so as you start to get back to business, you’ll need to consider your messaging to your customers, or how to reassure them that your product or service meets new health and safety protocols, for example,” MacLaren says, noting that public relations courses can help you feel more comfortable in crafting and delivering that message.

Re-start your career today!

920,920,1387,abbynews,https://www.abbynews.com/opinion/b-c-s-labour-minister-should-look-at-pandemics-financial-carnage-amid-minimum-wage-increase/,COLUMN: B.C.’s labour minister should look at COVID-19 financial carnage amid minimum wage increase – Abbotsford News,'May.',2020-05-28,"The timing couldn’t be worse for any government decision that drives up costs for business, writes Jock Finlayson

Minister of Labour Harry Bains recently confirmed that B.C.’s minimum wage will climb by 75 cents to $14.80 per hour on June 1. This is in keeping with a schedule of planned increases announced by the NDP government a couple of years ago.

Many people will welcome the prospect of the lowest-paid workers earning more. When the NDP government started down the road of boosting the minimum wage, the Business Council of B.C. supported the policy.

In normal economic times, most organizations that employ relatively low-paid workers can adjust to modest increases in labour costs associated with a higher minimum wage, without necessarily dampening overall job growth in the process. And this is more or less what happened amid the buoyant job market the province enjoyed from 2017 until mid-2019.

READ MORE: B.C.’s minimum wage to go up 75 cents in June

The government’s latest move on the minimum wage, however, is problematic. Businesses across B.C. have been hit with the biggest shock in decades as large swathes of the economy were shut down to help manage the COVID-19 pandemic. At the same time, the province’s export-oriented industries have been hammered by the sudden onset of a deep global recession together with disruptions to international supply chains and the virtual cessation of cross-border travel and tourism.

In truth, the timing couldn’t be worse for any government decision that drives up costs for business. In March and April, B.C. lost a staggering 400,000 jobs as tens of thousands of businesses and non-profits were compelled to shut their doors and laid off huge numbers of staff. Many self-employed and “gig” workers have also seen their incomes shrivel. When earlier minimum wage increases were implemented, B.C.’s unemployment rate was around 5 per cent. Now, it is above 11 per cent and still rising.

How bad are things for the private sector? A new survey conducted by the Business Council, the Greater Vancouver Board of Trade, and the B.C. Chamber of Commerce tells the story of a business community in distress.

Almost 80 per cent of the firms surveyed report dwindling revenues. Many have furloughed staff. Almost four in ten say they have deferred or cancelled capital projects since February. And while the B.C. government is re-opening the economy by gradually easing social distancing restrictions, barely one-quarter of the companies directly impacted by COVID-19 believe they are ready to restart and operate profitably.

Of interest, about one-third of B.C. firms have increased their digital or e-commerce presence in the past three months, a step that may allow them to run their businesses with fewer workers once the pandemic has passed.

A key question is how many of the 400,000 jobs lost in B.C. since February will “come back” as the economy wakes up over the coming months. Some undoubtedly will, as more companies re-open and ramp up activity. But thousands of small and mid-sized businesses are likely to close for good, either voluntarily or due to insolvency. Many others will resume operations but with fewer employees.

Restaurants and retail stores, for example, have been ordered to reduce capacity and limit the number of customers served; this will assuredly translate into less need for employees. All segments of B.C.’s large tourism sector will struggle to survive through the end of 2020 as visitor numbers plummet. More generally, shifts in consumer behaviour due to worries over the virus will weigh on the demand for some goods and services, depressing employment in certain industry sectors.

In this challenging economic environment, governments at all levels should be doing everything possible to encourage companies to re-hire and retain workers. This requires a concerted focus by policy-makers on containing costs, including labour costs. Unfortunately, B.C.’s ill-timed increase in the minimum wage will work against this objective by making it harder for many businesses to rehire and retain employees.

Instead of aggravating an already difficult situation, the Minister of Labour should take an honest look at the carnage befalling large parts of our business community during this economic calamity and recognize the overriding need to get people working again.

The nation’s unemployment rate is extremely high. The number of permanent small business closures is frightening. Long-established major firms are closing down. The Government of Canada, which responded quickly and effectively to quell financial panic, now has to show it can be as fast and adept at restarting a traumatized economy. In no part of Canada is the reboot more critical – and more uncertain – than in the nation’s rural areas and small towns.

For generations, rural and small-town Canada has been struggling. The sharp decline of many single-industry towns is well-known, as has been the fall off in the country’s agricultural workforce through a combination of technological innovation and the consolidation of farm properties. There has been no shortage of revitalization plans, community empowerment processes, and regional economic development efforts. Some have worked; most have had trouble stemming the flow of young people, families and businesses from these areas. Resilience is a key characteristic of agrarian life and Canada’s many small towns have fought back from economic despair in the past. But this feels different.

Several key forces have already lined up against rural Canada. Technological change has made some rural businesses more competitive, but lowered labour requirements in others. E-commerce and e-services improved the quality of life in remote centres but undercut the business model for many small local firms. The carbon tax hit rural Canada disproportionately hard and is harming already vulnerable operations. In Western Canada, the multiple factors undermining the oil and gas industry have buffeted the many small towns in the region. Pre-COVID, in a world increasingly dominated by city-state economies, rural and small-town Canada was already experiencing serious difficulties.

Even before the COVID-19 crisis hit, rural, blue-collar, and small-town Canada was already facing poorer outcomes than urban and white-collar Canada. As explained in a 2019 MLI report by Sean Speer titled Forgotten People and Forgotten Places: Canada’s Economic Performance in the Age of Populism, where a Canadian lives and the nature of their work was already a major determinant of economic success long before the pandemic. These divergent economic outcomes are all but certain to worsen in the Post-COVID world.

Canada now find itself in a midst of a deep economic meltdown. The country has many high priorities, from protecting and revitalizing Indigenous communities to supporting fishing villages on the East Coast. It needs to restart and expand the manufacturing sector, decide if it wants to revitalize the oil and gas sector, and try to revive retail, service and restaurant companies. The challenges facing rural and small-town Canada have largely escaped notice for the past few decades; now these communities have to vie for the government’s attention during a time of national crisis.

One rural sector – the tourism industry –reveals the extreme vulnerability of the small-town economy in Canada. Quite remarkably, the crises facing tourism have attracted limited attention countrywide. As the summer season approaches, a monumental economic meltdown is underway. Reservations at hotels, motels, fishing lodges, retreat centres have been cancelled en masse. Many have closed for all of 2020. In Yukon, which has worked exceptionally hard to build a vibrant, international market, the suspension of the West Coast cruise ship season has already caused widespread harm. So it is across the rest of the country, from cozy East Coast bed and breakfasts to world-class Saskatchewan fishing camps, the brilliant theatre towns of southern Ontario, and the spectacular wilderness operations in northern British Columbia and down the Mackenzie River valley.

The business losses in the tourism sector are serious but they do not explain the collective impact of the decline for rural and small-town tourism. If the travellers do not arrive – and they ae unlikely to come in the summer of 2020 and the crisis could persist into 2021 – the whole community suffers. Airline travel has stalled, hotels have closed, staff have been laid off, restaurants that are struggling to reopen will have fewer of the free-spending tourists, adventure companies are not hiring this year, and the thousands of companies that support the sector are struggling.

Over the last decade, tourism has been a hidden gem in the economic redevelopment of rural Canada. Indigenous tourism alone was slated to breach the $1 billion barrier in 2020, but hundreds of small and vulnerable Indigenous firms are facing bankruptcy. Canada has emerged as an attractive global tourist destination, capitalizing on the country’s spectacular scenery and compelling cultural attractions. This is all at risk as the world’s tourism industry struggles to find its feet in the wake of the pandemic. There is no easy path to the revitalization of tourism, but for small town Canada a great deal is riding on the rebirth.

Across the board, COVID-19 exposed serious weaknesses in rural areas. Poor quality Internet limited the community’s ability to respond to a succession of economic, educational, health and commercial crises. The inadequate health care services stood exposed during the pandemic, with Indigenous communities particularly nervous about the spread of the virus. As waves of layoffs swept across the country, job and income losses hit particularly hard at small-town businesses, tourist operations and resource projects, their economic vulnerability revealed.

There is no easy solution to the formidable challenges facing small town Canada. In a country awash with economic and social crises, and with the federal government sharply focused on the major difficulties facing the largest metropolitan areas, it is hard to imagine rural and small-town issues rising up high on the national agenda. Quite frankly, the country needs to think seriously about its commitment to the revival and revitalization of rural and small-town Canada, for the prospect looms large that a precipitous decline could easily follow on the heels of the devastation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

By Dr. Bonnie Henry and Adrian Dix

VICTORIA – The effects of COVID-19 have been far reaching. Everybody in our province has been impacted, as well as everybody across Canada and around the globe. We have learned a lot about the virus, how it spreads and how nations around the world are managing outbreaks.

However, there are still many questions that we need to answer and understand, including the impacts of the measures that we have taken to control COVID-19 in B.C. and flatten the curve. This is why we recently launched a province-wide survey, Your story, our future, to gather feedback from British Columbians on your experiences and actions you have taken so far in the COVID-19 pandemic in B.C.

This is a collaboration of B.C. public health experts, our health authority medical health officers, the BC Centre for Disease Control and Provincial Health Services Authority, as well as the provincial health officer. The information you share with us will help inform the public health decisions that we make in the weeks and months ahead.

As part of the survey, there is also an opportunity for you to express your interest in participating in further studies, including a serology blood test study to determine immunity within our province.

So far, more than 275,000 British Columbians have completed the survey, which is an outstanding response, and we would like to hear from even more: younger, older, in the north, south, east and west. It is only a few minutes of your time, but it will make a huge difference.

Dear editor,

I am writing to express my surprise that Black Press Media publications would publish this article which suggests ‘some scientists’ are concerned that Seabridge Gold’s KSM project did not incorporate independent and peer-reviewed science during the environmental assessment and permitting process. To reiterate Jonathon Moore’s statement that “we want those scales rebalanced and the way to rebalance that is through peer-reviewed science and processes that are inclusive and incorporate cross-border policies” is completely contrary to the evidence and facts as it relates to the KSM Project.

In our view, by publishing this article, Black Press Media is suggesting the KSM Project’s independent joint-harmonized environmental review conducted under the British Columbia Government Environmental Assessment Act, the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act (1992) and under the Nisga’a Lisims Treaty, was not independent, peer-reviewed and did not incorporate cross-border policies and concerns; this illustrates a lack of comprehension about the independent scientific review and the regulatory process that the KSM Project underwent to be granted its environmental approvals.

As professional fact finders, I am confident that you will be interested in learning the facts about the science, peer, international cross border reviews and public consultations conducted before and during the independent environmental assessment review of Seabridge Gold’s KSM project.

Between 2008 and 2014, 250 independent scientists from across 20 disciplines along with a cadre of geophysical, geotechnical mining, design and civil engineers, social scientists and Indigenous traditional scientists worked together to research and publish 36,000 pages of scientifically rigorous findings as it relates to the environmental, economic, social, heritage, cumulative, international and health impacts of this project.

This review included information related to potential transboundary concerns and cross border policies. This information was then independently reviewed by both the Tahltan First Nation and Nisga’a Lisims’ scientists, who considered both the traditional scientific knowledge and traditional values as it related to the project, and further project accommodations were made at their request.

It’s important to note, not unlike research scientists, each of the scientists working on this project belong to and are licensed with professional regulatory bodies which regulate their practice through expected standards of practice and conduct.

Once the 36,000 pages of information were collected and collated, The Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency, The British Columbia Environmental Assessment Agency along with twenty US Federal and Alaska regulatory agencies, including the EPA who were mentioned in the article, and the Nisga’a Lisims’ Government conducted extensive, independent reviews of the information. During this time, Seabridge Gold scientists conducted 115 meetings with these independent regulators to answer questions about their peer review of the science. In contrast to what the article suggests, the US EPA and Alaska regulators were at the table for these meetings and Alaska citizens’ questions and comments were collected and responded to.

Concurrently, and as a prerequisite to permitting projects, Seabridge Gold was required to gain a social license to operate from the local communities and First Nation rights holders.

After a decade of consultation and engagement with the local community members and First Nations rights holders, responding to 15,000 questions and comments, 76 percent of the local community members strongly supported the KSM project environmental assessment application. Additionally, both the Tahltan Nation and the Nisga’a Lisims Nation (the First Nations on whose traditional territory the KSM Project is located), signed economic benefit agreements in support of the KSM Project.

It is also important to note for the record, that after one of the most comprehensive environmental assessment ever undertaken in Canada and British Columbia, the Canadian Minister of the Environment, in her decision statement approving the KSM Project, stated: “The project is not likely to cause adverse environmental effects as defined in the former Act, taking into account the implementation of mitigation measures described in the report… the mitigation measures and follow up programs described in the Report are appropriate for the project.” Further, the British Columbia Ministers of Environment and Energy and Mines concluded, “the project will be constructed, operated and decommissioned in a way that ensures that no significant adverse effects are likely to occur.” The US (EPA) and Alaska regulators were “satisfied there would be no downstream or transboundary impacts.”

In a democracy, we certainly welcomed a debate that was strengthened with the involvement of Alaskans, but there are legal and regulatory processes that we followed during the environmental assessment of the KSM project, given that both the US and Canada are countries founded on the “rule of law.” With the environmental assessment approvals of the project granted, it will now be up to the operator of the project who will be required by law to live up to the mitigation measures prescribed to ensure this project is developed and operated safely and does not have adverse effects on the environment.

As a scientist, given the 36,000 pages of research compiled by over 250 independent scientists, the seven-year independent, peer regulatory review, three independent science reviews, over 15,000 conversations and our two First Nation partners’ approval for the project, I am genuinely disappointed by the false information perpetrated by publishing the unsubstantiated suggestion that the KSM project did not undergo a comprehensive, transparent peer-reviewed environmental assessment which did not take cross boundary policies into consideration.

My professional science training taught me that good science happens through factual and evidence-based decision-making. I am also under the impression good journalism happens when both sides of the story are told and, I hope, in the future, we can all expect that Black Press Media will live up to these professional standards when reporting on Seabridge Gold’s KSM Project.

Endangered species day was established 15 years ago. It is a day for us to learn about the wildlife, plants, animals and insects that are at risk of disappearing and perhaps most importantly, what we can do about it.

Every nation has a unique role in saving our planet’s endangered species. As Canadians it’s important that we know about the plight and prospects of wildlife from around the world. But it is most critical that Canadians know about the fellow species that share our lands and waters. These are the plants and animals that we steward and can take action to protect. Our decisions alone will determine their future.

We share our country with about 80,000 known wild species. We don’t know the exact number, and more remain to be described and discovered. Many of these plants and animals are common and thriving. Species like raccoon, mallard and Labrador-tea are not endangered, and have a low risk of ever being lost from Canada.

There is an important group in our Canadian collection of known plants and animals that are at risk of disappearing. Canada has about 800 species, sub-species and varieties of wildlife that have been officially assessed as at risk, but this probably represents less than a quarter of all plants and animals that are imperiled in our country. Without conservation actions, these species could join Canada’s “missing” species such as the greater prairie chicken, eastern box turtle and great laurel.

Within this group of nationally imperiled species are about 1,600 plants and animals that are also of global conservation concern. Many of these have very small ranges like the Bicknell’s thrush of Quebec, Atlantic Canada and the northeastern US, or the sand-verbena moth that is limited to a handful of sites of coastal sites in Washington and B.C. including the Nature Conservancy of Canada’s James Island. In most cases, we share the stewardship of these species with other nations, primarily our American neighbors.

Nationally and globally imperiled species are critical to conserve. We can help by protecting key wetlands, forests, coastal areas and grasslands by supporting the work of the Nature Conservancy of Canada and other land trusts. These projects leverage matching funds from the federal Natural Heritage Conservation Program.

There is also a select group of wildlife that are worth learning about. About 310 plants and animals live in Canada and nowhere else in the world. These range from a unique variety of the weasel-like marten that only lives on the island of Newfoundland to a small fish called the Vancouver lamprey that is restricted to Vancouver Island to a delicate wildflower that grows along the arctic coast called hairy braya that was rediscovered based on notes from the Franklin expedition. Most of the species in this select group have always been restricted to this geography we now call Canada. A few like the eastern wolf, have been lost from their former range in the US and their last stronghold against extinction is in Canada.

These are uniquely Canadian species. No other country can protect them. Later this spring, NatureServe Canada and the Nature Conservancy of Canada will be releasing a report and some maps on this select group of all-Canadian wildlife. If we want to pass on the full richness of the world’s wildlife to future generations, we need to protect these species.

We can use this time of social distancing to nudge closer to nature. To learn a little more about even just one of our endangered species in Canada. Learning is the foundation of conservation. Knowing what other species share our community and our country. Learning why they might disappear. Learning what can be done to save them.

925,925,1392,abbynews,https://www.abbynews.com/opinion/column-residents-should-explore-b-c-to-help-tourism-industry-amid-covid-19/,COLUMN: Residents should explore B.C. to help tourism industry amid COVID-19 – Abbotsford News,'May.',2020-05-11,"As policy-makers struggle to the tabulate the immense damage being done by the Covid-19 pandemic, the shuttering of local businesses, and the onset of a global economic downturn, few B.C. industries are being hit harder than tourism. Globally, cross-border travel has come to a halt and airlines have stopped serving most international routes. For 2020 as a whole, forecasters expect a huge drop in overnight “tourist arrivals” worldwide, including in North America. The impact of this unprecedented situation is painfully evident in B.C.

For B.C., the health of tourism matters: it is one of the province’s most important industries, serving as a key source of employment and business activity across the province. According to Destination British Columbia, 160,000 jobs and $6 billion in wage and salary income depend on the industry. In 2019, tourism generated aggregate revenues of roughly $21 billion, a jump of more than 50 per cent since 2008. Some of this was spending by B.C. residents on within-province travel and at local hotels, restaurants and other venues. But almost $8 billion consisted of “export revenues,” a category that captures spending by non-B.C. residents on goods and services purchased while visiting our province. Tourism export earnings exceed those garnered from the sale of B.C. minerals and agri-food and fish products – making tourism one of the province’s leading export sectors.

Sadly, the tourism industry is staring at an economic calamity. The virtual cessation of air travel, the shutting of the Canada-U.S. border, and the closure of local restaurants, stores, parks, and entertainment and cultural facilities mean the number of out-of-province visitors will plunge this spring and summer – the most critical months for many tourism businesses. The economic carnage is widespread.

To begin with, more than half of the stunning 396,000 jobs lost in B.C. in March and April were in industries that are part of the broad tourism sector – hotels and motels, eating and drinking establishments, other segments of retail trade, air transportation, and leisure, entertainment and recreational services. Every segment of B.C.’s diverse tourism industry – from guide outfitters and fishing camp operators to hotels, resorts, taxis, museums, and luxury retail businesses – is being hammered by the disappearance of visitors. The industry has never experienced anything like it.

A recent on-line survey conducted by the British Columbia Regional Tourism Secretariat paints an alarming picture. It finds only 37 per cent of B.C. hotels, motels and other tourism businesses believe they can survive through the end of the summer, given social distancing measures and other operational restrictions currently in place. Visitor bookings continue to be cancelled or postponed, with four-fifths of the tourism businesses surveyed reporting slower bookings into the fall months. The convention, meetings and events business has cratered. And, many tourism businesses are grappling with a severe cash flow crunch as revenues shrivel yet fixed costs remain.

Thankfully, earlier this month the B.C. government unveiled its economic re-opening plan. In the coming weeks, restaurants, hotels, motels and most other consumer-facing business will be allowed to resume operations, subject to new health and safety protocols to protect employees and customers. However, the plan specified no date for the return of “international tourism,” suggesting that it may have to await the development of a vaccine for COVID-19. If so, that spells bad news for the various segments of the B.C. tourism industry that depend on visitors from overseas and the United States to help drive their business.

What can be done? The near-term outlook for international travel is dim. Some Americans will come if the border re-opens before the summer, but in smaller numbers than in previous seasons. For now, re-building tourism should focus on bolstering the domestic market and encouraging more visitors from next-door Alberta.

Now is the time for British Columbians to travel and vacation within the province, not just this summer but into the fall. This includes visiting B.C. communities that one may not have experienced before. It may also involve opting for close-to-home “staycations.” Those with the ability to do so should step up and patronize B.C. hotels, restaurants, sightseeing venues, cultural attractions, and other local tourism-businesses to help keep the industry alive until international visitors return.

My niece is sheltering at home during the COVID-19 pandemic. She’s making sourdough starter for the first time because she couldn’t find any dry yeast. It’s like having a newborn for the first three days — keep warm, stir three or four times a day, watch for bubbles, feed regularly after use. On cold winter nights, old-timers used to take their sourdough starter to bed with them.

Meanwhile flour is also scarce. A well-known flour company has run out of its usual bright yellow bags and has to use white ones instead. It seems everyone is baking these days.

Questions come to mind. Are people re-enacting the traditional household activities of their mothers and grandmothers? Does this signal a massive change in society?

We don’t really know. Soren Kierkegaard, the father of existentialism, once wrote that we live life forwards and understand it backwards. People may simply be stocking up on baking supplies while they’re in quarantine. It may or may not be largely limited to women who are baking.

Caring for one’s sourdough starter will not alleviate the fear of loss of control, but, as psychologists suggest, it offers the physical and emotional comfort of working with one’s hands. It makes me wonder if people are trying to remember what their home economics teachers taught them, or wishing they had taken home economics electives.

Integrated systems

Many people assume that home economics only deals with teaching women how to cook and sew, as it did in the early years: the old stereotypes of women’s work, including cooking and sewing, are forever present. This definition was appropriate then, but isn’t now.

The unifying theme of home economics is ecology, where all living beings are parts of an integrated system and where a change in one part affects all other parts of the system. The truth of this theme has become painfully obvious in the COVID-19 pandemic.

When the International Federation for Home Economics turned 100 years old in 2008, it reaffirmed the mission of home economics to improve the quality of life and well-being for all people and families.

Home economics has always been more than passing on technical skills. It also includes communicating about everyday life and developing relationships. Critical thinking is important to ask which relationships matter, which people and what area of life will benefit from choices and how these choices affect the broader world. If people only learn skills, they have not learned how to be flexible in all circumstances, such as during shortages or extreme conditions.

The home economics movement began in the 1800s for economic and societal reasons in England, northern Europe and North America.

Agriculture gave way to industry and commerce; countries needed strong, healthy workers for wars and factories. An opening came for women to further their educations under the guise of scientific housekeeping, later referred to as domestic science, and then home economics.

Ellen Swallow Richards, the founder of home economics in North America, wanted to use the word “ecology” in the name. As the first woman to obtain a chemistry degree at MIT, and an outstanding scientist, she finally agreed to home economics in 1908.

Women’s advocacy

In Canada, Adelaide Hunter Hoodless founded home economics education beginning with the Women’s Institute in 1897 and later post-secondary institutions such as the Macdonald Institute in Guelph, Ont.

Hoodless had taken up health as a worthy cause when her young son died from drinking tainted milk. She vowed that no other mother would have to go through such despair.

Up to the 1960s, home economics as a profession spread across the world and provided exceptional job opportunities for women in government, education, business, commerce and universities. Its basis was practical hands-on learning with a focus on women’s education.

Societal shifts

My experience in home economics mirrors many young women of the 1960s. When I was 12, I joined 4-H, a rural youth organization that promoted “learn to do by doing” through practical projects and by offering leadership possibilities.

For me it was a window to the world. The district home economist in charge of the program was respected, independent and drove a government car. She was my first professional female role model, and she encouraged me to go into a bachelor of science program in household economics.

I became a district home economist and later a home economics teacher when the world was changing rapidly. Along came the “race for space,” John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King, Pierre Elliot Trudeau and Australian feminist Germaine Greer.

The second wave of feminism opened up many new areas of study to women and men. Home economics was no longer only for women, and consumerism and the market economy took over to a large extent.

The discipline of home economics has persisted in its focus on everyday life and the well-being of individuals and families. Over the years much discussion has swirled around the relevance of the name home economics. It sometimes goes incognito as human ecology, family and consumer sciences, family studies, home sciences, home arts, and career and technical studies.

‘I’m so happy about those buns’

Mother’s Day, the second Sunday in May, has become the time for North Americans to commemorate motherhood. The day dates back to about 100 years ago, around the same time that home economics was becoming recognized as a body of study. Many women, including myself, avoid Mother’s Day because it’s become so commercialized.

However, I cannot discount the connections between baking and mothering. My own mother used to visit my young family in the early 1980s and bake bread, including air buns. Once, when the buns were almost ready, my then-five-year-old son started dancing at the bottom of the stairs. She asked him, “Why are you dancing?” He said, “I’m so happy about those buns.”

Time passes, circumstances change and my memory of my mother baking is still very strong. Pandemic baking may also give indelible and sustaining outcomes to those who went through it. (And for the record, the bread my niece made with her first ever sourdough starter was pretty good!)

The links between home skills, home economics and love (not necessarily Mother’s Day) acknowledge all people’s desires for connection, activity and being part of a system. Home economics is not dead. It’s needed more than ever. Look for it.

It’s grown into an international network with thousands of trained personnel from coast to coast.

In BC the Salvation Army is active responding to the COVID-19 crisis. Many of the Emergency Disaster response units are supporting locations serving food and delivering goods and supplies. “Our mobile kitchens help to increase existing feeding output and provide additional take away serving options. They’re also ready to respond should a natural disaster such as a flood, fire, or earthquake occur,” says Ian Pollard, Divisional Emergency Disaster Services Director for The Salvation Army.

“In the midst of a global pandemic, the Salvation Army’s emergency disaster services continue to serve on the frontlines,” says Lt-Colonel John P. Murray, territorial secretary for communications. “As we navigate through these challenging times of social distancing, online training has been developed to ensure that we are able to continue to serve those in need.

“In addition, our disaster services personnel are planning for future hazards that may happen as a result of the pandemic.” Visit getprepared.gc.ca for more resources to help you and your family prepare for all types of emergencies.

May 3 to 9, 2020 was Emergency Preparedness Week. “Emergency Preparedness Week is an annual event coordinated by Public Safety Canada,” says Perron Goodyear, The Salvation Army’s territorial director of emergency disaster services.

“Using the theme ‘Are you Ready?’ The Salvation Army encourages Canadians to be prepared for potential hazards such as flooding, wildfires, tornadoes and the current global pandemic.” Disasters may be beyond our control, but there are ways to reduce the impact of whatever emergency we might face. This includes: Developing a plan for your family and purchasing or making an emergency kit that ensures you can be self-sufficient for at least 72 hours following a disaster. The EDS teams provide emergency feeding, emotional and spiritual care, support workers, emergency shelter assistance, donations management and assistance during a crisis.

As one of Canada’s major emergency relief organizations, the Salvation Army is often assigned specific roles by emergency preparedness authorities. Even with the ability to be flexible and to respond based upon the community’s situation, there are several basic services that The Salvation Army offers. These services form the core of The Salvation Army’s Emergency Disaster Services program: Food & Hydration; Emotional & Spiritual Care; Donations Management; Disaster Social Services and Long-Term Recovery.

“As we continue to maintain our physical and social distance and avoid many of those activities we’ve grown accustomed to, it can seem like the world is standing still, but in reality, things are changing quickly,” says Brian Choo, General Manager of Abbotsford’s OpenRoad Toyota.

As local businesses navigate that rapidly evolving reality, some benefits for customers have emerged.

Designated an essential service early on, the Toyota team moved quickly to take steps to help ensure the safety of both customers and staff. “We’re currently operating at about 75 per cent of capacity, so the need is there,” Choo says.

As service department technicians worked to ensure frontline employees could get to work and others had transportation for their essential needs, the OpenRoad team engaged with customers to determine which measures they wanted to see.

“We continue tracking people’s requests, and all the feedback we receive, to see where the need is and how we can best deliver that,” Choo says.

Some measures – like the contactless drop-off/pick-up and online payments – have been so well-received, they’ll likely continue post-COVID. And the dealership continues to adapt with new ideas to make life just a little easier for customers.

“People appreciate the steps we’re taking, not only to address health and safety concerns, but to make the service process easier.”

Choo is also eyeing changes for sales. Moving to an “all-in” pricing model, would allow customers to view the available inventory online, find a vehicle they like, then see exactly what their payments will be, taxes and fees included. “Consumers want that clarity. They’ll know the cost up-front, then they can come in for a test-drive. It streamlines the process.”

Here’s a look at other safety measures at the local dealership:

For now, the sales department is open by appointment only, with in-person meetings following social distancing protocols, but the team is also happy to speak with clients by phone or video conferencing. In the service department, drop-off and pick-up procedures are touch-free and all technicians wear disposable gloves. Vehicles in for servicing receive seat protectors, keys are handled through plastic and all surfaces are disinfected. A Health and Safety Officer ensures the best standard of cleanliness and health and safety practices. Additional hand sanitizer dispensers are available; increased sanitization protects high-traffic touch points, along with professional daytime cleaning service during peak times and nightly cleaning. All hard and soft surfaces inside service car loaners and test-drive vehicles are vacuumed and wiped down each time anyone uses them.

These and other measures continue OpenRoad Toyota’s commitment to delivering what customers want.

“We always try to learn how the customer wants to interact with us, and what services they need. We were doing before COVID, and we’ll continue doing afterward,” Choo explains. “If you need us, we’re here.”

The Sleuth hears that it’s a possibility, although the vehicle takes inspiration from the rugged-looking all-wheel-drive TJ Cruiser concept from 2017. It combines the usefulness and utility of a sliding-side-door people mover with the ability to go where regular minivans fear to tread. The concept has three rows of seats that, other than the driver’s chair, fold perfectly flat. The likely engines for the home market of Japan include a 2.0-litre four-cylinder and an optional hybrid system, but bet on something more potent for North America. Should it get the green light — your intrepid gumshoe expects an announcement in May — TJ Cruiser production likely would start in 2022.

Performance Corvette models are lining up, topping out at 1,000 horsepower:

The word reaching The Sleuth is that Chevrolet will unleash several higher-output versions of its new mid-engine sports car. The first to arrive, for the 2022 model year, will be the Z06, fitted with a 5.5-litre double-overhead-cam V-8 making 650 horsepower and 600 pound-feet of torque. In base form, the Corvette makes 495 horsepower. For the 2023 model year, the Corvette Grand Sport hybrid will arrive with the base 6.2-litre V-8 plus two electric motors producing a combined 600 horsepower and 500 pound-feet of torque. Then comes the 2024 ZR1, with 850 horsepower and 825 pound-feet of torque. Lastly, the Zora hybrid — named for engineer Zora Arkus-Duntov, who is considered the spiritual father of the Corvette — is slated for the 2025 model year and gets a twin-turbocharged version of the Z06’s engine plus an electric motor for the front wheels. Total system output is 1,000 horsepower and 975 pound-feet.

The timeline for rolling out all the performance variations of the new Corvette stretches to the 2025 model year. Photo: Chevrolet

The Fusion returns for 2021, as a wagon:

The Sleuth hears that the sole Ford sedan will be terminated sometime during the 2021 model year, or possibly before that. Replacing it will be the Fusion Active wagon that’s based on the Mondeo that the automaker sells in Europe. The Active label refers to the vehicle’s standard all-wheel-drive plus added ground clearance and body cladding for off-road suitability. The vehicle also appears to be taking direct aim at Subaru’s successful Outback wagon. The powertrain options include a turbocharged 2.0-litre four-cylinder that’s connected to an eight-speed automatic transmission. A hybrid will be available shortly after launch with a 188-horsepower system from the 2020 Fusion sedan. A $30,000 base price is anticipated for the U.S. market, but there’s no Canadian estimate yet.

Hyundai expands the N performance brand:

Following the arrival of the hot-hatch Veloster N, there’s word that the compact Kona utility vehicle will receive a similar treatment. The Sleuth hears that the Kona N will be fitted with the same turbocharged 2.0-litre four-cylinder engine as the Veloster N, which is rated at 275 horsepower and 260 pound-feet of torque. The Kona’s standard engine is a 2.0-litre four-cylinder that makes 147 horses and 132 pound-feet. The optional engine is a 175-horsepower turbocharged 1.6-litre. Although the Veloster N comes with a six-speed manual transmission or an available eight-speed automatic, The Sleuth expects the latter to get the nod in the Kona N when it launches in 2021 as a 2022 model.

Volvo’s Polestar division readies a lower-priced e electric sedan:

The Sleuth was concerned that the $200,000-plus cost of the electric Polestar 1 Coupe, which arrived for 2019, meant that any future models would be priced out of reach for most EV enthusiasts. They Spymaster is pleased to report that the new Polestar 2 sedan will start at $70,000 in Canada, plus destination charges. There’s also word that a less expensive version will join the lineup following a late-2020 launch. The built-in-China all-wheel-drive Polestar 2’s electric motors produce 408 horsepower and 487 pound-feet of torque. The automaker claims they can propel the car to 60 mph (96 km/h) from rest in less than five seconds.

Ups and downs

Up: Virtual auto racing:

Viewers can catch this season’s NASCAR, Formula One, Formula E and Indycar racing on various sports channels. Of course, due to COVID-19 restrictions, the competing drivers aren’t seated in actual racing machines, but instead are piloting simulated cars around virtual racetracks from the comfort and safety of their homes. According to published reports, TV viewership for these events is strong.

Down: Another sedan bites the dust:

Toyota’s Lexus division has announced that 2020 will be the last model year for the midsize GS sedan. In its final iteration, the GS is equipped with a 311-horsepower 3.5-litre V-6, while a 467-horsepower 5.0-litre V-8 is available in the GS F variant. The final 200 GS models will come in Black Line Special Edition trim.

Photo: Mazda

The CX-30 is a smart play on Mazda’s part and could be a smart buy for anyone seeking flair and finesse in a useful package

Achieving mastery in the utility-vehicle segment is not necessarily defined by the automaker that sells the most, but by which one, or ones, best combine styling, spaciousness and driving competency.

By that measure, the current trio of Mazda models — the CX-3, CX-5 and CX-9 — are highly regarded.

Despite what the name implies, the new CX-30 plugs a noticeable gap between the 3 and the 5. As for the tale of the tape for a vehicle that should be called the CX-4: About 13 centimetres longer than the three and 15 centimetres shorter than the CX-5.

Why is it called the CX-30? Apparently because Mazda already makes a CX-4, although not for this market.

In terms of cargo capacity, aft of the front seats, the CX-30 offers only slightly greater room than the CX-3. That’s due in part to a sloped liftgate, which gives the newcomer a sportier silhouette but cuts into stowage room (with the split-folding rear seat up or lowered). This is big deal because one of the CX-3’s shortcomings — and therefore one of the reasons to move up to the CX-30 — is cargo room.

Fortunately, the rear door is relatively wide and the cargo floor is quite low (unlike in the CX-3) to accommodate bulkier objects.

When viewed head-on, the CX-30’s visually appealing grille and elongated hood — part of the Kodo design language — appear to be lifted straight from the CX-5.

As you would expect, the CX-30’s passenger volume falls between that of the 3 and 5. The control panel and standard 23-centimetre touch-screen — appearing partially sunken into the dashboard — is also similar to the CX-5’s unit.

Elsewhere, Mazda focused on a quiet cabin. Along with added insulation, the sound system’s low-frequency speakers, which are normally placed in the lower front-door panels, are moved upward and closer to the pull handles. The automaker claims this means more bass plus a reduction in outside noise leaking in through the speaker grilles.

The base CX-30 engine is a 2.0-litre four-cylinder with 155 horsepower and 150 pound-feet of torque. Optional is a 2.5-litre four-cylinder that produces 186 horsepower and 186 pound-feet. Both engines are connected to six-speed automatic transmissions.

Front-wheel-drive is standard for both engines, and all-wheel-drive is optional for both.

Fuel consumption for the FWD 2.0 is rated at 8.9 l/100 km in the city, 7.1 on the highway and 8.1 combined.

A new AWD feature is the Off-Road mode that assists traction on rough/uneven/loose surfaces.

Pricing in Canada starts at $26,000, including destination charges, for the base CX-30 GX. That’s $3,000 higher than the CX-3’s base, but the CX-30 includes extra-cost content such as an 22.3-centimetre screen, heated front seats, LED headlights, 16-inch alloy wheels and eight-speaker audio. Also standard is blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert.

The midgrade GS comes with the 2.5-liter engine plus dual-zone climate control, 18-inch wheels and a heated steering wheel. There’s also a much larger grouping of key active-safety tech, including adaptive cruise control, pedestrian detection, lane-departure warning, inattentive-driver alert and emergency braking.

The top-line GT trim level comes with all-wheel-drive plus a 12-speaker Bose-brand audio package, heated front seats with power adjustment (including lumbar support and memory settings) for the driver.

You also get leather seat inserts, power moonroof, power liftgate, adaptive (left-right pivoting) headlights and head-up display that projects speed and other information onto the windshield.

Note than the GT’s 2.5-litre engine includes cylinder deactivation that shuts down two cylinders during light cruising to save fuel.

For the 2020 model year, every CX-30 (as does every new Mazda in Canada) comes with an unlimited-kilometre warranty with three years of comprehensive coverage (including roadside assistance), five-years of powertrain and seven years of anti-perforation (rust-through) coverage.

As buyers continue to gravitate to utility vehicles, the CX-30 is a smart play on Mazda’s part and could be a smart buy for anyone seeking flair and finesse in a useful package.

What you should know: 2020 Mazda CX-30

Type: Front- / all-wheel-drive compact utility vehicle

Engine (h.p.): 2.0-litre DOHC I-4 (155); 2.5-litre DOHC I-4 (186)

Transmission: Six-speed automatic

Market position: The CX-30 gives Mazda four utility vehicles to cover a wide range of size and price. It fills a critical spot in the lineup between the CX-3 and the CX-5.

Points: Slightly less practical (but better looking) than the CX-5, but a nice option to the CX-3. • Interior remains spacious for people and cargo, despite the smallish dimensions. • Stout optional engine is the same one installed in the heavier CX-5, so it should perform well with less heft to haul around.

• Well priced considering the lengthy list of base content.

Active safety: Blind-spot warning with cross-traffic backup alert (std.); active cruise control (opt.); emergency braking (opt.); drowsy-driver alert (opt.)

L/100 km (city/hwy) 8.9/7.1(2.0, FWD); Base price (incl. destination) $26,000

BY COMPARISON

Honda HR-V

Base price: $26,100

Smallest of Honda’s utility model provides a versatile space for cargo stowage.

Chevrolet Trax

Base price: $27,600

Tall, stubby model uses a modest 138-h.p. engine. Replacement due for 2021.

Kia Soul

Base price: $23,350

New second-generation wagon is roomy, stylish and affordable, but no AWD.

Give new life to your tired, worn out cabinetry, millwork and furniture

If you love the style and colour of your kitchen cabinets, but hate their worn appearance, the solution may be easier and more affordable than you think!

Cabinet refinishing can return the look you love at a fraction of the time and cost of new cabinets, explains Tracy Booth, who has been professionally refinishing cabinets for more than 30 years.

“Are you wanting to spend $30,000 or are you wanting to spend $2,000?” asks Booth, owner of Gleam Guard Cabinet Refinishing, serving Chilliwack and the Lower Mainland region.

While cabinets can go slightly lighter or darker, Booth emphasizes that his focus is on returning the cabinets to their original appearance, not changing their appearance.

“Wood has character and we want to preserve that character. Our goal is to restore, not change,” Booth says.“If areas have gotten dull or worn, we can fix that. That’s what makes us cabinet refinishers. A Gleam Guard trained professional can tint and make them look like new, which is a very technical skill.”

Technique and experience matters

The distinction is important, as refinishing – compared to simply painting or staining – takes a unique skillset. “It’s important people know that the person who is in their kitchen has the training to do the perfect matching,” notes Booth, whose Gleam Guard is BBB-accredited with an A+ rating.

“While we repaint painted cabinets; we do not paint brown cabinets white.”

To ensure the perfect, long-lasting finish, preparation is key. A Gleam Guard trained professional begins by prepping the surface with a vigorous clean, then professionally matching and applying the new colour. To complete the process, a wood floor finish is applied for a long-wearing result, protecting your cabinets from hazards such as water damage, grease and dust (with the added benefit of being easier to clean and maintain).

The entire dust-free process takes only a day or two, and there’s no need to unload your cabinets – easy!

Not just for kitchen cabinets … or wood

For those who’ve chosen a different material for their cabinets, you’ll find help here, too!

“We also do laminate refinishing – any product that your cabinets are made of, we can clean it and put a fresh finish on it,” Booth says.

In fact, all interior millwork can be refinished, so think beyond the kitchen to your built-in bookshelves, doors, windowsills, furniture and more.

To learn more, visit gleamguardcabinetrefinishing.ca. The Gleam Guard team is working during the current COVID precautions, taking steps to keep staff and clients safe, but for those who are self-isolating, Booth is happy to make appointments for later this summer.

After all, as first century Latin writer Publilius Syrus said, anyone can hold the helm when the sea is calm.

Oh, if only Publilius could see us now.

On all scales – local, regional, national and global – the pandemic has exposed those who fancy themselves as leaders but lack the talent, skill and character that true leadership requires.

But we’ve also seen people instill confidence and inspiration by rising to the occasion with a bold sense of control and decisiveness, putting the needs and wants of their communities ahead of their own.

Thankfully, we here in Surrey don’t have to look too far to see examples of such leaders – in fact, they’re just west of Scott Road.

From all accounts, Delta’s city council, under the direction of Mayor George Harvie, has acted with integrity, accountability, empathy, humility, resilience, vision, influence and positivity throughout the pandemic.

After working closely with Delta North MLA Ravi Kahlon to ensure a quick and decisive state of emergency declared in his city, Harvie also immediately requested that the province give local governments the authority to extend payment deadlines for the collection of fees and taxes without any penalty to residents and businesses.

A few days later, Delta’s mayor and council pushed the deadline for residents to pay their utility fees amid the COVID-19 outbreak. As reported by the North Delta Reporter, Delta council held special meetings on March 20 and 23, where it unanimously passed a bylaw to defer the late payment penalty deadline for 2020 flat rate utility bills.

Then, in a true proactive fashion, Delta council unanimously approved a bylaw on April 14 allowing the city to borrow up to $35 million to cover any delays in property tax revenue caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

“This is a very prudent financial thing to do as far as it’s a safety net for us in the City of Delta,” city manager Sean McGill said in a special meeting.

SEE ALSO: Delta mayor asks B.C. government to support local media

Around that time, in mid-April, Harvie also wrote a letter to premier John Horgan, asking the province to support local media hit hard by the financial impact of COVID-19.

“Local businesses, which are the prime source of revenue for local newspapers, are struggling like never before,” Harvie wrote. “Without advertising revenue from these businesses, the essential service provided by local media may not survive this crisis. Without local media, our democratic institutions will be severely weakened — the fourth estate is vital for a vibrant democracy.

“We ask that you include consideration for local media in provincial stimulus and recovery funding.”

And Harvie backed up those words with action. In a time when some cities reduced their support for local media, the City of Delta actually increased its advertising in the North Delta Reporter, filling it with full-page advertisements that communicated vital COVID-19 information to residents.

Then, in late April, Delta council approved a revised budget designed to save the city, and residents, some cash during the economic turmoil caused by COVID-19. The revised 2020 financial plan included a decrease in the city’s planned property tax increase, from 3.5 per cent to 1.75 per cent.

While the revised budget did defer some capital projects, it reflected a new priority – providing financial relief to residents and businesses while still providing sufficient funding for base city service levels.

SEE ALSO: City of Delta staff, mayor and council donate over $30,000 to local charities

In May, Delta’s mayor, council and city staff stepped up to help local charities through a staff fundraising campaign called Delta4Delta. The campaign’s goal for its opening weekend was $5,000, which was nearly tripled out of the gate and has so far raised nearly $20,000.

Finally, and most recently, Harvie announced he had reached into his own pocket to help his city’s most vulnerable.

“Some of the cities have taken that 10 per cent, and they call it a symbolic reduction in their salaries. I don’t support that because all it does is go to general revenue — it doesn’t get out there in the community at all,” Harvie said during a virtual townhall meeting on May 14.

”So my wife Gillian and I decided last month to donate 10 per cent of my annual remuneration, and we donated $16,000 to, divided between the Delta Hospital [and Community Health] Foundation, recognizing that all of their major events have been cancelled because the COVID, and to Deltassist, specifically towards their Starfish Backpack Program.

“I’d like to impress upon … all our community members — if you can, reach out and provide some financial assistance to our community service groups. They need it more than ever right now.”

I’ll tell you what we need, Mayor Harvie – more leaders like you.

More leaders like you.

79,79,79,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/some-canadians-will-be-receiving-smaller-cerb-payments-in-june-here-s-why-1.4998144,Some Canadians will be receiving smaller CERB payments in June. Here's why.,,2020-06-24,"TORONTO -- When Erin O’Brien opened up her email last week, she was shocked to find a notice from the federal government informing her that she would not receive her Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) payment the following week.

The Ottawa mother said the email explained that she was receiving the smaller amount in June because she was given a $2,000 advance when she collected her first CERB payment in April.

“I didn’t realize that this was even going to happen,” she told CTVNews.ca during a telephone interview from her home in Ottawa on Wednesday. “I thought it would just be all in the end that they would fix things. Not halfway through.”

O’Brien is far from alone in her surprise at the sudden reduction in CERB payments this month.

Dozens of Canadians have written in to CTVNews.ca to share how they, too, received word from the government last week notifying them that they weren’t eligible for the full $2,000 in June because of the earlier advance.

Kimberly Drew said she will only be receiving $500 this month, instead of the $2,000 she was expecting because of the advance payment she collected in April.

“It was not explained well when the payment came out so it was a bit of a shock,” she said. “I am frustrated.”

WHY ARE THERE REDUCED PAYMENTS NOW?

According to one of the Service Canada emails a CERB claimant received and forwarded to CTVNews.ca, the extra $2,000 that some people collected at the beginning of the program was an “advance of four weeks of the CERB, which was issued in order to get money in your pocket as quickly as possible.”

“Because of this advance, you will not receive a payment when you complete your next report. This is equivalent to the first two-week period of the advance. Please continue completing reports. This shows that you are eligible for all weeks of the CERB, including the four weeks of the benefit covered by the advance payment,” the message continued.

The notice also informed claimants that CERB would be extended by another eight weeks with a maximum payable amount of $12,000 over 24 weeks, which equals $2,000 per month for 6 months.

Ashley Michnowski, the director of communications for Employment Minister Carla Qualtrough, explained that CERB was initially intended to be available for a total of 16 weeks to a maximum of $8,000 before the extension.

Because those Canadians who were eligible for Employment Insurance (EI) received an extra $2,000 when the CERB benefit began, they had reached their maximum payable amount in June.

“As a result, starting the week of June 8th, some people would have received their full $8,000 initial CERB entitlement for the first initial 16 weeks and will therefore not receive a regular CERB payment this month,” Qualtrough’s spokesperson said in a statement to CTVNews.ca on Wednesday.

The minister’s office said eligible CERB claimants will receive money again at the beginning of July at the start of the next pay period now that the benefit has been extended for an additional eight weeks.

“In order to ensure claimants receive the available funding through the extension of CERB, they should continue to complete their biweekly reports,” the statement said.

'CLEAR, CONCISE, AND CONSISTENT DIRECTION'

There was some initial confusion when the CERB benefit was first rolled out in April because some claimants received more money than others.

For example, some people who applied for both employment insurance (EI) and CERB received two payments, even though no one is eligible to receive payments from both programs simultaneously.

As another example, those who were already on EI may have also received more than the initial $2,000 CERB payment when they were switched over to the new program because of residual EI benefits they had already qualified for.

At the time, Qualtrough reassured Canadians the additional deposits were not mistakes and recipients would be contacted about next steps.

“The CRA and Service Canada are working together to ensure that these situations are reconciled and payments do not exceed the maximum amount allowed per individual of $8,000 over a 16-week period,” she said in early April.

“So it won't necessarily be a clawback situation. It might be, but you can’t apply for more than the $8,000.”

However, days earlier Treasury Board President Jean-Yves Duclos created some confusion when he said the double payments were paid retroactively for the four-week period dating back to March 15, the first day people could apply for CERB.

A spokesperson from Qualtrough’s office clarified later that week that individuals who received $4,000 collectively from both the EI and CERB program would be contacted.

Conservative employment critic MP Dan Albas said the confusion and panic some Canadians are experiencing now could have been avoided if they were told what the $2,000 advance was for when they first received it.

“We recognize that during a crisis things happen quickly, but it’s really up to the government to provide clear, concise, and consistent direction,” he told CTVNews.ca during a telephone interview on Wednesday.

Albas said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has had multiple opportunities during his daily press briefings to bring Canadians up to speed on this issue and to let those people who received extra payments know what is expected of them.

“That would have been the responsible thing to do because ultimately, leaders take responsibility for mistakes,” he said. “And unfortunately, people are now at the end of the month just before the rent comes due, are being told that they will have considerably less support than they were planning.”

NDP MP and employment critic Daniel Blaikie echoed those sentiments when he said that it is “inexcusable” the government hasn’t made more of an effort to provide them with proper notice. He said it would have been easy to put up a reminder about the upcoming reduced payments on the Service Canada website a month ago for people to see when they log in to file their biweekly reports to claim their benefits.

Blaikie also said that he doesn’t understand why the government is reclaiming that advance money now when they have extended the program by another eight weeks.

“There is no need to do this right now,” he said during a telephone interview with CTVNews.ca on Wednesday. “They’re [the government] going to collect the money one way or another eventually. Doing it in a way that gives Canadians as much lead time as possible benefits CERB recipients and I don't think it does any harm to the government.”

144,144,144,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/it-s-extremely-dire-legions-at-risk-of-closing-forever-1.4995224,"Legions across Canada could close permanently, asking feds to help",,2020-06-22,"OTTAWA -- Royal Canadian Legion halls across the country have been shuttered for months due to COVID-19, and now a number of them are facing the prospect of never being able to reopen.

With most ineligible for the host of federal aid programs being offered to help keep other businesses and charitable organizations afloat, hundreds of these facilities could be forced to shut their doors forever without federal intervention.

Legions are often seen as the heart of many communities -- where Remembrance Day celebrations are held and meals are made and delivered to those in need -- but because the pandemic has put a pause on events, it’s cut off crucial income streams like facility rentals that allow legions to keep their doors open to veterans and others.

It’s estimated that about 124 of the 1,381 Royal Canadian Legion branches across Canada are likely to close permanently, and another 357 are facing financial hardship.

“We're a 95-year-old organization. And in that 95 years, we have prided ourselves on being self-sufficient, we have not reached out for funding. But these are unprecedented times,” National Executive Director Steven Clark said.

The Royal Canadian Legion has written to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s office twice, informing him of the gaps in the current federal aid offerings, and says they have yet to receive a response. The Prime Minister’s Office disputes that claim, confirming at least one response has been sent.

A government source told CTV News a reason the legions can’t get funding is because their programs are not directly related to the fight against COVID-19, though thousands of businesses have been able to access billions of federal aid dollars to make ends meet amid the pandemic.

In an email to CTV News, spokesperson for the Office of the Minister of Families, Children and Social Development Jessica Eritou pointed to the Emergency Community Support Fund as something legions that support veterans “may” qualify for to adapt their programs, and committed to “work with organizations to ensure they have the support they need to support Canadians.”

However, that program is offered to help adapt programming in the era of COVD-19 and the Royal Canadian Legion says that it’s their understanding based on conversations with federal officials that it can’t be used to cover operational costs, which is their biggest need right now.

They are calling on the federal government to expand the program’s parameters or allow them to access some other funding option to help pay for costs like rent and utilities.

While some branches may have employees on their payroll and could be eligible for some assistance, most are volunteer-run.

“We've had, of our 1,381 branches 167 have applied for federal assistance programs, but unfortunately only 55 have received that funding so it's still a very small percentage,” Clark said.

Local branches have been given some emergency reserve funding from the national headquarters, and have turned to crowdfunding initiatives but still the money is running out. While millions of dollars are donated every year through the National Poppy Campaign, this money can’t be used to cover the operational costs associated with keeping these facilities open.

While legions have been struggling for years to attract new members, having to close due to the pandemic could prove to be the final straw for many.

The branch in Kenora says it can only last a few more months before its closure becomes permanent.

“It’s extremely dire. We were good for the short haul, but as this keeps going, and we don’t know really where the light at the tunnel is going to be, we’re just not going to be able to survive,” said President of the Kenora Legion Jerry Lava.

“We’re depleting our savings now to make sure we can maintain our expenses. We’ve mothballed pretty well everything in the branch we could,” Lava said.

In a statement to CTV News, spokesperson for Veterans Affairs Canada John Embury said that the department’s response to the pandemic “is ongoing, and we will continue to explore ways to ensure that we’re providing Canadians and our community partners with the support they need.

Branches like this are the first point of contact for veterans and offer them crucial services and support, and that’s why so many are worried about what the future holds.

“I come to the legion and I meet old friends, and the comradery. It’s a place where you come and tell your story,” said Joel VanSnick, who is the Royal Canadian Legion’s district commander for the Ottawa-area which includes 62 branches.

“Once our legions are shut down, they’re gone... Where are veterans going to go to meet?” he said.",[]
145,145,145,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/inside-the-covid-19-commons-liberals-pass-key-spending-before-summer-sittings-1.4987560,Inside the COVID-19 Commons: Liberals pass key spending before summer sittings,'Rachel Aiello',2020-06-17,"OTTAWA -- The federal government has passed billions of dollars in spending measures during a special House of Commons sitting, with the backing of enough opposition MPs to not prompt formal standing votes.

The conclusion of the special sitting marks the end of more routine gatherings of MPs, with the next time the House convenes set for early July.

Through a series of oral approvals, MPs signed off on approximately $87 billion in funds to tie over federal departments and, in this case, COVID-19 aid programs until the fall. The agreement to pass the funding was given “on division,” meaning no recorded vote was required.

The two spending bills were the first chance since the pandemic shut down the regular sittings for MPs to indicate whether or not they still have confidence in the Liberal minority, though the sitting came and went without that opportunity being taken.

The Liberals’ commitment to an extension of a key COVID-19 aid program, the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, was what secured them the support needed to pass the supplementary estimates -- otherwise known as supply or the next cycle of scheduled and new federal spending.

Because of the Liberals’ minority standing, they needed to have the backing of at least one of the other parties in order to pass the spending measures, and the stakes were considerably higher in this instance because any votes that have to do with money, such as the federal budget or the estimates, are traditionally considered confidence votes.

In any parliament, a government lives so long as it maintains the confidence of the House of Commons. This confidence is demonstrated each time a key vote passes.

Approving the funding comes after both the Bloc Quebecois and NDP signalled they were not interested in seeing MPs line up to cast ballots amid a pandemic -- which could have happened if the Liberals lost Wednesday’s confidence votes and a snap election was called.

JUST 40 SITTING DAYS IN LAST YEAR

Wednesday’s sitting marked the 40th day there has been some form of an actual of House of Commons sitting in the last year, which did include the usual suspension over the summer of 2019 and then the fall federal election campaign.

Though after that October vote, the Liberals waited until December to reconvene the House.

CTVNews.ca asked Government House Leader Pablo Rodriguez last week about the limited number of sitting days and, as a result, the limited number of government mandate items that have been able to progress. He said the time taken pre-pandemic to adjust to the minority reality was necessary and no one could have anticipated a global health crisis would hit.

“We suggested a very ambitious agenda, a very complete throne speech, with everything that comes with it, and then we had COVID,” Rodriguez said. “But even with COVID, we adapted.”

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said once again Wednesday that the agreement to sit under the current structure was reached with the backing of the NDP and Greens, and defended the Liberals’ approach to Parliament.

“Three different parties came together to make a determination of what Parliament would do,” Trudeau said.

“Every time something doesn't go their way an opposition party cries, ‘oh no’ and it's a dictatorship all of a sudden. It's sort of irresponsible and it undermines I think the strength of our democracy that we've been able to show through this crisis,” said the prime minister during his Rideau Cottage press conference.

SPECIAL COMMITTEE COMING TO AN END

Before the special sitting got underway, MPs held their second last meeting of the special all-party COVID-19 committee of MPs. The committee is the first real experiment with a hybrid parliamentary sitting in the House chamber, but that experiment is nearly over.

As has been the case in the 23 of these meetings so far, MPs offered up statements and riding-specific petitions, before going through a question period-style session where the Liberals were grilled on the shortcomings in their COVID-19 plans and on other key policy matters.

In the motion passed on May 16, which put in place the structure of the summer sittings, MPs voted to cease the special committee after Thursday’s meeting. Its end will also mark the end of some form of MPs meeting four days a week, with them not all together until the first of four special sitting days in July.

As of June 18, the special committee will cease to exist, leaving just the four gatherings— July 8, July 22, Aug. 12, and Aug. 26— before the prospect of a more ‘normal’ House of Commons could convene come Sept. 21.

And as Trudeau announced on Wednesday morning, the July 8 sitting will also be where Finance Minister Bill Morneau will present “an economic and fiscal snapshot.”

STUDYING REMOTE VOTING, RULE CHANGES

One of the major limitations that has yet to be worked out is how to allow MPs to vote remotely.

This question is one that the Procedure and House Affairs (PROC) committee has been diving deeper into and evaluating how a formal hybrid House of Commons session could occur, the rule changes required to allow that, and what it would take to implement a remote voting system. The committee has been given a June 23 deadline to report back to its colleagues.

The government—with the support of the NDP—has argued that Parliament has continued to function through the pandemic, noting that under the new structure, the government has faced more questions from the opposition than it would have under normal House sitting parameters.

However, the Conservatives, and to a certain degree the Bloc Quebecois, have characterized the special committee as essentially a knock-off of Parliament and called for a more robust resumption of sittings that would have allowed for more accountability on the massive government policies being rolled out, while respecting the health and safety of all on Parliament Hill.

So, it remains to be seen whether the recommendations out of PROC could result in a change of plans when it comes to the summer and fall sitting schedule.",[]

However, with eased restrictions the team, minus a few players caught abroad, is back on the pitch for restricted practices.

“Without contact, it's unrealistic in terms of decision making for the players, and pressure, but we are doing what we can,"" said Valour FC head coach and general manager, Robert Gale.

With only a third of the roster from the inaugural season returning for a second year with the club, the limitations have made it difficult for players to build chemistry, other than some video conference socials held during the lockdown.

""You're not obviously going to get the ball skills not playing with your teammates as much,” recently acquired midfielder, Fraser Aird said.

“But keeping yourself physically fit during the whole thing out running and stuff like that is key because we never know what's going to happen so we need to be prepared for that.""

Further to the challenge of running practices while maintaining physical distancing, is the fact that no one knows exactly what the league will decide when it comes to when, where and how it plans to forego a season, if it even does.

“What's it going to look like? Is it a tournament? Will we get any games in? All of those factors are still unknown, so I think it's been a challenge,” Gale said.

The uncertainty has challenged some players’ ability to keep focused, with no season opener in sight.

“It's probably most mental (the effects), the whole pandemic thing and getting used to it and coming back to training not knowing what the outcome is going to be or when we are going to get the call,"" Aird said about the challenges of training during the pandemic.

With no firm start date, Gale says his staff has been taking a “scientific approach” in preparing for a potential season, using a “sliding scale” to gauge how hard to push his players.

""We had one for a potential June first start, a potential July first start, and a potential August first start,” Said Gale.

“Obviously as more information becomes available then we kind of ramp it up towards competition.""

The airline announced Tuesday that it would end service to eight domestic cities and cancel 30 regional routes due to weak demand for both business and leisure travel in the midst of government-imposed travel restrictions and border closures.

In a statement, Air Canada said it expects the airline industry will take a minimum of three years to recover from the effects of the pandemic.

“As a consequence, other changes to its network and schedule, as well as further service suspensions, will be considered over the coming weeks as the airline takes steps to decisively reduce its overall cost structure and cash burn rate,” the company said.

In a statement sent to CTV News, Transport Minister Marc Garneau called the airline's decision an ""unfortunate development.""

""This decision by Air Canada will be very disappointing to the residents and communities affected by these service cuts. We understand the impact this will have on many Canadians across the country and we continue to work with Canadian airlines and airports during this challenging time,"" Garneau said in the statement.

Airports set to lose routes have also expressed disappointment in the decision.

Tiffany Chase, a spokesperson with Halifax Stanfield International Airport, told CTV News that “these interregional connections are very important to maintain [an] essential transport network and provides our travellers with more choice and opportunity.”

Three flight routes to Halifax are disappearing. Regina has also been hit by Air Canada’s decision, losing three routes as well.

James Bogusz, President and CEO of the Regina International Airport, said that this will have a financial impact on the airports themselves.

“We are heading towards having to draw on our line of credit at around September, maybe early October,” he told CTV News. “It’s a really challenging situation. So any lost flights’ revenue is another blow to the airport.”

Air Canada reported a net loss of $1.05 billion in the first quarter of 2020, including a net loss of $688 million in March alone.

Earlier this month, Air Canada CEO Calin Rovinescu was one of more than 130 signatories to an open letter calling on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the country’s premiers to loosen travel restrictions as the industry struggles to stay afloat.

In May, Air Canada predicted it would lose nearly $20 million per day in the second quarter as a result of pandemic border shutdowns. In response, the airline has reduced its workforce by approximately 20,000 employees, representing more than 50 per cent of its staff, through layoffs, severances, early retirements, and special leaves.

Starting tomorrow, they will also be booking middle seats on flights again, ending their policy on physical distancing in an attempt to pack planes once more.

Here is a list of the Air Canada routes that will be suspended indefinitely. The airline said they will contact affected customers and offer them options, such as alternative routings where available.

387,387,387,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/canada-extends-ban-on-foreign-travellers-to-july-31-1.5005997,Canada extends ban on foreign travellers to July 31,,2020-06-30,"OTTAWA -- The Canadian government has extended the current ban on most international travellers until July 31.

The federal government first shut the border to non-Canadian citizens, with limited exceptions, to limit the spread of COVID-19 in mid-March. The extension on the foreign travel ban was made through a federal order recommended by Health Minister Patty Hajdu, dated June 29.

The ban allows permanent Canadian residents, the immediate family members of Canadian citizens, as well as diplomats and air crews, to come into Canada, though anyone who has symptoms of COVID-19 will still not be allowed to enter Canada.

“The introduction or spread of the disease would pose an imminent and severe risk to public health in Canada, the entry of persons into Canada who have recently been in a foreign country may introduce or contribute to the spread of the disease in Canada, and no reasonable alternatives to prevent the introduction or spread of the disease are available,” reads the government’s reasoning for the ongoing ban, in part.

This ban exempts the United States, which entered into a separate agreement with Canada shortly after the halt on all other foreign travel. The U.S. travel restrictions have been renewed until July 21 at least, meaning that all discretionary travel remains prohibited.

“To protect Canadians and to ease the potential burden non-essential travellers could place on our health care system and its frontline workers, the CBSA has implemented travel restrictions across all ports of entry in all modes of transportation… All travel of an optional or discretionary nature, including tourism and recreation, is covered by these measures,” said Canada Border Services Agency spokesperson Rebecca Purdy in an email.

This decision to extend the ban comes after the European Union agreed to a set of recommendations that will allow travellers from other nations, including Canada, to visit EU countries. The United States did not make the list of safe countries.

Last week Global Affairs Canada issued a reminder to Canadians that despite some countries partially reopening their borders, the national advice remains to avoid all non-essential travel outside of the country.

The mandatory 14-day self-isolation for any non-essential worker entering Canada remains in effect, as do all other aspects of the Quarantine Act.

To help Canadians stuck abroad, the government offered travellers an emergency loan of up to $5,000 to get home, and after chartering flights to repatriate stranded Canadians the department says the “final few” flights will be scheduled in the coming weeks, with no further trips planned.",[]

""We knew that if we didn't do something, we are pretty sure it would not have made it to shore,"" Tricia Hurt told CNN. ""It was really huffing and puffing, my husband said.""

The family came up behind the bear, and Brian pulled on the tub but lost his grip -- but he realized the bear's ear was loose. They looped the boat back around, and after a final tug the bear was free and swam safely to shore.

Hurt said the whole ordeal lasted about five minutes.

""We were so excited! We did our good deed for the day. We will never ever do this again, and it felt good to help the poor bear. You don't like to see animals struggle,"" Hurt said.

When they got back to the resort bar, word of their courageous act had already spread thanks to some campers watching on the shore.

The Hurts learned from people at the bar that the bear had been running around with the tub on its head for three to four days.

The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources had been contacted several times but had been unable to locate it thanks to the rural, wooded landscape, Hurt said.

""We weren't going to put the video up,"" Hurt said. ""But we wanted everyone to know that the bear was OK.""

Bolton says, despite the ongoing and “clearly” political detention of Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, there shouldn’t be a “prisoner swap” some are suggesting.

“I know Canada's being abused now. Its citizens are being held without any reason what[so]ever by the Chinese authorities, and I know there's a debate about this in Canada. All I can say is, bear with us on this. It's important we stick together,” said Bolton told Evan Solomon in a radio interview about his newly released book memoir about working in Trump’s White House: The Room Where It Happened.

The full interview aired Tuesday on the national iHeartRadio talk show The Evan Solomon Show.

“If this is the way China treats a country like Canada now, imagine how it will treat Canada when its influence around the world has expanded,” Bolton said.

As The Associated Press has reported, Bolton’s book details his time in the White House, and includes several allegations including a claim that Trump asked China for help winning the upcoming presidential election.

Bolton also writes that Trump made matters worse by implying that Meng’s extradition could be used as a bargaining chip in trade negotiations.

Asked if the Trump administration was using Canada by asking the Trudeau government to act on the U.S. extradition order and arrest Meng in Canada in order for Trump to have leverage with China, Bolton said Trump was the only one in the administration to think of Meng’s arrest as a political tool in China trade talks.

“It would be a big mistake to trade a criminal prosecution against Huawei and its chief financial officer for some kind of trade deal with China, which honestly, I don't think China is going to abide by anyway,” Bolton said.

For U.S. politicians the trade-based argument against dropping the extradition proceedings is different than the current conversation unfolding in Canada, where 19 high-profile former diplomats, politicians and academics have all called on Canada to consider halting the extradition process in order to get ""the two Michaels"" released.

Kovrig and Spavor were arrested separately in the days following Meng's arrest. Both men had been held in China without charges from December 2018 until June 19 when they were formally charged with espionage.

When asked about a swap, the prime minister strongly shot down the idea saying, if countries around the world including China saw that “arbitrarily arresting random Canadians” would be leverage to “get what they want out of Canada,” that would put Canadians abroad at risk.

Asked whether he thought the arrests of Kovrig and Spavor was retaliatory, Bolton said: “I think it clearly was for political reasons.”

“I don't think it should be a prisoner swap,” Bolton said.

“Huawei is an arm of the Chinese State... It's heavily subsidized and guided by decisions of the Chinese government, and it's part of the of the Chinese effort to affect telecommunications and information technology systems all over the world,” Bolton said.

TRUMP 'TOLERATED' TRUDEAU

Among the revelations in the book was that, according to Bolton Trump doesn’t like Trudeau and that he “tolerated” him. Asked why he thought Trump allegedly is not a fan of the prime minister, Bolton cited the early tensions of the NAFTA renegotiations.

“Part of the problem with the way Trump approaches foreign policy, in my view, is that he has difficulty distinguishing between the national interest of the countries involved, let's say the U.S. and Canada on the one hand versus the personal relationship between the leaders of the two countries on the other,” Bolton said.

He said, in his view, Trump’s personal feelings towards Trudeau “made it a lot harder to get things done.”

One particularly acrimonious interaction was at the 2018 G7 summit Canada hosted in Charlevoix, Que. It was after that meeting that Trump pulled out of the joint communique before he and his administration officials took aim at Trudeau, calling him “meek and mild” and “very dishonest and weak.”

“Trump felt that he had been backed into a corner in the G7 communique… When he saw Prime Minister Trudeau giving a closing press conference, he thought that he was unfairly treated, that led him to withdraw the U.S. from the communique… But that was an example where that personal reaction to what was being said led to a consequence that made the subsequent NATO Summit, for example, even more difficult than it would have been anyway,” Bolton said.

'HOPED TO MAKE A CONTRIBUTION'

Bolton did not testify in the Trump impeachment trial, and he has been criticized for saving the accusations about his former boss for his book, which Trump’s lawyers tried to get stopped from being released.

Asked to respond to those who have said Bolton has lost his moral authority after withholding what he knew to cash in with his book, Bolton said it’s “completely wrong.”

“Look, if my objective in life had been to make money, I never would have worked for the administration of Ronald Reagan, George HW Bush, George W. Bush or Donald Trump,” Bolton said.

He said he joined the Trump administration because he didn’t think it could have been as bad as people were saying.

“I hoped to make a contribution. The book is the story of whether I succeeded in that or not,” he said.",[]

According to a survey done in May by Statistics Canada, almost one in seven (14.6 percent) Canadians indicated that they lived in a household where food insecurity was a problem. This number is up from 10.5 percent just two years ago.

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought distinct challenges to many sectors of the food supply chain that have reshaped their operations with physical distancing, the use of personal protective gear and equipment modifications – all of which are contributing to rising costs.

“To get food to market, companies across the supply chain will need to charge more,” Sylvain Charlebois of Dalhousie University’s food analytics lab told CTVNews.ca in an interview. “In the past, there wasn’t usually much relation between the food supply chain and retail costs, but now costs are going up all around because of COVID-19. That’s why food prices cannot drop.”

In 2017, the average Canadian household spent around $8,527 annually on food. The typical inflation rate is usually between 1.5 and 2.5 per cent. Charlebois expects that number to rise closer to four per cent once the pandemic is over.

“This fall will see the worst of it as some government programs like the CERB [Canada Emergency Response Benefit] come to an end. Then we will get the full economic picture of what we’re dealing with,” he says.

Charlebois said that the federal government is already pumping a large amount of money into the economy through the CERB and that any new financial aid programs would be unlikely. He suggested that more families will consider relocating outside of major cities in an attempt to reduce their cost of living.

Those likely to be impacted the most by the spike in food prices are Canadian families who were already financially vulnerable and struggling to make ends meet before the pandemic began. Statistics Canada found that Canadians with children are more likely to be in a food-insecure household.

Another contributing factor to food insecurity in Canada is race. According to FoodShare Toronto’s Executive Director Paul Taylor, Black and Indigenous Canadians are more likely to experience barriers to affordable food.

“We know that the people who suffer the most from food insecurity are Black and Indigenous people,” Taylor told CTVNews.ca. “Research shows that Black Canadians are 3.5 times more likely to be food-insecure.”

A study by FoodShare Toronto and the PROOF research team at the University of Toronto found that regardless of homeownership and immigration status, Black Canadians continue to suffer the most from food insecurity.

“Ultimately when we talk about food insecurity we’re also talking about racism against Black and Indigenous folks,” Taylor added. “As a country, we need to recognize that racism and anti-Black racism is having a significant impact on health outcomes and access to food.”

From a policy approach, Taylor points to measures that will improve the financial circumstances of low-income households, like a universal basic income and comprehensive services such as child and pharma care.

“We live in one of the richest countries in the world,” he says. “Canadians need a basic income and comprehensive social services. When working together these could have a meaningful impact on food insecurity.”",[]
461,461,461,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/lifestyle/simple-design-steps-can-take-your-garden-to-the-next-level-1.5003509,Simple design steps can take your garden to the next level,'John Raby',2020-06-28,"CHARLESTON, W.VA. -- The flower beds are finished, the vegetables are growing, and yet something could be missing from the backyard landscape: That “wow” factor.

Adding a personal touch to the lawn and garden doesn't have to be complicated or break the family budget. Homeowners can transform an ordinary looking landscape with some imagination, design, and perhaps the help of a local agriculture extension service, landscape professional or private nursery.

“A garden is really never finished,” said Jonathan M. Lehrer, chairman of the Department of Urban Horticulture and Design at Farmingdale State College on Long Island, New York. “Sometimes the most difficult thing is kind of taking that plunge and deciding you're going to develop an area or start a project.”

Some ideas that gardeners can use to start taking their yards to another level:

THE STARTING POINT

An arbour, pergola, lattice - even posts with netting wrapped around them - will grab attention, especially at a yard's entrance. It also adds height where homeowners normally think only about length and width, Lehrer said.

Adding clematis, climbing roses or honeysuckle along them will provide long periods of blooms.

Arbors decorated with lights can also define garden rooms and set up views to the space beyond, inviting exploration, said Katharine Pinney, a landscape contractor and designer in Los Angeles.

“Use them to lead your visitor through the garden,” Pinney said.

THE PATHWAY TO SUCCESS

A path with mulch, gravel, brick, pavers or flagstone with edging will encourage a stroll.

Pinney said the simpler the path's route, the better. But Lehrer suggests avoiding a straight, linear pathway.

“Trying to use more curves, twists and turns, that kind of adds the illusion of a longer length than it might be, that mystery of what might be around the next corner,” he said.

Pinney said the choice of pavers should reflect the architectural style of the house. But mixing materials, such as brick and flagstones, adds visual interest.

“In short, use your imagination!” Pinney said.

Placing decorative pots loaded with flowers along the way will create a focal point and add colour.

PLACES TO REST

Benches and tables are a must for homeowners wanting to make their yards a hangout. Having limited room shouldn't be a deterrent.

Pinney said she designs numerous small gardens because the old bungalow neighbourhoods in her area have narrow but deep lots.

“Dividing that narrow space into rooms makes the garden seem larger,” she said.

Pinney and Lehrer suggest building a fire pit, a cooking area, or a place for dining or simply to enjoy morning coffee.

GET PERSONAL

Pinney suggests incorporating items that reflect the homeowner's personality. One of her clients loved wine and held tastings with friends. Pinney said she planted wine grapes for the customer and used old wine bottles from restaurants to border a path.

Old brick from another customer's 1920s bungalow was incorporated into the border of an outdoor groundcover “rug.”

“A homeowner should think about what would make the garden a reflection of their personality and interests,” Pinney said.

Due to the coronavirus pandemic, Lehrer added, “I've seen people that are not going to be going to the beach. “So they're creating pool areas, adding inexpensive holiday lights and lanterns and bringing music outside.”

TIMBERRR!

Landscaping timbers can create tiered walls and stairs to bridge elevation levels in the backyard while creating more planting beds in between. They're also great for creating individual planters. Timbers are available in both natural and synthetic types.

Pinney said treated lumber secured with timber screws is best for terraces, but not for vegetable gardens.

AGREE TO TREE

Depending on the climate and sun requirements, consider planting small trees along the edges.

Japanese tree lilacs and crape myrtles provide vibrant summer colour. Trees with spring blooms include redbuds, white and pink dogwoods, flowering crabapples, ornamental pears and star magnolias. To get the earliest spring blooms, consider planting forsythias.

For northern climates, Lehrer strongly suggests the cornelian cherry dogwood. It has yellow flowers in the spring and red cherry-like fruit in late summer and early fall. The leaves turn red and orange in the fall, and as the tree ages, the outer bark peels, revealing a orange-brown colour.

“It's a four-season plant that is extremely tough,” he said.

WINGED FRIENDS

A big garden bonus is a visit from a butterfly or hummingbird. Plants that produce nectar and pollen can lure them in.

The 4-H Children's Garden at Michigan State University includes a butterfly house that is open in the spring. Education co-ordinator Jessica Wright said attracting butterflies means having compatible plants for the caterpillars they begin as. These can include fennel, dill and milkweed. Other flowering plants can act as butterfly magnets.

Among the plants that attract hummingbirds are bleeding hearts, cardinal flower, impatiens and petunias. Both butterflies and hummingbirds are drawn to bee balm, butterfly bushes and zinnia. Birds and butterflies do require water, so consider adding feeders or a bird bath.

“The interaction with nature is the next level,” Wright said. “It's great to see them enjoying your garden as well.”",[]
542,542,542,ctvnews,https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/what-you-need-to-know-about-toronto-s-mandatory-mask-policy-1.5006032,What you need to know about Toronto's mandatory mask policy,'Katherine Declerq',2020-06-30,"TORONTO -- Toronto will be making it mandatory to wear face masks while inside enclosed public spaces starting on Tuesday.

The motion was presented to city council last week—with the support of Toronto Mayor John Tory and Medical Officer of Health Dr. Eileen de Villa—in an effort to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 as more businesses start to reopen in the city.

Here's what you need to know:

When do you need to wear a mask?

According to the mayor, the masks will be mandatory in all public and enclosed indoor spaces. This means they will be required on public transportation such as the TTC and ferries to the Toronto Islands, as well as inside shops, grocery stores and malls.

Toronto residents will not need to wear masks while at home, eating on a restaurant patio and at most workplaces where physical distancing is possible. It would also not apply to child-care centres.

“It is about public spaces where the general public has free and ready access, to try and limit the risk,” de Villa said.

While not mentioned in the bylaw, health officials have previously said that residents should wear a mask anytime where it is challenging to social distance from others.

What happens if I can’t wear a mask for health reasons?

All health officials and politicians agree that if someone is suffering from a medical condition that makes it difficult to breathe or function while wearing a mask, they should not wear one. They ask that those people try their best to remain physically distanced from others while in public spaces.

Children under the age of two also do not have to wear a mask.

When will the bylaw take effect?

The bylaw will take effect on July 7 and last until the first city council meeting of the fall, which is scheduled for the end of September or early October. At that time, council will either extend the bylaw, amend it or discontinue it.

What does this mean for schools reopening in early September?

Local health officials say the decision about whether or not children or teachers wear masks while in school is up to the provincial government. The Ontario government, in response to the mandatory mask policy, has said that it is actually up to each individual school board to decide on classroom policies.

“Each board right across the province has the flexibility,” Ontario Premier Doug Ford said on Tuesday. “Everyone is going to have different guidelines.”

Will there be a fine for not wearing a mask?

The mayor admitted there would not be “aggressive enforcement” when it comes to the mask policy, but rather his government will focus on education.

“To be candid about it we don’t really have the resources to go around and look at every store and look at every person that is in one of those places,” he said. “We are going to rely on people by and large to get educated and to do the right thing.”

At the same time, Tory said that it is up to every business to have a policy in place to ensure compliance, suggesting a “no shirt, no shoes, no mask, no service” model.

Who else is doing this?

The mayors of Brampton, Mississauga and Caledon also announced on Tuesday they intend to pass similar bylaws requiring masks to be worn inside public spaces.

Brampton Mayor Patrick Brown said the bylaw in his city could be in effect by July 7.

No timeline has been provided for the bylaw in Mississauga or Caledon.

Why is it not mandated provincially?

The Ford government has said they will not be requiring the wearing of masks, but rather will encourage their use. Speaking on Tuesday, the premier said that the needs of regions like Peel and Toronto will be different from those in northern Ontario, which is why he can’t make masks mandatory.

“But each region has the authority to make their own rules,” he said. “I will support them on any decision that they make.”

Why is this policy necessary?

Experts have said that wearing a mask will prevent the wearer from spraying droplets on others, helping curb the transmission of the disease if they are asymptomatic.

De Villa said that requiring masks in indoor settings is essential to preventing the spread of COVID-19, but that compliance will need to be as high as 80 per cent in order to work.

“The reality is that the virus continues to circulate and that we still need to be careful,” she said.

Randy VanDerStarren was granted rare access to 60 locations in Toronto for the project, including attractions, sports fields, buildings and places of worship, to name a few.

Dubbed “TOgether,” the photos will be compiled into a book which will compare pictures of empty places in the city normally teaming with people and images of the same spaces as they reopen and see people return.

“You could get depressed, if you actually looked at all these empty buildings,” VanDerStarren told CTV News Toronto Monday. “I have a very rare lens that I get to look through to see that vitality come to life again.”

The ‘TO’ in ""TOgether"" is for Toronto and the project wouldn’t have been possible without VanDerStarren’s partner, Deputy Mayor Michael Thompson, who helped get permission to enter some the most tightly controlled places.

“While it was difficult with respect to the process, the fact of the matter is that we knew that the darkness that existed in the city as a result of COVID and everything being shutdown wasn’t permanent, but we really needed to capture that,” Thompson told CTV News Toronto.

“And at the same time, we needed to be aware as to what happens when we’re back again. We’re alive, we’re energized.”

Money raised throught the project is being directed to DonateTO –which is helping community organizations through the recovery.

VanDerStarren is volunteering his time for ""TOgether,"" and said being granted the access has been an honour and privilege.

”I hope the work we do not only captures these locations, but does it in a way that you, as a viewer, as readers will look at the book and will look at the gallery that will come out of this and say ‘that’s my city, and I’m part of its recovery, I’m part of overcoming this virus’, he said.

VanDerStarren said he hopes to finish taking the pictures of Toronto’s reopening by the fall and show off all the comparisons by the end of the year.",[]

Speaking at Queen’s Park on Tuesday, Ontario Premier Doug Ford responded to questions about a Greater Toronto Area mayor who called for the government to change its policy as certain regions were given the green light to reopen amid the COVID-19 pandemic and others were not.

“We have to encourage people,” Ford told reporters. “I’ll be having that conversation and I highly, highly recommend you go outside and you’re in large groups or you’re in shopping centres, wear a mask.”

The premier went on to say that while his government thinks wearing face coverings is “critical”, policing 14.5 million people would be “very, very difficult.”

“We just don’t have the manpower for bylaw and police officers to be chasing people without masks,” he said.

The Ford government released a new list of regions in Ontario that can advance to Stage 2 of the reopening phase on Monday.

As of this Friday, the only regions not allowed to move forward to Stage 2 are Toronto, Peel and Windsor-Essex. They will remain in Stage 1 until at least next week, when the province will reassess the data and decide if they are ready to move forward next Friday.

The areas excluded from moving forward to Stage 2 remain the province's COVID-19 hot spots. Ontario reported 184 cases of COVID-19 on Tuesday, 118 of which were recorded in Toronto, Peel and Windsor-Essex.

""For the regions still staying in Stage 1, Toronto, Peel and Windsor-Essex, we ask you please be patient because we can't let our guard down,"" Ford said on Monday.

The decision to reopen certain areas of the GTA has caused concern for some municipalities. Markham Mayor Frank Scarpitti, whose region borders Toronto, has called on the government to make the wearing of masks mandatory, saying that without a province-wide strategy areas that reopen may experience a spike in COVID-19 cases or a second wave.

“We need the same rules across the province of Ontario. It becomes difficult for the public to understand what a rule is in one jurisdiction versus another,” Scarpitti said.

“If the provincial government does not move forward making it mandatory to wear masks, I’m asking the retailers and even some of the restaurants to impose no masks, no service.”

Scarpitti added there would be exceptions for people with health conditions that make it difficult to wear a mask.

Ford told reporters that he will be speaking with Scarpitti Tuesday afternoon about his concerns.

At the same time, Ontario’s Minister of Health Christine Elliott said that guidance from health officials remains the same—physical distancing is still the most effective way to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

""The guidance we have received from the chief medical officer of health as well as the other public health experts at the command table is that the physical distancing is still the most important rule to follow, that we should continue to do that for the foreseeable future, and that masks should be worn in situations when that's not going to possible,” Elliott said.

""A number of retailers have decided that they want masks to be worn if people want to enter and that's the retailers right to do that. So it's not mandatory, it's recommended, again when physical distancing can't be achieved.""

Province releases guide for businesses reopening

The Progressive Conservative government also acknowledged on Tuesday that customers and workers may not feel confident visiting stores or providing services. In that light, the government has released a new downloadable “toolkit” offering tips and guidelines for employers reopening their businesses for the first time since the pandemic was declared.

The guide is meant to help businesses identify risks for transmitting the disease and create a safety plan to help control the spread of COVID-19. One hundred and thirty-three sector-specific labour guidelines will also be included in the toolkit.

“Over the past few weeks, we've taken steps to build the necessary confidence that will help everyone prepare, adapt and get our economy going again,” Ford said.

“That means giving employers confidence that they have what they have and can open their doors. It also means giving workers confidence and we have to give customers confidence and that is how we will get our economy roaring once again.""

Safety is top of mind as we reopen. Today we launched a new guide to help businesses develop safety plans, including these steps:

✅Identify risks

✅Determine next steps

✅Creating a plan

✅Implementation

✅Communication to staff and customers https://t.co/5oWhnwHxQ8 pic.twitter.com/omQ3xXj7Pn — Doug Ford (@fordnation) June 16, 2020

One month after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 situation a pandemic, researchers surveyed more than 1,400 parents to see how their children were faring.

Not only did parents report that 79 per cent of kids were spending more time on screens, only 2.7 per cent of kids were meeting the recommended 60 minutes of physical activity per day.

“We've got a lifestyle of our children and youth that is sub-optimal to begin with. Twelve to 15 per cent meeting healthy sleep, healthy screen time, healthy physical activity guidelines. And that's dropped by close to 80 per cent during the crisis,” Mark Tremblay, study co-author and researcher at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Research Institute, told CTV News.

“This has been collateral damage to the lifestyles of kids.”

The study, published in International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity this week, also found that 41 per cent of children were sleeping more -- a positive finding, according to Tremblay, but one that may be attributed to boredom.

Fifteen-year-old Aneira Cleur says without school and extracurricular activities to keep them occupied, she and her friends have become “pretty lazy.”

“A lot of them are just lying in bed all day,” Cleur, who considered herself fairly active before the pandemic, told CTV News.

Her 13-year-old sister, Kerri, says that without the need to go anywhere or the ability to see her friends, she lost her motivation to leave the house.

""It was frustrating because there was what we little we could do,"" their father, Adrian Gay, told CTV News. ""They really weren't keen on venturing out when we forced them to. So it was tough.""

But as COVID-19 restrictions begin to ease across the country, and warmer weather draws more kids outside, experts warn it may not be enough to recondition kids for a healthier lifestyle -- especially in the event of a second wave.

""This could be the new normal for quite some time,” Trembley explained.

“We simply can't afford to shrug our shoulders and say, ‘It's okay this is just the way it's going to be.’ The consequences of that would be fairly serious.""

Trembley notes that, on average, Canadian parents were already struggling to encourage their children to meet daily activity guidelines and have less screen time.

Earlier this week, a study commissioned by ParticipACTION to support the annual Report Card on Physical Activity for Children and Youth, found that, before the pandemic, Canadian children were barely getting a passing grade for overall physical activity.

According to that study, only 39 per cent of children aged five to 11 and youths aged 12 to 17 met the national physical activity guidelines.

“Already we had a challenge to try and increase the proportion of kids that are benefiting from healthy movement behaviours,” said Tremblay.

""Now we're going to have to rehabilitate the population somewhat just to get back to that already rather weak baseline.”

Moving forward in the pandemic, Tremblay says it’s imperative that health officials focus on the promotion of healthy behaviours as well as disease prevention.

""Wouldn't it be great if, as a result of this rather horrible circumstance, that on a population level, families, and the communities they live in recalibrate themselves to ones where healthy active living becomes much more normative than it has been in recent years in Canada,” he said.

Experts recommend that parents incorporate physical activity into daily routines as much as possible and look for opportunities to be active as a family, while setting limits around screen time in the home.",[]
566,566,566,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/this-drug-can-treat-90-per-cent-of-cystic-fibrosis-patients-but-it-s-not-available-in-canada-1.4991938,"This drug can treat 90 per cent of cystic fibrosis patients, but it's not available in Canada",,2020-06-19,"TORONTO -- Struggling to breathe is one of the main symptoms of the novel coronavirus that has recently swept across the country. But for Nicole Stringer, who suffers from cystic fibrosis, it's been the reality for her entire life.

For Stringer, every breath is a battle. Now, she's fighting for access to a drug that could change that.

The Kelowna, B.C. woman was born with cystic fibrosis (CF), a genetic disorder that causes mucus to clog her lungs and damages her organs. On top of that, Stringer is also infected with a superbug, a bacteria called Pseudomonas aeruginosa which can't be killed by antibiotics.

Stringer uses puffers, an oxygen machine and takes a hundred pills every day to control symptoms like fever and nausea. But she's still constantly in and out of hospital, and plagued by the knowledge that at any time, her lungs could fail.

Her best friend, also a CF patient, recently succumbed to the disease.

Stringer has tried every treatment -- including travelling to the U.S. to become the first Canadian CF patient to try an experimental treatment called phage therapy, which uses viruses to kill bacteria. No treatment so far has truly helped.

""I have developed resistance to almost all of the antibiotics that I can take,"" she told CTV News. ""So now I have lung infections that are just doing what they're going to do and I have nothing to fight them with anymore, so I am going to continue to get sicker.""

COVID-19 poses yet another risk to Stringer's life, and has kept her isolated indoors for months.

But she sees hope for her declining health in the form of a drug that is already improving the health of CF patients in the U.S.: Trikafta.

Cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in a specific gene, which create a faulty protein. Trikafta works by targeting that mutation to help the defective protein work more efficiently, with signs it can slow or even stop the progression of the disease.

""Within a week's time many people have had less mucus, they can run up the stairs, they can play with their kids, so it is a drug that's life changing, it's transformational for people with a fatal genetic disease,"" Kelly Grover, CEO of Cystic Fibrosis Canada, told CTV News.

Trikafta is a combination of three drugs: elexacaftor, tezacaftor, and ivacaftor. The therapy can potentially treat up to 90 per cent of CF patients, according to a press release by Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, the company behind the drug.

However, Stringer can't access it, because it's not approved in Canada.

""To have something that … is life-changing that it's right there, but we can't grab it, is the most frustrating thing of my life,"" she said.

Trikafta has made all the difference to Stephi Lee, an American artist and online influencer. Several American patients have documented significant improvements on their YouTube channels.

""Listen to this,"" Lee says in one video. She inhales. ""I didn't even cough.""

Part of the frustration for Canadian patients is that the drug was fast-tracked for approval in the U.S. last year, where studies show it helps to improve lung function by up to 14 per cent.

Grover said it was ""horrendous"" that we haven't seen any progress towards approving the drug here, considering it was approved so quickly within the U.S.

""In the U.K. they are fast-tracking its approval, Ireland and Switzerland have said they will fund it as soon as it becomes approved,"" she said. ""And so every country seems to be clamouring to get its hands on this drug for people with CF, and in Canada we can't even get it into Health Canada for safety reviews. So we're very concerned.

""Patients are really being held hostage in Canada because of that.""

Cystic Fibrosis Canada is calling on Canadian governments and regulators to collaborate with each other and manufacturer Vertex in order to accelerate the approval of Trikafta in Canada, so that it can be made available to patients there.

But the real problem is price. In the U.S., the listed cost for Trikafta is US$311,000 per year.

According to Cystic Fibrosis Canada, in order to get to a Canadian price, the manufacturer must first apply for Health Canada approval of the drug, after which Canada's drug review and reimbursement processes kick in. The Patented Medicine Prices Review Board will determine the maximum price a company can charge for a new patented drug sold in Canada. What public and private insurers pay is negotiated with the company. A body called the pan-Canadian Pharmaceutical Alliance negotiates the price that consumers will actually be paying on behalf of the provincial, territorial and federal programs.

The estimated cost for one Trikafta patient in Canada could be more than $400,000 a year.

And Vertex hasn't even applied to sell it here, amid speculation it would not be approved at that price.

An evidence report put out on April 27 by the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER), an independent watchdog for drug pricing in the U.S., investigated Trikafta and three other CF treatments by Vertex.

ICER gave the drug their highest ""A"" evidence rating a vote of confidence in the drug's transformative effect on patients' lives but added that the price was far too high.

They estimated that the health-benefit price benchmark for Trikafta should be between US$67,900 and US$85,000 per year, which would require a 73 to 78 per cent discount from the drug's current listed price.

In a press release for the report, David Rind, ICER's Chief Medical Officer, said that ""despite being transformative therapies, the prices set by the manufacturer costing many millions of dollars over the lifetime of an average patient are out of proportion to their substantial benefits.

""When a manufacturer has a monopoly on treatments and is aware that insurers will be unable to refuse coverage, the lack of usual counterbalancing forces can lead to excessive prices,"" Rind said.

""Patients who receive the treatments will benefit, but unaligned prices will cause significant negative health consequences for many unseen individuals those throughout society who will experience financial toxicity and may have to delay care, forego care, or even abandon insurance as their out of pocket costs and premiums are driven upward.""

But Canadian doctors and patients say that the drug being unavailable in Canada doesn't fix the price problem.

""I think we need a long-term solution,"" Dr. Pearce Wilcox, a respirologist at St. Paul's Hospital, told CTV News. ""We recognize that medication like this and others are very expensive medications and that's the reality and the public system will have challenges in coming up with that funding.

""On the other hand … cystic fibrosis is a rare disease. So, the long term solution is we need some type of strategy that recognizes rare diseases and the challenges of costs for these medications.

""In the shorter term, there needs to be some of innovative approach,"" to allow patients to get access, he added.

The pharmaceutical company does provide a compassionate care program that allows the sickest patients to have access to medication at a discount, but many patients dealing with a lot of suffering in their day to day lives still will not qualify for that, Wilcox said.

""I think everybody has the right to a life-changing drug,"" Grover agreed. ""I think at this stage we need to get it into the queue, so that the public and private payers can negotiate with the manufacturer to [a] price that makes sense to the Canadian system. And right now we can't even get it into the queue to assess its safety.""

The population of Canadians with cystic fibrosis is around 4,300, ""so you're talking about thousands that this [drug] could help,"" Grover said.

Wilcox said he has been working with cystic fibrosis patients for more than 20 years, and has seen a lot of initiatives introduced over the years to improve care.

But Trikafta is in ""the game-changer category,"" for him in how much it can improve quality of life and slow the progression of the disease.

""There is a medication that has the chance of making a dramatic difference in their, their outcome, and yet … we have very limited access to this compound,"" he said.

For Stringer, the drug feels like her last chance.

""If I don't get Trikafta, I'm going to continue to get sicker,"" she said. ""I could be one infection away from dying. That's really all it takes, is one infection.

""The life that I have right now is not life,"" she added. ""I'm at home all the time, I need oxygen a lot of the time. I barely have enough energy to get up and go into my living room. I'm 28 years old and I don't have a life.""

Stringer made her own urgent appeal directly to Vertex, through Health Canada's Special Access Programme the only way a Canadian can access medication not yet available for sale in Canada but was turned down.

There is a government push to assist her, led by Conservative MP Dan Albas from B.C.

On May 4, he and 58 MPs signed a letter addressed to Health Minister Patty Hajdu asking what she is doing to ensure that Canadians get access to the drug.

In the letter, they mention that Vertex has ""signalled their willingness to negotiate and conclude a Price Listing Agreement with the pan-Canadian Pharmaceutical Alliance.

""During the negotiation period, they have offered to supply their drugs to Canadians suffering with CF for free,"" the letter continues.

""As the Minister of Health, please provide us with an update on what you are doing to support the negotiations with Vertex and ensure that Canadians have access to these life-saving and life-changing drugs.""

Stringer, and other patients like her, are waiting to see if anything comes of the letter, and if Trikafta will come to Canada or not.

In the meantime, Canadian patients with cystic fibrosis will have to remain in limbo, caught between hope and reality.",[]
567,567,567,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/as-the-race-for-a-vaccine-ramps-up-so-do-calls-for-vaccine-injury-compensation-1.4983341,"As the race for a vaccine ramps up, so do calls for vaccine injury compensation",,2020-06-13,"TORONTO -- Canada may be at the forefront of the race to develop an effective COVID-19 vaccine, with a clinical trial already approved, but experts warn we have fallen short in developing a fund to compensate those who may be injured by vaccinations.

With immense political and public pressure to develop a vaccine, a process that can take years, researchers are carrying out trials at an unprecedented pace in efforts to bring a successful vaccine to market in a matter of months.

And although vaccine-related reactions are rare, experts say a new vaccine -- especially one developed using new technology -- may come with unknown risks.

At least 19 countries already have programs in place that compensate individuals injured by vaccines, but Canada does not.

In fact, it is the only G7 country without such measures in place, and experts are now calling on the federal government to prepare in advance of the COVID-19 vaccination program.

“If you do suffer an adverse event, a serious adverse event, one of those very rare events, you should be compensated,” said Jennifer Keelan, a retired researcher who worked at the University of Toronto’s Department of Public Health, told CTV News.

“An ideal process is to think about these things before you implement the mass vaccine program, rather than reacting.”

Adverse reactions to vaccines are rare, but have had deadly repercussions in the past.

In 1976, the U.S. government rushed to develop a swine flu vaccination over fears of the next big pandemic. The immunization program was halted after 10 weeks due to reports that the vaccination increased the risk for Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), a rare form of paralysis that starts in the feet and creeps up the body.

Though the associated risk was approximately one in 100,000, more than 450 people developed GBS after receiving the vaccine. Of those, 25 died.

Similarly, in 2009, the H1N1 influenza vaccine, while largely deemed safe, was linked with cases of narcolepsy in Europe.

Experts warn that vaccine manufacturers may demand legal protection against lawsuits regarding adverse reactions to a new vaccine.

In 2009, the Canadian government put forth an emergency process to release the H1N1 vaccine without waiting for Health Canada to review the results of clinical trials concerning the vaccine’s efficacy.

According to the Canadian Medical Association Journal, Canada agreed to indemnify the vaccine’s manufacturer, Glaxo-SmithKline, from potential lawsuits.

At the time, the federal government was said to be considering a no-fault compensation scheme, or a vaccine injury compensation program. However, no such program was ever created.

Quebec is the only province that offers such a plan for adverse reactions stemming from immunizations.

In other provinces and territories, any healthcare costs associated with an adverse vaccine reaction would be covered through the public health system or, if disability occurred, through disability income.

According to the Canadian Vaccination Evidence Resource and Exchange Centre, the only other recourse would be through litigation. However, there is a limited understanding of the number of vaccine-injury related lawsuits in Canada.

CTV News contacted the federal government to see if there was any consideration for such a program in light of the circumstances surrounding COVID-19. A request for comment was not returned.

“Some of these individuals may actually be front-line workers, personal support workers, health-care workers, or those working in long-term care centres who will be asked to receive this vaccine not only for their benefit, but to protect the patients, the people they are caring for,” Dr. Kumanan Wilson, senior scientist at the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, told CTV News.

“Despite best practices being taken, if these individuals are harmed, we need a system in place to help compensate them in the event of injury.”

Wilson and Keelan have been calling for Canada to implement a vaccine injury compensation program for nearly 10 years.

In a 2011 report for the University of Toronto’s Munk School of Global Affairs, the researchers noted that, “the history and experience with vaccine-related injuries in many other western countries also suggests that it is highly probable that Canada will be faced with circumstances.”

At the time, Keelan noted that a no-fault compensation program for vaccine-related injuries would not only benefit people who suffer harm, it might also give those who are waffling about whether to get a vaccine the incentive they need to go ahead.

""We want people to be vaccinated. Vaccines are incredibly safe and they are one of the most effective public health measures that we have for preventing vaccine-preventable diseases,” she said in a 2011 interview with CTVNews.ca.

“We want them to have confidence in our publicly funded vaccine.""​

In a report to the World Health Organization in December 2018, the Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety wrote that no-fault vaccine injury compensation programs are considered a measure to maintain confidence in immunization programmes.",[]

Cineplex Inc., in this undated photo. (The Canadian Press)

B.C.’s two major theatre companies, Cineplex Inc. and Landmark Cinemas, are reopening some theatres in B.C. as the province enters Phase Three of its restart plan.

The Toronto-based movie theatre company, Cineplex, has made ticket purchases available online for a number of locations through the province, according to its website on Tuesday (June 30). Theatres which appear to be opening for viewings on Friday include locations in Nanaimo, Vancouver, Langley, Victoria and Burnaby.

There will be some changes for movie goers, however, to ensure physical distancing. This includes a staggered seating reservation system and contactless ticket purchases. Guests will not be able to use cash, except for the purchase of a gift card and will have to have exact change.

Concession options will be limited, as well.

Guests are being asked to arrive no more than 15 minutes prior to the movie start time. While masks are not mandatory, they are being recommended and those who don’t have a mask will be supplied one at no extra cost.

Behind the scenes, the movie theatre company has confirmed that seats, handrails and children’s booster seats will be wiped down with industrial-grade cleaning products between each showtime, followed by a deep-clean of the entire auditorium and lobby each evening.

The reopenings come as Cineplex vows to sue U.K.-based chain Cineworld PLC for calling off a $2.8-billion takeover of the company. On Monday, Cineplex said the COVID-19 pandemic had a “material negative effect” on its operations and resulted in a $178.4-million loss in the first quarter.

Theatre locations set to open Friday include:

Burnaby

Kelowna

Langley

Nanaimo

Richmond

Surrey

Vancouver

Victoria

Meanwhile, Landmark Cinemas will also be reopening its doors Friday, with similar safety measures.

“We ask movie lovers join us in doing their part to protect members of their community, including our employees, by staying home if they are experiencing any symptoms,” a statement from the company reads.

There, classic movies will be screened such as Jurassic Park, Jaws, The Empire Strikes Back, Wonder Woman, and ET: The Extra-Terrestrial. Tickets will be $5 through the week and $2.99 on Tuesdays.

Landmark theatres screening movies include:

Campbell River

Courtenay

Cranbrook

Dawson Creek

Fort St. John

Kelowna, Grand 10

Nanaimo

Alessia Cara emerged the top winner at this year’s Juno Awards, scooping up three trophies in a pre-recorded ceremony that paired celebration with an acknowledgment that more needs to be done to represent the diverse voices of Canadian artists.

While the Junos usually mark the biggest night for the country’s music industry, the Monday event, which streamed online, took on a noticeably different tone in isolation. Missing were those euphoric acceptance speeches inside a massive venue filled with adoring fans, replaced with a handful of intimate performances and some serious reflection on the future.

Running a bit over 90 minutes, the Junos were handed out at historic speed, with 42 categories announced by presenters that included “Stranger Things” actor Finn Wolfhard and singer Jessie Reyez, who also pocketed her third career Juno during the event.

But it was the 23-year-old Cara who shone brightest as her deeply personal 2018 “The Pains of Growing” picked up both album and pop album of the year, while she also won songwriter of the year for her work on several of its tracks.

It was an uplifting finish for the Brampton, Ont.-raised pop singer after her dreams of hosting the awards show were dashed in the wake of COVID-19. She was originally lined up to be MC for the televised event in Saskatoon last March before organizers pulled the plug in response to the pandemic.

Cara was quick to jump onto Twitter after she came out on top, posting a characteristically humble “um whaaaaaaat” before retweeting congratulatory messages from a couple of her followers.

Aside from the big wins, Monday’s ceremony took on a sense of social urgency as greater awareness surrounding representation of Black, Indigenous and other artists of colour became a topic some of the presenters addressed.

CBC Radio host Odario Williams, who’s also a member of hip-hop collective Grand Analog, opened the show with a candid acknowledgment of the many shortfalls of Juno Awards past.

He noted that it took 15 years after the first ceremony in 1970 before soul and reggae artists were included in the list of categories, while it wasn’t until 1991 when the first rap recording award was given to Maestro Fresh Wes.

“I’ve got to give a shout out to the Black and Indigenous Canadian artists of the ’70s, the ’80s, the ’90s that are true pioneers in the growth of our musical landscape,” he said, pointing to Liberty Silver, who was the first Black woman to win a Juno in 1985.

While Juno organizers have made efforts to improve diversity among its nominees in recent years, president Allan Reid recognized that much work still needs to be done.

“We are committed to the long-term inclusion and amplification of Black voices and a more equitable industry for all,” he said at the outset of the show.

“We are working on an action plan with specific commitments that we will reveal this July. We must do better for our BIPOC members of the music community, and we welcome you to hold us accountable.”

A number of the night’s music performances also put the subject of racism in Canada at the forefront.

Halifax alt-pop duo Neon Dreams, who were selected as breakthrough group this year, gave a sombre performance of “We Were Kings.” The coming-of-age reflection was co-written by lead singer Frank Kadillac about his own experiences rising above stereotypes, racism and high school bullying.

Indigenous singer Iskwe went outdoors to play ”Little Star,” a song paying tribute to Colten Boushie, Tina Fontaine and the lives of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls, filmed within the Mississaugas Of Scugog Island First Nation territory.

Other highlights included two-time winner Shawn Mendes, who was selected as artist of the year. “Senorita,” his duet with girlfriend Camila Cabello, won single of the year, making him the first artist to pick up that award for three consecutive years.

Breakthrough artist went to Oshawa, Ont.-born pop singer Lennon Stella, who’s already established herself as an actress on the primetime musical-drama series “Nashville.”

Avril Lavigne pocketed the fan choice award, which is voted on by viewers, for the second year in a row, and the third time in her career.

Among this year’s most surprising winners is Governor General Julie Payette, who’s a member of the Ottawa Bach Choir that won best classical album, vocal or choral.

Bryan Adams’ “Shine a Light” won adult contemporary album, giving the musician his 17th Juno win and putting him behind only Celine Dion and Anne Murray as the artist with the most Junos.

667,667,1134,mapleridgenews,https://www.mapleridgenews.com/entertainment/childhood-memories-in-maple-ridge-rekindled-in-new-album/,Childhood memories in Maple Ridge rekindled in new album – Maple Ridge News,'Roxanne Hooper',2020-06-28,"Multi-talented musician Julian Taylor divulges much about himself in his new album, The Ridge

Julian Taylor released his newest album last week called The Ridge, and its title and first single pay homage to a farm he stayed at in Maple Ridge during his childhood.

Singer, songwriter, and storyteller Julian Taylor may be kicking it on the music scene in Toronto – both in studio and on stage.

But it’s his roots, and a few specific childhood memories of time spent on a Maple Ridge farm, that he’s bringing to life with in his newest solo album, The Ridge, released last week.

LISTEN

Taylor described the title song and first single, which was actually premiered back in April, as a dramatic, minor-key ballad that tells a story – in snapshots – of a young boy’s life on a farm before they had to sell it and move on.

For him, much of it is based on the true story of summers spent with his aunt and grandparents at their farm in Maple Ridge. And with his lyrics, he shares memories of following his older sister around the barn, chicken coop, and pastures of that farm wearing his little rainboots, catching frogs, shovelling manure, and chasing chickens.

“I spent every summer in Maple Ridge from the time that I was four until I was 14,” Taylor shared with The News.

“My grandfather is John Skanks. He ran the famous boxing gym there and his wife, my step-grandmother is Carol Skanks. I didn’t go to school there, but I trained at the boxing gym each summer.”

Last Friday the “The Ridge” was released and that same evening a few family & friends surprised me with a little social distancing soirée. I had no clue and was totally taken back. It was awesome. Thanks everyone all over the world for your kindness. I’m glad you like the album. pic.twitter.com/OAdHrYMnj2 — Julian Taylor (@jtaylorband) June 23, 2020

The eight-song Americana album was originally scheduled for a fall release date, but Taylor decided to speed up the release, in hopes his songs might bring joy to listeners in what he calls “troubled times.”

“I’d really like the heart of this record and the stories to connect with people. These are letters to members of my family. It’s something that everyone has – family (whether chosen or not) and memories.”

He co-produced it with long-time collaborator Saam Hashemi and recorded at The Woodshed, Blue Rodeo’s studio in downtown Toronto.

In addition to exposing many personal truths with this latest album, Taylor sees The Ridge as a way to reach out and help others.

Taylor plans to donate a portion of the sales from the album to a scholarship he started in honour of Bruce Adamson.

“This is something near and dear to my heart,” Taylor explained. “Bruce was my bandmate for over a decade before he ended his own life. I started this scholarship in his name to help at-risk children who are interested in pursuing music.”

Thank you @AppleMusic my producer friend @Saampler sent me these snaps shots and I’m kind of floored. Such good company to be in and it’s the first time on the charts so I’m feeling blessed. Thank you to everyone for listening to the new record. pic.twitter.com/pEMnLCJEJ1 — Julian Taylor (@jtaylorband) June 19, 2020

Taylor is a musical chameleon – who can be found performing rhythm and blues one day, and funk, soul, or rock the next.

The baritone vocalist, who happens to also play guitar and piano, is also described as a prolific musician who has released 10 studio albums in the past two decades.

He cut his teeth in the music industry as frontman with the Staggered Crossing band before the group disbanded in 2007 and he ventured out on a solo career. And since then, Taylor has toured across Canada numerous times and has shared the stage with such world-renowned acts as Nickelback, Jeff Healey, Midnight Oil, Collective Soul, and Blue Rodeo.

Classified as a major label veteran on the Toronto music scene, Taylor was personally invited to perform at the Olympics in Salt Lake City and Vancouver, and his songs have been placed in popular TV programs such as “Elementary,” “Private Eyes,” “Kim’s Convenience,” “Haven,” “The Good Witch,” and “Younger.”

With all tour dates currently on hold due to COVID-19, Taylor is doing regular livestreaming for his Patreon supporters, plus performing several public livestreaming performances including a recent concert for Mariposa Folk Festival, in partnership with the National Arts Centre.

668,668,1135,mapleridgenews,https://www.mapleridgenews.com/entertainment/maple-ridge-author-releases-first-in-icelandic-inspired-fantasy-young-adult-novel-trilogy/,Maple Ridge author releases first in Icelandic-inspired fantasy young adult novel trilogy – Maple Ridge News,'Ryan Uytdewilligen',2020-06-27,"Brooke Carter published The Stone of Sorrow, Book One in her Runecaster series with Orca Publishing

“I’ve always been intrigued by my Icelandic family history and by the wonderfully weird customs and myths in Icelandic culture,” said Brooke Carter, author of The Stone of Sorrow.

The Maple Ridge writer told The News that when she was in grad school, she studied a lot of Scandinavian literature and was obsessed with the sagas.

“The little germ of the idea for this book has been growing for a long time,” Carter assured.

The Stone of Sorrow follows seventeen-year-old Runa Unnursdóttir, who spends her days daydreaming of sailing away and exploring the world instead of studying the runes and learning her spells.

When a rival clan led by an evil witch raids the village and kidnaps her sister, Runa is forced to act and travel to the site of an ancient runecasting competition to try to win back the magical gem.

“During my MFA candidacy at UBC, I was fortunate to study with Susan Juby and she encouraged me to expand on a writing exercise I did about a young Runecaster who longed to sail away from her home,” Carter recalled.

That became the first pages of her own Icelandic saga.

“This series follows in much the same vein as the ancient ones—it’s about struggling through difficult times and fighting darkness with magic and hope,” she added.

Carter said it was important to her that any YA book she writes—particularly when fantasy has a lot of sexist tropes and traditionally patriarchal themes—reflects the young people who are reading it today.

”I wanted a feminist Viking-era fantasy, one that was concerned with female agency and self-determination,” Carter explained.

She also said Maple Ridge played a role in her inspiration – nature and wildlife, particularly Gold Greek, directly shaped some of her writing.

Additional to The Stone of Sorrow, Carter has also wrote Another Miserable Love Song, Learning Seventeen, Lucky Break, The Unbroken Hearts Club, and Double or Nothing.

“COVID-19 has hit the book industry hard,” she added, “and it has had a huge impact on our local libraries and bookstores. I’ve been fortunate to work closely with Black Bond Books in Valley Fair Mall – they have a display in store for The Stone of Sorrow – and they’ve been incredibly supportive of authors.”

The Stone of Sorrow is out now and can be bought from Black Bond, direct from Orca, or online anywhere books are sold.

It is book one in her Runecaster series with Orca and Book Two, The Saga of Lies, comes out in April of 2021, and Book Three, The Sisters of War, is due in April 2022.

With concert venues closed and most performers staying at home without gigs, Allan Reid said he’s focused on giving this year’s Juno nominees the recognition they missed after the pandemic sidelined a weekend of accolades in Saskatoon several months ago.

But he said this year’s show, which is skipping broadcast TV and going directly to CBC Gem, will look undeniably different than ones in the past.

“This is not the Juno broadcast that you would see on television — it’s not 12 performances and six awards,” explained Reid, who serves as president of the Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (CARAS).

Instead, the show is cramming two nights of trophies into a brisk ceremony recorded in isolation.

Winners in a dizzying 42 categories will be announced over 90 minutes, putting the marquee nominees for single and album of the year in the same spotlight as more obscure ones, such as world music and children’s album.

Presenters include Toronto Raptors’ Chris Boucher and two-time Juno winner Jessie Reyez, while songs will be performed by Iskwe, Neon Dreams, the Dead South, and Alessia Cara, who was originally supposed to host the cancelled television event.

The Junos will stream on CBC Gem, and CBC’s Facebook, YouTube and Twitter pages on Monday at 7 p.m. ET.

Reid spoke with The Canadian Press about making a different sort of Junos show, how the virus is slamming the music industry, and what it all means for the 50th anniversary of the awards set for next March.

CP: There are a number of significant changes to this year’s Junos, including that Alessia Cara stepped away from hosting duties. But she’s also this year’s top nominee with six nods. How will she be involved in the show?

Reid: Alessia is going to have a one-time performance of “Rooting for You” (a song that helped her pick up the songwriter of the year nomination). It’s an exclusive premiere from her new EP called “This Summer: Live Off The Floor,” which is coming out in July. She recorded it pre-pandemic.

CP: How about Jann Arden, who was originally supposed to be inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame by Anne Murray on the broadcast? Those plans have been sidelined, but is something going to materialize later?

Reid: We felt this was not the time… those are lifetime moments. So we haven’t finalized details. We are trying to figure out how to accomplish that, whether it’s around the 50th anniversary, or another way, we’re not sure. (There were) so many disappointments with the show not happening and that was definitely one of them.

CP: Speaking of the 50th anniversary, the Junos are slated for Toronto next year to mark the momentous occasion. The celebration would be the first time in a decade that the awards have taken place in the city. But considering the virus, is that still on?

Reid: Obviously, COVID is has changed everything. As a music event that is a mass gathering — from all of our events to the broadcast — we have to be taking into consideration: What if there is a second wave? Things are still relatively unknown about what the future will hold, so we need to make plans, and alternate plans, to make sure that we can still do a celebration. But what exactly that’s going to be, right now we’re still working through. I don’t think there’s anybody who can say for sure if we’re going to be able to gather 15,000 people in the Scotiabank Arena next March.

CP: After the last-minute cancellation of the 2020 Junos, do you plan to return to Saskatoon?

Reid: We’re working on a three- to five-year plan at all times with future cities. The challenge for Saskatoon is that everything was spent — it wasn’t like we cancelled a month before the event, (it was) 48 to 72 hours. And so all the food had been delivered to the convention centre for the gala dinner, the stage was fully built, we were starting rehearsals. The whole machine was rolling. So, from an investment standpoint, it requires new investment to make that happen again. Hopefully we’ll get a chance to go back.

CP: What about the Canadian music industry as a whole? Since the country effectively shut down live entertainment, we’ve seen musicians rally for financial support from the federal government, but there’s a more uncertain road ahead for live music. You’re head of CARAS, a non-profit that supports performers, so how do you see this shaping up?

Reid: The music industry — like sports, like restaurants — has been hit incredibly hard. It’s devastating to see artists lose their livelihoods who can’t tour. Yes, we’re very fortunate to have a government that’s providing (assistance) to try to make ends meet, but I’ve had so many conversations with artists who are just going, “I don’t know much how longer I can go. I’ve got to find another way to make a living.” If they’re not on the radio and not generating that kind of performance income, it comes from performing live. And I’m extremely worried of what’s going to happen to the venues across this country. If this is prolonged from three-and-a-half months into next year, how do those venues survive? And if they go away then where do the bands go to play?

Kelly Collins a Maple Ridge member of the chorus, said the group has been rehearsing together that was since March.

One of the projects that has kept Westcoast Harmony busy is a 49-person rendition of O Canada, performed through zoom,

“Making the video took dedication, and time – I personally learned that a digital recording isn’t as forgiving as a live performance,” Collins said. “We had to bring our A game not only in vocals but with our face, our eyes! It was incredible and fun – I am so proud to be a part of this group of amazing people!”

The members all learned and recorded their video independently at home and submitted it for editing, an undertaking Downton said will continue on into new projects.

“Music, combined with a strong sense of community will always find a way to be together,” Collins said.

Grammy-winning country group The Dixie Chicks have dropped the word Dixie from their name, now going by The Chicks.

The band’s social media accounts and website were changed on Thursday to the refer to the new name for the band, which is made up of Martie Maguire, Natalie Maines and Emily Strayer. The band also recognized that the name was already in use by a band in New Zealand.

“A sincere and heartfelt thank you goes out to ‘The Chicks’ of NZ for their gracious gesture in allowing us to share their name. We are honoured to co-exist together in the world with these exceptionally talented sisters,” the band said in a statement.

The move follows a decision by country group Lady Antebellum to change to Lady A after acknowledging the word’s association to slavery. A statement on The Chicks’ website said “We want to meet this moment.” The term Dixie refers to Southern U.S. states, especially those that belonged to the Confederacy.

The Chicks, who are releasing their first new album in 14 years next month, also released a new video for their new song, “March March” that features videos and images from the recent Black Lives Matter rallies.

Lady A received criticism with their name switch after a Black singer revealed she’d been performing as Lady A for years.

The Chicks are the best selling female group in America with more than 33 million albums sold in the United States, according to the Recording Industry Association of America. Formed originally in Texas as a bluegrass group, the band hit commercial fame with their breakthrough album “Wide Open Spaces.” The band has won 13 Grammys.

The band was shunned by country radio over an incident in 2003 when lead singer Maines criticized then-President George W. Bush because of the Iraq War. They responded to the backlash with their song “Not Ready to Make Nice,” and swept the Grammys in 2007 winning three of the top all-genre categories.

A trip down memory lane transported 90-year-young Harold Pattern back to a horrifying moment in the old Hammond Theatre, when he watched his sister being shot only a few feet away.

Thankfully, the six-year-old Haney boy would soon learn that his sister was in fact alive and it was all make believe. Kathleen – who he believed was about 20 at the time – would not only survive but go on to perform in a few other theatre shows.

“But, I remember bawling my head off. That was my sister up there,” Pattern shared.

“I remember thinking some SOB shot her.”

Just a few weeks ago, the Legion Garden resident was sorting through some old family photos and ran across a few faded black-and-white images of his sister all dressed up for her role as Moonyeen Clare in the Maple Ridge Players’ Club production of Smilin’ Through.

Her character was killed by a jealous suitor in a three-act romantic comedy hosting in the former Hammond Theatre – now long gone – Pattern noted.

RECENT NEWS: The show must go on

The date was Friday, Jan. 11, 1935.

“That one really stuck in my mind. Here I see her laying there, dead, and I’m screaming, ‘someone shot my sister’.”

Turns out Kathleen wasn’t the only thespian in the Pattern family.

Their mother, Winnifred, was also involved with the theatre group for a time, often in front of house. But in this same show, Mom was also on stage as the Carteret’s family maid.

Pattern only recalls attended a handful of theatre performances after that traumatizing day 85 years ago.

But he, the baby among the five siblings, had an artistic bend too, and Pattern would take to the stage himself during his teens.

He played drums in a band first known as the Musical Knights and later rebranded as Herb Henry and Orchestra.

Over the course of about four years, he performed at a number of local venues, including the Old Aggie Hall, the Masonic Hall, the Sampo Hall in Webster’s Corners, the Pitt Meadows Heritage Hall (still standing), plus a number of other community halls around the Lower Mainland.

“All I have is a pair of drum sticks left,” and a lot of memories, Pattern reflected.

RECENT NEWS: Maple Ridge film studio plagued by vandalism as owner waits to reopen

This walk down memory lane was all sparked by the picture of his sister.

“I don’t know how long I’m going to be around. I am 90, afterall,” he said, explaining his quest to sort through old papers and pictures and prepare to be pass them along to his three children, six grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.

In addition to finding the pictures in his photo album, he found an old theatre bill for the show, recognizing some familiar names among the cast of characters and crew.

The list included former Maple Ridge alderman Reginald Franklin; Nick Mussallem, son of former car dealership owner and MLA George Mussallem; Russell Kirkpatrick of Kirkpatrick Sand & Gravel; and Ivan Hambly, who took over the Haney Gazette after James Junior Dougan’s death.

“They’re all gone now,” Pattern said.

But the memories live on, he said, at least for him.

Several Metro Vancouver-based tribute bands are uniting to raise money for charities during an online music festival.

The day-long Tribute Webfest 2020 is set for Saturday, June 27, in support of a diverse number of organizations chosen by each of the nine bands involved, through Canadahelps.org.

“With the loss of live shows and festivals in the time of Covid19, we wanted to create something unique and special for all of you who are missing the live music experience,” says a post on facebook.com/tributewebfest2020, where all of the 45-minute live sets will be streamed from 1 to 8:30 p.m. on Saturday.

“The level of talent on the roster are some of the best musicians playing in Canada today and we’re sure the lineup will have something for everyone. There will also be an interesting list of personalities from the broadcast and music industry that will be your hosts during the event.”

(Story continues below link to livestream)

The fundraising goal is $25,000 for the festival, which will feature the bands Eagle Eyes (playing music by the Eagles), Arrival (ABBA), Bad Moon Riders (CCR), The Hip Show (Tragically Hip), Fo Fighters (Foo Fighters), Reckless (Bryan Adams), Fair Warning (Van Halen), Dreams (Fleetwood Mac) and Montreal-based New World Men (Rush).

All performers are donating time to the cause, along with broadcast video director Gene Greenwood of TourBus TV, host/co-producer Larry Hennessey (JACK 96.9), host Michael Williams (former MuchMusic VJ), tech director Jeff Scharf, and executive producer/host Joe Foley.

“Together we can show everyone the Canadian Spirit is alive and well in these difficult times,” says the festival’s Facebook event page.

The supported charities are Food Banks BC, Alzheimer Society of BC, Music Heals, Pacific Parkinson’s Research Institute, Greater Vancouver Food Bank, Fondation Santé Urbaine, McGill University Health Centre Foundation, BC Cancer Foundation and The Gord Downie & Chanie Wenjack Fund. As well, all bands will be supporting The Frontline Fund.

An international award-winning performance by the BC Girls Choir is back in the running for the top Children’s Choir of the World through the Llangollen International Musical Eisteddfod.

Having gone and unexpectedly claimed the top prize in 2018, artistic director Fiona Blackburn was hoping that the choir could do it again this year – but COVID-19 put a physical stop to that opportunity.

Instead, Llangollen – the 75-year-old competition, which takes place in a small Welsh town – uploaded all of the winning performances since 1994 onto their website and is asking audiences to cast their votes for the 2020 winner.

Maple Ridge members of the winning choir included Sydney Coates, Carly Roberts, Mila Tkatchouk, Ella Treleaven, Maeve Whalley, and from Pitt Meadows, Erin Ryu and Manae Ryu.

Blackburn said the initial win was significant because only two Canadian choirs have been named for the past quarter century (Newfoundland being the other).

“The competition has been cancelled this year, but people from all around the world are encouraged to ‘sit in the judges’ chairs’ and vote for their favourite performance,” she said, a tad disapointed about not getting to return to the community.

“The charm of that particular place… I will never ever forget it,” Blackburn assured.

The artistic director lived in Maple Ridge for several decades until making the move to Vancouver Island several years ago.

“We get together on Saturdays with girls age six to seven, all the way up to teenagers,” she said, adding that she happily makes the trip each week from the island for that practise.

“We use Coquitlam as a base. There are members from Bowen Island to Mission… White Rock, Langley, Maple Ridge, and Pitt Meadows,” she explained.

While performance prospects such as the International Choral Kathaumixw and been cancelled and their next international tour is planned for 2021, Blackburn is encouraging people to visit the Llangollen website and have a listen to the choir.

The BC Girls Choir performance is of ‘Ban, Ban, Caliban’, which describes the ogre in Shakespeare’s The Tempest.

People can visit https://llangollen.tv/home-2020/children-corau-plant and cast their vote.

After a brief illness Dr. James Peters Johnson passed away peacefully on Saturday, June 27, 2020 at the age of 81. Jim was born on May 26, 1939 in Hamilton, Ontario. In 1964, he graduated with his O.D. degree from the College of Optometry of Ontario (in Toronto) and has been an active practitioner for 56 years in Hamilton Ontario, Sechelt British Columbia and in the Vancouver area. In 1978, he was inducted as a fellow in the American Academy of Optometry, and from 1976 to 1979 he taught at the School of Optometry and Vision Science, University of Waterloo.

Jim was an enthusiastic organist, an exceptional hobbyist and member of the Canadian Toy Train Association, and a worthy mentor to all young relatives.

Extended members of the Johnson, Peters, and Bays families will not soon forget him. Cousin Number Two was a founding member of The 77 Club.

Jim is survived by three brothers: Gilbert (Denise) of Cobourg, Dennis of Guelph, and Stephen (Wendy Warnken) of Toronto. Uncle Jim is fondly remembered by Piers (Brie Gillespie), Maximilian (Elizabeth Whelan Marcolini), Elliott and Emma, as well as great-nieces Beatrice and Peregrine. He is especially missed by two godsons – Donald (Cindy) Johnson of Vegreville Alberta and Elliott Johnson.

Jim is sadly missed by good friend and former wife Pamela Earle. He is predeceased by his parents, Dr. Arthur A. Johnson and Pearl (Peters) Johnson U.E. His family is thankful for the care and dedication of the staff at Ridge Meadows Hospital and Surrey Memorial Hospital in British Columbia during his final days.

In his senior years, Jim made an annual trip to Cambodia and his friends there send this message: “We have lost a kind man who has helped many people brighten up their eyesight and many children with school materials. He will Rest in Peace and his acts of kindness will be remembered by many people here in Cambodia. He will always be missed.” The ashes of James Peters Johnson will rest in a Buddhist Temple in Cambodia.

In lieu of flowers, please make a donation to a charity of your choice in memory of Dr. James Johnson. A celebration of his life will be announced at a later time. Messages can be left for the family at an on-line Guest Book at www.mapleridgefuneral.caObituary",[]
707,707,1174,mapleridgenews,https://www.mapleridgenews.com/marketplace/how-to-make-your-tax-refund-work-harder/,How to make your tax refund work harder – Maple Ridge News,'Jun.',2020-06-29,"Use your refund to help reach your financial goals

“Sometimes you just need a little help getting back on track, and that’s where a payday loan from MyCanadaPayday.com can help,” says Sundeep Thind, manager of MyCanadaPayday’s Surrey office.

When that tax refund comes in, it’s easy to see it as “free” money to treat yourself to something fun – a weekend away, or special purchase you’ve been eyeing for awhile.

But remember, your refund is actually a percentage of your own hard-earned income, so if you really want to get the most from your refund, it pays to pay yourself first:

1. Start an emergency fund: Your tax refund is the perfect opportunity to start your emergency fund – money set aside in case of situations like income loss or unexpected car repairs. Start with as much as you can afford, building up over time until you have enough to cover three months of bills. When the unexpected happens, you’ll be prepared.

2. Send it directly to savings: Setting up direct deposit allows quicker access to your refund, and can make it a lot easier to save that money: instead of sending it to your primary chequing account, direct your refund right to your savings!

3. Pay down your credit: Most can benefit from paying off credit card debt. If you have multiple cards, put your refund onto the card with the highest interest rate to save money over time in interest charges, and boost your credit score!

4. Put it toward a major financial goal: Maybe it’s time for a more reliable car or to think about buying your first house. A larger downpayment can make major purchases much more affordable longterm, lowering the amount paid over time and offering long-term advantages like lower interest rates. Your tax refund can help make your financial dreams a reality!

5. Start a retirement account: While retirement savings can be tough to commit to with so much else tugging on your wallet, every bit helps. If you’ve already started saving through an RRSPs, RIFs or Tax-Free Savings Account, your tax return can give your savings a boost. Even better, that contribution will lighten your tax burden next year!

6. Invest in the online stock market: Today online investing is becoming easier and much more accessible, allowing beginners and professionals alike to create a diversified portfolio. Robo-advisors provide sophisticated algorithms, comprehensive dashboards and interactive reporting that allow you to take a set-it-and-forget it approach and still see long-term benefits.

7. Spend it (wisely) on yourself: There’s no harm in spending a little of your tax refund on yourself, but as with so many things, the key is moderation. Maybe it’s time to pay for that certification or class, or invest in a stand-up desk. These are ways to use your refund to invest in yourself!

When you need short-term help

If your refund was not as much as you were expecting, or worse yet, you end up owing this year, easy, safe and secure options are available through Canada’s licensed payday loan specialists.

“Sometimes you just need a little help getting back on track, and that’s where a payday loan from MyCanadaPayday.com can help,” says Sundeep Thind, manager of MyCanadaPayday’s Surrey office.

“We have the entire process online, including the one-page application form, and our specialists are here to help you reach your financial goals.”

The Sugar Lake Recreational Properties is your waterfront base for year-round adventures. The 66-lot shared interest lakefront development features 45 fully serviced RV lots and 20 cabin sites, all just steps from the beach and lake.

Summer is all about experiences we’ll share for years to come: Paddles on the lake, forest trails to explore and tall tales told around the campfire – maybe about the fish that got away that very afternoon!

The chance to write your summer story is here.

(And even better, you can add to it come fall and winter!)

Your story starts at Sugar Lake, just an hour east of Vernon and less than two hours’ drive from Kelowna – so easy to get to, but what a difference once you get here.

The Sugar Lake Recreational Properties is at the heart of lake life – your waterfront base for the adventures yet to come. The 66-lot shared interest lakefront development features 45 fully serviced RV lots and 20 cabin sites, all just steps from the beach and lake.

While other regions in the Okanagan and Shuswap can quickly get busy with boats, swimmers and other recreation enthusiasts, here you’ll enjoy many of the same opportunities, but away from the crowds, in your own piece of paradise. And if you simply want to share the sun with your go-to beach read, that’s just fine too!

Rounding out the amenities onsite are a new dock with boat slips available for lease, group picnic areas to share a meal with family and friends, and even an on-site guest lodge, with its own licensed, full-service bistro.

Of course, not all experiences are focused around the lake, so from Sugar Lake, it’s easy to turn the page and choose your own adventure.

Outdoor recreation opportunities take you off the lake and into thousands of hectares of forest begging to be explored. Cast your rod into nearby rivers and streams, or head to the hills of Silver Star, where summer and fall mountain biking gives way to winter skiing and snowshoeing.

Just 14 kilometres north, explore Cherryville, where recreation opportunities include bird watching, horseback tours, fishing and more in the foothills of the Monashee Mountains. Continue east to Monashee Provincial Park to enjoy spring wildflowers, hiking, fishing and some of the oldest rock formations in Western Canada.

And a little farther afield to Nakusp, experiences include inviting hot springs, a thriving local arts community and the waterfront walkway overlooking Upper Arrow Lake.

Learn about vendor financing for your own carefully selected RV site or cabin, and about maximizing your investment with the option of renting out your site or cabin when you’re not using it.

(Contributed)

Music is known to help improve people’s lives.

From children in hospitals to seniors, palliative care patients, those with AIDS and HIV, at-risk youth, people in rehabilitation and people grieving the loss of others.

However, music therapy programs across the country are facing an uncertain future.

Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, some programs have put on pause, while other therapists have turned to virtual methods to support their students.

But, a musical therapist with the Ridge Meadows Association for Community Living came up with a novel way of bringing her services to those who need them – drive-by music therapy sessions.

“I realized that we all had to adapt and find ways to function, and that I needed to model not only survival but also how to thrive in a rapidly changing world,” said RMACL music therapist Birgit Giesser.

Ridge Meadows Association for Community Living provides services for adults and children with disabilities and Giesser thought it was crucial to connect with her students who might potentially feel isolated due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

People, “who may not fully understand the pandemic but are still experiencing the full breakdown of their normal lives,” she said.

So, Giesser created mobile sessions for her students following provincial health guidelines.

“Music therapy for me is about activating the joy, curiosity and skills we have within us and sharing them with one another. Music makes our lives meaningful and helps us cope with challenges,” noted Giesser.

Music Heals, an organization that raises money and awareness for music therapy across the country, funds the Community Living program in Maple Ridge, and matched money raised from last years Tea-ki Bar Social hosted by T’s Once Upon A Tea Leaf, where the back alley is turned into a cocktail party with DJ’s, vendors and food trucks.

READ MORE: A thirst for positive change

But, like many charities across the country, Music Heals has lost about $970,000 in revenue due to the cancellation of fundraising events, including this years Tea-ki Bar Social.

Since Taryn Stephenson, who runs the Music Heals Charitable Foundation and who is also co-owner of T’s, started working with Music Heals, she has become more “hyper-aware” of the healing power of music.

“I really wanted to make sure that people in Maple Ridge had access to that,” she said.

And, said Stephenson, if they don’t have people who believe in the power of music and want to make donations to the charity, then they run the risk of current programs not being sustainable.

“What a sad day to not have music fill the hallways of facilities and hospitals,” she said.

Since 2012 the organization has funded 32,000 hours of music therapy across Canada.

Four Maple Ridge Secondary students are hoping to make names for themselves in the NCAA next season.

Jaxon Brant, Noah Bradly, Cole Low, and Jacob Pahnke have seen plenty of success with their lacrosse careers so far and scholarships to Division I and II schools are their latest achievements.

As members of the Ridge Meadows Burrards they have won provincial championships with both their U-15 and U-18 squads, and now they’ve conquered B.C., the athletes are hoping to replicate the feat in the U.S.

Brad Rennie coached the young men when they were playing for the Burrards U-15 squad. He mentioned being impressed with their accomplishments but not surprised.

“They just seem to be a different breed of athlete to be honest with you,” Rennie said. “Not only were they pivotal leaders on the field, they’re also excellent leaders in the community as well, and that’s why they stand out.”

He said coaching the players as they rose through the local ranks was an honour.

“I’ve learned as much from these guys as they have from me. Competition’s within their blood, so it’s been fun as a coach to sit back and watch all the hard work they’ve put in to reap the rewards at this time in their careers.”

Jacob Pahnke will play at the highest level of the four. He received a four year scholarship to play lacrosse at Div. I school, Canisius College in Buffalo, New York.

He said it was a relief to finally settle on a place to continue to pursue his passion for the sport.

“You spend two years talking to schools and going to all the tournaments, so it felt good to make a decision,” Pahnke noted, adding he’s looking forward to playing the sport he loves while getting an education at the same time.

Cole Lowe, who earned a four year scholarship to North Greenville University in South Carolina, is excited to branch out on his own for the first time.

He said he will major in international business, and has set a few goals for himself in the sport.

“Hopefully I’ll make the all-state team down there,” Lowe said. “I’m going to have to hit the gym, get my fitness up, and then kill it on the field.”

Jaxon Brant and Noah Bradley will have the benefit of going to the same school. They have both accepted scholarships to Lander University in Greenwood, South Carolina.

“I’m really excited to go there,” said Brant. “I’m excited to be on my own, and to have the freedom, and grow up a bit. It’s a new chapter.”

In addition to playing lacrosse, he plans on studying graphic design, and hopes to become a firefighter some day.

His future room mate, Bradley, said he never thought he would be able to get this far with lacrosse.

“Honestly, I’m kind of humbled by it,” he said. “Just to be there playing with some top end players… it’s going to be fun.”

A commitment to grinding on the field has resulted in the honour, he said.

“I think my strength is the effort I put into my game,” Bradley said, “Typical I like to go for those ground balls.”

Travis Gathercole was the coach of the Ridge Meadows Burrards U-18 team which just won this year’s provincial championship.

He is quick to heap praise on the talented young players.

“All of those kids did whatever was asked of them and they did it to a very high standard,” Gathercole said.

“I’m not at all surprised they got the offers they did. They’re great kids, great athletes, and they’ve got good heads on their shoulders.”

The coach also pointed out a lot of praise deserves to go to scholarship recipients’ team mates who pushed them on to success.

“If you look at the overall picture, they wouldn’t have achieved what they have if they didn’t have the quality of athletes to train against consistently.”

Dear Editor,

[RE: Haney Hotel owner fights province to re-open his main entrance, June 25, The News online]

I could not believe my eyes when I noticed that the main entrance to the Haney Hotel was being closed!

That is an establishment that has been here for nearly three-quarters of a century, and to see such a cold and callous act – to destroy their main entrance – is unbelievable.

So, their main entrance is now going to be in the back alley? Only one entrance and exit, is that allowed for fire and safety reasons?

I would hope not.

Why is the entrance to Chevron still allowed of Lougheed Highway?

If I was to guess why this is happening, I would think this could be a beginning of plan by the province to expropriate the property for whatever reason.

RELATED LETTER: Government needs to help, not hinder Maple Ridge business

Or, is it because of the state of emergency in place by the B.C. government, giving them the powers to do what ever they deem necessary, which they seem to be reluctant to give up?

However, there a very bad smell to the whole proceeding – this is [not] any form of resemblance of a democratic society.

This is my considered opinion.

If you have a letter you’d like to submit to the editor for consideration, please email us at editor@mapleridgenews.com. Look forward to hearing your thoughts.

Dear Editor,

[Shared letter sent to Maple Ridge Mayor Michael Morden and council]

I would like to suggest that Maple Ridge implement an on street-parking permit.

This is a device used in many cities in North America and is used to supplement operating funds for the city and create a safer access for emergency vehicles when neighbourhoods have become plugged with street parking.

My neighbourhood for instance, between the hours of 6 p.m. and 6 a.m. is hard for even one car to navigate the street, let along if a fire truck should need access.

I know it is human nature to avoid the need to purchase the ability to legally park on the street. They then would be more likely to use their driveway/garage in order to negate the purchase of an on-street parking permit.

For those who still wish street parking between the hours of 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. (overnight parking), they would either pay for a permit ($100/per year) or in violation of this bylaw would receive a ticket issued by bylaws enforcement officers for $100 for each parking infraction.

I only suggest this because I feel it has become more and more dangerous as most of our neighbourhoods contain many secondary suites, which overwhelm the planned parking alloted when the subdivision was first planned.

UNRELATED LETTER: Re-opening too early could prove deadly to man

Many homeowners don’t use their garage for parking, many use them for storage or a place to put their junk.

Many home with lane access to driveways don’t use their driveways, opting to park in the front of their homes instead, adding to the ongoing problem.

These people would be more apt to use their driveways if they were presented with the idea that they would need to purchase a permit to legally park on the street.

These methods are currently in use in White Rock and Vancouver.

IDEA TOSSED AROUND BEFORE: Permits for residential parking in Maple Ridge?

Between the cost of permits and the issuing of fines, this bylaw could generate an adequate amount of funds that would fund the hiring of new personnel required to staff this bylaw enforcement, and with a considerable amount to go into the city operation budget.

Lastly, I would like to amplify the fact that we are reaching a dangerous situation that could affect the ability of fire trucks and ambulances from reaching a house fire, a heart attack victim in need of intervention by EMS, or a child needing medical attention.

The legal issue of the municipality failing to correct these situation could, in the future, lead to legal hardship for the municipality that could easily prove that the safety of its taxpaying citizen were neglected.

Please give this serious consideration and please see the need for this suggestion and how it can be instituted at no cost to the city. In fact, the city will not only make money on this bylaw, but will also have the ability to hire more personnel to enforce these new bylaws.

Thank you for listening.

SAME ARGUMENT MADE LAST FALL: Implement a parking permit system

Dear Editor,

[RE: Haney Hotel owner fights province to re-open his main entrance, June 25, The News online]

Here we have an employer and owner of commercial property no doubt pays a large tax bill.

I would hazard to guess he provides some of the hotel rooms for housing to people in transition, as well as tourists to our city – and he is being hammered by the province and city over a driveway that will impact his business.

Why is the driveway of the Salvation Army not being closed?

RELATED: Haney Bypass work underway in Maple Ridge

They are the only property on that corner to retain a driveway.

The reason for closing his driveway is that corner is a high crash zone.

This is a pretty poor excuse.

The Salvation Army probably create more traffic and pedestrian issues than the hotel, and yet they are provided access – be fair and close all the driveways near that corner.

There might be another reason, other than laziness, that motivates people to leave poo in bags beside the garbage cans – and it has nothing to do with COVID, one letter writer suggests. (Special to The News)

Dear Editor,

[RE: Maple Ridge dog walker pissed with discarded poop bags, April 12, The News online]

Dear Maple Ridge dog walker, who is pissed with discarded poop bags, I want you to know that you are not alone.

We community members, who take pride in the cleanliness and sanitation of our community, understand the frustration about the dog poop bags.

I also would like for you to think about this…

Have you ever seen someone attempt to make an environmentally friendly decision by leaving a pop can or bottle beside the garbage can in hopes that a Good Samaritan would pick it up and recycle it responsibly?

Did you know dog poo is banned from our city garbage cans?

Did you think that these people might be trying to be like the person who made an attempt to recycle the pop bottle by placing it beside the garbage can, not in it.

My point is, people leaving their doggy doodoo has been going on long before COVID came around.

These people who are leaving the poo under the garbage bin most likely are not scared of touching the garbage bin handle and they aren’t lazy after all, they just know the harmful effects this biohazard has on our environment.

When dog poo is put in the landfill and not disposed of correctly, it harms vegetation and exposes people and other animals to bacteria and parasites.

Have you ever visited the Pitt River Regional Greenway? It is a beautiful walking trail along the Fraser River in Pitt Meadows.

I recently visited this trail on a Father’s Day walk with my dad.

Believe it or not, I did not see one bag of dog poo anywhere. I believe the reason for the scarcity of the dog poo filled bags were because of the accessibility of all the wonderful dog poo bins! This area is maintained by the Metro Vancouver Parks and in my humble opinion, the City of Maple Ridge and also Pitt Meadows should take notes and implement this genius idea.

Why is it that at places, such as off-leash dog parks and other trails, where many of our fur babies love to walk are deprived of dog poo waste bins?

If they created half as many dog waste bins as they did garbage cans, this would actually give the citizens responsible choices to make while disposing of our crap, literally.

Maybe we wouldn’t be finding all these little bags of doggy poo poo everywhere and we wouldn’t have as many Maple Ridge dog walkers who are pissed with discarded poop bags.

752,752,1219,mapleridgenews,https://www.mapleridgenews.com/opinion/finlayson-b-c-s-economy-devastated-by-pandemic-and-the-measures-taken-to-contain-it/,Finlayson: B.C.’s economy devastated by pandemic – and the measures taken to contain it – Maple Ridge News,'Jun.',2020-06-24,"‘Policy-makers should be acutely sensitive to the financial health of the overall business sector’

In its June 2020 Monetary Policy Report, the U.S. Federal Reserve – America’s central bank — observed that the COVID-19 pandemic “poses acute risks to the survival of many small businesses,” adding that widespread failures among such firms “would adversely alter the economic landscape of local communities and potentially slow the economic recovery and future labor productivity growth.”

The B.C. government would be wise to take this message to heart. Small businesses, as defined by the government’s statisticians, account for 98 per cent of all enterprises and approximately half of private sector jobs.

In the current challenging and uncertain economic climate, policy-makers should be acutely sensitive to the financial health of the overall business sector, including smaller firms.

Many of these companies are in sectors that have been hard-hit by pandemic-related social distancing, outright business closures, dwindling consumer demand, and reduced investment – for example, food services, accommodation, recreation, non-essential retail, travel, arts and entertainment, construction, and personal services.

Compounding the risks for small firms, they also tend to be more financially fragile than larger companies, with most having limited cash reserves and lines of credit.

Although B.C. has done a good job flattening the curve of COVID-19, the province’s economy has been devastated by the pandemic and the measures taken to contain it. For 2020, the Business Council forecasts that economic output (GDP) in the province will drop by almost 8 per cent, which is far greater than the GDP losses experienced in previous recessions.

As of mid-June, B.C. is down 350,000 jobs compared to early 2020 — a catastrophic fall in employment. While the worst of the COVID-19 economic downturn may be over, the consequences of steep declines in GDP, employment and business activity since February are expected to be felt for years to come. And much of the pain will be visited upon smaller and mid-sized enterprises in every sector and region of B.C.

The dramatic slide in consumer spending and business activity triggered by mandated closures across large segments of the economy, coupled with the virtual cessation of travel, border closures, and the onset of a global recession, has already led to casualties among B.C. firms.

Under the government’s staged economic reopening plan, many formerly shuttered businesses are – or soon will be — open again.

However, in sectors like retail, restaurants and bars, leisure, recreation, hotels and motels, and personal services, businesses are now required to maintain strict social distancing for customers and staff, to limit the number of people on-site, and to devote more resources to cleaning and sanitation.

This amounts to a significant change in the operating environment for many businesses, one that is likely to translate into both lower revenues and higher costs.

Looking ahead, a substantial number of businesses will not last through the end of 2021. We estimate that at least 10 per cent of the 200,000 B.C. businesses with paid employees could be gone in the next 6-18 months.

Some will make the difficult decision to cease operations, while others will be forced into insolvency because they are no longer able to cover their bills or service their debts.

The impact of a shrinking private sector will not be limited to business owners/operators. Fewer firms also mean lost jobs for B.C. workers, less vibrant communities, and greater economic hardship for families.

Faced with this alarming prospect, the provincial government must do what it can to minimize mortality among locally-based companies. Equally important, it should focus on creating an environment that supports business start-ups to help fill the gap that will open up as thousands of existing companies fail.

Despite a few positive steps, to date the NDP government has come up short in supporting the business community and in encouraging new business formation.

In fact, the government has largely carried on with its pre-pandemic policy agenda, which paved the way for increased tax and regulatory burdens for most businesses and higher payroll costs for employers.

A change of direction is necessary if policy-makers are interested in kick starting economic recovery and making British Columbia a top-ranked jurisdiction for new private sector investment and entrepreneurial activity.

Germany has launched a coronavirus tracing app that officials say is so secure even government ministers can use it. Smartphone apps have been touted as a high-tech tool in the effort to track down potential COVID-19 infections. (Hannibal Hanschke/Pool Photo via AP)

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau recently announced the release of a nationwide contact tracing app. He remarked that it would be “something you can just download and forget about.”

In the wake of demonstrations in response to the killing of George Floyd, the Minneapolis Public Safety Commissioner stated that the police had begun tracking down protesters through a process he analogized to “contact tracing.” Whether or not contact tracing apps are or will be used to locate demonstrators, it is clear that the barrier between public health officers and police officers is permeable.

Blurring these lines is dangerous on multiple fronts. New surveillance technologies aimed at combating COVID-19 could be co-opted as a foothold to strengthen the surveillance state. In turn, skepticism of state-promoted contact tracing technologies may lead to insufficient adoption of them by the public, undermining their effectiveness and taking away a potentially important tool to fight the pandemic.

Legal precedents

This situation is not the first time that public health, privacy and law enforcement have collided. In the case of Vancouver Police Department vs. BC Centre for Excellence (BC-CfE) in HIV/AIDS, the Vancouver Police Department demanded private medical records from the BC-CfE in connection to an aggravated sexual assault case.

The implications of this request were massive. The BC-CfE has records on almost all known HIV-positive people in the province that include personal, demographic and even genetic information. Understandably, the BC-CfE resisted the request.

The B.C. provincial court held that society’s interest in protecting the confidentiality of the records outweighed the objectives of the police investigation as disclosure of patient and research information in furtherance of a criminal investigation would “erode the Centre’s ability to maintain a comprehensive program for HIV-Aids research and treatment. The benefits to society from that research are immeasurable.”

A similar argument could be made of any request to access data collected to fight COVID-19, such as data collected through contact tracing. It is not difficult to conclude that many people would refuse to voluntarily enrol in contact tracing apps like Alberta’s TraceTogether if they believed their information was not safe, as polling has suggested that privacy is a a significant concern with respect to such apps. Without buy-in from a critical mass of users, a contact tracing app would likely fail.

Structural framework

Yet legal arguments to protect our privacy through court proceedings are not enough in the post-COVID era. A broader structural framework to ensure privacy for health information is required.

Former Ontario Privacy Commissioner Dr. Ann Cavoukian developed a concept known as “privacy by design” in the late 1990s. Though many of the principles of this concept are geared toward the creation of information systems, they could well be applied to a data framework. The most pertinent foundational principles are as follows: the approach to privacy should be proactive rather than reactive; privacy should be the default setting and; transparency.

If properly crafted, a statute could make the government’s COVID-19 tracking efforts achieve privacy by design; it could ensure that any information collected for the purposes of COVID-19 surveillance be used only for health purposes, precluding use for any other purpose.

This would not only make privacy the default setting, but would also be a proactive approach, acting to prevent the state from engaging in violations of privacy, rather than attempting to reverse the damage in court after it has been done. Furthermore, a statute could ensure improved transparency by mandating that users be asked for permission each time before any identifiable data about them is used, informing them of the purpose of that use and then notifying them again once that information has been used.

New crisis solutions

The COVID-19 crisis is unprecedented, as are the measures we have collectively taken in response. We are all understandably keen to take whatever action is necessary to bring this virus to heel. Yet we must also remain vigilant.

Temporary impingement on rights and liberties all too often become permanent. As many have pointed out, this is not the last global pandemic nor, given the climate crisis, the last major catastrophe that will occur in our lifetimes.

The demand for increased bio-surveillance will grow in order to prevent this, and future pandemics. The Charter of Rights and Freedoms, of course, contains provisions protecting our privacy as well as our right to life, liberty and security of person. However, it is clear that in order to realize these rights, further action is needed to keep the realm of public health officers and police officers separate. Privacy and transparency need to become the default, not something that must be fought for in a courtroom after the fact.

The barrier between public health officers and police officers must stay intact. The challenges we face in the months and years ahead will not be easy to overcome, but we must face them with open eyes and to ensure we avoid an Orwellian pandemic in which we entirely lose control of our right to privacy.

Although men have been assigned the stereotype of working the backyard BBQ, it is a joy that is shared by most home culinary enthusiasts. It’s a summertime passion. The smoky essence of smoldering charcoal starts my mouth watering as my mind conjures up recollections of flame-licked meats, and fire roasted vegetables. With a few basic tips, you can overcome any barbequing intimidation you may have.

Overcooking lean meats is one of the most common mistakes made. Although it is imperative for poultry to be fully cooked, this does not give you the right to transform it into dry charred remains.

Brining can help protect light-meat poultry and lean pork. This is a technique that involves soaking in a salt-water solution for a period of time prior to cooking. Not only does this add moisture to the center of the meat, but also seasoning, as the salt saturated water is drawn in. A simple brining formula would be: one quarter cup table salt dissolved in 4 cups of water for pieces of poultry or lean pork. Let the meat sit in the brine for at least 1 hour in the refrigerator. Remove from the brine, pat them dry, and cook as you normally would. This brining process will provide a moisture protection shield to help keep fully cooked meats juicy. However, this is only a safeguard – overcooking is still possible, but this lessens the chance. The only other consideration you may need to give your recipe is the amount of seasoning. The meat will already be seasoned somewhat from the salt in the brine, so back off on the saltshaker.

Try this technique the next time you are barbequing chicken breasts, pork chops, pork tenderloins or pork loins. You will be impressed with the results.

The salt used can be any salt: Kosher, Sea, etc. – the important aspect is to ensure that the granules are the same size as table salt. A coarser grind will result in less salt per equal measure as more air trapped between the larger particles.

It is important to mention that this is the simplest form of brine: water and salt. There are many more complex recipes available on the internet that will bring flavor and moisture, but this easy brine is a straightforward starting point. Another essential pointer to bring up is that red meats are typically not brined; marinating is better for red meats, but that’s slated for another column topic.

Dear Chef Dez,

I love barbequed chicken with the skin on, however it always seems to get burned on the outside well before the center gets cooked. I know many people cook skinless chicken pieces and they have no problem, but I enjoy having the skin on. However, the fat from the skin promotes flare-ups, and thus gets burned. How can I avoid this without losing my enjoyment of having the skin?

Tracey S., Abbotsford

Dear Tracey,

Indirect heat is the way to go to conquer this problem. When using direct heat (with the flames directly below the meat) the skin will drip fat onto the flames and cause flare-ups, and thus create excessive burning. Depending on what type of barbeque you have, setting it up for indirect cooking will be different. Many ceramic charcoal BBQs will have a ceramic plate for heat diffusion, while gas grills will mostly rely on having a burner turned off under the meat and closing the lid. This will utilize the heat from the other burners to do the job.

It’s getting easier to access a swab test for COVID-19, but you still need a referral from a doctor, and a little courage. (Jessica Peters/ The Progress)

First of all, I need to sincerely apologize to the health nurse who performed my COVID-19 test.

I don’t always act like the melting Wicked Witch of the West, growling and pawing at my own face. Then again, who knew that swabs were half-a-foot long and could reach around to scratch your brains.

For the rest of you, I’ll back up a bit. It all started last week, with a post-workday nap that turned into a deep sleep.

Then there was the dry cough, the runny and tender nose, the pain in my forehead. Ultimately, there was the fact that all of the above didn’t disappear with a good dose of allergy medications.

I called in sick, because clearly I had caught a cold. And in addition to the ultimate cure of hot soups and daytime television, I had to go for a COVID-19 test. If we’ve learned anything from COVID-19 it’s that distancing works. And even the slightest chance that I may have spread the novel coronavirus around the office in the preceding days sent a flu-like shiver up my spine.

The first part was the easiest. I called up my family doctor’s office and told them I was sick. The doctor called back the next day and agreed I needed a test. A family member picked up the requisition and I was on my way to the Chilliwack Public Health Unit.

READ MORE: VIDEO: New COVID-19 testing machine takes load off B.C.’s virologists and labs

I ran through the raindrops to the front door, only to be turned around to the side of the building I had sprinted past.

Around the corner, signs on the building and markings on the ground direct you where to stand and what to do. A nurse was waiting at the doorway, ready to screen me for my symptoms. With that out of the way, I was in the building, which has been temporarily turned into a make-shift COVID-19 testing ward. The first thing I noticed is that the windows are all sealed off with poly and tape.

A few wide rows of spaced apart chairs face away from the entrance, and a few testing areas have been curtained off along one wall.

Distancing is in place that is well above the suggested two metres, and it made me feel safe. It also reminded me that this is a serious threat to some people’s health. It underscored why I was standing there, requisition in hand, sniffles in my nostrils, and a fear of what’s about to happen. I would have preferred to be back at the office, writing. Prior to COVID-19, I wouldn’t even have blinked twice at going to work with a dripping nose. A bit of cold medication, some strong coffee and tissues and I would have been on my way.

But we know more now, don’t we? If anything, staying home when sick should be adopted as the new normal.

I’m sent to a curtained off area, and we run through the list of questions. As my ‘yes’ answers pile up faster than the ‘no’ answers, the hypochondriac within me feels like maybe I do have the virus.

When it was time to tilt the head back, and let the nurse do her thing, I felt immensely brave. But as brave as I am in my heart, my body always has other plans. I felt my eyes widen as the swab entered my nose and quickly jammed up. My eyes teared. I gagged. I grabbed my chin, for some unknown reason, coughed and snorted and began to make those aforementioned witchy noises.

With no luck on the right, she moved to the left. I felt the swab glide up easily and for a slice of a second, I thought this would be easier. Of course, I was wrong and I was once again writhing in the chair.

So the bad news is, I’m utterly ridiculous. The good news is, it was over very quickly and shouldn’t be avoided for any reason. Results are quick, available on myehealth.com within 24 hours, and if you test positive they will call in the same time frame.

Also good news? My COVID-19 test that day was negative and it was likely just that regular ‘old’ coronavirus — the common cold. As of today, I’m one of more than 171,000 people who have been tested for COVID-19 in B.C. To date, there have been 2,775 cases in this province, and 168 deaths. Eleven people are in the hospital today with COVID-19, and five of those are in an ICU.

And so, despite the temporary discomfort, I would do it again.

For more information on how and when to get a COVID-19 test, visit www.bccdc.ca, call 8-1-1, or contact your physician’s office.

Submit letters to the editor through our website, via email or in writing.

Dear Editor,

[RE: Get tough on crime but leave law abiding, registered gun owners alone, June 13, The News]

Mr. O’Brian spelled out quite clearly the implications of the Order In Council (OIC) firearm ban on legal firearm owners in his well-written letter, but there is a greater issue behind it.

That is the use of an Order In Council to pass such major, wide-sweeping legislation without parliamentary procedure and due process.

All 338 of our sitting MPs were elected by the people to represent all citizens in Canada.

This use of an OIC has robbed Canadians proper debate in the House of Commons and second reading in the Senate, thus denying Canadians due process in a fully functioning democracy.

On that basis alone, the use of the OIC tool must not be allowed to stand, for it sets a dangerous precedent.

If it is allowed to stand, what’s to stop future governments from using this tool to pass legislation to trample the rights of another group?

Impossible, you say?

I urge anyone reading this to revisit history, for things like this have happened before, and it would be incredibly naive to think it couldn’t happen again.

Disarming a population – from farmers, ranchers, sport shooter, and collectors – was proven to be the first step to some of the greatest human rights abuses in history by governments that have lost their way.

This use of an Order In Council, or, shall I say, abuse, was not just a slap in the face of democracy. It was a right cross, and Canadians need to remember the lessons of history in order to avoid repeating it.

Submit letters to the editor through our website, via email or in writing.

Dear Editor,

I will avoid the inevitable downsizing to either a condo or apartment complex as long as my wife and I can maintain our detached home and yard.

The writing is on the wall though as we already need to hire-out maintenance work that is beyond us now.

But what is the alternative, if we oppose high density developments?

Yes, such developments come with their own problems including increased traffic.

Urban sprawl is a problem that all municipalities must deal with. It is better to build up, isn’t it, then to see productive farmland built over and lost, along with habitat for birds and animals.

As humans, we also need green spaces.

UNRELATED LETTER: Predictions of COVID reality 30 years into the future

Too much has been lost because of developers taking the easy and cheapest way out – aided and abetted by municipal planning departments – by paving over paradise as the song from the 1960s said.

It was true then, and it is still true today.

For most people in this part-time, minimum-wage-with-no-benefits economy, owning a detached home anywhere in the Fraser Valley is a pipe-dream.

But people need housing and higher density developments can provide that.

Such developments need to be people friendly, not simply boxes to warehouse people in – as that comes with its own set of social problems and isolation.

I might hate the idea of eventually downsizing, but I hate the sight of urban sprawl even more.

This pandemic should be a wake up call to become as self-sufficient in food production as possible. So, for that reason alone, higher density is the only viable future as the population grows. Otherwise the future will be the fulfillment of the Fraser Institute long held dream of seeing the entire Fraser Valley covered in housing from the Coast to Hope.

I couldn’t imagine anything more horrific.

Robert T. Rock, Mission City

SoundON is a province-wide campaign and resilience fund to help bring British Columbia’s music community back together and provide desperately needed support to those connected to the sector – artists, presenters, production staff and venues.

The first project of its kind in Canada, it is the ultimate in community and collaboration as it brings together industry members from across the province with one common goal – to bring the province’s vibrant music industry back to life.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on the once effervescent music industry in BC, said Lindsay MacPherson, executive director at Music BC.

“It is a pain that has been felt by so many, especially those working in arts and culture. A group of leaders from across the industry have come together to collaborate on a way to bring back life to the sector,” MacPherson explained. “We have everyone from city officials, promoters, presenters, venues, production, and artists working on the project. Our aim is to be highly collaborative, in an unprecedented way, to bring our beloved industry back.”

The music industry in BC was among the first sectors to be closed due to COVID and will be among the last to reopen, a scenario that is predicted to create devastating consequences for the industry.

Without immediate action, more than 90 per cent of Canadian independent music venues are anticipated to permanently close within the next six months.

SoundON.ca will fund and stream uniquely curated content through the lens of festivals and presenters.

With the help of public funding, corporate sponsors, and individual donors, SoundON aims to put economic flow back into the industry.

The website also provides music lovers worldwide a whole new way to discover music in BC. Amazing shows from across our province will be featured.

SoundON is produced by a volunteer collective from the music sector, who are passionate about making a difference.

The first stages, announcing today, invite presenters from across B.C. to apply to curate shows that will be streamed on SoundON.ca beginning July.

An anticipated 100 shows will be produced to showcase the incredible diversity of British Columbia’s music community. While shows will be free to watch on SoundON.ca, donations will be encouraged to help fund the project through its ongoing phases.

SoundOn is presented in part with initial funding from Creative BC, the Province of British Columbia, several corporate sponsors, and private funders.

(Theatre in the Country/Special to the Langley Advance Times)

Since early April, Langley’s Theatre in the Country (TIC) has been presenting live streaming productions to a growing audience of viewers.

So far, they have presented 12 distinct scripts from one-acts to full plays from material largely in the public domain.

With a rotating group of 45 plus performers they have offered shows from Oscar Wilde to the Thin Man series.

This week they will present their first full length modern play, Nana’s Naughty Knickers, with playwright, Katherine Disavino in attendance via Zoom from Los Angeles.

DiSavino is a Los Angeles writer who serves as an executive story editor on CW’s Nancy Drew.

Her four published plays have been translated into multiple languages and performed around the world.

What protagonist Bridget saw as a unique opportunity to stay with her favorite Nana in New York for the summer, quickly turns into an experience she’ll never forget.

It seems her sweet Grandma is running an illegal boutique from her apartment, selling hand-made naughty knickers to every senior citizen in the five borough area! Will her Nana get arrested – or worse – evicted?

When Theatre in the Country shuttered its doors on March 16, artistic director Reg Parks said they had no idea when or if they would reopen, but they started planning on how to keep their performers and patrons active and engaged in a live theatre experience.

“The idea is simple: using their bank of over 45 performers they will perform a new costumed, readers theatre show each weekend on Friday and Saturday night,” he said. “The audience that has been asked to pay what they can starting at $5. It is the company’s hope that no one needs to miss out on a play just because of financial uncertainty caused by a layoff or otherwise.”

Parks said TIC will open their doors with a two-person musical titled The Last 5 Years by Jason Robert Brown.

It will feature two veteran TIC performers, and an audience reduced to 50 from their normal capacity of 200.

Other shows will also be offered with casts of two to five and will be announced at a later date.

Theatre in the Country is a community based dinner-theatre which was founded by Reg and Erin Parks in 2013.

It was first located in Maple Ridge, before moving to downtown Langley three years ago.

Nana’s Naughty Knickers will be performed nightly on July 3 and 4 at 7:30 p.m.

Tickets and information on upcoming performance is available at https://theatreinthecountry.com.

798,798,1265,langleyadvancetimes,https://www.langleyadvancetimes.com/entertainment/langley-filmmaker-revamps-award-winning-documentary-about-his-own-addiction-story/,Langley filmmaker revamps award-winning documentary about his own addiction story – Langley Advance Times,'Ryan Uytdewilligen',2020-06-27,"A Ravaged Soul: Anatomy of an Addict was originally released by v12films in 2014

Langley resident Brian MacDonald recalled sneaking around between classes to score drugs throughout the 1990s.

He was an instructor at the time, owning and operating Vancouver’s Broadcast College in the midst of a career that had taken him on-air and into the management side of the industry.

MacDonald told the Langley Advance Times that was also the time an addiction to heroin took over his life.

After cleaning up in 2002, MacDonald decided to follow a passion for film and start his own production company – v12films.

“We produce documentaries on the human condition and struggle,” he said. “Stories of redemption.”

MacDonald began with his own story and began to explore the journey of addiction through a one-hour documentary called A Ravaged Soul – first released in 2014.

“It takes a look at the downtown East Side of Vancouver,” MacDonald explains. “It’s an ugly story and hard to watch.”

The filmmaker said he left no stone unturned, frankly discussing sexual and physical abuse that preceded his addiction.

Key members of his life speak in A Ravaged Soul, including MacDonald’s mother and his ex-wife, the mother of his child.

He credits their son as his major inspiration for turning his life around.

“It’s a really emotional 60-minute ride,” he assured.

Stan Mingo, a former dealer from the Vancouver Downtown East Side also appears in the documentary, a man MacDonald referred to as “the king of the heroin trade.”

MacDonald said Mingo speaks openly about his experiences and a time when he even plotted to kill MacDonald.

Altogether, the documentary charts MacDonald’s experiences of getting sober through his own eyes and the views of others who were and remain close to him.

“I guarantee it is as honest of a documentary that you will see and I’m proud of it,” MacDonald assured.

His first attempt at the production in 2014 led to an Official Selection award at the REEL Recovery Film Festival in New York.

MacDonald has since released a myriad of documentaries in the past five years, most of them dealing with drug addiction and the stigmas that go with the territory.

Today, the owner of v12films said he updated his inaugural work by updating the situation and some of the documentary’s technical aspects.

“The production value was weak so I brought it up to a more professional standard and up to speed,” he said.

With the stresses of COVID-19, MacDonald said the documentary had plenty for relevancy as drug use as, in his words, gone off the charts.

With other productions in the works including a dramatic pilot called The Orchestration of Audrey, MacDonald invited people to contact him at v12films.canada@gmail.com to view the documentary.

“If someone you love is suffering from addiction, please contact me to show them the film,” he said.

MacDonald is 18 years clean and moved to Langley 14 years ago to be closer to his ex-wife and son.

People can visit http://www.v12films.com/home to find out more about MacDonald and the production company.

Westcoast Harmony Chorus sings a cappella with more than 60 members of varying ages from all over the Lower Mainland – rehearsing on Wednesday evenings in Surrey.

While the coronavirus pandemic halted those physical practices, Westcoast Harmony is still performing traditional barbershop, contemporary pop, and rock arrangements together – now virtually over Zoom.

Anne Downton, a Langley member of the chorus said the group has been rehearsing together that was since March, but said they do missing singing together – but the impersonal method will have to due in the meantime.

“This was a way to sing together, and it’s been wonderful to hear the group sound again,” she said.

One of the projects that has kept Westcoast Harmony busy is a 49-person rendition of O Canada, performed through zoom and edited by Downton.

“We also really want to contribute to our local communities’ celebrations; we know Canada Day celebrations are looking different this year, so we wanted to be able to share our music, and hopefully bring joy to everyone who watches,” Downton said.

The members all learned and recorded their video independently at home and submitted it for editing, an undertaking Downton said will continue on into new projects.

Andrew Strain photo.

On the West Coast, we know that the province’s fertile valleys are ripe with, well, food and wine. But did you know that the area that stretches from the fields of the Fraser Valley to the vineyards of the Okanagan is also an ideal spot for outdoor play?

For every fresh peach that’s devoured, there’s an orchard to cycle through. For every Pinot that’s sipped, there’s a paddle that first needs to be dipped in a cool lake. So, embrace this delectable yin and yang, and rediscover your next great BC adventure.

Explore the Fraser Valley

In British Columbia, we’re blessed with natural settings that are as fruitful as they are beautiful. Rolling fields, vineyards, and wide-open spaces are all ready for exploration – and adventure.

A trip just east of the city to the Fraser Valley is the quickest way to immerse in farm life. Beginning in Langley, you can nibble your way from farm to farm to Abbotsford and beyond – all family-run operations that boast everything from fresh-from-the-garden fruits and vegetables to homemade waffles, ice creams, and ciders. Among the pretty landscapes and grazing cattle, you can ride the rapids during a river-rafting excursion or try your hand at catch-and-release sturgeon fishing near Chilliwack. To understand more about local Indigenous culture, opt for a guided tour of the area’s significant sites.

Road Trip to the Okanagan

There are many ways to journey to the Okanagan, and we know them all: the oft-travelled Highway 1; scenic Highway 7; Highway 5/Highway 97, a.k.a. “the fast route”; and Highway 3/Highway 97. But don’t rush along these corridors.

Fuel up at coffee shops and dig into some of the best home cooking anywhere at famed roadside diners in Hope. With bellies full, test your mettle on winding trails or seek out quiet spots at local green spaces. Pedal fast and furious at bike parks or visit historic ranches and outdoorsy resorts, and consider staying awhile.

Valley summers were made for places like Vaseux Lake. Grant Harder photo.

Enjoy Lakeside Adventure

Spend more than five minutes in BC’s sun-kissed Okanagan, and you know that wine touring, craft breweries, cideries, and meaderies are prime for summer visits. Also prime for warmer months? Hours spent on a boat, swims in hidden coves, and long, leisurely paddles with your pod.

Beyond the shorelines, explore the bucolic valleys and the sustainable agritourism that fuel this lakeside lifestyle. Try two-wheeling among the vineyards – a novel way to visit local wineries near Penticton. Hike the Okanagan’s many trails, discover local Indigenous culture near Osoyoos, or visit a family farm for homegrown treats. Another option? Take it all in from a patio at one of the region’s premier winery restaurants. Cheers to that!

Steve “Elvis” Elliot crooned tunes fit for the King himself, serenading Grace and her guests with hits like “Don’t be Cruel,” a few gospel favourites and “All Shook Up.”

Storteboom was clearly having a wonderful time, and so were her guests. Before starting his rendition of “It’s Now or Never,” Elliot asked Storteboom if she had any Italian blood in her. The sassy nonagenarian proudly declared her Dutch heritage but told Elvis “I can be anything you want me to be.”

Local dignitaries MLA Laurie Throness and District of Kent Mayor Sylvia Pranger also stopped by to pass on their well wishes. Storteboom received more than 150 birthday cards from the community, including one from The Observer.

On Tuesday (June 23), Agassiz Speedway announced the July 4 Freedom Summer Classic, a full afternoon of racing to be streamed via the Agassiz Speedway Facebook page.

The upcoming race will feature mini stock cars and dwarf cars racing from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. and midgets and street stocks racing from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.

“One time, one night only,” the promotional poster reads. “No spectators; just for the love of freedom and racing.”

RELATED: Four basic rules for getting ‘race ready’ for Agassiz Speedway

This race has been in the works since at least mid-June, in which Darrell Porayko called on the racing community via social media for a first-come, first-serve race featuring a maximum of 20 cars; the current provincially-mandated gathering restrictions meant the drivers and crew members present could only amount to 50 people total.

Three days before the official announcement, speedway officials said American Independence Day was “looking good for an exhibition race.”

RELATED: Super fan shown appreciation at Agassiz Speedway

“No points, no money,” the June 20 post said. “This is only to satisfy your hunger to race.”

Were it not for the pandemic, the 2020 racing season would normally have begun on May 2. Up until the plan for the July 4 race came to be, drivers were limited to test and tune dates and speedway staff worked on maintaining and updating the track and facilities, missing the rush of racing all the while. Speedway staff had no general meeting for much of the pandemic until June due to stricter gathering restrictions.

The Langley Speedway Historical Society donated vintage trophies for the Freedom Summer Classic.

The Reach Gallery Museum is open again, and the public is invited to view the latest exhibitions.

The facility first closed its doors in mid-March in the midst of three exhibitions that were intended to be open until late spring, and began offering online content to allow people to interact with the exhibitions from home.

The site reopened on June 1, and those exhibitions will now remain open until late August.

The exhibitions include “a soul is not made of atoms,” a solo exhibition by Vancouver-based artist Trevor Van den Eijnden that features immersive sculptural and light installations.

Also featured is Glimmers of the Radiant Real, a touring group exhibition from Ontario making its only western Canada stop at The Reach, and Art on Demand 6.2, the latest installment in The Reach’s Emerge exhibition program, which mentors young and emerging artists and curators in the Fraser Valley.

Adrienne Fast, curator of arts and visual culture at The Reach, said in-person programming – classes, workshops, and camps – has been put on hold. But The Reach continues to regularly update its website with educational materials and interactive activities.

She said The Reach has implemented a number of changes that include hand sanitizing stations, physical-distancing measures, directional signage, and an increased cleaning schedule.

Summer hours of operation are Tuesday to Friday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Saturdays from noon to 5 p.m. Visit thereach.ca for more information.

A short film that is based in Abbotsford is part of an online Vancouver documentary film festival that is streaming online from June 18 to 26.

The film Have You Forgotten Me? takes place in Abbotsford and is about a Sikh family and the oldest Sikh Temple in North America.

Anchored by the letters of a wife left behind, Vancouver-based director Baljit Sangra considers one Sikh family’s story of separation and assimilation, and of creating community in a new country.

The film is included in the DOXA Documentary Film Festival and is featured in this year’s Shorts Program: BC Voices.

DOXA was originally scheduled to take place in Vancouver from May 7 to 14. The online festival features more than 64 films – shorts and features – from across Canada and the world.

Films will be available to watch on demand for the duration of the festival. Once unlocked, viewers have 24 hours to watch the movie of their choice.

Virtual tickets for each film are $8 general and $6 for seniors/students/low income. A $60 pass provides access to all the films. The films and tickets are available at doxafestival.ca.

— The music video for Isaiah Faber’s (Powfu) “death bed (coffee for your head) ft. beabadoobee” was filmed mostly at Abbotsford Mill Lake Park. The song has over 440 million views on Spotify and the video has over 90 million views on Youtube. Screenshot from Youtube music video.

A two-month-old song from a Mission artist has become the biggest music hit to come out of the Fraser Valley in recent history.

Isaiah Faber, known as Powfu, released “(coffee for your head) ft. beabadoobee” in April 2020, and the song been heard by over 440 million people on Spotify.

The music video, much of it filmed at Abbotsford’s Mill Lake Park, has reached over 90 million views on Youtube. Faber’s other music videos are also filmed at various Abbotsford locations.

In order to become the Fraser Valley’s biggest hit of all time, it would have to surpass the Carly Rae Jepsen’s smash 2013 hit “Call Me Maybe,” which has over 1.2 billion views on Youtube.

It seems music runs in the family as Faber’s father, David, is the lead singer of the Canadian punk band Faber Drive. Faber Drive, also hailing from Mission, was nominated for a Juno Award in 2008.

Local love and a world of design possibilities come together at this Ashley HomeStore.

What’s your style? Finding a way to reflect that in your home can send you searching through Pinterest, streaming the latest HGTV special or shopping store to store to find one that speaks to you in your price range.

Or, you could browse a world of styles, sizes, materials and colours in one location!

From Vintage Casual, Traditional, Contemporary and anything in between “there’s always something for every budget, and something for every taste,” says Nichole Dansie, from Ashley HomeStore in Abbotsford. “Whether you’re moving out for the first time and you’re looking for that starter sofa or you’re decorating your dream home, you’ll find the styles that you love here.”

Where others source from outside manufacturers, Ashley HomeStore is a complete design-manufacture business, meaning you won’t find other brands on the showroom floor. What you will find is a wide selection of furnishings to suit just about every home and every style.

While the company’s North American presence allows for savings that only larger-scale manufacturing affords, the local, family-owned Fraser Valley stores serving Abbotsford, Langley and Coquitlam demonstrate the value of neighbours helping neighbours.

“I think one of the best qualities our HomeStores offer is that we’re very focused on your experience. That means we’re here to work with you to answer any questions you have – before or after you leave the store,” Dansie says.

TIPS FROM ASHLEY HOMESTORE

Measure! Before you leave the house, break out that measuring tape. “Measurements are very important, not only for the space it’s going into, but also your doorways, hallways, stairwells and elevator,” Dansie points out. The last thing you want is to LOVE that 90-inch couch but find your elevator is only 86” tall.

Consider your colours. Are you trying to match a particular paint sample or floor colour? “I find a lot of people will bring in a piece of flooring with them. One person even brought a piece of drywall painted with their wall colour,” Dansie says. “And remember, lighting is so important, but it can be difficult to get a clear reflection of that under showroom lights. We’ll often suggest people take a pillow cushion outside to the natural light to get a better idea of the true colour.”

In addition to in-home delivery and set-up, with extensive health and safety protocols in place, Ashley HomeStore also offers 1 year of in-home service with their delivery. Products also include a one-year manufacturer’s warranty, with additional options available.

If you love the style and colour of your kitchen cabinets, but hate their worn appearance, the solution may be easier and more affordable than you think!

Cabinet refinishing can return the look you love at a fraction of the time and cost of new cabinets, explains Tracy Booth, who has been professionally refinishing cabinets for more than 30 years.

“Are you wanting to spend $30,000 or are you wanting to spend $2,000?” asks Booth, owner of Gleam Guard Cabinet Refinishing, serving Greater Victoria and Vancouver Island.

While cabinets can go slightly lighter or darker, Booth emphasizes that his focus is on returning the cabinets to their original appearance, not changing their appearance.

“Wood has character and we want to preserve that character. Our goal is to restore, not change,” Booth says.“If areas have gotten dull or worn, we can fix that. That’s what makes us cabinet refinishers. A Gleam Guard trained professional can tint and make them look like new, which is a very technical skill.”

Technique and experience matters

The distinction is important, as refinishing – compared to simply painting or staining – takes a unique skillset. “It’s important people know that the person who is in their kitchen has the training to do the perfect matching,” notes Booth, whose Gleam Guard is BBB-accredited with an A+ rating.

“While we repaint painted cabinets; we do not paint brown cabinets white.”

To ensure the perfect, long-lasting finish, preparation is key. A Gleam Guard trained professional begins by prepping the surface with a vigorous clean, then professionally matching and applying the new colour. To complete the process, a wood floor finish is applied for a long-wearing result, protecting your cabinets from hazards such as water damage, grease and dust (with the added benefit of being easier to clean and maintain).

The entire dust-free process takes only a day or two, and there’s no need to unload your cabinets – easy!

Not just for kitchen cabinets … or wood

For those who’ve chosen a different material for their cabinets, you’ll find help here, too!

“We also do laminate refinishing – any product that your cabinets are made of, we can clean it and put a fresh finish on it,” Booth says.

In fact, all interior millwork can be refinished, so think beyond the kitchen to your built-in bookshelves, doors, windowsills, furniture and more.

To learn more, visit gleamguardcabinetrefinishing.ca. The Gleam Guard team is working during the current COVID precautions, taking steps to keep staff and clients safe, but for those who are self-isolating, Booth is happy to make appointments for later this summer.

In a letter penned by Rob Dhanu and signed by 20 other lawyers, the argument is put forth that if liquor stores and laundromats and Walmart remained in operation amid the COVID-19 pandemic, why couldn’t the courts?

And with phase two in B.C. seeing yet more businesses able to open safely, why not provincial courts?

“Charter scrutiny will require us to ask how it was possible that British Columbians could receive a massage or a haircut but still not access their courts?” the letter states.

(See below for the entire letter, unedited.)

The letter goes so far as to say that: “One of the greatest court systems in the world is in its worst moment of crisis as numerous criminal matters dangle on the precipice of oblivion.”

Why oblivion? Why is delay so serious? Any non-lawyer who has spent any time in courts will know that nothing moves quickly. And time and again, it’s these very defence lawyers asking for adjournment after adjournment.

• READ MORE: COVID-19: B.C. provincial court to reduce operations

• READ MORE: COVID-19: B.C. supreme and provincial courts suspend regular operations

Asked about this perceived hypocrisy – defence lawyers who constantly adjourn files now complaining about delays – Dhanu responded that very few matters ever go to trial as they are resolved before that stage. He said files are often adjourned so that resolution can happen in the background. Many things need to happen outside of court including, for example, discussions with Crown, reference letters being completed, expert assessments made, and counselling or treatment arranged.

What is of great concern to all defence lawyers is delays that violate the Charter rights of the accused, rights that are now further enshrined in the so-called R v. Jordan decision that says all provincial criminal matters need to be resolved in 18 months, from charge to trial (or resolution).

What could prove to be of great concern for the justice system going forward, according to Dhanu and his colleagues, is the definition of “exceptional circumstances” where delay is allowed under Jordan.

The novel coronavirus outbreak that led to a global pandemic is about as exceptional as it gets, so clearly Jordan arguments will be a no-go, right?

Not so fast, say the lawyers. According to the court, in Jordan exceptional circumstances lie outside the Crown’s control in that they are reasonably unforeseen or unavoidable. But Dhanu says the analysis doesn’t end there. He says the Crown must “proactively mitigate the delay” and help prevent “a possibly devastating cascade of delay issues.”

He argues further that if the courts open in several weeks or months with protective measures in place such as plexiglass and hand sanitizer, then the question will be, why couldn’t this have been done sooner since they did it at, for example, the liqour store?

And if the courts open in several weeks without such measures, even more questions around delay will be asked.

An even further argument is being made regarding the BC Supreme Court, which in places like Chilliwack functions side-by-side with provincial court. The BC Supreme Court is re-opening its doors (supposedly) this week, while the much busier (from a criminal perspective) provincial court is limited to two courtrooms in Surrey and one courtroom in four other courthouses in the Lower Mainland as of June 8.

“There will be an obvious inconsistency if one level of court in this province is open for business and the other is not,” Dhanu writes.

All of this is to say that COVID-19 is a terrible yoke on an already over-burdened justice system.

And while I am not a lawyer, I don’t for a second believe any Crown counsel will agree that delays stemming from the pandemic will count towards the Jordan 18-month ceiling. Will any judge buy the argument? We will see, but I don’t know.

But that doesn’t mean these 20 lawyers don’t plan on floating that boat when provincial courts are back up and running in the coming weeks.

The full letter penned by Fraser Valley defence lawyer Rupinder (Rob) Dhanu and signed by 20 lawyers sent to the B.C. government this week:

QUIS CUSTODIET IPSOS CUSTODES – “WHO WATCHES THE WATCHERS?” ~Juvenal

A growing tsunami of criminal cases may be at risk of never seeing the light of day due to delays arising from the coronavirus pandemic and the response of British Columbia courts. In mid-March of this year, all three levels of our court system effectively shuttered their doors to all but the most “urgent” of cases. Unfortunately, even these most urgent of matters could not proceed due to the woefully inadequate technological infrastructure at the disposal of the court system. Today, we are face to face with an ever-increasing log jam of delayed hearings that add daily to the already clogged corridors of our courts. The continued inability of our court system to stem the tide increasingly raises the spectre of unreasonable delay under section 11(b) of the Charter.

Thus far, the overwhelming assumption among court stakeholders has been that Covid-19 constitutes “exceptional circumstances” when it comes to R. v. Jordan and delay. According to the court in Jordan, exceptional circumstances lie outside the Crown’s control in the sense that they are reasonably unforeseen or unavoidable. But the exceptional circumstances analysis does not end there. Both the justice system and Crown must also proactively mitigate the delay resulting from a discrete exceptional circumstance. This is the sword of Damocles that now hangs over our justice system in terms of a possibly devastating cascade of delay issues arising from continued closure and a seeming inability to efficiently or effectively pivot to deal with them.

Much of the current criticism against our justice system has centred around the failure of technology to pick up where the closure of our courts left off. There can be no doubt that the tradition laden court system has lagged behind advancements in technology that have reshaped our daily world. However, the technology issue is a proverbial red herring. Even if the technology available to our courts were far more advanced, the vast majority of hearings still could not have proceeded. That is because in person hearings are required to tender exhibits, for credibility assessments to be made, to allow juries to sit or myriad other reasons underpinning our system of justice. Thus, the technology issue may factor into the delay analysis but it plays a far lesser role than the real question. That being whether our courts took reasonable steps to mitigate issues of delay using the considerable resources they did have at their disposal.

Charter analysis will begin with the fact that, unlike many other jurisdictions that imposed strict “lockdown” policies, British Columbia’s approach was to require safe operation of a broad range of services designated as essential services, to protect the health care system and maintain access to key services and supplies. Many non-essential businesses remained open, provided they could operate safely. Our court system and related legal professionals were designated an essential service by the government of this province. From hospitals to laundromats and liquor stores to large retailers with numerous locations and employees, essential and non-essential businesses across the province quickly responded to social distancing directives in a timely if painful manner in order to keep their doors open. Thus, the delay analysis begins with the question of why our courts could not pivot in a timely manner to do the same.

Analyzing inconsistencies in the response of our courts will inform the delay analysis. On March 13, 2020, a joint notice was issued by all three levels of our courts that they had developed a coordinated approach to manage impacts of coronavirus on their operations. However, this coordinated approach did not translate to what was actually occurring on the ground for long. Due to the nature of appellate practice, the British Columbia Court of Appeal was able to shift gears to online hearings courtesy of Zoom video conferencing technology in a way trial courts simply could not.

But the real dichotomy in responses will likely lay between British Columbia Supreme and Provincial courts. Supreme courts opened for at least some in person hearings including trial matters in May by simply employing social distancing protocols. Meanwhile, our Provincial courts remained closed. Our Supreme Court announced that they would be reopening their doors on June 8, 2020 (although if this actually occurs remains to be seen). On the other hand, the workhorse for most criminal matters, the Provincial Court, directed a far more limited opening of 2 courtrooms in Surrey and 1 courtroom in 4 other courthouses in the Lower Mainland and Fraser Valley as of June 8th. There will be an obvious inconsistency if one level of court in this province is open for business and the other is not. This inconsistency is perhaps most glaring in courthouses where both Supreme and Provincial courts function side by side within the confines of the same building. For instance, a litigant could seemingly walk into Victoria Supreme Court to have their day in court but it would apparently be too dangerous to do so in the Provincial courtroom next door.

The delay analysis will not only involve exploring inconsistencies between our courts, but also with government. On May 6, 2020, the provincial government announced that Phase 2 of British Columbia’s Restart Plan would commence as of May 19 and include restoration of a wide array of services including elective surgeries, dentistry, physiotherapy, massage, the retail sector, hair salons, restaurants, pubs, libraries, offices, sports, parks, child care and much more. The government further announced that Phase 3 would commence in June and would include reopening of schools, hotels, parks and movie theatres.

Meanwhile, on May 7, 2020, our Supreme Court directed that all criminal matters scheduled for any type of appearance up to and including May 29, 2020 were to be adjourned. One day after this, on May 8, 2020, the Provincial Court announced “Covid-2” or the second phase of yet further rolling adjournments for all criminal law matters scheduled for trial or continuation between May 19 to July 3, 2020. If any in custody trials in the month of May were believed to be urgent, accused, their counsel or Crown counsel were required to arrange for an “Urgency Application”. Otherwise, consent to the adjournment would be deemed to have been provided.

The incongruous and similarly timed announcements of our government’s Phase 2 Restart Plan and the announcement of “Covid-2” by our Provincial Court, as well as its unnamed equivalent from Supreme Court, raises further questions when assessing delay. Dr. Bonnie Henry, British Columbia’s provincial health officer, had declared that citizens of this province were able to safely resume numerous services and activities including those involving close physical contact. By May 15, 2020, health authorities were directing that gyms could reopen. Charter scrutiny will require us to ask how it was possible that British Columbians could receive a massage or a haircut but still not access their courts?

The delay analysis will not only involve scrutinizing inconsistencies but also assessing outcomes. If our courts reopen weeks or months from now with some physical distancing measures in place, a somewhat different courtroom layout with plexiglass and hand sanitizer added for good measure we will have to ask why it took so long for such basic measures to be taken when businesses of all sizes accomplished such changes within days. If they reopen without some of those basic measures in place even more questions will be raised as to delay. In fact, some observers have already noted that courtrooms, where counsel, court clerks, the judge and witnesses typically sit approximately 6 feet apart from one another are better situated than many businesses to respond to the pandemic. Assessing outcomes will involve working backwards to see whether resources were made available by government to our courts on a timely basis, whether proper expertise were engaged and when as well as myriad others questions to determine whether circumstances remained exceptional.

Charter challenges will not be limited to delay alone as the “Urgency Application” process implemented by our courts is also vulnerable. Under section 7 and 11(d) of the Charter, all Canadian citizens have a right to a fair trial. The “Urgency Application” process turns these Charter rights on their head by reversing the burden so an accused person, who is presumed innocent, has to make application to even have an opportunity to access this right. This includes individuals who are in custody awaiting trial and whose very freedom is at stake.

Perhaps even more problematic, the “Urgency Application” process turned out to be a straw man as virtually no such application was successful. This is because our shuttered court system actually did not have the ability to accommodate even so-called urgent trial proceedings. As a result, the potential for constitutional argument exists that the “Urgency Application” process was, in fact, a veneer of due process used to dress up the closure of our court system. A hearing process with no chance of success is not due process and strikes at the core of our constitutional values. Further, failure to bring an “Urgency Application” meant you were deemed to be giving away this right. This is problematic for every single litigant but especially so for self-represented accused whose trial rights were summarily stripped from them by the very courts sworn to uphold them.

Each day that passes while our courts remain closed or operating at greatly reduced capacity creates a devastating domino effect on all currently scheduled matters. Add to this a possible flood of delay applications as litigants argue their right to a timely and fair trial has been violated. One of the greatest court systems in the world is in its worst moment of crisis as numerous criminal matters dangle on the precipice of oblivion. Now is the time for bold action as well as increased innovation and transparency or we risk reaching the point of no return.

People have opinions. And you, reader, may be one of those people going: “whoa, whoa, whoa, what about …”

That’s a natural impulse. But when it comes to racism and protests, it’s awful easy to get sucked down a rabbit hole of other people’s misleading or misguided arguments.

Two circulate so frequently that they’re worth addressing.

First: George Floyd.

He wasn’t perfect. The degree of his imperfections are a matter of some disagreement, even if sensible people agree that he didn’t deserve to die for them.

The second part of that sentence is what’s key here. George Floyd’s death provided the ignition that began the current focus on racism in society. But whatever one wants to think about that life, it doesn’t affect the core facts underlying the current re-examination of society.

Simply: in many, many places, the colour of one’s skin affects one’s likelihood of dying at the hands of police; and one’s chances of professional and life success.

That’s what this is about, but those who aren’t subject to racism can tend to forget it under a deluge of news and information.

Imagine you have two identical 13-year-olds (or two six-year-olds or two 20-year-olds or two 30-year-olds) with the same family background, education, and everything else down the line. Countless studies show that if one is Black (or, in Canada, Indigenous), something bad is far more likely to happen to the one who is not white.

That all leads to things like the wife of a Black wine shop owner fearing her husband will be killed by police in his own store if he is present when officers go to check on a security alarm that went off.

It leads to things like First Nations men and women in Canada feeling unwelcome in, and being driven out of, key societal institutions by racism. It leads to them distrusting – often with good reason – our country’s institutions.

Many of us know someone with a sketchy past who turned their life around. But white people are more likely to be given the opportunity to do so than those who aren’t. This is what “systemic racism” is. It doesn’t mean everybody is racist. It means that our society is riddled with things, big and small, that collectively end up penalizing people for having a different skin tone.

Sometimes systemic racism results in someone dying who wouldn’t if they were white. Often it leaves a person without the same access to the opportunities afforded to white colleagues. Even if one were to put aside Floyd’s unjust end – and one cannot ignore it – we still need to deal with everything else faced by those who look different.

One other thing:

Some people take issue with the Black Lives Matter rallying cry. The standard is that “all lives matter.” It’s a response that is, to put it kindly, problematic. But it’s not always made with bad intentions. Often, it’s one borne of a lack of information, or a misreading of what the statement Black Lives Matter really means.

RELATED: Black Lives Matter posters ripped down and defaced in Abbotsford

“Black Lives Matter” doesn’t mean only Black lives matter. It doesn’t mean they matter more than the lives of other people. It just means they should matter. Period. You probably agree with this.

Demonstrators are stating, simply, all lives should matter, regardless of race, but that they don’t. That’s the core message of Black Lives Matter. It’s just Black Lives Also Matter doesn’t have quite the same potential as a rallying cry.

The premise of Black Lives Matter is that while society values white lives, it values those of Black people to a much lesser degree. All the data underscore this fact. In Canada, we also know this applies to Indigenous people.

Ottawa has repeatedly promised, but failed, to address severe water problems on First Nations reserves. Our federal government has been found by the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal to have continuously underfunded the on-reserve child welfare system.

And Ottawa has continuously fought against having to repay that money to Indigenous kids. The list goes on.

Demonstrators want all kids to have the same chance at success, all teens to be confident they aren’t being judged based on their skin colour, and all adults to not have to think about their race when they head for a job interview.

The core message of demonstrators is that all our lives should matter equally, and that our neighbours and friends shouldn’t face discrimination that we know exists. It shouldn’t be controversial.

As retailers across the BC work to welcome customers back safely, the experience will look a little different.

Individual small businesses and large shopping centres alike are working to ensure that when you’re ready to return, you’ll do so feeling confident in the safety and physical distancing measures in place.

At Abbotsford’s Sevenoaks Shopping Centre, “New Days New Ways” shares a variety of safety protocols and shopping guidelines designed to help guests feel safe in their shopping experience.

Here’s a look at what’s happening at Sevenoaks

Curbside Pick-Up: Sevenoaks, in partnership with participating retailers, is offering the option of curbside pick-up. Simply visit shopsevenoaks.com, select the retailer you’d like to shop with, and contact the individual store by phone or online to confirm operating hours, the availability of the desired merchandise, and the payment options to complete your purchase.

When your order is ready, the retailer will notify you of the date and time for pick up and designated location. Call the store to confirm your arrival, and an employee will deliver the contactless purchase to your vehicle.

Monitoring numbers: In addition to traffic counters tabulating how many people are in the mall, security are monitoring mall traffic and observing to ensure customers aren’t congregating in large groups.

Signage and guidance: Inside, signage, floor decals and door decals positioned throughout remind people to stay two metres apart and practice physical distancing.

Chilliwack born-and-raised trumpeter and vocalist, Bonnie Northgraves, will be performing at Bozzini’s Upstairs Lounge on Thursday, June 25. (Submitted)

After months of silence at Bozzini’s Upstairs Lounge, music is once again ringing out from the intimate Chilliwack concert space.

On June 4, Tsean Miller brought the Church of Rock to the stage. It was the first concert in almost three months to take place there after venues around Chilliwack and the world shut down due to COVID-19.

Now artistic director Emmanuel Asprakis is bringing in the next artist – Chilliwack born-and-raised trumpeter and vocalist Bonnie Northgraves on June 25.

With the Vancouver Jazz Festival being cancelled this year Asprakis took that as the inspiration for a jazz show being one the first events happening at Bozzini’s now that COVID-19 restrictions have eased.

“I was supposed to be playing at the Jazz Fest this year and singing the anthem on Canada Day, so it’s really lovely to have been invited to Bozzini’s to play,” said Northgraves, who now lives in Vancouver. “[I’m] so looking forward to performing in my home town.”

Northgraves performs her own original music as well as being a key member in Company B Jazz Band, Jeff Gladstone and the Bad Ideas, T Lizzy, and many others. She is a performer, recording artist, teacher, and clinician. She is passionate about music and hopes to spread her love of jazz through performance and education.

Her singing is smokey and rich, and her trumpet playing is a call to the early jazz styles of New Orleans. In 2019 Bonnie Released her debut album Between Then And Now.

Bozzini’s Upstairs Lounge typically seats 32 people, but due to physical distancing measures, only 16 seats will be available.

Bonnie Northgraves performs Thursday, June 25 at 8 p.m. (doors at 6:30 p.m.) at Bozzini’s Upstairs Lounge. Tickets are $20. To reserve call 604-792-0744.

The music video for Isaiah Faber’s (Powfu) “death bed (coffee for your head)” was filmed mostly at Abbotsford Mill Lake Park. The song has over 440 million views on Spotify and the video has over 90 million views on Youtube. Screenshot from Youtube music video.

A two-month-old song from a Mission artist has become the biggest music hit to come out of the Fraser Valley in recent history.

Isaiah Faber, known as Powfu, released “death bed (coffee for your head) ft. beabadoobee” in April 2020, and the song been heard by over 440 million people on Spotify.

The music video, much of it filmed at Abbotsford’s Mill Lake Park, has reached over 90 million views on Youtube. Faber’s other music videos are also filmed at various Abbotsford locations.

In order to become the Fraser Valley’s biggest hit of all time, it would have to surpass the Carly Rae Jepsen’s smash 2013 hit “Call Me Maybe,” which has over 1.2 billion views on Youtube.

It seems music runs in the family as Faber’s father, David, is the lead singer of the Canadian punk band Faber Drive. Faber Drive, also hailing from Mission, was nominated for a Juno Award in 2008.

Surrey’s White Hart Public House is among the first bars in Metro Vancouver to feature live entertainment in the post-COVID world.

The Newton-area pub welcomed back live bands a couple of weeks ago, starting with “house band” The Wingnuts on June 5.

“I think we’re one of the first bars to have live music again, definitely, because we wanted to get ahead of that curve,” said pub operator George Hart. “We knew we could do it safely, so we figured why not, let’s get it going again.”

For now, measures to stop the virus from spreading include clear plastic sheets hung between tables and encouraging physical distancing, among other rules.

“The hardest part is reminding people that they can’t dance, which isn’t easy,” Hart said with a laugh.

At a news conference Monday (June 15), provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry was asked about dancing in nightclubs and bars.

“It is going to be challenging because we know there are some things like dance floors that are not going to happen right now, as well as we know that singing, singing in a group, can be a very dangerous thing for this virus,” Henry said.

“We’ve seen that in a number of places around the world, including recent examples in the States south of us where singing groups in churches, even with physical distancing, have led to transmission of cases, and singing in other situations as well. So those are all things we need to work through, and I know Worksafe is working with the industry to come up with some reasonable guidance for that.”

Restaurants and pubs across the province were allowed to reopen to dine-in guests more than three weeks ago, as part of Phase Two in B.C.’s Restart Plan. Last Thursday (June 11), Henry removed the 50 per cent capacity restriction, allowing restaurant and pub operators to determine their capacity so long as guests are able to physically distance by at least two metres.

On Friday night (June 12) at the White Hart, the band Spank The Plank played a mix of classic rock songs for a few dozen people who paid $10 admission online, through Eric McCauley’s Good Time Bookings page on eventbrite.ca.

“It’s a family-run business, and we want to make sure everyone is safe and follow the proper restrictions put in place by Worksafe,” said McCauley, who books bands at the White Hart.

“We’re sold out tonight, pretty much, and we’re keeping it to around 42 people,” Hart added. “We’re doing advance ticket sales, and one of the shows sold out in an hour, the Tragically Hip tribute, Roadside Attraction (on June 27). Other bands have sold out in a couple of days, and some are selling out at the door. People can line up, six feet apart obviously, and if we have room then they can come in.”

• RELATED STORY: B.C.’s new COVID-19 cases remain low, no deaths since Friday.

Other bands on the calendar this month include Robert Graves Band (June 19), March Hare (June 20), The Rattlers (June 24) and Rob Montgomery/Nadine States (June 30), plus karaoke Tuesdays.

Hart and his family took over operations of the former Hook and Ladder pub site last year.

“We changed the name to White Hart after our soccer team’s stadium, which is White Hart Lane,” said Hart. “It’s an ode to Tottenham (the soccer club in London). My family is from there, I have the tatttoo, we’re diehard fans. In September of 2019 we came up here from Bear Creek (Pub), just a better location, bigger. We renovated it, painted it with Tottenham colours, everything, got the sign up and yeah, we’re ready.”

Spank the Plank drummer Wes Lawrie said it’s fun for the band to again perform “for people who appreciate it.”

Prior to Friday night at the White Hart, his last gig was set for March 16 at a venue in Whistler.

“We were just ready to leave my place, everything loaded, and we got the call to not bother, it was closed, everything was shut down,” Lawrie recalled.

“As a musician this has been very tough, and just very different,” he added. “But it looks like we’re getting going again, and we’re hearing about other gigs happening at some places, so I’m sure we’ll be playing again soon. This is definitely something I haven’t experienced before.”

Pawan Deol and Michael P. Vidler, who created the short film Unkept, won best short and best director at the 2019 Chilliwack Independent Film Festival (CIFF). The founder of CIFF, Taras Groves, is waiving entry fees for all Black, Asian and minority ethnic filmmakers for his festival. (Submitted)

The founder and director of an independent film festival has made it easier for Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) filmmakers to submit their work and have their voices heard.

Taras Groves of the Chilliwack Independent Film Festival (CIFF) announced this week that he is waiving submission costs for all BAME filmmakers.

CIFF is the first film festival in B.C. to do this, he added.

“Whilst we have been able to showcase numerous minority and Indigenous filmmakers over the years… we feel compelled to do more, especially given what is currently going on in the world today with Black lives and systemic racism,” Groves said.

“This is no different in the arts. And actions are louder than words.”

Submissions costs can quickly stack up for independent filmmakers making it very difficult for them to break through.

This is a “conscious attempt to form an enduring effort to provide a platform for more voices to be heard,” Groves said. He is encouraging other organizations and festivals to follow suit.

Film and the arts may seem small with everything that is going on in the world today but Groves said he still believes it’s an important means for sharing new voices and changing perspectives.

The festival, which began in 2017, normally takes place in November each year. A date for the 2020 CIFF has not yet been set, but it will be going ahead.

Faye Paris’s newly released book OX Daddy ox: Memories from the Heart shares the joys, sorrows, and tribulations of growing up from a child’s point of view.

“I was inspired to write a book honouring my dad and all dads for being there for their children. Even dads in the animal kingdom are amazing… gorilla dads groom, cuddle comfort and discipline their offspring – a lot like my dad.”

She calls it a children’s book for adults, and it is classified under memoirs and parenting.

The effect of this father-daughter relationship is unquestionably powerful and compelling, reads the description. An imperfect man tries to teach his daughter to be better than he is as a person. This is an outcome he expects his daughter to accomplish; this is an outcome his daughter feels she can never achieve. Over the years she views this man with imperfections differently. Still, she loves and respects him while driven by the impact of his values on her life.

Faye Paris’s newly released book ‘OX Daddy ox: Memories from the Heart.’ (Submitted)

Paris describes her favourite memory from the chapter called ‘A Sticky Situation.’

“It is about my dad trying to teach me how to paint my bedroom closet as a young child. While trying to paint a closet wall, I dripped paint on the newspaper protecting the floor. When I walked on the drips the newspaper stuck to my shoes. I lifted one foot then the other foot, but the newspaper would not come off. I was stuck and frustrated. My dad lifted me off the ground, pulled the newspaper off my shoes, and consoled me,” Paris said.

“In that moment, he was my hero. It is astounding how a small gesture can turn a dad into a superhero from a child’s perspective.”

One of the messages she wanted to send to dads and all parents is that children see the world differently depending on their developmental stage. Sometimes as parents we forget that children are not just little adults, she said.

Paris is a registered clinical counsellor who enjoys not only counselling but teaching, speaking, and providing trainings about the arts and mental health issues.

When she finished writing the book, she realized it was her own form of therapy.

“By the time I described the last memory of my dad in this book, I realized writing this book was a way for me to deal with my own grief at losing my dad.”

At only 50 pages long, it’s a fairly quick read with lots of illustrations, all of which represent children’s attempts at drawing as they grow-up.

Illustrations are by Shen-Mei Li and photos are by Larry Paris.

She is now in the process of writing a book about her mother, a relationship she calls “more complicated, but interesting.” She also has plans to write a book about maintaining one’s own mental health.

You can buy OX Daddy ox: Memories from the Heart on Amazon.ca for $24.99 (paperback), $31.99 (hardcover), or $4.99 (ebook).

Brian John Harwood of Kansas Stone and Dustin Bird have gathered their friends in the music industry to deliver a new single, “Together We’re Strong.”

The video for the track is in memory of Capt. Jennifer Casey and features clips from the Royal Canadian Air Forces’ Snowbirds and of Capt. Jennifer Casey herself, who was excited about spreading inspiration across Canada through her work on this project.

“We were devastated to learn of the tragic loss of Capt. Casey,’ Bird said. “As Canadians, we wanted to use the power of music to encourage and bring people together in a time of adversity.”

Proceeds from the track will be donated to the Unison Benevolent Fund, a Canadian music industry charity whose mission is to help professional music-makers in times of hardship, illness or economic difficulties.

The duo co-wrote the track, which features 18 Canadian country artists, including former Langley resident Aaron Pritchett, Cory Marks, Jason McCoy, Alee, and Jason Blaine – among many others including both Harwood and Bird.

“Staying positive together is the one thing that we have the power of doing. Unity is strength,” added Harwood.

As the live music and touring industry has come screeching to a halt, many artists are struggling to find ways to keep the music playing during the time of COVID-19.

Harwood and Bird said the project works to uplift everyone including other artists, fans and the worldwide country community, while raising funds for those struggling within the music industry.

Amanda Power, Unison’s executive director, added that now more than ever, members of our music community are depending on Unison’s COVID-19 Relief Program.

“Thanks to the generous efforts of the artists involved, every dollar raised from ‘Together We’re Strong’ will allow us to provide direct relief for music-makers and music professionals during this difficult time,” Power explained.

To donate, people can text UNISON to 45678 or visit unisonfund.ca, where donations will be matched by Spotify.

Since its release there have been almost 60,000 streams on Spotify and over 20,000 video views.

A Chilliwack artist’s property was aglow with lighted sculptures Saturday night as she held a public art exhibition outside her own home.

Not knowing when the next time her work would be installed inside a gallery, Sylvie Roussel-Janssens decided to create her own gallery. She opened her home and yard to friends and the public for a one-night show on June 6.

“I feel like sometimes you really have to take things in your own hands. Cultural institutions are very prudent. They may not be the ones who will think outside the (white) box first,” Roussel-Janssens said. “If and when they do, they will have been nudged by the daring ones: the artists.”

During the COVID-19 pandemic, she has been busy by working on new projects which were on display that night.

Large house-shaped structures of red, blue and yellow stood at the foot of her driveway as smaller pieces lit up the deck and the walls of the garage.

For a long time she has dreamt of travelling with her art, but due to the fact that her work is in three-dimensional sculpture form, it needs to be easily transportable.

Showing, moving, storing and selling sculpture is difficult, she admits.

Roussel-Janssens is constantly figuring out new designs so she can make her sculptures foldable, collapsable or stackable.

“Nothing makes me sadder than looking at boxes containing artworks that do not get a chance to live. For me, it is not enough to make a piece. I want it to have a life after the studio, to go in the world.”

A successful fundraiser benefitting widows and orphans of Kenya brought in more than $10,000 on the weekend.

The giant garage sale fundraiser hosted by Voice of Hope saw a steady stream of folks as they browsed through the thousands of items for sale set up in a Chilliwack barn on Saturday, June 27.

To help with physical distancing protocols, people could only go one way through the garage sale which was filled with kitchen items, linens, books and more.

A total of $10,100 was raise that day for widows and orphans of Kenya. More money is expected to come in from a handful of larger-valued items, like a hospital bed, that they are selling on social media.

Voice of Hope is run by a group of Chilliwack women. They have been working to improve the quality of life for Kenya’s impoverished widows and orphans since 2013. Normally, they would be planning a trip to visit Kakamega, Kenya, in October but with the restrictions due to COVID-19, they have put their trip off until the fall of 2021.

The women have been collecting donated items for the giant garage sale since January.

Saturday’s fundraiser was so successful, they will be having another giant garage sale on Saturday, July 18 from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. at 7350 Barrow Rd. There will also be hot dogs for sale.

Anyone who missed the June 27 garage sale fundraiser and would like to help with the cause can donate bottles and cans to the ongoing Voice of Hope bottle drive. Bottle and cans can be dropped off any time at 7350 Barrow Rd. Look for the “Bottles and cans drop off” sign on the south side of the grey building with red doors.

Additionally, if you would like to donate to the next garage sale fundraiser, you can drop off items at the above address on July 15 and July 16 from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.

Word has reached The Sleuth that Toyota will introduce a competitor to the Volkswagen Golf GTI, Hyundai Veloster N and Subaru WRX. The Corolla GR (the initials stand for Gazoo Racing, which is the automaker’s home-grown performance division) is expected to arrive in 2022. The turbocharged 1.6-liter three-cylinder engine and probable six-speed manual transmission come from the rally-inspired subcompact GR Yaris (not for North America), rated at 257 horsepower and 266 pound-feet of torque. The numbers are likely to carry over to the Corolla GR. Also, the Yaris GR’s all-wheel-drive system isn’t expected to transition into the Corolla. A starting price in the low-$30,000 range is expected.

Blackwing, fly:

With apologies to the Beatles tune, Blackbird, The Sleuth notes that General Motors’ Cadillac division will use the Blackwing designation for the brand’s top-performing “V” sedans that are due to arrive in late 2020, namely the upcoming CT4-V Blackwing and CT5-V Blackwing. The CT4 version gets a turbo V-6 with an output of about 400 horsepower, while the CT5’s supercharged V-8 could reach 640 horses. There’s no word regarding Blackwing models for any of Cadillac’s utility vehicles, but given that the brand’s key luxury competitors offer higher-output variants of similar vehicles, it’s possible that Blackwing versions for the full range of XT wagons as well as the big Escalade might already be in the planning stages.

Is BMW adding to its X lineup?

That’s what The Sleuth hears is in the works, to be labeled the X8. That makes eight such utility/tall-wagon models, beginning with the X1. The X8 is being designed as a “coupe,” which is essentially a four-door tall-bodied hatchback similar in silhouette to the X4 and X6 models. It’s expected that the new flagship X8 will offer the same turbocharged inline-six-cylinder and V-8 engines as the 8 Series coupe, with output ranging from 335 to 617 horsepower, the latter assigned to a sporty X8 M, which is also expected. A plug-in hybrid model is also likely. At this point, information is sketchy concerning an expected arrival date, but sometime in 2022 seems probable. As for pricing, count on well north of $100,000 in Canada

Mazda’s plans for the Mazda6 revealed:

The Sleuth is hearing that the automaker’s midsize sedan will receive nothing short of a complete makeover for the 2023 model year. The highly touted (by most automotive writers, at least) four-door has been a sluggish seller in a world that’s still in love with utility vehicles. The next Mazda6 will employ a new rear-wheel-drive architecture, replacing the current front-wheel-drive platform. All-wheel-drive will also be available. The new 6’s styling will be inspired by the 2017 Mazda Vision Coupe concept. For thrust, expect an inline six-cylinder gasoline engine and a 48-volt electric-assist motor/generator capable of delivering extra torque when needed. There are rumours of 350 maximum horsepower with this layout, which would likely make the Mazda6 a stellar performer.

Lexus plans a new flagship luxury utility vehicle:

The Sleuth hears there’s a good chance that the sleek LF-1 Limitless concept vehicle that went on display in 2018 will emerge in production form for the 2022 model year wearing the LQ designation. It’s also expected to use the same turbocharged powerplants as the big LS and LS hybrid sedans that make 416 and 354 horsepower, respectively. The arrival of the five-passenger LQ might also mean the retirement of the truck-like eight-passenger LX utility vehicle, although that’s far from certain at this point.

Ups and downs

Up: Music for electric BMWs:

According to a story in the New York Times, film-score composer Hans Zimmer is creating a melodic sound for the BMW’s upcoming i4 electric sedan, which launches for the 2021 model year. By then, European and U.S. regulators will require all electric vehicles (normally silent) to emit noises/sounds to alert pedestrians to their presence. Zimmer has produced music for The Da Vinci Code, Inception, Top Gun (1986), Interstellar, Pirates of the Caribbean and others.

Why just have any sound for the electric BMW i4 when it’s stopped when Hans Zimmer can compose something special. Photo: BMW.

Up: Hybrid Mustang delayed:

Ford is reporting a gasoline-electric power system for the Mustang won’t happen until the start of the 2023 model year, when a next-generation model will roll out. Originally, the option was set to launch later this year for 2021. The Mustang hybrid is said to combine the current 5.0-litre gasoline V-8 with an electric motor at each front wheel.

The base engine makes 246 horsepower. Photo: Jaguar.

Virtually all automakers have figured out that the key to current and future business success is in utility vehicles of varying sizes and descriptions.

That lesson hasn’t been lost on Jaguar, which launched the E-Pace for the 2018 model year. It serves as a junior partner to the mid-size F-Pace wagon that arrived for 2017.

If you’re interested in new or used Jaguars, be sure to visit TodaysDrive.com to find your dream car today!

The E-Pace name sounds like it might refer to an electric vehicle, but it uses good-old-fashioned gasoline propulsion. Jaguar’s I-Pace tall hatchback wagon is Jaguar’s sole electric, at least until the 2021 XJ sedan arrives. The E-Pace rests on a front-wheel-drive platform derived from the Land Rover Evoque (Jaguar and Land Rover are owned by the same company). Like the F-Pace, however, the E-Pace has standard all-wheel-drive.

The F-Pace and E-Pace are unmistakable as kin, right down to their similar-looking front-end shapes that are clearly influenced by other Jaguar fleet members. The common thread also extends to the opposite end, where the fashionably sloping liftgate looks attractive enough, but results in reduced cargo space when compared to other more squared-off designs.

The cabin appears equally inviting, especially the cockpit-style driver’s pod that could have been lifted straight out of the F-Type sports car. The touch screen is nice and big and the large, round ventilation controls will no doubt assist the fumble-fingered.

The E-Pace is more than 30 centimetres shorter and nearly nine centimetres narrower than the F-Pace, and is more than 20 centimetres shorter between the front and rear wheels. But the real surprise is that the E-pace actually outweighs the bigger Jag by 34 kilograms, which goes to show that compactness doesn’t necessarily result in a corresponding reduction in heft.

Fortunately, the E-Pace is up to the task of quickly and efficiently hauling passengers and cargo, using a turbocharged 2.0-litre four-cylinder engine that’s rated at a respectable 246 horsepower and 269 pound-feet of torque. It’s standard in the P250 models.

For significantly more oomph, the E-Pace P300 R-Dynamic trims come with a turbo 2.0 that puts 296 horsepower and 295 pound-feet of torque.

A nine-speed automatic is the sole transmission choice.

The all-wheel-drive hardware depends on the engine, starting with a permanently engaged setup for the P250 models. The P300 R-Dynamic’s “Active Driveline” powers only the front wheels in normal driving conditions. When traction loss is detected, the system can direct nearly all of the available torque to the rear wheels and to a specific rear wheel, if necessary.

Active Driveline’s standard torque-vectoring system “uses the brakes to (balance) the distribution of engine torque between all four wheels during cornering.” According to the company, this reduces the vehicle’s natural tendency to travel in a straight line even when the steering wheel is turned (called understeer).

Common to all E-Pace models is a low-speed cruise-control system that regulates the vehicle’s speed between two km/h and 30 km/h. Interestingly, active-safety technology such as blind-spot warning and adaptive cruise control are not standard, although lane-keeping assist is.

E-Pace pricing starts at $51,700, including destination charges. For that pile of cash, you get a reasonable level of standard content, but to move closer to the luxury zone you’ll need to select the R-Dynamic or Checkered Flag versions for leather seat coverings, panoramic roof, navigation, head-up info display and 19-inch wheels (18s are standard).

The performance-laden P300 R-Dynamic adds about $5,700 to the base price, but you also get larger brakes, 20-inch wheels plus a bit more comfort content.

Whatever the choice, the E-pace is an enticing little cat, with the looks, luxury and power that fits with the Jaguar name and reputation. And it’s a utility vehicle.

What you should know: 2020 Jaguar E-Pace

Type: Four-door, all-wheel-drive compact utility vehicle

Engine (h.p.): 2.0-litre DOHC I-4, turbocharged (246/296)

Transmission: Nine-speed automatic

Market position: The E-Pace is one of a growing legion of smaller premium utility vehicles. many of which resemble their larger stable mates. In some cases, these models have replaced traditional sedans in their respective lineups.

Points: Nicely balanced design presses all the right “want-it-now” buttons.

• Both base and higher-output versions of the turbo-2.0 engine should prove more than acceptable in the power department. • Jaguar’s aversion to offering manual transmissions is typical of most luxury brands these days. • Surprisingly heavy when compared with similarly sized wagons.

Active safety: Blind-spot warning with cross-traffic alert (opt.); active cruise control (opt.); emergency braking (std.); lane-keeping assist (std.)

1007,1007,1474,theprogress,https://www.theprogress.com/opinion/opinion-why-the-fuss-about-wearing-a-mask/,Opinion: Why the fuss about wearing a mask? – Chilliwack Progress,'Eric Welsh',2020-06-30,"Do the non-medical reasons for not wearing masks in a pandemic outweigh potential benefits?

When I was just a little kid, I liked wearing masks.

It was the 1980s, at the height of the ninja craze. I’d watch Enter the Ninja with my friends, then I’d grab my sword (stick) and throwing stars (made out of paper) and spend the rest of the day skulking in shadows and assassinating other ninjas (trees).

Those were good times, but eventually I had to leave the mask wearing behind. It’s cute when you’re eight years old. It’s disturbing when you’re 18.

But the COVID-19 pandemic has given me an opportunity to be an adult and wear a mask without having to plot a bank/liquor store robbery.

Just last week I donned my cloth face mask and followed my wife into a local grocery store. While she shopped, I darted from place to place, stalking her through the aisles. I hid behind the Doritos. No, wait! I ducked behind a stack of Diet Coke. She never saw me until it was too late and the bucket of ice cream was already in the buggy.

Stealthily!

So much fun, and I wonder why more people aren’t taking advantage of this once-in-a-lifetime chance.

READ MORE: Fraser East health region has become B.C.’s COVID-19 hotspot

READ MORE: Some movie theatres set to reopen this week following lengthy COVID-19 shutdown

Grabbing takeout from a burger and fries place last weekend I did a quick count of masks. There were 27 people in the joint and my wife and I were the only ones covering our faces. We wear masks because she has Multiple Sclerosis, which puts her in the ‘could die if you get COVID’ category. We try to reduce our potential exposure as much as possible while still living life, but we are very much in the minority everywhere we go.

Why is that? Individually, we’re all being asked to do just two things during the pandemic.

Wear a mask and don’t get all up in anybody else’s space.

Both should be easy enough. I get that some people may not be able to wear a mask for medical reasons related to breathing, but for the rest of us is there really a good reason not to?

Maybe it’s a comfort thing, and I can understand that because one does get heated wearing a mask. But it shouldn’t be a deal breaker to wear one for a half hour in a store if it’ll help keep those COVID numbers down so stores can stay open, should it?

Maybe it’s a vanity thing? While many people may be reluctant to cover up their faces, people cheer wildly when I conceal my ugly mug, so this isn’t something I can relate to. But is looking good a good enough reason to risk prolonging a pandemic? And if it’s more about being embarrassed or ‘looking silly,’ think about how much easier it would be if everyone wore a mask.

I tell my children, ‘Don’t care about what other people think of you,’ and I’ll walk the walk on that.

Maybe people think I look goofy in my space mask, with all its stars and planets and stuff, but I don’t care.

It doesn’t hurt me in any way and even if it doesn’t make a difference in the spread of COVID-19, it might make one of my fellow humans feel a little safer standing close to me in public.

So I’m an unapologetic space ninja doing my thing.

If it’s a ‘nobody’s going to tell me what to do and you people are all sheep’ type of thing, I don’t know what to say.

If you hate the government, okay. If you distrust science, whatever. But even if wearing a mask is in fact completely useless, it shows that you are a compassionate person who cares about the people around you, and you are willing to do your part to help protect them.

And if you can have a little fun with it in the process, what’s the harm?

The Easter service was closed to the congregation and to the public to attend in person at they church but was live streamed to the internet. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jonathan Hayward

By Levi Minderhoud

Imagine that, over the past couple of months, you have devoured most of the food in your kitchen. You, your spouse, and your children are growing hungry. You drive to the local grocery store. But when you walk up to the entrance, an attendant says, “sorry, COVID-19 restrictions require us to only allow 50 people into our store at a time. We are already at our legal 50-person capacity. Please sign your name to the bottom of this waiting list and we’ll call you next week when it is your turn to enter the grocery store.”

You return home hungry.

Of course, we all recognize this scenario as absurd – some things cannot wait for another day. While following rules and taking precautions are necessary during a pandemic, essential services must continue for the good of society.

This denial of basic necessities is not so different from what is happening to people of faith throughout British Columbia. Although grocery stores, hospitals, and many other sectors of the economy deemed “essential” are not subject to a cap of 50 persons on their premises, this restriction continues to apply to worship services. But worship services are an essential service to hundreds of thousands of Christians, Jews, Sikhs, Muslims, and other faith groups across the province.

In the Bible, Jesus says that, “Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.” Christians require more than food, medical treatment, or employment income to thrive. Christians thrive by hearing the Word of God and by gathering together with fellow believers.

• READ MORE: B.C. faith leaders, Horgan discuss need for virtual religious ceremonies

• READ MORE: COVID-19: B.C. church services resume with public health limits

The Apostle Paul also describes how members of the church are like parts of the body. The human body cannot thrive if major parts of it are missing. Similarly, a church cannot thrive if a majority of its members are missing. Weekly, in-person worship services are a vital opportunity to hear this life-giving Word of God and participate in the sacraments.

The case for the essential nature of worship services was recently made in an open letter sent to Premier Horgan, Health Minister Dix, and Provincial Health Officer Henry. This request to Expand BC Worship Services was signed by 143 churches in British Columbia in early June. That letter, to date, remains unanswered.

Some people, perhaps including our leaders in British Columbia, may doubt that corporate worship services are essential, but this mentality betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of the Christian religion. Just as medical treatment is to the injured, food is to the hungry, and work is to the unemployment, so the participation in collective worship services – hearing the preaching of God’s word, receiving the promise of baptism, participating in holy communion, praising God collectively in song and prayer, and fellowshipping with other believers – is to the spiritually deprived Christian.

Although Christians can derive some benefit from online worship services or in small groups, such worship services are akin to feeding someone a bread-only diet for months. It will sustain a person for a while, but it will eventually result in serious health complications. Similarly, Christians are starving for the nourishment that comes from full worship services.

I recognize that, given the reality of COVID-19, mass gatherings remain limited in general. But worship services are not just typical gatherings. Nor are they hobbies akin to yoga. Although worship services are considered similar to concerts, sporting events, and festivals in the explicit order against mass gatherings, worship services are categorically different than these activities in that they are – or are supposed to be –constitutionally protected, and doubly so.

The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees the freedom of peaceful assembly and freedom of religion, both of which are seriously infringed upon by the limit of 50 people for worship services. According to these freedoms, British Columbians have a double constitutional right to attend religious worship services. They do not have a similar constitutional right to camp overnight, attend a movie theatre, dine at a restaurant, or stay in a hotel. Yet, Phase 3 of British Columbia’s Opening Plan removes restrictions on these activities, while maintaining the cap of 50 people at a worship service, even when some churches can seat thousands.

In light of the essential and Charter-protected nature of worship services, the leaders of British Columbia’s pandemic response should immediately change the Order of the Provincial Health Officer on Mass Gatherings to specifically allow for larger worship services. Raising the limit of people to 100 or allowing a certain percentage (e.g. 50%) of a church’s capacity to gather for worship would be a good first step, and in line with what other provinces are successfully doing.

As much of society re-opens around us, the provincial government must trust churches to operate safely and cautiously. It’s time for people of faith to declare that our spiritual food, distributed in weekly worship services, must not be rationed. It’s time for the provincial government to respect the freedom of the hundreds of thousands of people of faith in our province. It’s time to expand worship services in British Columbia.

As I plan the July memorial service for my father, I am continually frustrated by a set of illogical and constantly changing rules. I can’t have more than five, or is it 10, or is it 50 people present? And, they have to be able to stand at least six feet apart. I should probably sanitize everything in sight.

As the guest(s) arrive, I need signage that leads to the hand-sanitizing stations. We will not sit. And once the ceremony is done, everyone must leave the area. No consoling hugs and keep those tears inside the non-medical masks.

• READ MORE: Chilliwack Progress Letters

If we were only a professional sports team, or if we could call this event some kind of protest or like some, we could just ignore all those rules. And, by the way, none of the recent outbreaks have been linked to any of the unsanctioned rallies we all watched on the news. If only life was normal.

If we went about our normal, free-citizen business, we would be like Justin Trudeau and all those other “do as I say and not as I do” people. And my family would say goodbye to my dad in a private, dignified, and loving way that causes no harm to anyone.

I didn’t have any choice to be born white or brown and neither did you.

United States President Donald Trump didn’t choose not to be born Black or anything else. The people of our countries are diverse in colour.

People who are rioting are not addressing the underlying problem, and governments on most levels have not addressed or dealt with it correctly.

People are hurting and dying because they want to be heard and start change in society. This is no excuse for violence. Burning cities, looting someone’s livelihood and destroying the economy for any reason does not “right the problem.” It is hoped peaceful protests will.

I didn’t choose this country as “my home and native land” but I’m so thankful I was born a Canadian – a second generation person growing up in Chilliwack. I have not had to live under oppression like some of our neighbours have experienced. It must be difficult, but rioting is not the answer.

Stay safe and be kind.

I (as many people do) wholeheartedly support movements towards these much-needed changes. From my lens, it seems as though the world is taking notice of other voices that have been aching to be heard for so long, through the forms of documentaries, books, and listening to people’s diverse experiences. My hope is that this leads to greater understanding, as this is an essential step towards building a future that is more equitable for all.

However, it seems that so many people believe that to be for one thing you have to be against another, and that is just not how things need to work all of the time.

In my household, we’ve been feeling a lot of digital daggers of hatred from the general public lately.

Let me explain.

My husband is a police officer. I’m sure that you have noticed an awful lot of negative social media and news attention around police. It is way easier to find negative stories about police officers than positive ones. This generally seems to be the case, but it is especially true right now.

• READ MORE: B.C. to review Police Act amid growing calls to defund police

• READ MORE: When protesters cry ‘defund the police,’ what does it mean?

Police agencies hire their members from the same human population as every other organization, so of course not all police officers are going to be wonderful human beings. Some of the actions of police officers shown in the media are disgraceful, to say the least. Obviously, former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin falls into that category.

Police officers who conduct themselves in this way by no means make up the majority of the police officers in the world.

On the contrary, they make up a tiny fraction of the general policing population. Negative policing stories are simply reported on with much higher frequency than accounts of police assisting people out of a dangerous situation, lending a helping hand to someone in need, or showing compassion.

Let me put it to you this way. Out of all the articles you’ve ever read about elementary school teachers, how many of those articles were about child abusers or sex predators? How many of those articles focused on teachers who went above and beyond to help prepare their students for an upcoming exam? You’ve probably read more articles about teachers who turned out to be predators than teachers who gave their all to help a student succeed. Does that mean that most teachers are sex offenders? Absolutely not. That is my point. What generally gets reported on are the tantalizing stories, not the mundane everyday stories that are not newsworthy. The exact same principal applies to the depiction of police in the news and on social media.

I wish people could understand what the day-to-day of policing is really like. On a daily basis, police officers respond to calls from the public where they are asked to bring justice and peace to pretty awful situations.

While doing this, they are shouted at, spat on, and worse. My husband has personally been called to deal with some incredibly reprehensible situations this year and has helped to arrest people who have committed some of the most horrific crimes imaginable. Because of this, he has been in some extremely dangerous situations. He loses peace over it, he loses sleep over it, he has nightmares, and then he repeatedly experiences hatred towards him because he wears the police badge. Nonetheless, he gets up in the morning, puts his uniform on, and goes back out to do his job to help make our communities safer. This can be very hard to watch as a spouse.

My husband is a genuinely kind and compassionate person. He has taught me more about understanding and empathy towards people from all walks of life than anyone else I’ve ever met. But to be honest, I know dozens of police officers who, just like my husband, also have a heart of gold and the actions to back up their intentions. It breaks my heart to see all of the police officers being painted with the same ugly brush based on the conduct of a select few whose actions have become highly publicized.

I suppose this letter to the editor is just a public service announcement from a police wife, who is hurting alongside the rest of the world. It is honourable to be working for positive changes for the world, and I truly hope that you are.

Please remember that while doing so, you don’t need to be against the kind-hearted and dedicated police officers who are working towards the same positive end goals that you are working towards.

Our elders built this country and we reap the benefits of their hard work.

Yet not only are elders often overlooked, they face troubling levels of abuse from physical to financial to emotional.

And now, amid a global pandemic, seniors are bearing the brunt of the illness, made worse by further abuse. Outbreaks at retirement homes have been particularly devastating, and the consequences of public health advice to stay home and employ physical distancing mean many seniors are left more alone than ever.

Even worse, B.C.’s seniors advocate Isobel Mackenzie says the pandemic forcing many to remain isolated is increasing their likelihood of experience elder abuse.

• READ MORE: All your local, regional and national COVID-19 coverage in one place

“Recognizing the signs of elder abuse and knowing who to report it to is key.”

The provincial government recently announced $1.89 million in grants, $550,000 of which is going to Seniors First BC to try to help with the problem of elder abuse.

“We are using this funding to educate and protect seniors from malicious COVID-19 related frauds and scams that try to trick seniors into giving out their personal information online or over the phone,” executive director Rick Gambrel said. “We also run a seniors abuse and information line… a victim services program and referrals to an in-house lawyer.”

Elder abuse, including neglect, is defined as a single or repeated act, or a lack of appropriate action, that causes harm or distress to an older person.

It can take place in a senior’s home, a care facility or in the community, and often involves a person in a position of trust or a situation of dependency. The abuse can be physical, emotional, verbal, financial, sexual, spiritual or neglectful.

According to statistics from Seniors First BC, approximately eight per cent of seniors in B.C. experience some form of abuse, but this number may be even higher due to under-reporting. Pay attention to the elderly people in your lives and do your best to ensure elder abuse is not impacting them.

It’s the least we can do.

But throughout all of this is something even more insidious, I suggest, namely, an epistemological crisis in our world.

Epistemology is the area of philosophy that deals with the origin and the source and the nature of knowledge. What does it mean to “know” something? Where do you get your knowledge from? How do you know this or that?

These are questions that some of us are asking one another more and more every day as misinformation and, more insidious, disinformation, permeates the public discourse.

Have you ever noticed how the smartest people you know, either in person or through public networks such as the media, often express uncertainty, doubt, and even change their minds?

And have you ever noticed how the most ignorant people you know are steadfast and seem to know everything?

• RELATED: COLUMN: Fighting an ‘infodemic’ amid a pandemic

• RELATED: COLUMN: The call for full-scale economic reopening is an argument to cull the herd

The epistemological Catch-22 we find ourselves in is that the more chaotic our world becomes with pandemic fears, racial tension on the rise, and economic uncertainty underlying it all, the more people seek answers. But those answers are hard to find, and bad answers are worse than more questions.

Remember that episode of Seinfeld where the topic of abortion came up? The gag from the 1990s sit-com was that while the main characters constantly had different people they were dating, they were all quite superficial about the relationships so there was never anything serious discussed. But on the obviously controversial topic of abortion, and with Elaine dating a perfectly handsome man, Jerry asked her what her new beau’s thoughts might be on the subject? “I’m sure he’s pro-choice,” she awkwardly stuttered, soon to be proven wrong.

What does this have to do with anything these days? Well so many of us have social media relationships, in my case a pretty large network of local people on my Facebook account with whom I share Progress news stories, sometimes anecdotes about what I see around town, and many people interact with me. And while there are a great many controversial day-to-day subjects that come across my desk or my social media feed, the unintentional misinformation and blatant disinformation regarding this COVID-19 pandemic of late has been staggering, to the point where I have had to start “unfriending” people who share nonsensical memes and outright lies.

But I can’t keep up.

I’m used to kooks and conspiracy theorists and far right or far left trolls sending me messages or commenting persistently on matters they know nothing about.

But sometimes lately, with some otherwise rational and reasonable individuals with whom I’ve dealt with on news stories or community events, I feel like Elaine in Seinfeld not wanting to ask, but wondering: “You aren’t a conspiracy theorist, right? Oh no, you are!?”

With a desire for answers about why things are happening, in the face of terrifying doubt and uncertainty, far too many people are falling prey to the unintentional misinformation of the ignorant but worse, the intentional disinformation of the malevolent.

Public health officials and politicians are not getting this perfect, but they aren’t lying. The guy sharing memes mocking Trudeau is probably unintentionally spreading misinformation, and the gal sharing a link to something that you’ve seen over and over that contradicts what public health officials are saying is also probably unintentionally spreading lies.

As an optimist I think, sure, maybe we can’t get the malevolent social media users to change their ways, but I think if we all put our mind to it, we can help shift the narrative of the ignorant toward the truth or at least the pursuit of it.

The truth matters, right?

1014,1014,1481,theprogress,https://www.theprogress.com/opinion/letter-canada-needs-to-rethink-illegal-firearms/,LETTER: Canada needs to rethink illegal firearms – Chilliwack Progress,'Jun.',2020-06-18,"As the Chilliwack Progress reported, MP Mark Strahl had some harsh words to say about the announcement by the prime minister and his officials banning the sale of military-type arms to private individuals.

The action was at long last brought to the fore by the recent event in Nova Scotia, but this issue has been discussed by Canadians over many decades. And so, after much consultation prior to the last election and acutely in recent days, a federal government finally took action.

I couldn’t disagree with Strahl’s words more. There is nothing “cowardly” or “underhanded” about doing what a majority of Canadians have wanted for a long time, that is the elimination of firearms capable of mass murder. It comes as no surprise that a Conservative MP along with his party and now today the ignorant words of a Tory candidate for the Conservative leadership would accuse their own government of malfeasance.

Now, I completely understand that Mr. Strahl would want to curry favour with his base.

I am positive that there is seething anger in gun shops over this ban, but the inescapable truth is that legal gun owners and hunters, even those that go to our nice shooting range, do not think that assault-style weapons should be in civilian hands. As for the problem of guns coming into Canada from mainly the U.S., I agree that a lot more should be done to interdict these illegal weapons.

Some research into Mr. Strahl’s public statements shows no propensity on his or even his party’s part when in power, to budget enough funds for stricter border enforcement, nor does one find strong statements from Strahl advocating for more punitive jail terms for those who own illegal handguns or those who commit crimes with their use.

I wonder if this MP has been lobbying the provincial government to enact more severe punishments for illegal hand gun use?

Illegal hand guns can be obtained easily in Mr. Strahl’s riding.

They have been used here. They are regularly found mixed with drugs, money, knives and other dangerous items in homes right here in Chilliwack.

It is time for Mr. Strahl to begin at long last to advocate to the proper authorities, at least in this province, for a complete rethinking of the effects of illegal firearms. His rhetoric may save lives and help our society which is one of his jobs.

So, perhaps a little less indignation for political purposes and a lot more positive action would be a way forward for this MP.

One can continue to hope.

Remember we elect our official to work for us!

• READ MORE: LETTER: Chilliwack mayor’s anti-racism words amount to ‘grovelling and self-flagellation’

Thank you for publicizing your views. They are indicative of the problems we face here locally, where poisonous ideals and white privileges have been fostered and fed so well that they might be so articulately regurgitated by people like yourself.

It has been a problem in this town since my grandfather collonial-strolled into it more than 120 years ago.

This underbelly of outdated viewpoints, flawed since inception, has grown unchallenged due to the socioeconomic climate contained within. It’s bad for business, bad for politics, bad for safety to challenge or criticize the local extremist ideology and so it’s seldom done. When progression is ventured, as it was ever so mildly by Mayor Ken Popove, it is met with a white backlash only comparable to deep southern states or South Africa.

• READ MORE: Mayor of Chilliwack says it’s time to have ‘uncomfortable conversations’ about racism

You use several terms that indicate you have researched support for ideals and feelings that you already held. It is a tragic commonality to all of the well-articulated letters.

Your argument is so ridiculously outdated and ill-informed that trying to educate you on any of your points would be akin to explaining calculus to a seven-year-old. They must be intended to elicit the support of other local racist extremists.

Your letter is an abhorrent encapsulation of why we need leaders like Mayor Popove to take the small incremental steps this enclave of racism and homophobia will allow.

I implore co-operation and togetherness but there is no starting point for commentary like this. These views will never make this area a better part of Canada for our indigenous, minority or LGBTQ citizens. Citizens who contribute to the community equally but receive no equal regard. These views will never allow for sociological growth or social justice or rich diversity. These views are dangerous. These views are wrong.

Thank you Mayor Popove. At first I felt you didn’t say enough, now I remember why you couldn’t say more.

This might sound harsh but it’s said out of love. Love for the beauty of this geographic location and genuine love for the people of my community. But it’s time to grow up now Chilliwack and take a stand against the continued fostering of these tragic ideals.

Kari Medig photo.

As British Columbians, we seek solace in the mountains, humbled and exhilarated by their magnitude. In eastern BC, dramatic landscapes – with their towering peaks, plunging falls, and charming towns – help us connect with nature on a grand scale. This summer, discover larger-than-life mountains and outdoor adventure in places like Fernie, Revelstoke, and Valemount. While the journey may take longer, the experience will leave you awestruck.

Explore Dramatic Mountain Landscapes

Once you’ve been, you know. Mountain ranges in this part of BC are on a different scale. Even the most seasoned adventurist is speechless at the sight of the Rocky Mountains. Mount Robson Provincial Park, home to the largest peak in the Canadian Rockies, is a must-see.

This area is home to seven UNESCO-designated parks, including Mount Assiniboine Provincial Park. Explore the mountain ranges with a lift-accessed alpine hike, or plan a stay in a backcountry lodge surrounded by ancient peaks.

Enjoy Outdoor Adventures

If you love the outdoors, you may have already paid a visit to the Kootenays or Valemount for the abundance of activities. But, once is never enough. From hiking to biking, paddling to golfing, there’s plenty to keep you entertained.

With four lift-accessed bike parks (including Golden’s Kicking Horse Mountain Resort) and 600-plus trails, the Kootenays are a mountain biker’s paradise. Whether your ascent is lift- or leg-powered, you can conquer some of BC’s best-known bike trails, maneuvring through tight singletrack and wheeling through alpine wildflowers.

Paddle the calm waterways or navigate raging rapids. Kootenay Lake, home to the world’s largest trout species, is prime for fishing. Tip: hire a guide for insider knowledge. Meanwhile, tee time is served with spectacular mountain views when you golf at one of the 25 championship courses in the Kootenays.

Experience Authentic Mountain Culture

A trip to BC’s mountain towns, as wild and vibrant as the nature surrounding them, is a rite of passage for every British Columbian. Tucked into valleys, on shores of rivers, and along old railway routes, communities like Fernie and Cranbrook are pulsing with energy and entrepreneurial spirit. Spoiler alert: the vibe is infectious, if you haven’t already been.

As you may have observed, a feverish pursuit of outdoor activities and great coffee are common traits, but each town has its own personality and charm. Swing by a java joint, like Nelson’s Oso Negro, to find friendly faces and a laid-back vibe. Absorb the ethos of each place by visiting Indigenous-owned businesses, exploring historic attractions, popping into boutiques, and meeting interesting characters.

In the mountains, a day of adventure almost always ends with an après. Sip craft beer on a sun-drenched patio, and live like the locals do – if only for a short while.

Want to get back the cabinets you love? Gleam Guard offers a quick, dust-free and cost-effective solution.

We love the idea of a kitchen that looks as good as it works, but thinking about the dust, disruption and cost of a full-on renovation? That’s another story.

The good news is that it IS possible to get back to the cabinets and millwork you love quickly, and at a fraction of the cost of a new kitchen.

And even better news: the only prep you’ll need to do is clearing off your countertops!

“Many homeowners love the cabinets and millwork in their home, but over time, the finish has become worn or dull. They don’t want – or need – all-new cabinets, so the refinishing solution is perfect,” says Tracy Booth, owner of Gleam Guard Cabinet Refinishing, serving Chilliwack and the Lower Mainland region.

The key is to choose a professional with the experience to create a beautiful, lasting finish, using techniques that won’t fill the air with aggravating dust particles, says Booth, who’s been professionally refinishing cabinets for more than 30 years.

Here’s why it works:

Choosing qualified refinishing professionals means you’ll get your kitchen back to the way you want it, without the cost of new cabinets – as little as $2,000 instead of $20,000 to $30,000, for example.

You don’t need to remove old cabinets or replace door and drawer fronts – in fact, you don’t even need to empty your cupboards and drawers! “Our average prep time for customers is 10 minutes,” Booth says. (And if you don’t have much to clear off your countertops, it’s even less!)

The dust-free process starts with your Gleam Guard professional prepping the surface with a vigorous clean, then matching and applying the new finish. A wood floor finish provides a long-wearing result, protecting your cabinets from hazards such as water damage, grease and dust.

There’s no lengthy planning, demolition and construction period. “Our trained cabinet refinishing professionals will have your cabinets looking great and ready to go within one to two days,” Booth says.

All interior millwork can be refinished, so think beyond the kitchen to your built-in bookshelves, doors, windowsills, furniture and more.

How do you practice ice skating without a rink?

The Sungod Skating Club took their spring training online, bringing community, exercise and expertise into their members’ homes in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Off-ice strength and conditioning, technical dry-land jump classes, dance classes, social events, and guest appearances from high-profile athletes within the sport have made this a spring to remember for Sungod Skating Club.

“It is a lot of work to put together this online project on top of everything else the club is doing these days, but to see the athletes so engaged and to provide additional support to them has made the efforts all the more worthwhile,” says Director of Programs Kevin Bursey. “We’re definitely making lemonade out of lemons these days.”

Before the pandemic hit, club skaters performed their biannual Ice Show to the largest audience the club has seen in over two decades.

“We were so lucky to have scheduled our production a week earlier than normal, so after three months’ hard work the club was still able to present their efforts to the community of Delta before everything shut down,” club president Harman Sidhu says.

In the months since, Sungod Skating Club has continued to make memories for their members by inviting Olympian Patrick Chan and two-time Canadian national champion Nam Nguyen to deliver online sessions and answer questions. Nguyen encouraged the skaters to continue with their off-ice pursuits and gave pointers on how he himself was handling these new challenges.

No ice… No problem!

The club has hosted online competitions for beginner and advanced members where young skaters perform skills, exercises and small routines on the floor in their own homes via video conferencing. A panel of judges assesses and scores their efforts, and innovative animation allows them to hold an awards ceremony where top performers see their virtual selves on top of the podium.

“I’m pretty sure we’re the first skating club to venture into this area of provision to our members. It’s an exciting concept that gives our skaters motivation towards staying involved,” Bursey says.

At the beginning of June parents and skaters took part in an interactive cooking session with performance nutrition dietician Kelsey Moore. Later in the month the entire club is competing in a three-day decathlon-style event dubbed “No Ice… No Problem” with fitness challenges for all ages. Wearing custom shirts made by a local North Delta business, members will bond and stay in shape so they’re ready to return to the ice.

Online Skating programs designed to focus on balance, agility, and coordination will help prepare skaters to step on the ice. The club plans to continue using these new modes of teaching even when arenas are operational again, to enhance on-ice coaching.

(photo courtesy Ric Wallace – WhiteRockBeach.ca)

White Rock’s promenade and pier may be open, but one popular waterfront element – the artists walk – is still missing.

And it’s not likely to reappear until plans can be worked out to allow it to operate safely under COVID-19 restrictions, according to city cultural development manager Elizabeth Keurvorst.

In a brief verbal presentation and written memo to council on June 15, Keurvorst was responding to a question to council from local artist/photographer Ric Wallace.

Wallace had asked whether the artists walk was to re-open, with physical distancing measures.

He noted that the White Rock Farmers Market is currently accepting non-food vendors; that council is taking measures – including providing picnic tables – to help support waterfront restaurants; and that even some buskers have returned to designated outdoor areas in the city.

But Keurvorst pointed out that resuming the artists walk – which in pre-pandemic times provided space on the grassy area just west of the museum to some 14 exhibiting artists – would create challenges under current provincial restrictions.

Ordinarily, individuals pay a $150 annual fee to participate in the artists walk, which enables each to set up, display and sell their artwork in a six square-metre space, and keep 100 per cent of the proceeds of sales.

“In looking at how we can restart, we look to the provincial health office, and there are two considerations that we would want to look at before re-opening the artists walk,” Keurvorst said.

“One would be physical distancing…as people walk the promenade they tend to veer onto the grass to allow for that six-foot distancing, that two-metre distancing,” she added.

READ ALSO: White Rock Farmers Market back with a difference May 3

“As well, the public health order has put out guidelines for farmers markets, when it comes to including artisans, but there is a market manager present to monitor that – we wouldn’t have that at the artists walk. We would need to look to the provincial health authorities’ cross-departmental team in order to look at reopening the artists walk, so there is a lot of work to do before we can open it again.”

Coun. Christopher Trevelyan asked whether there had been any consideration given to alternative locations for the artists walk.

“The short answer is no, but the same principles would apply; looking to the provincial health officer to help us with any guidance on both buskers and artists,” Keurvorst said.

Trevelyan sought, and received, assurances from Keurvorst and chief administrative officer Guillermo Ferrero, that staff is actively studying ways to bring back the artists walk.

“In concert with all the other services we’re doing, we’re looking at the Pop-Uptown Gallery, we’re looking at the artists walk, buskers and all the services we offer,” Keurvorst said.

In her memorandum, she noted that artists who exhibited in 2019, but could not this year, have been encouraged to participate in online marketing in association with the city’s Virtual Canada Day event on July 1, and also online art shows offered in partnership with Semiahmoo Arts.

“Re-thinking how the tents are set back and how walkers are able to walk between or behind to maintain physical distancing, where artwork is stored, and how far down the beach, we want to stretch, will be important for us to comply with the provincial health distancing requirements,” she wrote.

Section 90 of the Community Charter provides that a city council can hold a meeting that’s closed to the public if it concerns “personal” information about an “identifiable” individual, concerns labour or other employee relations, or the “acquisition, disposition or expropriation” of land if council thinks such disclosure could harm the city’s interests.

The Charter also allows city councils to do business inside a closed meeting if the information they are considering is prohibited from disclosure under the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act, or the matter involves “the consideration of information received and held in confidence” concerning negotiations between the city and higher levels of government.

READ ALSO: Surrey disbands homelessness society during closed meeting

This is quite cut-and-dried. It is therefore not to be used as a vehicle by council majorities, on matters not captured by the aforementioned provisions set out in the Community Charter, to sneak one by the electorate they purport to serve.

Moreover, it is certainly not to be used as an excuse for politicians to duck accountability, when asked why an item was dealt with in a closed meeting when the matter did not fall under any of these provisions.

City councillors revealed this week that council decided to disband the Surrey Housing and Homelessness Society’s board during a closed meeting last Thursday apparently because the mayor wanted to bring its governance “in-house.”

Mayor Doug McCallum would then not comment on the matter as it had been dealt with in a closed meeting.

Expedient for politicians, unfair for the public they were elected to serve.

This is not the stuff of transparency. Rather, it is opaque and anti-democratic.

It is comforting to know that, in cases of personal tragedy and extreme adversity, not only family and friends but also complete strangers are more than willing to help you.

Three recent local tragedies come to mind.

On June 1, Jasvinder Singh Riar, age 31, died at work, at the Canadian National Railway’s Thornton Yard in North Surrey, leaving behind his wife, his nine-month-old son, and his mother, paternal grandmother and sister. That was one mighty responsibility he shouldered, being the sole provider for his family.

But at this time of writing, 866 donors have contributed $96,959 through a GoFundMe campaign online, toward helping his family.

This past Sunday, which happened to be Father’s Day, tragedy struck another local family when Surrey realtor Kashif Sheikh, 46, drowned while trying to save his daughter who had slipped into a creek near a waterfall in the Okanagan.

Sheikh leaves behind a wife and four children.

By Wednesday morning, 939 donors to a GoFundMe campaign had raised $95,230 to help Sheikh’s family.

Of course, no amount of money will ever replace these two men. But the money being raised in their memory will surely help take some of the burden off their survivors, who are undoubtedly suffering from the shock, confusion and grief that is particular to sudden and unexpected deaths.

Now, a third local fundraising initiative has been launched to help a Surrey family of seven whose home was destroyed in a fire on Tuesday in Whalley.

The fact that strangers, some of whom can ill afford it, will help others in times of need serves to remind us that ultimately none of us are really alone.

And we can all take some comfort in that.

Submitted photos taken from March 23 to May 1 in Surrey show dog owners allowing their dogs to roam and play – and even do their business on – using sports fields, despite signs clearly stating dogs are prohibited.

The Editor,

Dogs are prohibited on athletic fields everywhere to protect the health and welfare of the athletes who use the fields. Why do dog owners purposefully disregard the welfare of those athletes and others who use the fields for their intended purpose?

It’s shocking that during the COVID-19 crisis, when people are expected to raise their social consciousness and take actions to protect the health of other people, that dog owners carry on as usual, disregarding laws that don’t suit them.

Dog owners who use athletic fields for their own private off-leash dog park and dog toilet, are breaking municipal laws. I see more than 35 dogs a week on the South Surrey Athletic fields at 20th and 148 Street. Things are as bad or worse at Sunnyside Park. Thirty-five dogs equal 35 piles of defecated excrement on the fields and and urine everywhere.

I know people think it is convenient to use the local sports field, that driving to the dog park adds unnecessary carbon to global warming, and that their dog is perfect. But owning a dog carries responsibilities to the environment, to your city and to other people.

We don’t spread human waste on sports fields or send it to the landfill for obvious reasons. Dog turds are worse.

By Curt Taylor Griffiths

As a member of the Provincial Municipal Policing Transition Study Committee, which created the transition plan for the new City of Surrey Police Department, I feel compelled to respond to several assertions made by Peter German in the media, including in the June 11th issue of the Now-Leader.

German argues that the quality of policing will not improve with the transition from RCMP to a municipal police force. It will. The Surrey Police Department will deliver policing services within a community policing framework that is best practice and evidence based. It will be flexible and adaptable to the changing needs of one of Canada’s most dynamic communities. The delivery of policing services will be decentralized, focusing on the communities of South Surrey, Cloverdale, Newton, Fleetwood/Guildford, and City Centre/Whalley. Officers will assume ownership of the districts.

German states that the Surrey RCMP has 843 officers. This figure includes vacancies and officers on secondment to specialized units. The actual strength of the detachment is 792 and the number of deployable officers is fewer than that. The new SPD will have 805 officers, the majority of whom will be involved in front line service. Compared to the current deployment of RCMP officers in Surrey, there will be 16 per cent more uniformed SPD officers on the street.

Peter German: Costs of new police force will handcuff Surrey taxpayers for a generation

German raises the issue of increased salary costs associated with the new SPD. The collective agreement that will be negotiated between the RCMP union and the federal government is likely to include a provision that RCMP officers in B.C. have wage parity with their municipal counterparts. This would result in a 20 per cent wage increase for RCMP members. Notably, RCMP-policed municipalities will not be at the bargaining table, but will get the invoice. If wage parity is achieved, the costs of RCMP contract policing and municipal policing will be similar, even with the 10 per cent federal subsidy for RCMP.

German asserts that training the new members of the SPD will be a problem. It will not. The transition plan calls for 68 new recruits to be hired and trained over a two-year period at the Police Academy at the Justice Institute of B.C. The staff at the academy assured the transition committee that this number can be accommodated. The remaining hires will be officers who are currently in service. Although there has not been a formal survey of in-service officers, anecdotal evidence suggests that the SPD will be successful in hiring currently serving officers from other police services, including the RCMP. The transition plan calls for a gradual change-over from RCMP to municipal, with SPD members replacing RCMP officers over a period of time.

German raises the issue of community safety, arguing that criminals will have a “field day” during the transition. Unlikely. The graduated transition plan will ensure the department is fully staffed at all times. Protocols have also been established for investigative file continuity during the transition.

In German’s view, municipal police services do not create a greater sense of identity. They do. In contrast to their RCMP counterparts, municipal police officers generally spend their entire careers in one community. This facilitates ownership and partnerships. The SPD will be able to recruit a workforce that reflects the diversity of the community, an impossibility in an RCMP detachment where personnel decisions are not made at the local level. The arrival and departure of officers and the Officer in Command of the detachment is determined by the organizational needs of the RCMP rather than by those of the municipality.

The men and women of the RCMP who have policed the city for the past 70 years have served admirably. However, Surrey has outgrown the RCMP model. It was the last municipality in Canada with over 350,000 residents without an independent police service. The City of Surrey had its own police service from 1887 to 1951. In many ways, it is returning to its roots.

Once again, we are confronted with the good, the bad, and the ugly.

First, the good. It’s heartening that, despite the risk and fear generated by this pandemic, volunteers such as those at Whalley’s City Centre Church have nevertheless stepped up to make more than 10,000 bag lunches for people in need of a break, at Surrey Urban Mission.

The selflessness of such sandwich slingers is, shall we say, soul-inspiring.

Second, there is the bad and the ugly. The following covers both categories.

Year-round, we are confronted with examples of loathsome behaviour.

People who steal money from poppy trays during Remembrance Day, people who run off with Salvation Army donation kettles at Christmas time, people who taint candies at Halloween. Behaviour both ugly, and bad.

It’s unconscionable that someone would break into a school at any time, let alone during a pandemic, to steal equipment that children need.

But 20 counts of breaking into schools?

That’s no one-off ‘mistake,’ hopefully to be remedied by an attack of conscience. Nor is it an act of down-and-out desperation, nor mischief.

It’s a career choice, and a bad one at that.

Bad, and ugly.

Thankfully, people who choose to do good instead help push that pendulum back in the right direction, which makes their work all the more profound.

Those who prey on others must live with themselves.

Surrey council’s avowed intention to create a municipal police force would end over 70 years of RCMP service to the community and terminate a 20-year contract signed in 2012.

Since 1935, the federal government has allowed its federal force to police municipalities, with over 150 contracts currently in place.

The reasons are obvious – a quality, cost effective police service. The RCMP did not ask to become Surrey’s municipal force. Residents overwhelmingly voted to replace the Surrey Municipal Police in a 1950 plebiscite.

So why does Surrey now wish to end its contract with the RCMP? The reasons given float between a safer city, greater accountability, and that Surrey is now a big city.

It is extremely unusual for a municipality to unilaterally end its contract with the RCMP, other than when communities amalgamate.

Once gone, never to return is the federal mantra, as it underwrites significant contract policing costs. Below are the real issues.

THE QUALITY OF POLICING WILL IMPROVE

Wrong! The quality of police officers on the street in the Lower Mainland is virtually the same whether they are municipal or RCMP. This is the result of common standards. At the end of the day, it boils down to having sufficient street resources and specialized units to deliver the level of policing required by a community. This is not the function of one force or another.

SURREY COUNCIL WILL GOVERN THE NEW FORCE

Wrong! Municipalities do not appoint police boards – the province does. The municipality has two seats on a police board. RCMP detachments typically report to a council appointed safety committee. Surrey recently changed this reporting structure, with the RCMP commander reporting only to the mayor.

A MUNICIPAL FORCE WILL BE COST-NEUTRAL

Wrong! Make no mistake, a municipal force will cost more than the RCMP. Nobody knows how much more, for one simple reason. The RCMP has not been engaged in the discussion.

Consider the following.

1. In 2018, the per capita cost of policing in Surrey was $284 compared to $458 in Vancouver – a 60 per difference.

2. Surrey detachment has 843 officers. Any force policing Surrey needs more resources. To suggest that the new force can perform its duties with the same number, or less officers is poppycock.

3. The RCMP patrol model is one person per car. Many municipal forces are contractually required to employ a percentage of two person cars.

4. RCMP members maintain most of the investigations they are assigned during a shift, rather than referring them to detective units.

5. The salary differential between the RCMP and municipal police is between 15 and 20 per cent.

6. A new force will offer a salary commensurate with the highest municipal police salary.

7. Ten per cent of Surrey’s policing costs are covered by the federal government.

8. Transition costs include tens of millions of dollars for clothing, vehicles, and infrastructure.

9. Surrey will be required to deal with all lawsuits, such as police car accidents.

10. The cost of recruiting 800 plus employees and training them is huge.

It is reasonable to project that Surrey will require a force of at least 1,200 police officers to cover off existing needs, and the new patrol model. Combine that with a 15 to 20 per cent increase in salaries, the loss of a 10 per cent subsidy, a huge capital investment, and transition costs, and the increased cost to Surrey taxpayers will be in the hundreds of millions of dollars.

RECRUITING A NEW FORCE WILL NOT BE A PROBLEM

Wrong! Where do you find 800, or 1,200 police officers? It is estimated that up to 150 municipal police officers from other Lower Mainland forces may bridge over to be closer to home or for promotions. RCMP pension portability remains an issue, despite Surrey bravely suggesting it is not. Nobody has even surveyed how many RCMP members are interested in joining, but the RCMP attrition rate is quite low. Where then will the bulk of the new force be recruited? Overseas? Other provinces? Will hiring requirements be reduced? And how will this provide a better level of policing?

TRAINING A NEW FORCE WILL NOT BE A PROBLEM

Wrong! The Police Academy at the Justice Institute of B.C. is woefully under resourced, with an aging and outdated infrastructure that struggles to keep up with the current attrition rate of municipal forces. It has no present ability to expand and provide the numbers of recruits required for Surrey or to backfill other departments. Despite a brave assertion that there is a plan, the need to train hundreds of police officers to an acceptable standard will be a huge cost to the Province and municipalities.

THE NEW FORCE WILL MAGICALLY REPLACE RCMP

Wrong! Any transition would rely heavily on a continued RCMP presence, meaning two police chiefs, multiple communication systems, different cultures, policies, and command structures. A one-year timeframe is pie in the sky. Recruiting, training, and new infrastructure will take much longer.

SURREY WILL BE SAFER

Wrong! Naysayers skate around the fact that Surrey’s violent crime severity index in 2018 was at a 10-year low. The local detachment has done everything asked of it by the City to deal with the illegal drug market, domestic abuse complaints, gang violence and routine calls for service. During a transition, organized crime may well have a field day. Transferring institutional knowledge, intelligence and sources is not an easy task for police.

MUNICIPAL FORCE CREATES BETTER SENSE OF IDENTITY

Wrong! The RCMP has responded to millions of calls for service over the past 70 years. Hundreds of RCMP officers make their homes in Surrey. They are volunteers – hockey, baseball, soccer, and football coaches. Many have been injured on the job and five made the ultimate sacrifice. It is our national police force, with which all Canadians identify.

The current, integrated nature of policing in the Lower Mainland has withstood the test of time, commissions of inquiry, and challenging cases. The citizens of Surrey should do what they want, but with their eyes wide open. Trading the yellow stripe of Canada’s national police for the blue stripe of a municipal force must not be a knee-jerk decision taken with blinders on. Taxpayers will endure the consequences for a generation.

In the first season of HBO’s True Detective, Matthew McConaughey’s character, Rust Cohle, tells detectives – who are working to solve a decades-old murder case – that “time is a flat circle.”

“Everything we’ve ever done or will do, we’re gonna do over and over and over again,” he says.

It’s arguably McConaughey’s most memorable line from the dark, police drama, and has been oft-repeated, meme’d on the internet time and again, perhaps more as a result of the actor’s self-assured delivery than because it provides any real wisdom.

Nevertheless, I’ve found logic in it lately, as we all begin to stumble out of the darkness that is COVID-19 quarantine and emerge from hibernation to re-enter the world, throwing open the shades triumphantly even if we’re still not quite sure what day it is.

Perhaps it’s because I have found myself with free time on my hands, but the days have somehow felt like they’re moving both fast and slow at once, in the same way that a microwaved convenience-store burrito can be cold but somehow still burn your tongue.

Maybe time is even going backwards. Who knows?

Someone mentioned to me earlier this week that, by the end of this month – it’s June now, for those scoring at home – we’ll be halfway through 2020, meaning we have just six months to go before we can turn a page on this hellish year.

It took me by surprise. We’re halfway through? How? It feels like only a few weeks ago that I was using up my remaining 2019 vacation days to go on a vacation with my wife. We went on a plane and everything.

But that was February.

Today is Thursday. What’s tomorrow? December?

Who knows.

The truth is, these last months have all melted together into one long Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day.

In the before times, I’d wake up just before 7 a.m., get ready for work and be out the door by quarter to eight, arriving at the office a few minutes early to ensure I could snag a much coveted parking spot.

But working from home, I rolled out of bed later and later each day, yet still made it with minutes to spare. When your office is 30 feet from your bedroom, time becomes irrelevant.

Once on the clock, my routine was upended, too. Pre-pandemic, I would never eat cereal at my desk at 2 p.m. or spend my coffee break debating which pair of pyjama pants was best for casual Friday. One day, I showered on my lunch break.

My days off would get a little murky, too, as my early-quarantine goals – which ranged from a pledge to exercise daily or to use my off-time to learn a new skill – were eventually replaced by video games and sitcom binging, for hours on end.

I once stayed up until 4:30 a.m. to watch a Korean League Baseball game. I don’t know why.

The clock has struck midnight on such slothfulness, however, and in the long run, maybe it’s for the best. I leave the house for work now. I have reason again to wear pants.

And at some point, I really am going to get into a daily exercise routine.

Maybe tomorrow. Or by October, at the latest. It’s just a few days away.

Many will agree with Surrey Councillor Doug Elford when he says, “Twitter is a sewer.”

Sadly, though, his Safe Surrey Coalition has been wallowing, luxuriating even, in its mire.

And, not only in this most recent instance, in which a so-called “unauthorized person,” who, at that moment at least, was in complete control of the keys when he or she accused the police of murder in posts on Twitter and Facebook.

The civic slate has been engaged in a sustained smear campaign against the RCMP through its social media posts, digging up whatever it can find to put the Mounties in a bad light. This particular example, while the most egregious, is not a one-off.

Not only was the post beneath contempt, but that it was posted under the banner of a civic slate, one with majority control of Surrey’s affairs, is beyond disturbing.

READ ALSO: Safe Surrey under fire for ‘sickening’ social media posts accusing RCMP of murder

For Mayor Doug McCallum, after all has been said and done, to claim he, “and certainly Safe Surrey Coalition, have tremendous respect for the RCMP,” brings to mind the words of Humpty Dumpty: “When I use a word, it means just what I choose it to mean – neither more nor less.”

Speaking of eggs, surely the cracks now running through the SSC’s shell, resulting from the shock waves produced by its own political social media grenade, cannot simply be repaired with an “oops,” and vows to not allow it to happen again. That’s not enough.

There needs to be a reckoning, if this civic slate is to exorcise itself, in the public eye at least, from whatever foul processes that hatched such an unfortunate social media post in the first place.
