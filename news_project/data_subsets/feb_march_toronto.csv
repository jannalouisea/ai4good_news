143,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/conservative-leadership-race-enters-final-push-1.4830847,Conservative leadership race enters final push,,2020-02-27,"OTTAWA -- The four Conservative leadership candidates are kicking off the final stretch of COVID-19-style campaigning, with just over a month to go before all ballots are cast, after breaking a party record for membership signups.

After going head-to-head in two debates on June 17 and 18 the leadership hopefuls are continuning to try to separate themselves from the rest of the pack.

Erin O’Toole, Peter MacKay, Leslyn Lewis, and Derek Sloan battled it out in French on June 17, doing their best to deliver their platform pitches despite not one being fully bilingual. On June 18, Toronto played host to the first and only English-language debate.

Co-chairs of the Conservative Party leadership election organizing committee Dan Nowlan and Lisa Raitt were chosen to moderate.

Under the original leadership race timeline, the party was set to hold its debates in April, but those were cancelled when the entire race was put on pause due to the pandemic.

Given the public health concerns at play, there was no live audience, and physical distancing measures were in place.

Another pandemic-prompted workaround, the voting process will be conducted through mail-in ballots, which party members need to send back to the party by August 21.

On July 14 the party revealed that it had set an internal record for the total number of memberships in a leadership race, with 269,469 members eligible to vote.

“With nearly 270,000 paid Conservative Party members as of cut-off on May 15, 2020, that also means it’s the largest membership eligible to vote in a leadership in Canadian history,” said the party in a statement. According to the Conservatives, the biggest growth in new support came from voters in Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador, Quebec, and Alberta.

The race resumed on April 29 “with adjustments to accommodate current circumstances,” a month after it was initially suspended, with LEOC saying at the time that it wouldn’t be possible to meet all deadlines necessary in time for the originally-planned June 27 announcement of a winner.

While all ballots need to be submitted by August 21, it’s yet to be determined how quickly they will be scrutinized and a winner declared.

The ballots have begun to be mailed out and should soon be in eligible voters’ inboxes, the party said in mid-July.

The date and format of how the party will announce its new leader once the results are tallied will also depend on the health guidelines and government orders in place at the time.

VERIFIED CANDIDATES

To reach this phase, each contender had to raise $200,000, put forward an additional $100,000 as a compliance fee, and gather 3,000 signatures from members. This secures their name on the ballot.

Erin O’Toole:

A three-time Conservative MP from Ontario and former cabinet minister. Prior to entering politics O'Toole was in the Royal Canadian Air Force for a decade and later worked as a lawyer. O'Toole placed third in the 2017 leadership race, and since re-entering has taken policy positions that appear to be appealing to the base of the party. He's described himself as the ""true blue"" candidate.

O'Toole says he's running because ""the country needs a strong Conservative party."" He's taking the position of uniting Conservatives.

Peter MacKay:

A former federal cabinet minister from Nova Scotia and the last leader of the Progressive Conservatives pre-merger with Stephen Harper’s Canadian Alliance in 2003. After deciding not to run in 2015, MacKay was working at a Toronto law firm and was a frequent political commentator. Since throwing his hat in the ring he's faced questions over some conflicting positions.

MacKay says he is running ""to keep the Conservative movement united and to defeat Justin Trudeau in the next general election.""

Leslyn Lewis:

An Ontario lawyer who was an unsuccessful 2015 federal election candidate. Lewis lost after being put into a race at the last moment when the previous candidate quit once a video of him urinating in a cup while working in someone's home surfaced. She came to Canada as a child from Jamaica and has received the backing of Campaign Life Coalition, as well as the support of a prominent Christian activist, who called her a ""breath of fresh air"" as a woman who is against same-sex marriage and abortion.

Lewis says she is running because ""Canadians can and should expect much more from their leaders,"" and because she is seeing ""opportunities for future generations falling away.""

Derek Sloan:

A rookie Ontario Conservative MP elected for the first time in 2019. Prior to entering politics he worked as a lawyer and small business owner. Since entering the House of Commons he's stated that he believes the ""cause of sexual orientation"" is ""scientifically unclear,"" and has also received the backing of social conservative organization Campaign Life Coalition.

Sloan says he believes the country is ""under siege by a tide of political correctness that seeks to destroy Canada,"" and vows to ""take a stand for Canada against radical progressivism.""

NO LONGER IN THE RUNNING

Marilyn Gladu:

A two-time Conservative MP from Ontario, who was first elected in 2015. Prior to entering politics she worked as a chemical engineer. As a parliamentarian she's advocated for palliative care and, during her time as the health critic, she voiced concerns about the Liberals’ rollout of marijuana legalization.

Gladu said her vision included: ""Canadian policy rooted in a better balance of fiscal common sense and social compassion.""

Rudy Husny:

A longtime Conservative party member and former staffer. Husny worked for PricewaterhouseCoopers in Montreal before trying his luck twice at running as the Conservative candidate in the riding of Outremont in 2011 and 2015. Husny worked as a senior adviser to the Minister of International Trade in between his two unsuccessful bids. After 2015, he spent time both in the private sector in the Gulf region and in outgoing Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer's office. Husny was the only Quebec candidate, and he had already established that he would tell MPs looking to bring forward anti-abortion bills that it's ""not the priority.""

Husny said he was running ""to bring generational change to our party, to our politics, and to our country.""

Rick Peterson:

A businessman from Alberta and past leadership candidate. He came 12th in the 2017 leadership race and touted his bilingualism and openness to diversity as assets. He proposed a 15 per cent flat personal income tax and a roll back of Liberal gun laws.

Peterson said he was running to ""help restore and reinvigorate the investment climate and job creation."" He billed himself as the candidate with a ""bold vision"" that included tax reform and a climate plan.

Jim Karahalios:

An Ontario lawyer who has advocated for the elimination of carbon taxes. He's also married to Ontario Progressive Conservative MPP Belinda Karahalios and is suing the provincial PC party over allegations that the 2018 race for party president was “rigged” to keep him out. He received the backing of social conservative group Campaign Life Coalition.

Karahalios said he was running to fight against what he called a ""top-down coronation"" for ""the well-connected establishment candidates.""

PROMPTED BY SCHEER RESIGNATION

The leadership race got underway on January 13, giving hopefuls 45 days to declare. The hunt for a new head of the party was prompted by Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer announcing on Dec. 12 that he was stepping down as leader but would be staying on until a replacement is named.

Under Scheer, the Conservatives increased their seat count to 121 seats in the 2019 federal election, but in the weeks following the election, Scheer faced a steady stream of criticism for his performance and personal stance on same-sex marriage and other social issues. He was also questioned about his expenses and use of party funds in the lead-up to the federal campaign.",[]

CTVNews.ca will have stories on tax season every Money Monday. Look for it in our 5 Things to Know.

Whether you are working with a tax specialist or using software to file your taxes, it’s important to be aware of any changes that could affect your refund.

But first, let’s start with the basics.

IMPORTANT DATES AND DEADLINES

As usual, April 30 is the last day to file your 2019 income tax return. If you owe the Canada Revenue Agency money, it must be paid by this date. Otherwise, you’ll face a late-filing penalty and daily interest charges on your balance.

The CRA notes that even if you can’t pay your full balance owing on or before April 30, you can avoid the late-filing penalty by filing your return on time.

If you are self-employed, you have until June 15 to file your return. But keep in mind that if you owe taxes, you’ll still be required to pay your balance by the April 30 deadline.

The deadline to contribute to your registered retirement savings plan (RRSP) is March 2.

CHANGES TO CRA SERVICES

Right off the bat, you might notice a few changes to the T1 Personal Income Tax return form. Most notably, it’s doubled in size from four pages to eight.

But this doesn’t mean you’ll be required to put in extra work. The length accounts for increased font size and new formatting, as well as the CRA’s decision to include the calculation of federal tax. There is also a new numbering system.

“Most Canadians aren’t going to notice much of a difference, other than the extra pages and new line numbers” Armando Minicucci, tax specialist at Grant Thornton, told CTVNews.ca.

The CRA has also released a new online tool that allows you to check the estimated processing time for your tax return and other tax-related requests.

You now also have the option of setting a personal identification number through the My Account portal to quickly identify yourself when calling the CRA.

GETTING ORGANIZED

If you haven’t done so already, experts suggest signing up for the CRA’s My Account portal to ensure that all of your personal information is up to date and accurate. This portal not only stores important tax income documents, it allows you to check the status of your refunds, outstanding balances, and RRSP or TFSA contribution limits.

More importantly, if you have misplaced any of your documents or T-slips, you should be able to access them in My Account.

Next, organize your paperwork.

· Employment and income slips (T4s, T4As, T5s, T3s, etc.)

· Receipts to back up claims for things like medical or childcare costs, charitable donations, or moving expenses

· Disability certificates, mortgage and property tax statements

· Self-employed or rental income and expense information

· Student tuition and interest documents

Reporting investment income tends to be the trickiest area for taxpayers, according to Minicucci.

“Income sometimes gets missed because people don’t understand how much they’ve earned on their investments each year,” he said. “This is generally the most common area where individual taxpayers are reassessed.”

You should have received an annual statement from any investments you held in 2019 showing the total income you earned during the year and the total expenses incurred, such as investment adviser fees (which are deductible).

NEW AND IMPROVED TAX BREAKS

Enhanced CPP Contributions: You can now claim a deduction for any enhanced contributions to the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) or the Quebec Pension Plan (QPP).

“Employees were required to contribute 0.15 per cent of pensionable earnings commencing last January to a maximum annual contribution of $80.85,” explained Minicucci.

“Regular contributions to CPP result in a non-refundable tax credit. The deduction for enhanced contributions is a tax deduction, not a tax credit.”

Canada Workers Benefit: Formerly known as the Working Income Tax Benefit, this benefit provides a refundable tax credit for individuals and families that are in the workforce but have income below certain thresholds.

The maximum benefit is $1,335 for individuals with earned income of $12,820 or less. For families, the maximum refund is $2,335 with an income threshold of no more than $17,025. However, if you are enrolled in a full-time education program, you’re not eligible.

Home Buyers’ Plan: In 2019 the Home Buyers’ Plan RRSP withdrawal limit increased from $25,000 to $35,000 for withdrawals made after March 19.

New homeowners also qualify for the $5,000 first-time Home Buyers’ Tax Credit if they have purchased a home in the tax year—a tax credit Minicucci warns could be overlooked by many first-time buyers.

Cannabis as a Medical Expense: Certain cannabis products are now considered eligible for the medical expense tax credit, providing you have an authorization.

Climate Action Incentive: The perks of this incentive program range depending on which province you live in. Albertans are now eligible to claim this incentive, whereas residents in New Brunswick will not. Residents in Ontario, Saskatchewan and Manitoba will receive a large amount this year compared to the previous tax season.",[]
517,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/how-to-protect-your-personal-information-online-during-tax-season-1.4804898,How to protect your personal information online during tax season,'Nicole Bogart',2020-02-17,"TORONTO -- Tax season can be a particularly precarious time for Canadians.

Not only is there pressure to file your tax return accurately and on-time, you’re doling out vast amounts of sensitive personal information online while doing so.

Practising good personal data protection etiquette online should be top of mind for consumers year-round. But it becomes increasingly important during tax season, when cybercriminals tend to prey on consumers who are more likely to fall for scams that ask for their personal information.

Here are some important security measures to keep in mind while handling your personal information online this tax season:

BE WARY OF SCAMS

Canadians have faced an influx of online scams and robocalls purporting to be from federal organizations including the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) over the last few years.

These scams often threaten consumers with the imminent threat of arrest or lawsuit before asking for a litany of personal information, such as social insurance numbers.

In 2019, Canadians lost more than $1.4 million to CRA scams, according to numbers provided to CTVNews.ca by the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre (CAFC). In fact, as of Feb. 2, the CAFC had confirmed 34 successful instances of CRA fraud in 2020, costing consumers over $10,000 total.

“A lot of the scams take place over email and SMS,” Christine Beauchamp, director of the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security, told CTVNews.ca in a telephone interview.

“They have a variety of messages that make them seem very legitimate and professional. You might not be able to tell right away whether or not they’re legitimate.”

When it comes to online scams in particular, the CRA says it will never:

Ask for prepaid credit cards or gift cards.

Collect or distribute payment via e-transfer or bitcoin.

Send an email with a link that asks you to divulge personal or financial information, unless you have called the CRA to ask for a form or a link for information. In this case, a CRA agent would send you an email during the call with that information.

Beauchamp adds that users should never click on links included in suspicious emails, especially if it’s not a secure link.

Sites with a secure connection will display a lock symbol in the left hand side of the URL bar in your web browser. Secure sites will also start with “https” (the “s” stands for secure).

USE SECURE PASSWORDS

Your income tax return contains a wealth of incredibly sensitive personal information -- perfect for anyone who wants to steal your identity.

“If there is one password you want to keep incredibly strong and unique, I would say it’s definitely the one that’s associated with your tax return file,” Beauchamp said.

Whether you are filing online through the CRA’s website, or using a third-party program to help you with your return, make sure that you use a password that is eight to 10 upper- and lower-case letters mixed with numbers. That’s the formula experts say is most secure.

When choosing numbers to add to your password, be sure not to use anything that is easily identifiable, such as your address or date of birth.

If you have a hard time remembering your passwords, Beauchamp suggests stringing together three or four random words you’ll remember, which is often as strong as an alphanumerical password.

SAVE YOUR FILES SECURELY

When filing your taxes online, be mindful of where you save the PDF copy of your return and any supporting documents.

If possible, Beauchamp recommends storing these files on an encrypted external hard drive or a secure drive in the documents section of your computer. Files that are saved on your computer’s desktop are not as protected as those stored in the documents folders.

Experts don’t recommend storing these kinds of personal documents in the cloud.

Keep in mind that you should be filing your return from a secure internet connection and not from a public Wi-Fi connection.

Public Wi-Fi networks are highly susceptible to Man-in-the-Middle-style attacks, which allow eavesdroppers to intercept data transmissions and read them.

EDUCATE YOURSELF

The CRA has an entire website dedicated to helping Canadians protect themselves against fraud, including information about the most common scams.

The government’s Get Cyber Safe websitehas additional information about filing your taxes online safely.

Tax season is prime time for scammers,'Nicole Bogart',2020-02-10,"TORONTO -- Canadians who have grown tired of unsolicited emails and phone calls from scammers claiming they owe money to federal agencies will have their patience tested this tax season.

The Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre (CAFC) is expecting to see a surge in these scams between March and April, when cybercriminals tend to prey on consumers who are more likely to fall for scams that ask for their personal informationduring tax season.

According to numbers provided to CTVNews.ca, 470 Canadians lost more than $1.4 million to these scams last year alone.

Another 3,210 complaints of scammers posing as the tax agency were reported to the CAFC in 2019, but the CAFC notes that thousands more go unreported.

Jeff Thompson, a senior RCMP intelligence agent working for the CAFC, says that scams that mention the CRA are just the tip of the iceberg.

“There’s the telephone CRA scam that we continue to get reports about, but we’ve seen a huge shift with [scammers] claiming to be Service Canada reporting fraud on your SIN number,” Thompson told CTVNews.ca in a telephone interview.

Thompson said CRA-related scams often involve phishing campaigns sent by email or text message, many with the promise of a tax return in the form of an e-transfer -- something the CRA says it will never do.

But despite increased effort by Canadians authorities and government officials to crack down on these types of scams, including a large scale bust involving more than 40 illegal call centres in India last March, experts fear the market for fraud outpaces authoritative efforts.

“It is a little bit like a drop of a bucket -- a game of whack-a-mole. You take out one group and another pops up,” Avner Levin, director of Ryerson University’s Privacy and Cybercrime Institute, told CTVNews.ca in a telephone interview.

“All they need is a handful of successful scams to make money. And if you’re talking about sending out an email or a text message the costs are negligible.”

Avner says some relief may come from more stringent requirements placed on telecom providers by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), including call-blocking technology that prevents some “spoofed” numbers from reaching Canadians customers.

“This isn’t an issue you can solve on your own by blocking calls on your own device. You need the telecom companies to get involved and do their part,” Avner said.

Meanwhile, as scammers ramp up for busy season, Avner’s best piece of advice is simple: don’t answer your phoneif you don’t recognize the number.

“The scam is in the social context… the person gets on the phone and intimidates you, stresses you out, convinces you to do things you wouldn’t do,” he said.

“You’ve got to find ways to disengage and disconnect. The more you stay on the line and have a conversation with them, even if you think you’re impervious to this, they will chip away at it.”

In a statement to CTVNews.ca, a CRA spokesperson said education is key when it comes to protecting Canadians from these types of scams.

The CRA says it will never:

Use aggressive language or threaten to arrest or deport you .

Ask for prepaid credit cards or gift cards.

Collect or distribute payment through e-transfers or bitcoins.

Send an email with a link that asks you to divulge personal or financial information, unless you have called the CRA to ask for a form or a link for information. In this case, a CRA agent would send you an email during the call with that information.

The CAFC notes that users should never click on links included in suspicious emails, especially if it’s not a secure link.Sites with a secure connection will display a lock symbol in the left hand side of the URL bar in your web browser. Secure sites will also start with “https” (the “s” stands for secure).

But Levin notes that consumers should continue to be vigilant after filing their taxes, noting that cybercriminals are ready to strike at any time.

“There is some risk when you’re filing your taxes, but afterwards, when you’re awaiting a return, we also see a huge spike in these types of scams,” he said.

Luxury condo prices climbed 7 per cent in the GTA in the 12 months ending Jan. 31, to a median price of $2.4 million. By comparison, high end houses, rose only 1.2 per cent to $3.6 million in the same period.

But Steven Green, a sales representative with Royal LePage Partners Realty, said he expects this year will see another jump in prices. He is predicting luxury condos to rise between 10 and 15 per cent in the next 12 months and houses to surge between 2.5 and 6 per cent.

The lack of new listings has continued to drive up prices this month, said Green. As an example, he cited a case last week where six competing offers drove the selling price of a condo near Yonge Street and Lawrence Avenue up by 36 per cent beyond asking.

“There’s no supply, so there’s five people looking to buy the same kind of product right now because they had no chance of buying this one,” he said.

Green, who has several Hollywood names among his clientele, says Toronto’s luxury market is being fuelled by the return of foreign buyers since last summer.

Property buyers from Asia and the U.S. are attracted by the city’s vibrant culture and relative safety, and have adjusted to the non-resident buyers tax introduced in 2017. Prices also came down in some areas such as Bayview Avenue and York Mills Road

“They look at real estate differently than we do. We always wanted to buy a house on the quiet street. They have changed the market and pricing for some areas because they want to be buying on the major street or close to the major street because they want the action,” he said.

Prices look high to Torontonians but Green said, “We’re still undervalued for major cities around the world.”

Empty nesters are typically looking for condos in their old neighbourhoods. Condos sell in Toronto for about $1,000 per square foot, he said. Many buyers are purchasing less square footage than they might actually like but they are purchasing for the area.

“So many people are looking for 1,800 sq. ft.-plus and that’s hard to find,” said Green.

Many of those are in Yorkville, the St. Regis at Bay and Adelaide streets and the Ritz on Wellington St. W.

Among Canada’s major cities, Montreal saw the highest year-over-year price appreciation in its luxury market in the year leading to Jan. 31 with 8.5 per cent for both houses and condos. A dearth of listings is also pushing prices there, with homeowners hesitating to list for fear of not being able to find another suitable property, said Royal Lepage. The company is forecasting the median price of luxury homes there to grow by 5.5 per cent for houses and 5 per cent for condos.

The Toronto Regional Real Estate Board is predicting average Toronto home prices will rise by 10 per cent overall this year, including all houses and condos. Last year the average selling price of a resale home was 12 per cent higher year over year than 2018.

Royal LePage’s uses median home values in its different markets, in addition to company data and analytics from its sister company, RPS Real Property Solutions.

The report is based on GTA houses priced at about $3.15 million and up and condos valued at $1.7 million and higher. In Montreal, the luxury designation applies to houses costing about $1.3 million or more and condos at or above about $1.05 million.",[]

The Canadian Press





TORONTO - S.J. Green is getting a head start on CFL free agency.

The Toronto Argonauts granted the veteran American receiver's request to be released Friday. He was scheduled to become a free agent Tuesday.

“He asked for his release to pursue other opportunities,” Argos GM Mike (Pinball) Clemons said in a statement. “We grant his request with a pint of sorrow and a gallon of gratitude, and a gentle reminder that the door is still open.”

Green, 34, spent three seasons with Toronto after being acquired from the Montreal Alouettes in April 2017. He was a 1,000-yard receiver throughout his Argos' tenure and last year became the 18th player in CFL history to top 10,000 career yards.

The six-foot-two, 217-pound Green's best season with Toronto came in 2017 when he had 104 receptions for 1,462 yards and 10 TDs. He helped the Argos win a Grey Cup title that year.

Riders sign former Jaguars receiver Greene

REGINA - The Saskatchewan Roughriders signed former NFL receiver Rashad Greene on Friday.

Greene, a 2015 fifth-round pick of the Jacksonville Jaguars, appeared in 25 regular-season games with the NFL squad. The 27-year-old had 30 receptions for 185 yards and two touchdowns while also returning 41 punts for 448 yards and a TD.

Greene played collegiately at Florida State and helped the Seminoles capture the '13 BCS title. He registered 270 catches for 3,830 yards and 29 TDs, becoming the school's all-time leader in receptions and yards.

The Canadian Press





TORONTO -- The Toronto Argonauts have signed veteran American defensive back Tommie Campbell and Canadian receiver Natey Adjei.

Campbell, 32, was released by the Alouettes last week after spending two years in Montreal. He began his CFL career with the Calgary Stampeders in 2016 after five years in the NFL with Tennessee and Jacksonville.

Last season, Campbell was named a CFL East all-star after recording 66 tackles, three interceptions and two forced fumbles in 16 games.

""He's a very good fit for how we plan to play,"" said Argos vice president of player personnel John Murphy. ""What we're asking him to do, he'll ideally fit in. We know how productive he's been.""

Adjei, a native of Mississauga, Ont., spent the first two seasons of his CFL career with the Argos after being drafted 22nd overall by Toronto in the 2013 draft.

The 30-year-old Adjei spent the past four seasons with the Edmonton Eskimos, who released him recently.

Last season, Adjei set career highs in receptions (58), receiving yards (534) and touchdowns (two).

The Argos also signed American defensive lineman Obinna Iheoma and released Canadian receiver Alex Charette.

BOMBERS SIGN PAIR

WINNIPEG -- The Winnipeg Blue Bombers have signed American offensive linemen Kevin Lawrence and Jarell Broxton.

Lawrence started all 12 games in his senior year last season at Rhode Island.

Broxton is a former Big 12 all-star at Baylor. He signed with the NFL's Baltimore Ravens as an undrafted free agent in 2016, and spent most of that season on their practice roster.

If the automotive world is nearing its peak in the broadly based utility-vehicle segment, the product planners and designers at Cadillac must have missed the memo.

Slotted between the five-passenger XT5 and the eight-passenger Escalade, the XT6 has room for up to seven souls spread across three rows of seats (or six people with the optional second-row bucket seats).

The XT6 uses the XT5’s platform and is therefore built at the same Tennessee plant, along with the GMC Acadia. Although the distance between the front and rear wheels is identical for both Caddys, the XT6 is about 23 centimetres longer, six centimetres wider and 7.5 centimetres taller.

The XT6 even looks like the XT5, with an understated front-end design. The XT6’s roofline slopes to a lesser degree than the XT5’s, and the liftgate is more vertical, which helps provide third-row riders a reasonable amount of headroom and anti-claustrophobia side glass. Similar to the third rows of competing models, in the XT6. adult-sized occupants sit close to the floor with their knees pointing toward the ceiling.

The squared-off shape means 25-per cent-greater cargo capacity than the XT5, with the rear rows folded forward. With the third-row bench in use, there’s not a great deal of stowage space to be had in the XT6.

Similarities between the two models carry through to the interior where the two dashboards differ only slightly. The XT6’s unconventional gear changer takes some getting used to since you toggle, rather than shift, your selections. Beside it, a rotary dial controls the various functions (i.e. infotainment, navigation, etc.) displayed on the 20-centimetre touch-screen.

The XT6 scores points for its supportive, yet cushy seats and a whisper-quiet interior that contributes to an enjoyable first-class ride.

Pressing the starter button brings to life a 3.6-litre V-6 that’s common to the XT5 and a number of other General Motors vehicles. It’s rated at 310 horsepower and 271 pound-feet of torque. A nine-speed automatic transmission with paddle shifters directs power to the front or, optionally, all four wheels.

Fuel consumption is officially pegged at 13.5 l/10 km in the city, 9.7 l/100 km on the highway and 11.8 l/100 km combined.

According to Cadillac, it takes 6.9 seconds to launch the XT6 to 60 mph (96 km/h) from rest. That’s reasonably rapid for a vehicle weighing in the 2,000-kilogram range, not that it will matter much to most buyers. But the available power is plentiful and comes on seamlessly. The smooth-shifting transmission also reacts quickly and always seems to be in the right gear, no matter the speed or the throttle position.

Among its key features, the $64,100 (including destination charges) base Premium Luxury trim level has all-wheel-drive, tri-zone climate control, leather upholstery, power liftgate, power-folding third-row seat, panoramic sunroof and an eight-speaker Bose-brand audio system.

The XT6 Sport lists for $66,900 and has a blacked-out grille and trim, carbon-fibre interior fittings, heavy-duty cooling system, dynamic (constantly adjusting) sport suspension, and a twin-clutch rear axle. This feature allows all available torque to be directed to either outside wheel when turning (a.k.a. torque vectoring).

Options for the Premium Luxury and Sport include automatic parking assist, trailer hitch guidance (the XT6 has a 1,820-kilogram towing capacity), reverse automatic braking, head-up information display and an infrared night-vision camera that can detect and track otherwise unseen people or animals beyond headlight range.

For families with kids and/or for people requiring more cargo room, selecting the XT6 over the XT5 might be the smart play, especially when the only Cadillac wagon larger than the XT5 used to be the Escalade.

What you should know: 2020 Cadillac XT6

Type: All-wheel-drive midsize utility vehicle

Engine (h.p.): 3.6-litre DOHC V-6 (310)

Transmission: Nine-speed automatic with manual-shift mode

Market position: The XT6 joins a lengthy list of premium midsize utility vehicles that are fitted with three rows of seats and come with an assortment of luxury and safety items. Until the XT6’s arrival, it was either the XT5 or the Escalade.

Points: Design is the epitome of understated elegance. • First-rate interior appointments. • Standard V-6 delivers acceptable power but an XT6-V with a twin-turbo-V-6 would likely be a desirable option. • This is the one to get if the size and expense of a Cadillac Escalade is not to your liking.

Perhaps not since the First Sting Ray broke cover for the 1963 model year has there been a more highly anticipated Corvette.

Why? Two reasons. First, the engine is in the back and not the front, immediately making the 2020 Stingray a more exotic machine than any previous Corvette. Second, the base price is $70,000, which isn’t really exotic money.

Certainly some Corvette fans are not happy that their favourite sports car now looks like it was created in Europe and not in America, but their grumbling is drowned out by the praise.

From any angle, the new Corvette is stunning. And yes, it does look European in nature; especially the pointy nose, low hood and massive windshield. Chevrolet says their shapes were inspired by fighter jets, which is easy to see.

Other aspects of the design, however, such as the in-your-face air intakes positioned ahead of the extra-wide rear fenders, add some North American flavoring.

The rear window gives gawkers a peek at the engine bay, while the extended-length rear deck opens to reveal trunk space aft of the engine that Chevrolet says can hold two sets of golf clubs. It’s also where the removable body-coloured roof panel is stowed. Translucent and carbon-fibre panels are optional.

A smaller cargo hold in front — the frunk, as it’s called — is good for an airline-approved carry-on suitcase or a few grocery bags.

For the convertible — which costs about $9,000 more than the base coupe — the power-operated rear deck opens, clamshell-style, then the roof section retracts to rest above the engine before the deck returns to its original position. The process takes 16 seconds and can be done at vehicle speeds up to 50 km/h.

The Corvette’s interior is almost as radical as the body. The unusual steering wheel is flat on the top and the bottom and might take some getting used to. The 30-centimetre configurable instrument display and the 20-centimetre touch-screen (angled toward the driver) appear to have been influenced by hardcore video gamers. Most obvious, though, the driver is separated from the passenger by a wall topped with a lengthy row of buttons and switches almost entirely needed for the climate-control system.

As is the trend these days, switches and pushbuttons have replaced the traditional shift lever, clearly indicating that this Corvette is not available with a manual transmission. Instead, an eight-speed automatic — of the rapid-shift, dual-clutch variety — with paddle shifters handles the gear swapping and hooks to a 6.2-litre V-8 that punches out 490 horsepower and 470 pound-feet of torque. The drive system has six modes, with engine and transmission settings ranging from cruising (soft) to sporting (firm), according to driver preference.

Chevrolet says the Corvette can reach 60 mph (96 km/h) from rest in less than three seconds, which is about as quick (or quicker) than the most powerful seventh-generation front-engine Corvette (the 755-horse ZR1).

KEEP READING: 2020 Nissan Pathfinder keeps moving forward

Part of the credit goes to rear weight bias of the new car (which means more traction), but to pull off that time you’ll need the optional launch control. Just keep the throttle floored and the system releases the brakes, immediately dispatching the Stingray with barely a hint of wheelspin.

The extra cost should be no problem considering the Stingray’s shockingly low $70,000 starting price (coupe), which includes destination charges. That gets you plenty of content, but along with launch control, most enthusiasts will likely shell out a bit more for the Z51 Performance Package. It includes bigger brakes with cooling outlets, performance suspension and rear-axle ratio, and a performance exhaust system that adds five horsepower.

Other options include an electronic limited-slip differential, rearview mirror/camera, upgraded interior appointments (including a choice of two front-seat designs) and magnetic ride-control shock absorbers that instantly and constantly adjust to road conditions and driver inputs.

Given its wild styling, hot performance and even hotter price, the 2020 Corvette Stingray is understandably in high demand. Deliveries begin soon, but that’s likely just the beginning as higher performing models will come on stream with more exotic power and looks. And likely at a price that’s still not exotic.

What you should know: 2020 Chevrolet Corvette Stingray

Type: Two-door, rear-wheel-drive midengine sport coupe/convertible

Engine (h.p.): 6.2-litre OHV V-8 (490/495)

Transmission: Eight-speed automated manual

Market position: For the first time in its six-decade-plus history, the Corvette has the engine behind the seats instead of in front, pointing the way to a whole new future for the car as it severs ties to the past.

Points: Stunning design also comes with a dash of practicality. • Ground-breaking interior has an almost singular focus on the driver. • Non-turbo overhead valve V-8 has been a Chevrolet staple for years. • Some enthusiasts will be saddened by the lack of a manual transmission. • Look for future more versions that stretch the performance envelope.

Active safety: Blind-spot warning with cross-traffic backup alert (std.); active cruise control (n.a.); emergency braking (n.a.); pedestrian detection (n.a.)

1465,theprogress,https://www.theprogress.com/autos/5-ways-to-improve-your-car-fuel-efficiency/,5 ways to improve your car fuel efficiency – Chilliwack Progress,'Feb.',2020-02-19,"Among constant travels and peaking gas prices, improving fuel efficiency can be a top priority

Among constant travels, errands, and peaking gas prices, improving fuel efficiency is on the top of the list for many. We referred to Natural Resources Canada for some tips on fuel efficiency.

1. Check the tire pressure

Driving a vehicle with under-inflated tires of 8 pounds per square inch can increase fuel consumption by 4 per cent. Be sure to find the right tire pressure for your vehicle.

2. Remove the bicycle racks

Aerodynamic drag like bike or roof racks can increase your aerodynamic drag by 20 per cent on the highway. Always best to avoid carrying extra weight because the less your car weighs the less fuel it will use.

3. Avoid idling

The average 3-litre vehicle consumes over a cup of fuel every 10 minutes of idling according to Natural Resources Canada. Turn your engine off if you have stopped for more than a minute except in traffic.

4.Accelerate gently

Ease on to the pedal gently. To be extra cautious take 5 seconds to accelerate your vehicle to 20km/h from a stop.

5. Combine trips

Constantly hitting the road with a cold engine is not the best solution for fuel-efficiency. Longer rides help your engine warm up to its fuel-efficient temperature. Plan your route to avoid rush hour and get the tasks done in a single outing.

1466,theprogress,https://www.theprogress.com/autos/2020-amg-c43-wagon-and-sedan-are-true-benchmarks/,2020 AMG C43 Wagon and Sedan are true benchmarks – Chilliwack Progress,'Feb.',2020-02-18,"Even more intriguing is the fact that the C43 wagon is only offered in Canada and not the US

The styling is showing its age but the C43 line up is still a handsome bunch (Submitted)

While the Mercedes-Benz’ C-class has always been a top compact vehicle for Mercedes – often beating BMW’s 3-series and Audi’s A4s in comparison tests – it’s the AMG-influenced C43s and C63s that are the true stars in the lineup.

These higher performance vehicles have created a niche in the same way “M” series (for BMW) and “S” or “RS” series (for Audi) have in the ever competitive performance market. While many people might still associate BMWs as the “driver’s car,” it’s actually the Mercedes these days that seem to provide all around better performance.

In fact, driving the BMW, Audi and Mercedes back to back reveal that the sweet spot in this market is the Mercedes C43, because it has just right amount of performance and features for a surprisingly reasonable price, at least for a so called performance segment.

Even more intriguing is the fact that the C43 wagon is only offered in Canada and not the US – likely because Canadians don’t mind purchasing wagons while Americans seems to avoid them like the plague.

Yes you can also buy the significantly more expensive C63s but personally, I find that the C43 is the better day-to-day vehicle that provides performance without sacrificing comfort and refinement. The C63 is all-powerful but it’s awkward to drive in traffic-heavy towns and cities we live in.

If you are wondering why anyone would buy the C43 wagon over the GLC 43 sporty utility vehicle (which shares the similar platform), it’s because the lower and more stable C43 actually performs better than the taller GLC 43. The GLC 43 might offer more space here and there, but the C43 wagon is the winner here. The C43 also comes in a coupe format, but our focus of the review is the sedan and the wagon.

Design and Features

The styling is showing its age but the C43 line up is still a handsome bunch. The C43 comes with a special AMG-style front grille and air intake system. The rear of the vehicle offers a quad-tip exhaust system and if you opt for the sedan, there is also a small and inconspicuous spoiler.

The 2020 AMG C43 is all about personalization: a new 64-colour ambient lighting system is a great example of this.

Along with the signature AMG instrumentation, the dashboard is modern and sleek. Rocker switches replace most buttons in the console and the infotainment system is a generous 10.5-inch size. The Burmester sound system offers amazing sound and audio quality.

The cargo capacity in the back of the wagon version is quite good: between 460 litres and 1,480 litres when the back seats are folded down.

Standard in the AMG C43 are a number of safety features including Crosswind Assist, Blind Spot Assist, Attention Assist, Active Brake Assist, Vehicle Exit Warning, multiple air bags and something known as PRE-SAFE. PRE-SAFE is a feature that will detect when a rollover or collision is imminent, and act to create to avoid injury. This includes tightening of the front seatbelts, closing the windows and sunroof and adjustment of the passenger seats.

Performance

The 2020 AMG C43 is a vehicle that is designed specifically for driving performance. The C43 sedan is a wonderful model but once again, I am drawn to the unique C43 wagon.

One of the main benefits of a wagon over an SUV is the lower centre of gravity – a wagon will provide much better handling in a similar circumstances. Speaking of a lower centre of gravity, the ground clearance for the C43 is just under 9 cm or 3.5 inches, meaning the vehicle sits precariously close to the ground.

The AMG C43’s biturbo 3.0-litre V6 engine creates an impressive 385 horsepower and 384 lb-ft. of torque. The engine is punchy, responsive and can accelerate the car from 0 to 100 km/h in just 4.8 seconds. Paired to the engine is a 9-speed AMG SPEEDSHIFT TCT transmission with shift paddles that can downshift multiple gears with a double-click of the paddle.

There are multiple drive modes including Comfort, Slippery, Sport+, as well as a personalized mode the driver can set up individually. Driving the AMG C43 around curves is easy thanks to adaptive damping and the suspension that incorporates three-stage electronically-maneuvered shock absorbers.

The 2020 AMG C43 is reasonably lightweight (1,760 kilograms) and corners exceptionally well thanks to a 69% rear-axle torque bias. The brakes on this vehicle feature large, 360-mm multi-piston front calipers that help spread out the heat of braking.

Overall, the Audi S4 compares favorably but the C43 feels more updated and advanced. The BMW 3-series may have been the standard in earlier years but these days the 3-series struggle from steering feel that is disconnected from the driver.

Fuel economy for the C43 is 8.9 L/100km for highway driving and 12.4 L/100km for the city. The limited warranty that comes with the C43 also only covers 4 years or 80,000 km.

Summary

The starting price for the 2020 Mercedes-Benz AMG C43 Sedan is $59,900, and the Wagon lists at $60,900. While there are no additional trim levels, add-ons quickly bring up the total price on both models.

The premium package alone is an extra $5,900 but adds 17 additional features including foot-activated tailgate, keyless entry, 360 degree camera, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, Active Parking assist as well as others. Heads-up display costs a cool $1,500 while adding on climate comfort seats will set you back another $1,200. The Intelligent Drive Package with safety features will cost $2,700.

I’m in love with the C43 wagon, but wagon or sedan, the C43 delivers performance and smoothness that are truly world-class.

For those looking to preserve or share their their images, digital photographic services are a great solution, says Carsten Arnold from Carmel Studios.

Chilliwack’s Carsten Arnold is used to seeing years of family history come his way.

In albums, loose in photo boxes, or slide trays, families can have thousands of photographs hidden away in cabinets, closets or bookshelves. For those looking to preserve those images, share them with others, and even make them more accessible, Carsten’s Carmel Studios has the solution: digital photographic services.

“Families have so many old photos and don’t know how to deal with them – they want to preserve their memories, share them, and pass them down,” Carsten says, highlighting the possibilities of digital scanning, editing and restoration provided by Carmel Studios.

By scanning those cherished images, they become much easier to share, or to be used to create beautiful artwork. And, it’s not only those albums of printed photographs that can be scanned – Carsten works with slides, negatives and even Polaroids, capturing and preserving your family’s memories for years to come. If you’re an artist and need to digitize your original artwork, Carmel Studios also has the specialized equipment to accurately reproduce it, no matter what size.

Preserving and presenting your history

If you have many images to choose from, Carsten will help you explore and realize your goals, whether that’s selecting a single image to enlarge and print, for example, or preserving your family’s entire photographic story.

When photos have faded or weathered with time, Carsten’s many years of Photoshop wizardry can restore your precious memories to their original look, or they can be edited to suit your needs.

And when you want to showcase a favourite image, Carmel Studios can help with state-of-the-art printing, on photo paper or canvas for larger prints.

“With older photos, when the image is a little grainy or not in the best focus, canvas can be more forgiving,” Carsten explains. Prefer a more creative approach? He can even apply “photographic artistry” to your favourites and give them a whole new look. “There are so many creative and stylistic ways to make your images stand out.”

Sharing a photographer’s eye

Complementing Carsten Arnold’s scanning and restoration expertise is his talent as a photographer.

In addition to award-winning architectural, interiors, food, and product photography, Carsten thrives in the Fraser Valley’s natural landscapes, capturing its beauty and creating breathtaking stylized nature images.

“Photography is not always about the literal expression of reality,” reflects Carsten, whose large-format canvas prints are sold at Decor West Interiors in Chilliwack, Canwest Galleries in Harrison, and online at the Carmel Studios’ digital gallery.

Take the stress out of home shopping by planning ahead

Nathan Janzen has always been in the business of helping people.

Over nearly two decades in financial services he’s learned a lot about everything from residential financing to small-business loans, commercial buy-outs and agriculture equipment financing, but the bigger lesson was more personal.

“Working for banks allowed me to reflect on who I want to be and who I want to represent,” Nathan says.

He realized he cared most about the financial wellbeing of his clients, and didn’t like the pressure to cross-sell chequing accounts and credit cards. Now that he’s self-employed as a mortgage broker, he works for you — not the bank.

Make a date with your mortgage broker

Nathan says the first step of any home purchase is a visit with your mortgage broker. Whether you’re a first-time buyer or already own a home, you don’t want to fall in love with a property only to have the application process fall through.

“It’s always good to know where you stand and know what’s possible.”

With that in mind, Nathan shares three tips to empower borrowers and simplify the application experience:

1. Know your budget – Dig into your finances and get a solid sense of your monthly income and expenses to help you decide what kind of monthly payment you’re comfortable carrying.

“Don’t forget to include things like property taxes, heating costs and, potentially, strata fees when making your budget,” Nathan says.

2. Know your credit score – It’s a good idea to review your credit report annually to make sure there are no surprises. Some clients assume their credit’s fantastic but discover a long-forgotten event is affecting their rating. By checking your score annually, you’ll have a good sense of where you stand and won’t be scrambling for extra documentation at the last minute.

“Many people don’t realize that you can call and talk with the credit provider if an item is reporting incorrectly on your credit report or even ask for forgiveness on one-off late payments. All of which can improve your score,” Nathan says.

When buying his first house years ago, Nathan learned of a reporting error that was affecting his credit score. His credit report included a chequing account that a financial institution forgot to properly close.

“If I’d checked my credit earlier, my home purchase wouldn’t have been delayed.”

3. Know your documents – Knowing who to ask and where to look for documents takes time, so Nathan recommends organizing your paperwork before you start house hunting. “It may take time to figure out whether the documents you need are hiding in a filing cabinet or an email,” Nathan says.

It’s less stressful to track down documents from your accountant, employer, filing cabinets and emails before your dream house hits the market.

Reach out to Nathan today to learn more about the mortgage process by calling 778-549-0331, emailing nathan@mynetworth.ca or using the two minute application at networthservices.ca

Are you prepared?

Regardless of your income, learning how to prepare for tax season is key to ensuring you’re getting the most from your return.

Get organized: Your tax filing deadline may still be a way off, but there’s no time like now to start collecting everything you’ll need, starting with your income statements, such as T4s, self-employed income and investment income.

Sort your receipts: Particularly applicable for those who own their own business, with any luck, you’ve been sorting receipts throughout the year. But if busy schedules – or procrastination – has got the best of your best-laid plans, you still have time to get prepared! Try to keep all receipts in one place, ideally separated into different types of expenses, such as office equipment, utilities, meals and transportation. As an added bonus of your early organization, you’ll have lots of time to chase down missing receipts!

Decide how you’ll file: So, do you tackle your taxes on your own, or hire a tax professional? For those with a straightforward tax situation without a lot of deductions, today’s software can make it pretty simple. Employers will have already factored your taxes into your paycheques, so you’re unlikely to have huge surprises. But for a more complicated return, a tax professional can help make sense of those deductions.

Know the rules for claiming dependents: Claiming children and other dependents can be tricky, especially if you welcomed your first child in 2019 – thinking about claiming your child on your taxes is likely the last thing on your mind! This might be a good opportunity to consult a tax professional to ensure you’re claiming dependents properly, and hopefully get a little financial relief to make the cost of kids a little more manageable.

Don’t forget your deadlines: Your deadline to file as a Canadian taxpayer is April 30, or June 15 if you or your spouse is self-employed. Simple enough, right? It’s surprisingly easy to forget to file your taxes, but that can bring significant consequences, especially if you owe money on your return. Make it impossible for you to forget your tax filing deadline by:

Marking it on your calendar

Setting a reminder alarm on your phone

Writing your deadline on a notecard and putting it on the fridge, bathroom mirror, or anywhere you’ll see it every day

Setting mini goals and deadlines for each step of the tax preparation process

Options if you owe

Avoiding filing your taxes because you may not have enough money to pay what you owe? Options to cover your tax bill include a repayment plan with the government or a short-term option like an online payday loan from MyCanadaPayday.com – easy and secure.

“Our one-page online loan application will have you on your way in minutes, while our team takes care of the rest,” says Sundeep Thind, manager of MyCanadaPayday’s Surrey office. “We are Canada’s fully licensed, online payday loan specialists, and we’re happy to help you take care of that unexpected bill, so you can get back on track.”

While the daily case count announcements from provincial health authorities are the most eye-catching figures, there's other important numbers beyond newly confirmed cases, including hospitalizations and testing data.

This page will be updated daily as new information on Alberta, Canada and international cases of COVID-19 is made available.

Starting the week of June 29, the province will provide daily data updates Monday through Friday and not on weekends and holidays.

Follow the links below or scroll down to see how the COVID-19 situation is changing in Alberta as the pandemic continues.

HOW IS COVID-19 GROWING IN ALBERTA?

The province's daily case count announcement is among the most prominent COVID-19 statistics.

The number of new cases represents the number of patients who are newly infected with the coronavirus. The number of active cases in the province can go up or down depending on the number of new recoveries on a given day.

The above graph divides active cases into those who are sick, but not in hospital, and those patients requiring hospitalization. Hospitalized patients are further divided by those getting care in and out of intensive care units.

Recoveries are defined by Alberta Health Services as follows:

A return to health after 14 days of isolation for those with COVID-19 but who experienced only mild symptoms.

If hospitalized due to COVID-19, anyone who does not require additional hospitalization or treatment in the 10 days after they left the hospital.

If tested, such as a health care worker, two negative tests at least 24 hours apart.

Daily case counts include both lab-confirmed and probable cases. The case count for a given day is sometimes revised to more accurately reflect probable cases that were either later confirmed or determined not to be related to COVID-19.

WHERE IS COVID-19 HITTING ALBERTA THE HARDEST?

Since early April, the province has provided a geographic breakdown for both its five health zones as well as individual cities and community-level subzones within those cities.

Alberta Health Services divides the province into five health zones: Calgary, Central, Edmonton, North and South.

A map of those zones can be seen here, and it's important to note that the Edmonton and Calgary zones cover an area significantly bigger than the cities they are named after.

Sizable daily jumps in the new number of cases can't necessarily be attributed to the virus growing, as testing volume and reporting time also influence the data.

For more local data, the province's COVID-19 statistics page has an interactive map showing cases by city and community.

HOW MANY COVID-19 PATIENTS ARE IN HOSPITAL?

Tracking hospitalizations is an important indicator of how severely pandemic is affecting Albertans as well as how the coronavirus is taxing the province's health care system.

Alberta has the capacity for 295 intensive care unit beds and nearly 8,500 total beds, according to the province's modelling released in April.

So far, the number of hospitalizations and ICU admissions have both remained well below those maximum capacities.

Hospitalization data is often retroactively updated by the province as individual hospitals report data at varying times and speeds.

HOW IS ALBERTA TESTING FOR COVID-19?

Alberta has been the top province in Canada measured by per capita COVID-19 testing since near the start of the pandemic.

The province has now administered more than 500,000 tests Albertans.

It's important to distinguish between test volume (number of tests completed) and number of people tested as patients can be tested more than once.

The province has made seven notable shifts in testing policy.

March 23: The province announced testing was being focused on at-risk populations and health care workers. At the same time, testing returning travellers was deprioritized to only those showing symptoms.

April 7: Testing is opened to any symptomatic individuals in the Calgary Zone, which had seen significant spikes in cases in March and April.

April 13: Testing was expanded to any Albertan with symptoms consistent with the coronavirus.

April 17: The province announced it would start testing all staff and residents of continuing care facilities for COVID-19 regardless of whether or not they show symptoms.​

May 4: The testing criteria was expanded again to include anyone exeperiencing headache, muscle or joint aches, fatigue or severe exhaustion, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, unexplained loss of appetite, loss of sense of smell or taste, or pink eye.

May 11: The province opened testing to asymptomatic residents of the Calgary zone who work outside their home. Testing is to be done on a first-come, first-serve basis for up to 1,000 asymptomatic residents each day. The policy was in place until May 18.

May 29: The province announces all Albertans, including those who are asymptomatic, were eligible to be tested.

HOW IS COVID-19 BEING SPREAD IN ALBERTA?

The province divides the ways COVID-19 is being spread into three categories: travel-related cases, spread via a known source, and spread via an unknown source, or community transmission.

Initially, travel-related cases were responsible for many of Alberta's new COVID-19 cases. But since travel restrictions came into effect, the number of travel-related cases has largely flattened since early April.

Close contact with individuals known to be carrying the virus remains the most common way of spreading COVID-19 in Alberta.

Suspected community transmitted cases, where the carrier isn't immediately known, are an important indicator of how the coronavirus is spreading in a community as well as how successful measures like physical distancing have been in limiting transmission.

Identified cases are investigated by AHS and classified into one of the three categories. The classification can change pending further investigation.

WHICH AGE GROUPS HAVE BEEN MOST SUSCEPTIBLE TO COVID-19?

Since the onset of the pandemic, COVID-19 has affected the elderly more than other age groups as seen in high death and active case counts.

But, younger age groups are not immune, and by mid-June, cases among Albertans under the age of 40 had risen to form a majority of all active cases in the province.

HOW DOES COVID-19'S GROWTH IN ALBERTA COMPARE TO ELSEWHERE?

Conclusions drawn from comparing provinces are somewhat limited by widely differing testing volumes and practices among provinces, but the raw data does allow from some contrast.

The above graphs rank provinces by the number of tests they administer and how many confirmed cases they have, both adjusted to per 10,000 population of their respective province.

Tests are also not without their own biases. More tests will produce more positives, and it's easier to test everyone in a less populous province.

Rates adjusted for population provide a snapshot of the COVID-19 situation on any given day, but experts say the growth of the virus, which is unrelated to population size, is also an important indicator of future trends.

The below graphs display Alberta's coronavirus curve alongside other provinces and other countries. Both use a logarithmic scale to better depict the exponential growth of COVID-19.",[]

If that major and unprecedented moment in Canadian politics occurs, Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland would become Canada’s acting prime minister.

That’s according to an official order made on March 13, the day that Trudeau’s office announced that his wife Sophie had tested positive for COVID-19.

The prime minister remains in self-isolation but on Monday Trudeau said he and his children remain symptom-free, while his wife’s symptoms are mild.

Trudeau has been working from home, chairing cabinet meetings, holding regular public addresses, and participating in international calls with world leaders from his home office.

“In the event that the Prime Minister is unable to perform the functions of his office,” a threshold left undefined, Freeland would take charge, reads the order issued by the Privy Council Office.

In line with public health advice, Trudeau has not been tested for COVID-19 as he is not symptomatic, but given the rapid and concerning spread, the federal cabinet has been given instructions on the roles they’d play if the situation evolved.

Following Freeland, the next five ministers in line are based on seniority: Veterans Affairs Minister Lawrence MacAulay; Indigenous Services Minister Carolyn Bennett; President of the Privy Council Dominic LeBlanc; Industry Minister Navdeep Bains; and Finance Minister Bill Morneau.

The order also goes on to outline how ministerial roles would shift to see all portfolios covered should Freeland become Canada’s acting prime minister, or if other ministers are no longer able to do their jobs.

If Freeland takes on Trudeau’s job, LeBlanc would become deputy prime minister, for example. Should federal Health Minister Patty Hajdu be unable to fulfill her duties, Bennett, who is a doctor, would take on that job.",[]

514,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/tax-season-5-costly-mistakes-to-avoid-this-year-1.4844543,Income tax: Common mistakes made on tax returns,'Nicole Bogart',2020-03-09,"TORONTO -- When most people think about making a mistake on their tax return, their fears often revolve around checking the wrong box or missing key facts that might lead the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) to audit them.

But, according to experts, the costliest tax mistakes made by Canadians are usually related to missed deductions and a lack of understanding about whether they need to file.

Here are five costly mistakes to avoid when putting together your return this year:

NOT FILING AT ALL

If you didn’t make a single dime during the tax year, failing to file a tax return will only leadto more money being left on the table.

“One of the most common mistakes is not filing because you don’t think you have enough income, or you didn’t have an income at all,” Lisa Gittens, senior tax professional at H&R Block, told CTVNews.ca by phone earlier this month.

“As long as you are living in Canada you should be filing.”

According to Gittens, students, young adults, stay-at-home parents and the unemployed are the most prone to this mistake, which prevents them from claiming certain tax credits and benefits that all Canadians are entitled to, regardless of their income bracket.

This includes the Canada child benefit, the universal child care benefit, and the GST/HST credit, and provincial credits like the Climate Action Incentive. Keep in mind that both parents must file a tax return in order to receive the Canada child benefit.

You can also claim things like medical expenses, educational expenses, and child care expenses if you didn’t make any income. And, as Gittens notes, the more expenses you can write off, the greater chance you'll get a refund.

Gittens notes that it’s especially important for students to file their returns in order to build credit with the CRA.

“Many students don’t file because they have no income, but once they graduate and start earning income, they have no credit with the CRA,” she explained.

NOT CLAIMING MEDICAL EXPENSES

Medical expenses not covered by provincial health services or benefits plans are another commonly neglected area, especially for low- and middle-income Canadians.

“When your medical expenses are high in comparison to your income you get a medical expense supplement that refunds a portion of the medical expenses you claimed,” said Gittens.

This type of expense can include eye exams, dental expenses not covered by insurance, medical supplies and travel expenses. This year, certain cannabis products are now considered eligible for the medical expense tax credit, if you have a prescription.

You can claim your total eligible medical expenses, minus three per cent of your income or the set maximum for the tax year ($2,352), whichever is less.

For future tax years, Gittens recommends completing all of your miscellaneous medical exams and yearly check-ups towards the end of the year to capitalize on the return and make it easier to organize your receipts.

“When you get all of those eye exams and dental exams taken care of at the end of the year the receipts are all there for you to claim on your taxes,” she said.

MISREPORTING INCOME FROM YOUR SIDE JOB

Whether you are making extra money by driving an Uber, hosting people at your Airbnb, or earning a little side cash online, you want to make sure you are recording those earnings as self-employed income.

“You’ll want to be sure that you’re also contributing to the Canada Pension Plan based on those earnings,” notes Gittens.

If you plan on claiming any expenses related to that income (i.e. expenses related to your vehicle, house, or travel expenses), make sure that you have the receipts to back it up.

MISSING INVESTMENT INCOME

Before filing, make note of your investment streams and make sure you have received a statement for each of them. These annual statements should show the total income you earned during the tax year and the total expenses incurred, such as investment adviser fees (which are deductible).

“Income sometimes gets missed because people don’t understand how much they’ve earned on their investments each year,” Armando Minicucci, tax specialist at Grant Thornton, told CTVNews.ca by phone.

“This is generally the most common area where individual tax payers are reassessed.”

FILING TOO EARLY

The early bird doesn’t always get the worm, especially when it comes to taxes.

“Those early filers who are hoping to get their refunds right away tend to miss certain documents, whether it be T4’s from their employers or investment slips from the bank,” Michael Davis, senior tax specialist at H&R Block, told CTVNews.ca by phone.

Not only could this cause you to make an amendment to your return, it could put you at risk of incurring penalties for misreporting your income if you make a habit of it.

“If you fail to report the same kind of income in back-to-back years it could result in penalties,” said Davis.

April 30 is the last day to file your 2019 income tax return. If you owe the CRA money, it must be paid by this date. Otherwise, you’ll face a late-filing penalty and daily interest chargeson your balance.

If you are self-employed, you have until June 15 to file your return. But keep in mind that if you owe taxes, you’ll still be required to pay your balance by the April 30 deadline.",[]
515,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/the-cra-has-completely-redesigned-the-t1-personal-income-tax-return-form-1.4821920,The CRA has completely redesigned the T1 Personal Income Tax return form,'Nicole Bogart',2020-03-02,"TORONTO -- Your income tax package has an entirely new look this year thanks to the Canada Revenue Agency’s decision to revamp the T1 Personal Income Tax return form.

The T1 General Form, also known as the Income Tax and Benefit Return, is the main document used to file your personal income taxes and acts as a summary of all the other forms you complete for your income taxes.

Depending on how you’ve filed your tax return in years past, you might be familiar with the general layout of the form.

But during the 2020 tax season the form will look quite different – most notably, doubling in size.

WHAT IS A T1 GENERAL FORM?

The T1 is used to summarize all of the other forms you complete for your income taxes.

It shows your provincial tax (except in Quebec), total income, net income, tax payable, deductions, and non-refundable credits.

When you file your taxes, this form is used to apply for things such as the Canada Child Benefit, or the GST/HST credit.

If you file your taxes online using tax software, you may not recognize the name of the T1 form because it’s often filled out automatically.

“If you use tax software or go to your tax professional all of the calculations are done in the background,” Lisa Gittens, senior tax professional at H&R Block, told CTVNews.ca by phone.

“The purpose [of the redesign] was to simplify the preparation and that process has already been simplified if you’re using online software.”

In other words, unless you are dedicated to filing your taxes by pen and paper, you won’t even notice the change.

WHAT’S DIFFERENT?

As the CRA puts it, “Your income tax package has a new look.”

The first thing you will likely notice is that the form has doubled in size from four pages to eight. Additionally, some of the line numbers that were previously three or four digits long are now five digits long.

The CRA notes that the form has been updated to include the use of plain language “where possible,” reduce the number of forms, update worksheets to simplify certain calculations, and increase font size and white space.

The form now also includes the calculation of federal tax.

“Most Canadians aren’t going to notice much of a difference, other than the extra pages and new line numbers,” Armando Minicucci, tax specialist at Grant Thornton, told CTVNews.ca.

“Two of the new pages are from adding the non-refundable tax schedule to the form.”

Page one of the form still asks for your basic personal information, such as your name, address, e-mail address, province of residency, marital status and information about your spouse or partner.

The second page now asks whether you have any income that is exempt under the Indian Act. If you do, you will not be required to complete the T90 form, “Income Exempt under the Indian Act.”

The rest of the T1 form requires the same information as previous years, including various deductions such as RRSP contributions and child-care expenses, the calculation of your net income and your taxable income.

Gittens notes that the calculation of these reductions is the most important part of the T1 form and remains completely unchanged from previous years.

The remainder of the form is dedicated to calculating your federal tax.

April 30 is the last day to file your 2019 income tax return. If you owe the Canada Revenue Agency money, it must be paid by this date. Otherwise, you’ll face a late-filing penalty and daily interest charges on your balance.

Other changes to CRA services this tax year include a new online tool that allows you to check the estimated processing time for your tax return and other tax-related requests, and the ability to pay your balance via PayPal.

551,ctvnews,https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/diy-ideas-to-keep-your-kids-entertained-at-home-during-the-covid-19-pandemic-1.4868512,DIY ideas to keep your kids entertained at home during the COVID-19 pandemic,,2020-03-25,"TORONTO -- With most Toronto residents staying at home and indoors, it can be difficult to keep kids entertained during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Many parents, however, are getting creative, including Sepideh Coady, a mother of two young children.

“Right now we’re not going to the playground. We have to accept it,” Coady tells CTV News Toronto. “And we have to use whatever we have at home to keep them engaged and keep them moving.”

Coady is a yoga and pilates instructor, and has found a way to include her kids, ages two and four, in the physical activity.

“I’m telling you, it’s not easy. It’s challenging,” Coady said. “But I’m getting used to working out with them around me. And sometimes, engaging them. The more I engage them, the happier they are and they learn.”

One of the DIY (do-it-yourself) activities Coady came up with for her kids is an obstacle course in the living room, using items already in the house.

“I had these leftover cups from their birthday, and yesterday I thought, ‘let’s do some obstacle training!’” Coady said, laughing. “We’re connecting, we’re doing something together, and it’s a successful experience.”

Coady says that other activities she’s hoping to take on with her children in the coming weeks range from cooking to cleaning together.

“We have lots of time,” she says. “At the end, they’re happy, they’re entertained and they learn some life skills.”

Quieter DIY activities

When it’s time for some quieter activities, like arts and crafts, DIY expert Denise Wild says parents can make learning tools on their own.

“You can even have kids help you make these tools, and that way they’re crafting and creating and getting involved with their own education,” Wild said. “Use what you have at home, or search online. Pinterest is a great source for ideas and inspiration, and there are so many learning downloads right now that are available for free to use.”

Wild has the following DIY activity ideas for different age groups:

Pre-schooler: A mindfulness tub

“You create a little bin with lots of little goodies to help your child learn to regulate their emotions, whether you’ve got flash cards, maybe it’s Playdoh, some beads, puzzles and books. Anything that you can either do with your child, or your child can do on their own,” says Wild.

Kindergartener: A binder of printables

“If you just go online and even search ‘free learning printables’ or free learning downloads, you’ll find a lot of really great stuff,” says Wild. “If you put them into plastic sleeves, you can use a dry erase marker so that you can do the project over and over again.”

Elementary school student: Creative writing prompts

“So for older kids you can come up with questions and engage them in conversation. Encourage them to be thinking differently,” Wild explains. “I’ve got something that says ‘who do you admire?’, ‘if you could travel in time where would you go?’, and these are great for just discussing as a family or for having your child work on their creative writing.”",[]

697,thestar,https://www.thestar.com/business/2020/03/19/bully-offers-eclipse-coronavirus-woes-in-canadas-home-market.html,‘Bully offers’ eclipse coronavirus woes in Canada’s home market,'Natalie Obiko Pearson',2020-03-19,"A week into a pandemic that has forced a swath of Canada’s economy to shut down and wiped hundreds of billions of dollars off the nation’s stock market, a Vancouver mansion sold for $150,000 over the asking price.

As the coronavirus upends the real estate business, along with everything else, the country’s indefatigable buyers are taking some pause — but, so far, not much.

John Pasalis’ firm was getting ready to list a $1.1 million home in Toronto’s trendy Leslieville district next week but was pre-empted by two “bully” offers — those made ahead of the official selling date. A deal was struck before the property ever hit the market.

“Some of those buyers are seeing the slowdown as a way to compete without too many people,” said Pasalis, president of Realosophy Realty.

Before the virus landed in Canada, its three biggest markets — Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver — were gearing up for a sizzling house-hunting season this spring. That outlook has now dimmed.

Home resales are expected to fall in the coming weeks as the economy contracts. Agencies are cancelling open houses, and a traditionally face-to-face industry is using virtual tours to get some deals done.

In addition, new home construction and renovations will take a hit. Toronto said Wednesday it was suspending all but emergency issues of building permits as city facilities are closed.

An extended drop in Canada’s housing market would be a major blow to an economy already reeling from the meltdown in oil prices. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, the Bank of Canada and the country’s biggest commercial banks are pulling out all the stops to try and head off a serious recession.

The central bank has now cut interest rates a full percentage point to 0.75 per cent in the past two weeks, spurring mortgage rates lower, and it may cut again. The banking regulator is loosening bank capital requirements to free up $300 billion of lending capacity.

Meanwhile, Canada’s six biggest lenders, including Royal Bank of Canada, Bank of Montreal and Toronto-Dominion Bank, said they would consider six-month mortgage-payment deferrals for small businesses and individual borrowers impacted by the pandemic.

In the longer run, relentless demand means any pullback will likely be short-lived and prices should hold up, said Robert Hogue, senior economist at RBC.

“In all likelihood, this will be a temporary hit with a rebound taking place later this year once the COVID-19 situation settles down — though the timing and magnitude of the rebound are highly uncertain at this point,” Hogue said in a research note this week.

Immigration bump

Re/Max, one of the nation’s biggest brokerages, on Tuesday urged its 18,000 brokers across the country to cancel all open houses. In Vancouver, developers are closing sales centres and construction sites will be impacted as building activity is interrupted, according to Anne McMullin, president of the Urban Development Institute, an industry group.

But underpinning the market is the fastest pace population growth in 30 years, driven in large part by immigration, and the appeal of Canadian real estate to those with cash to deploy at uncertain times, including foreign buyers.

In Montreal, a New-York based buyer just made an offer on a property listed at more than two million after a virtual visit, said Debby Doktorczyk, owner of Engel & Volkers Montreal, which counts 175 brokers.

Momentum helps. The housing market entered the spring selling season on a high, with sales across the country up 25 per cent from February 2019. Toronto and Vancouver home resales surged about 44 per cent from the same month a year ago, while Montreal’s were up about 23 per cent.

The market was extremely strong — if not a bit “crazy” — before the pandemic, says Doktorczyck. Now, “instead of getting 15 offers for a property, we’re getting five,” she said, adding virtual visits are likely to become more common.

Market oxygen

Even in Vancouver, which was only just emerging from its worst year in decades before the coronavirus, Royal LePage broker Adil Dinani says his shop is still doing 90 per cent of the deals expected.

Dinani was up past midnight negotiating the sale of a $2.3 million, six-bedroom home in an affluent suburb just outside Vancouver. The open house on Sunday had drawn 40 groups — some 85 eager buyers undeterred by the virus — who waited to enter one group at a time. The property drew seven offers, including the winner — an all-cash bid, almost $150,000 above asking.

While open houses may be suspended, home buyers can still see homes by appointment, say agents. Meanwhile falling mortgage rates will act as a spur. Borrowers can now get a five-year variable mortgage at 2.1 per cent and a three-year fixed at 1.99 per cent, according to RateSpy.com.

“You know the saying — oxygen for any real estate market is low interest rates,” said Dinani at Royal LePage in Vancouver. “Well interest rates just got lower. There’s a lot more room to move in Canada. That prime rate can come down more, unlike the U.S. and other nations that are pretty much operating near zero.”",[]
768,thestar,https://www.thestar.com/sponsored_sections/alternative-homeownership/2020/03/31/a-land-lease-faq.html,A land lease FAQ,'Min. Read',2020-03-31,"Land lease is an affordable home ownership model that allows people to own a home without buying the land. While land lease is a well-established home ownership model in many countries, it is less well-known in Canada.

Parkbridge’s land lease communities are particularly attractive for young families looking to buy their first home and for retirees looking to free up money for life’s other priorities while still continuing to maintain and build equity. Parkbridge is a leading Canadian developer and owner-operator of land lease communities, with 55+ communities in Canada.

As Parkbridge continues to grow, it’s helping Canadians better understand how land lease works and why the option can be beneficial. Here are some frequently asked questions about land lease. To learn more, visit parkbridge.com.

Q: Is buying a home in a land lease community like buying a traditional home?

Yes! Buyers work with a real estate agent and lawyer and obtain financing as required before closing the purchase and sale agreement. Those wishing to buy a home in a Parkbridge community must make an application with the community management team and then sign a site lease. Parkbridge recommends you complete this application and have it approved before finalizing any home purchase.

Q: How do I get a mortgage on a home in a land lease community?

Homeowners in Parkbridge communities work with mortgage brokers and financial institutions to obtain financing with Canada’s major banks and credit unions. Thanks to industry awareness efforts in recent years, financing on land lease homes is now broadly available at many financial institutions and credit unions across Canada.

Q: Do homes in land lease communities increase in value?

As with other forms of home ownership, appreciation value depends on a number of factors, like location and the state of the economy. At one Parkbridge community, homes purchased between 2007 to 2017 rose in price an average of seven per cent per year. Some homes more than doubled in just six years.

Q: What legislation supports homeowners in land lease communities?

Land lease communities across Canada are governed by provincial legislation and regulations that differ slightly across jurisdictions but in all cases enforce the rights and responsibilities of both residents and land lease owners.

Q: What happens when a resident’s lease expires? Are they able to renew?

Yes, residents are able to renew their lease. The homeowner works with the land lease operator on renewing the lease agreement.

Q: Is the lease transferable upon sale of a home?

Yes. This is called an Assignment of Lease and is covered under provincial legislation.

Q: How does the new owner enter into a lease agreement with the land lease owner?

The seller informs the community management team of their intention to sell. Before finalizing the home purchase, the buyer completes a lease application.

Q: How much is rent?

Rent varies from community to community and is regulated by the respective provincial governments. Rent depends on the local market as well as the services and amenities that are provided in that community.

Q: Are land lease communities different than Manufactured Home Communities?

Manufactured Home Communities (MHCs) are the earliest example of land lease. Today, Parkbridge has modular, manufactured and traditional-build homes.

Q: Why do homeowners choose to live in a Parkbridge land lease community?

On average, the purchase price of a home in a land lease community is up to 30-per-cent less than a traditional freehold home in the same area. Parkbridge’s land lease communities are also professionally managed, often with quality amenities, which helps create a sense of community where residents feel supported and connected. Amenities can include community centres, pools, playgrounds and fitness centres. Services can include snow removal and maintenance of common areas. Amenities and services vary by community, depending on the needs and wants of the owners.

And a final advantage is that unlike other developers, Parkbridge maintains a presence in the community, investing alongside homeowners to ensure there is ongoing, thoughtful attention to community infrastructure, standards and amenities.

With its images of rusting trailers and chronically under-employed bad boys, the show reinforced negative stereotypes about ‘trailer parks.’ And the bad press spread to take in land lease communities and Manufactured Homes too.

Here’s the thing: such communities are as different from trailer parks as chalk and cheese. Read on for some facts that correct some common myths and misconceptions.

Fact # 1: Manufactured home ownership is a valuable option for middle income families and retirees

Mark Bourree, Senior Regional Manager, Property Operations for Parkbridge (the largest land lease owner-operator and developer in Canada says the option is increasingly popular with people of all ages and stages, but particularly with seniors and young people starting out in life. For young families, manufactured homes provide an option that costs up to 30 per cent less than a conventional home. This is because you’re paying for the house, but not the land underneath it; hence the term ‘land lease community’. And unlike apartments, they offer a yard where kids can play.

As for seniors: “A lot of people downsize from their empty nest home and move into a community of manufactured homes,” Kemp says. The two main advantages: the reasonable price ensures seniors can easily live on their pension while freeing up money for life’s other priorities. And “if you are away for a period of time, your house is absolutely secure because neighbours watch over it.”

Fact #2: Manufactured Homes are a good investment

“The law of supply and demand works in this industry as well,” says Kemp. “Let’s say you bought your home for $40,000 about 20 years ago and you’ve taken really good care of it. Now you’re ready to sell.” Depending on the location and condition, the same home might well sell for more than a new home today (in the range of $200,000), he says.

Fact # 3: A Manufactured Home is not a mobile home

The vast majority of manufactured homes are moved once and remain in place throughout their lifetime – they don’t have a hitch or wheels. As well, manufactured home communities are becoming increasingly known as ‘land lease communities.’ Canada’s largest land lease owner-operator and developer, Parkbridge, has modular, manufactured and new traditional build homes to choose from, depending on the location and community.

Fact # 4: Manufactured Homes are well-built and follow the same building codes as freehold homes

For the last 30 years, manufactured homes have been required to meet a code called Z240, similar to the requirements in Canada’s National Building Code. “They have the exact same criteria as any freehold home built in Canada,” says Bouree. Expect a solid frame, full insulation, energy saving features, gyproc walls, and a roof meant to last 25 years.

Bourree says that manufactured homes are manufactured in the tightly controlled environment of an indoor factory, then moved into place on the back of a semi trailer truck. “They’re well-designed and engineered,” he says. “And they have to be able to withstand the winds going down the highway at 100 kilometres an hour.”

Fact # 5: There is an incredible sense of community among neighbours

Many Manufactured Home Communities offer enviable locations close to major cities, as well as the kinds of amenities that draw people together, from playgrounds to community centres and hiking and walking trails. Because the communities are professionally managed, owners commit to maintaining their homes to the standards of the community as part of their lease. “It’s like having a condo board, only without the drama,” says Bourree. “Most of our residents stay for a very long time.”

What’s more, points out Kemp, unlike an apartment building, where you might be acquainted with the neighbours across the hall but not those above or below you, people in manufactured home communities tend to know each other well. “Often they organize barbecues and bingo games and garage sales,” he says. “Plus knowing your neighbours creates security – residents will question a stranger in the park.”

Between the distractions and inevitable boredom, effective studying can feel like something you wing rather than something you master.

But – like any activity – learning to study well just requires a little practice, and some useful tips from the experts.

Chris McGrath, vice president of student success at George Brown College, says it comes down to understanding your study style, and the setting you need to optimize self-learning,

Many people have an expectation “that there’s only one way to study, or one magic approach,” says McGrath. “The reality is that everyone’s brain works differently, and we are all very diverse learners.”

“Students who are struggling to get into a pattern of effective study … should reach out to one of the academic support centres on their campus. They can provide resources to help a student orient their thinking into the type of learner they are, and they can then cascade down and contemplate some really effective behaviours that will help make study time more practical.”

That might mean adjusting the way you revise depending on the topic you’re studying, and the tools you’re using.

“If I’m reading content, I can sit on my sofa (to study),” says McGrath. “If I have to write, it has to be at a desk … and I need background noise, because it stimulates my brain activity.”

There are also other variables to consider, says McGrath, including where a student tends to study: At home, in a dorm, or – for commuter students – shared spaces like libraries or cafes.

“Campuses have abundant spaces where students can really hunker down and focus with minimal distraction,” he says. “On commuter campuses I encourage (students) to think about finding a good spot on campus and accessing that space part of their regular schedule, and I encourage them to leverage their commute time (to study).”

For these students, accessing study materials in audio format may be an ideal way to review lectures or readings on the go.

Scheduling dedicated, uninterrupted study time is also an ideal strategy for those who are looking to become more efficient with reviewing course material and preparing for exams.

“The phone gets turned off, (you’re) free from distraction, in a physical environment where (you) feel comfortable and not overstimulated, and where (you) can maintain focus,” he says. “And don’t schedule anything for longer stretches than 30-minute chunks.”

That’s because our brains tend to wander after 30 minutes of intense focus, and we need to take a minute break to re-set.

“Make studying a regular habit,” adds McGrath. “Many students assume the only time they need to study is when they have a deadline but engaging in on-going review will help optimize their learning, so when deadlines approach, they don’t have to cram.”

“It’s really a test of give-and-take, and trying different techniques, but it starts with having an honest awareness of what someone’s particular approach to learning is.”",[]
771,thestar,https://www.thestar.com/life/post_secondary_education/2020/03/take-advantage-of-on-campus-resources0.html,Take advantage of on-campus resources,'Kristen Thompson',2020-03-09,"New students usually have a list of must-know spots on their college or university campus: the library, coffee shop, bus loop and bookstore. But campuses are full of equally important resource spaces that all first-years should familiarize themselves with if they want to make the most of their experience. And this can begin before classes even start

“Everybody’s got a Twitter feed, everybody’s got an Instagram page, says Steve Joordens, a psychology professor at the University of Toronto. ""As soon as students know what university they are going to, they should follow some of those (accounts).”

Signing up to participate in your school’s orientation program is another great first step in learning not only where the arts or sciences buildings are, but also health and wellness services, writing centres, financial aid, learning support, counselling, career centres, LGBTQ+ or Indigenous groups, and other on-campus resources.

And don’t discount the value of connecting with older students. Humber College, for example, has a first-year experience program that matches new students with upper-year mentors, and runs events informed by student needs.

“It is important for students to be connected to the campus community, because often that connection leads to … a greater opportunity for success academically and personally,” says Ian Crookshank, Humber’s dean of students.

“Through connecting with the campus community, students are not only more informed in terms of what support is available, but also better able to recognize when things aren’t going quite right. During a student’s journey, bumps in the road are inevitable. Challenges can arise academically, emotionally, financially and personally. There are some students who have a support system that can help them through the bumps. For other students, that support system may need a little bolstering.

“The campus community can help to normalize what a student is going through, let them know that for every valley there will be a peak, and provide them with several ways to help find what they need to (do to) overcome. This is done by accessing resources, but also having … an open door to a space where they can be themselves, or a connection to an opportunity to grow.”

Crookshank points out that while there is a fair amount of well-intentioned discussion about the need to increase the resilience of today’s youth, that mentality also misses the point that for many of our students, life to this point has not been easy.

“The thing that is sometimes in need of development for those in first year is an understanding of how to access that resilience and resourcefulness in a post-secondary context, how to remain positive and ask for help. That’s where connection to the campus, learning about the resources, understanding the culture, etc. can be incredibly helpful. And when they feel overwhelmed or challenged, they know that there is an incredible group of people who want to see them succeed and are there to help.”

Ultimately, students should remind themselves that university and college life is about more than just academia: It’s about feeling whole and at home.",[]

Leaving friends, family and familiarity behind is tough, but a new community can be found on your campus – you just need to know where (and how) to look.

“It is absolutely true that our antidote to all the stress that life throws at us is our social connections,” says Steve Joordens, a psychology professor at the University of Toronto. “So, when you pick somebody up and transplant them somewhere else, they lose that connection.”

Not only is it normal, but actually expected for first-year students to have bouts of loneliness, and in turn feel more stressed than normal, he says. The best way to overcome those feelings of loneliness and stress is to create a new social network where you are.

“Connect with others who share some interests that you share,” Joordens suggests. Look into clubs, teams or organizations on campus that are devoted to one of your areas of interest, and join in. Making friends with people who share your hobbies – and allowing you to discuss familiar topics – can really help students make new social connections.

If walking into a room full of strangers seems overwhelming, Joordens suggests connecting with one of the organizers or members online, first.

“A lot of students, especially with phones and social networks being so powerful, (find it) low-risk to reach out to somebody in a chat,” he says. “Find that first friend, have chats on social media, and get comfortable with that person on that platform. … It’s a less risky, more controlled way to get to know somebody, but don’t let it become a crutch or a hard chasm to cross.”

Ultimately, says Joordens, connecting in-person is the goal. A simple strategy to tackle that first get-to-know-you conversation is to ask the other person questions about themselves, which often makes the conversation go smoother.

“The reason we all find it hard (to make new friends) is we all have a mild form of social anxiety, (or fear) we will do something that makes a fool of ourselves,” says Joordens. “That’s a threat, and that threat makes our sympathetic nervous system act up. So, when we’re about to walk into a room full of strangers, that’s what makes us feel nervous.”

The trick is learning to control that fear. “Go on YouTube and look for guided relaxation videos. Rather than telling yourself to stop being nervous, you can learn to tell yourself to relax,” Joordens says.

Ultimately, being able to connect human-to-human and walk into a room full of strangers is an important skill for future success, and students will have to continue facing that fear long into adulthood.

“Yes, it will be uncomfortable, but you’ve got to do it,” Joordens says. You never know, you may make life-long friends in the process.",[]

Since the legalization of recreational cannabis use in Canada in 2018, there has been high demand for skilled workers in all areas of the industry.

The majority of job opportunities focus on cannabis cultivation, harvesting, processing, manufacturing, and administration. Educational programs to train or certify students in these areas have been few and far between, however. Those that do exist are located far outside of the GTA.

Meeting industry demands

Centennial College is set to launch a new cannabis cultivation and processing certificate program this fall that will bridge this gap and cultivate much-needed workers in Toronto.

The entry-level part-time program will offer both theoretical and hands-on education in the cultivation of cannabis, from seed to sale.

“Most of the existing cannabis cultivation programs in Ontario are in Niagara, or Guelph, or the hinterland, and there’s a dearth of talent for us here in Toronto,” says Joe Goldfarb, curriculum developer and instructor for the new program. “We saw a gap here in the city that needed to be filled.”

Joe Goldfarb - Curriculum Developer & Instructor, Cannabis Cultivation Program, Centennial College

Cultivating the best

Students in Centennial’s new cannabis cultivation and processing program will take courses in a blended format, with practical experience at a licensed cannabis production facility. “Our program is split into two parts,” says Goldfarb, who is also the head of operations at local cannabis company Medz Cannabis and so has an insider’s understanding of the industry.

“There’s an online component and an on-site component. We’ve paired the theoretical learning with on-site learning here at our facility. Students will get hands-on experience working with cannabis plants. They’ll be helping with every single facet of the industry.”

The hands-on learning will cover working with nutrients, pest control management, different stages in the growth cycle of a cannabis plant, pruning and trimming, sanitization, documentation, and compliance with government policy, laws and regulations. It’s a well-rounded, comprehensive education. “This isn’t happening anywhere else in terms of cannabis industry education,” says Goldfarb.

The program’s courses include introduction to cannabis studies, cannabis law, cannabis cultivation theory, cannabis cultivation systems, cannabis processing theory, and formulation of cannabis products.

A reputation of excellence

Over the past 50 years, Centennial College has transformed itself from a local community college into a worldly institution, with a presence in countries like China, India, South Korea, and Brazil.

Centennial has a record of exemplary teaching, innovative programming, and extensive partnership building. This new program fits the bill in terms of the college’s reputation as a forward-thinking school.

There’s a present and growing need for well-trained staff in cultivation facilities across Canada. Centennial’s new program will prepare graduates for job opportunities in cultivation operations, quality assurance and quality control, processing, consumer education, and more.

Centennial’s cannabis cultivation and processing program is the first of its kind and is open to anyone (aged 19+) who wants to explore a career in the cannabis industry. For more information, visit centennialcollege.ca.",[]

That’s because evidence suggests that artificial intelligence — or AI — will be one of the leading economic drivers of our time, with an estimated worldwide business value of $3.9 trillion USD by the year 2022.

Canada has quickly become a leader in the AI space, with research strength and transformative startups. In fact, Montreal has the highest concentration of researchers and students of deep learning (a subgroup of machine learning in AI) in the world, and Toronto has the highest concentration of AI startups in the world. As AI and machine learning are increasingly changing and improving how we do business, companies don’t want to be left behind. And with more companies adopting these technologies, the demand for high-quality talent is on the rise.



The university recognized the demand for data scientists within organizations, and the small talent pool, and decided to bridge the gap. The program aims to help put students on the right path toward a career as a data analyst, data engineer, data scientist, or AI practitioner.

Students in the program have the opportunity to work in cross-functional teams to translate learnings into business insights and help guide business decisions. “The majority of our students are mature students who have some work experience and are looking to reskill or upskill within their careers,” says Beitinjaneh, “and what they learn can be applied directly to their work.”

Jean-Olivier Pitre, a data engineer with the Société de transport de Montréal (STM), Montreal’s municipal transport service, enrolled in the program to advance his skills in turning data into insight, and it paid off. “Because of the advanced analytics work that I produced with my team on how to optimize service on the Montréal metro's orange line, I received the Coup de Coeur STM award, an award given to STM employees who did astounding work for the customer experience and/or directly contributed to our 2025 organizational plan,” he says. “This wouldn’t have been possible without this program. McGill gave me the knowledge and the tools, but especially the roadmap and strategy on how to generate value from data in order to make a positive impact in the real world — in our case, to millions of weekly users”

The public sector industry has shown notable gain, with a trend of 54,000 net new jobs in the last year. Compared to 12 months earlier, the survey found that jobs in the industry grew by 1.8 percent and the public sector’s total number of employees increased by 33,000.

“About 3.6 million Canadians are employed in the public sector,” says Carmen Sicilia, associate professor and director of indigenous relations at McGill University School of Continuing Studies. “These public service positions are in every single community — not just in large cities, but small communities including Indigenous communities in Northern Canada.”

Starting a career in the public sector

The School of Continuing Studies at McGill prepares individuals for jobs in the present and future, regardless of whether they’re launching their career, growing their career, or newcomers to Canada who need to rebuild their career. Launched in 2018, the undergraduate-level certificate in public administration and governance was so successful that inquiring students had to be put on a waiting list. To follow up on that success and meet the demand, McGill has launched a graduate-level diploma in the subject which has already began accepting applications and will launch this fall.

“The certificate and diploma in public administration and governance aim to help learners prepare for a career in the public sector or advance their current career positions,” says Sicilia. “The curriculum aims to strengthen students’ managerial and leadership competencies and equip them with the knowledge, analytical skills, and problem-solving strategies that are critical for success in public service organizations.”

The new programs are both completely online and follow a blended approach, meaning classes are live, allowing students to connect and interact with the course lecturer and classmates, alongside parts that are self-directed and can be done online from anywhere the student wishes to do classwork.

“Individuals don’t have to leave their jobs, their families, or their communities,” says Sicilia. “What’s so fascinating is the sharing that goes on in the classroom. Because individuals are working in various communities, learning doesn’t just come from the lecturers, but from the learners themselves.”

“The jobs are there,” says Sicilia, adding that programs in public administration and governance, like the one at McGill, give people the opportunity to get access to these careers. “We listened to what the needs are from the organizations and we asked them specifically, ‘What competencies and skills do you want individuals to come out with? Don’t give us course names. What tools or knowledge do they need to have?’”

She was recently promoted to senior data visualization and open data specialist, overseeing data and building solutions for crime analysts. Recently, Verduga decided to go back to school part time to complete her crime analytic certificate through The Chang School at Ryerson, which she expects to finish this spring. “The big advantage is that the program helps you analyze crime using state-of-the-art technology and specifically tailored techniques. The technology is always changing, so ongoing education is important. This kind of training is also great for those working in crime analysis for banks, insurance and consulting companies.”

In today’s world, nothing is quite as distinct. “The lines are blurring. If you ask students in full-time programs or those in continuing education, they’re all looking for flexible learning opportunities: experiential learning, learning on the job, in a lab, online,” explains Emily Milic, public relations and communications manager for Humber College. “These days, flexible learning is embedded in the DNA of most curriculums. Full-time and continuing education students have families and commitments and flexibility is key to a successful program.”

Continuing education has also changed in recent years. “It continues to provide opportunities for individuals to learn new skills or improve their existing skills, but employers are now working with the continuing education colleges on planning curriculums and ensuring their employees get what they need from the continuing education experience,” explains Milic.

Humber, for example, has an education training solutions department to directly work with individual companies. “The group works with individual companies directly to work out their needs and help them devise curriculums to reach those goals, whether that means single-day training sessions or a long-term course series,” says Milic. Most continuing education providers have relationships with corporate partners, and the arrangements are variable, but the goal is that these programs will provide educational options that work for both the learner and the corporate organization.

Why are corporations so involved in the structure of continuing education? One term used to describe today’s continuing education is open-loop learning. “It used to be that you went to school to get your credentials, then you went on to work at your career. Typically these days, though, you’re in and out of continuing education throughout your career. We are facilitating that by creating programs that meet the needs of those individuals and their employers,” says Milic.

This certainly suits the way people want to learn and the way industry wants and needs them to learn. And while industry is involved in curriculum across the board, the relationships vary. In some cases, institutions of learning are working with companies to develop very specific programs for employees, to help them develop professionally and personally. In other cases, employers help support employee advancement by offering educational assistance programs to employees.

One such relationship is between Walmart Canada and Humber as lead education partner. Walmart offers financial assistance to associates and their families, providing opportunities for tuition reimbursement and demonstrating their commitment to their employees.

Humber’s Barrett Centre for Technology and Innovation has partnership agreements with several sector companies who are working together to develop education geared to employment pathways and recruitment opportunities for Humber students and graduates. Initiatives include STEM outreach activities, robotic equipment and audio-visual systems.

On the weekends, the two are typically homebodies unless they’re going to a friend’s house. Also for their date nights, they try to find ways to budget. “We never go out to drink, we go on dates maybe once every three months and typically spend just shy of $100 per date with food included.”

Their two largest monthly spends? $1,695 split between the two of them on rent, more than $700 on car insurance, about $550 on groceries and $400, which is non-negotiable, for charity.

On top of their more realistic goals, the couple is hoping to finally go on vacation for the first time. “We’d also like to go to either Disney World, Ireland, or the Caribbean for our first vacation sometime in the next few years,” Emily says.

We asked the couple to send in a sample of their weekly expenses for a #MillennialMoney expert to examine. Here’s what happened.

The expert: Jason Heath, managing director at Objective Financial Partners Inc., has advice for the couple, who he says, has an exciting year ahead.

> It sounds like the home budget is pretty modest at $300,000. They will need a minimum 5% down payment or $15,000.

> As they are considering a home purchase, remember that with babies come changes in income and expenses. I’m sure some sort of a parental leave for one or both of them will reduce their combined income for a period of time. EI maternity and parental benefits will replace only a portion of their incomes.

> I would focus the extra $300 to $800 leftover cash each month on Tom’s consolidation loan. It is likely the interest rate is higher than Emily’s OSAP loan rate.

> Debt repayment may be a better option than investing given the interest rates they’re paying, especially given their time horizon for a home purchase seems short. It’s not wise taking risk to invest if you may need your money in a short period of time.

> One thing to consider while Emily is off work is she may have the opportunity to buy back service in her pension plan. This is often a good opportunity to take advantage of and she should consider it during or after her maternity leave.

> Having a baby is a good time to re-evaluate insurance coverage and estate planning. Both Emily and Tom may need more life insurance. If they don’t already have wills and powers of attorney, they should consider them in advance of their new addition to the family.

> It’s hard to criticize generous philanthropists, but this couple should consider whether an expected decrease in income and increase in expenses should cause them to reconsider their $400 per month in donations, even if it is just temporarily.

The results: They spent less. Spending in week 1: $2,262. Spending in week 2: $551.91.

What Emily thought: Compared to last week, the couple is proud of how little they spent. “We will save from there,” Emily said. Next goals: “We’d like to reduce spending on snacks and coffee.” Added bonus, Tom will no longer need to use the 407 toll to go to work as he did in week 2, which will mean more savings.

Take-aways: With help from the Millennial Money expert, now Emily and Tom have shifted into looking more seriously into how to buy a home. “We will likely have to rent to save up for a down payment and maybe will need to pay off debts before purchasing a house as well,” Emily said.

In addition to that, the two had already planned to transfer any child tax benefits into an RESP, so they were glad to hear this affirmed by the financial coach as the “best investment strategy.”

Despite the desperation to pay off debts, the couple agree their charitable contributions are still not debatable, and that they will continue to give just as much.

Instead, they’ve found different areas to save money. “Emily’s family lives here, and they have offered child care which would offset child care costs with her return to work,” Tom added.

Mortgage rates to fall following Bank of Canada rate cut,'Michael Lewis',2020-03-05,"Variable rate mortgage holders are the big winners from the Big Six banks’ moves to match the Bank of Canada’s 50 point reduction to its trendsetting interest rate.

According to rate comparison website RateSpy.com, variable rate customers will see rates drop by half a per cent for interest cost savings of roughly $500 per year for every $100,000 of mortgage.

Those with adjustable-rate mortgages will see monthly payments fall by about $24 per $100,000, while variable-rate customers will continue to make the same monthly payment but their portion directed to principal will rise while the amount paid in interest will fall. Home backed and regular lines of credit will drop as well.

All of this follows the Bank of Canada’s decision Wednesday to lower its overnight target rate by 50 basis points to 1.25 per cent — the lowest since the 2008 recession — due to fears of a deepening economic downturn caused by the coronavirus and after the U.S. Fed imposed an emergency 50-basis-point cut.

There had been expectations that the banks would not pass on the full BoC cut, but Canada’s largest bank, RBC, led the way Wednesday evening, announcing a 50-basis point reduction to 3.45 per cent for its prime rate effective Thursday, which is used to set the rate at which banks lend to customers with good credit.

The other big banks — Bank of Nova Scotia, TD-Canada Trust, CIBC and BMO followed suit with National Bank of Canada confirming Thursday that it will also lower its prime rate by 50 points to 3.45 per cent as of Friday.

Rob McLister, RateSpy.com’s founder, said the the lowest widely available variable rate will drop immediately to roughly 2.34 per cent from 2.84 per cent, while the 2.59 per cent rate for the lowest conventional five year fixed-rate mortgages will fall in the short term due the lower prime and downward movement in bond yields which normally signal falling mortgage rates. He said fixed rates will trend lower as economic data continues to soften, “but we’ll have to wait and see by how much.”

Many observers expect the Bank of Canada to announce another 25 point rate cut next month — possibly another quarter-point cut before the end of the year, which would bring Canada’s overnight rate to 0.75 per cent.

“The growing risk of COVID-19 to the outlook suggests that the Bank of Canada will follow today’s 50-bp cut in interest rates with an additional 25-bps cut in April,” said Stephen Brown of Capital Economics in a note. “Given lingering concerns that looser policy will boost an already red-hot housing market, however, we think the Bank is unlikely to go further than that.”",[]

After Monday, when they officially bade adieu to royal life, it’s time for champagne, caviar and a three-tier cake scrawled with, “Freedom!” The bash with their closest pals should also include a few symbolic nods to their new homeland, Canada. (Actually, scratch that because now I’m picturing Heather Dorak browbeating guests into doing Pilates on an itchy Hudson’s Bay blanket as George Clooney gets wasted on Molson Canadian and Oprah, already stinking of ketchup chips, demands the terrified chefs whip up a batch of Nanaimo bars for her flight home.)

The point is, Harry and Meghan are now liberated. Congratulations!

Your royal nightmare is over. Let the real dreaming begin.

Anyone who believes the young couple made a grave mistake by ditching the charmed life of his birth — and one she married into — need only watch a nine-second clip from Monday. It was Commonwealth Day, Harry and Meghan’s last pony show as departing senior royals. The narcoleptic event went down inside Westminster Abbey, though given the frostiness on display, it should’ve unfolded in the North Pole.

Harry and Meghan, looking resplendent, were already seated in the second row. But when Prince William and Kate Middleton, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, ambled toward their spots in the first row, months of reported feuds twisted into high-def focus. Meghan waved at Kate, sweetly, but was ignored like a dirty panhandler.

William and Kate then took their seats. And Meghan turned toward her husband to whisper.

What she said, I have no clue.

But I would not blame Meghan had she asked in a hush, “Harry, what is wrong with those two?”

After months in which a “falling out” between the brothers was widely reported, this was a chance for the couples to at least feign congeniality for the global cameras. You know? Pretend everything is A-OK. Hug it out. Fake laugh and make small talk. Do something to disabuse the world of the notion there is now bad blood between two blood brothers.

But that’s not what happened. And the blame goes to William and Kate, who telegraphed petulance.

My heart goes out to Harry and Meghan. It really does. Tired of the absolute garbage they’ve endured from the British tabloids — and determined to animate their own philanthropic and career goals without the controlling shackles of Buckingham Palace — they reasonably asked to become part-time royals.

Instead, they were stripped of their Sussex brand and banished from the Queendom.

Whether it was the awkward, chilly interaction with William and Kate on Monday or getting booed by a heckler at the Endeavour Fund Awards a couple of days earlier, Harry and Meghan’s final weekend as royals was not cause for any second-guessing — it was proof #Megxit was one of the greatest decisions ever made.

The royal family does not deserve Harry and Meghan. The world does.

The royal family wanted to hold them down. They are now free.

On Saturday, during an interview on MSNBC Live, British journalist Victoria Mather revealed the extent of the classist-slash-racist forces aligned against Markle when she blurted out, “I think what has really, really upset the British public is that Meghan Markle, who many people consider only, you know, five clicks up from trailer trash, has actually tried to disrespect the Queen. And the Queen is the most respected person — most respected woman — in the world.”

Now, if I were to be similarly nasty, I might point out Mather looks like Benedict Cumberbatch’s uncle in drag who works the overnight shift at a Twinings factory. Five clicks up from trailer trash? Mather looks and sounds three clicks below a stolen bangers-and-mash breakfast along the banks of the River Thames, in the company of Piccadilly Circus freaks.

But if you watch the rest of the interview, the narrative is clear: Kate Middleton came from a great family worthy of royalty. Meghan Markle, by contrast, was spawned from a biracial hillbilly clan, and has no right to yank Harry from his relationship with his king-in-waiting brother and preternaturally uptight sister-in-law.

So Meghan is basically the Yoko Ono of this century: blamed for the breakup of another “Fab Four.”

Give me a break. From the moment Markle was linked to Prince Harry, she has coped with vicious attacks on her character and motivation. And yet, at every turn, she has bravely smiled, put on her hiking boots and taken the high road. Her steely resolve, her focus on the big picture, reminds me of someone else: Princess Diana.

So Harry and Meghan’s final march through royal duty this weekend is no longer cause for debate: it is irrefutable evidence they made the right decision by getting the hell away. What they want for themselves, compared to what was expected of them, could never be reconciled. There was no middle ground here.

Harry and Meghan, after the birth of their son, realized royal life was a prison in the making.

Now they are free. Now there is no looking back.

884,thestar,https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/opinion/2020/03/11/is-dixie-chicks-gaslighter-really-just-a-jerk.html,Is Dixie Chicks’ gaslighter really just a jerk?,'Shinan Govani',2020-03-11,"It only took 14 years.

When the Dixie Chicks triumphantly returned earlier this month, dropping a fist-up emoji of a song called “Gaslighter” — also the name of a long-awaited album, coming soon — my thoughts darted to a few places. One, I remembered how much I bloody love the Dixie Chicks.

Two, a reminder of the fuss that engulfed the game-changing country trio, back in the early aughts, when frontwoman Natalie Maines publicly denounced both the Iraq War and the then-president George W. Bush (and how quaint all of that sounds now).

Three, a fixation on the idea that while “Gaslighter’ has the ire and the tang of songs on their 2006 comeback album — think “Not Ready To Make Nice” — and that it, additionally, makes pulp of a term that is ubiquitous these days — “gaslighting” is an in-vogue word, employed everywhere from politics to reality TV — I was not entirely sure that what this song was about was actually … well … “gaslighting.” Maybe it’s just a bummer?

Indeed, visions of Alanis cascaded upon me, as I wondered if gaslight might just be the next “Ironic”? You remember, dontcha, that ’90s anthem which describes any number of things — “a traffic jam when you’re already late,” for one; “ten thousand spoons when all you need is a knife,” for another — few of which were especially ironic?

Some background: “gaslighting” has become a more popular expression, in this Trump-era zeitgeist of “alternative facts” but in its purest essence, in the personal realm, it refers to a form of sustained emotional abuse that involves manipulating the truth to make someone doubt their grip on reality — and the term actually goes back decades. To a 1938 play “Gaslight,” in fact — one that later became a classic movie with Ingrid Bergman. In that plot, a husband wrecks havoc on his wife by subtly altering things, including playing with the gaslights in the house.

What do you think?

Lying. Manipulation. Keeping your victim foggy-eyed and off-balance. The toolbox of the classic gaslighter in that original incarnation. And one that has become a staple in psychology, and has now morphed into a go-to bit of invective in this era, it reaching its own sort of pop-political apotheosis when, in an interview last year, none other than Taylor Swift accused Trump of “gaslighting the American public.” Lately, I have heard everyone from Real Housewives to contestants on “Love Island” throw around the term.

The term has also been enjoying a good run on bookshelves, too, especially in a form of domestic noir as practised by authors like Gillian Flynn. There is, for instance, Tara Isabella Burton’s pretty great, gender-bending Talented Mr. Ripley redux from a couple of years ago, “Social Creature,” in which the anti-heroine uses gaslighting via the very 21st-century modes of social media. And also, even crazier, the meta-ness of A.J. Finn’s bestseller “The Woman in the Window” (soon to be a movie with Amy Adams), which was sold as a gaslight novel but then got even more curiouser, when the author was unveiled as a serial liar himself in a long profile done of him in “The New Yorker,” with his past deceptions including claiming to have had cancer, among other things (cue the allegations of Finn as a gaslighter by colleagues).

A Guardian columnist echoed some of my own reservations, though, when she warned against cheapening the term. “Put simply, all gaslighters are lying creeps, but not every lying creep is a gaslighter,” Barbara Ellen wrote. Meaning: it is not a convenient umbrella term for all mendacious behaviour, nor is it “gaslighting every single time someone lies, or makes excuses.”

When it occurs, “it is a systematic dissolving another person’s sense of self, until they’re questioning every move and instinct.” And not just a phenomenon that pops up on a show like “Love Island,” where male contestants are tagged as gaslighters, when — girl, please — many of them are just himbos who’d say anything to get laid.

So, what say you, Dixie Chicks? In their album — which the group has called “the most personal and autobiographical” — the just-out song clearly traces Maines’ very public divorce from a liar-face. And the full-blast lyrics? Well, they speak for themselves. Exhibit A: “Give you all my money, you’ll gladly walk away … Gaslighter, denier, doing anything to get your ass farther …”

It is an earworm, all right, but is, actually … gaslighting? Let the debates begin.",[]

Others would say that it’s never gone away: disco has been an enduring influence on music — and pop culture more broadly — ever since producers and artists first integrated synthesizers and four on the floor beats into pop sounds in the late 1960s and early ’70s.

Wherever you fall in these debates about disco’s evergreen status, what cannot be disputed is the central place of the late American singer and songwriter Donna Summer in the history of the genre.

Performer and frequent co-writer of 14 Billboard Hot 100 top 10 hits — including “Hot Stuff,” “Bad Girls,” “Macarthur Park,” “Heaven Knows,” “Last Dance,” “Dim all the Lights” and more — Summer’s musical legacy is huge. And yet for many years Summer resisted her status as the so-called Queen of Disco, says theatre director Des McAnuff, “because she was so many other things.”

McAnuff is the director and co-writer of the Broadway musical “Summer: The Donna Summer Musical,” which is playing at the Princess of Wales Theatre through March 22. The premise of the show is that it takes place at a concert celebrating Summer’s music and then flashes back to retell the story of her life.

Three actors play Summer, as the senior Diva Donna (Dan’yelle Williamson), the career-prime Disco Donna (Alex Hairston) and the fledgling Duckling Donna (Olivia Elease Hardy).

“One of the themes is that she was many people,” says McAnuff. “She lived a number of different lives, some even contradictory.”

The show revisits Summer’s early professional years in Germany, where she met up with the producers Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte, and put out the groundbreaking singles “Love to Love You Baby” and “I Feel Love.” In its survey of Summer’s career, it demonstrates the wide range of musical genres that influenced her and to which she contributed, including pop, funk, R&B, gospel and inspirational rock.

It also touches on some of the more controversial aspects of Summer’s life and career: a born-again Christian, she was quoted in the 1980s as saying that AIDS was divine retribution for immoral lifestyles, statements she denied but which caused great distress among her massive gay following.

The show reunites McAnuff, the Tony and Olivier Award winner and former artistic director of the Stratford Festival, with choreographer Sergio Trujillo. The pair have created several highly successful musicals built around the back catalogues of musical groups and artists, including “Jersey Boys,” about Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons, and “Ain’t Too Proud,” about The Temptations.

Both McAnuff and Trujillo, who live in the U.S., spent formative years in Canada and still identify partly as Canadian. Trujillo’s memories of the disco era are directly tied to Toronto.

“My family arrived in Canada in 1976 from Colombia,” says Trujillo. “I had never heard disco music before. I’d only heard salsa in Colombia. This whole new sound and style of music was electrifying to me. My cousins are older than me by five or six years and they were all really immersed in the disco craze. They would take me to various clubs around Toronto — I was 14 or 15 — and I watched them dance. I saw the music and the decadence of that world.”

The challenge that Trujillo gave himself with “Summer” was to do more than “dust off those old disco moves” (just to set expectations: no one does the Hustle in this show).

“I lived through this period,” says Trujillo. “I decided that I was going to take the opportunity to create some storytelling” through the way the musical numbers are staged.

A priority for Trujillo and McAnuff was to make the production a showcase for female performers, particularly female performers of colour. Besides the three Donnas, there is a chorus of 12 female dancers (and one male) who, in addition to performing Trujillo’s choreography, play various roles in the story, female and male.

This “creates a kind of androgyny that captures the time,” says McAnuff, “and uses extraordinary talents that have been relatively sidelined in our business … Sergio and I spend a lot of time in auditions and one of the thing that becomes clear is that there are many, many women who don’t get the opportunities they deserve in terms of roles.”

While he spent his high school years in Scarborough and launched his theatre career in Toronto, McAnuff’s memories of the disco era are firmly set in New York. “I was working at the Public Theater in those days. The disco beat permeated all kinds of genres of music,” recalls McAnuff. “I was very aware of it. I play music; you couldn’t play music without being influenced by it.”

While he was at the time the sort of artsy rebel “who considered anything north of 14th Street as uptown,” says McAnuff, he does remember going to Studio 54 in its heyday and hearing Summer’s “Macarthur Park” for the first time.

“That song was of course a big discovery,” he says, “and this is in the show. Before that people thought of Donna as a sort of Black Marilyn Monroe, but the fact that she could sing that way was something of a shock. She hadn’t really had the chance to show off those extraordinary pipes.”

“Summer” played on Broadway from April to December 2019 and earned two Tony nominations (for LaChanze as Diva Donna and Ariana DeBose as Disco Donna). This North American tour has been on the road since September 2019, and both McAnuff and Trujillo say they’re coming to Toronto to see the show here.

“I am excited that we are bringing it to the hometown where I fell in love with disco dance,” says Trujillo, “to be able to revisit that in the place where it all started for me. I hope audiences enjoy it and that they not only reminisce, but they leave dancing.”

Viewers who endured a train wreck of a “Bachelor” season had to put up with a fiasco of a finale, spread over four hours and two nights Monday and Tuesday, as pilot Peter Weber’s bid to find a wife crashed and burned.

To summarize: Peter claimed to be head over heels in love with one woman who said she loved him but that they were too different to make things work. Two days after she walked out on him, Peter claimed to be head over heels in love with another woman and proposed marriage to her. But the engagement ended because he still had feelings for the first woman, who confessed she still had feelings for him and agreed to give him a second chance.

Despite the optimistic presence of jeweller Neil Lane in Tuesday’s live studio audience in Los Angeles, briefcase of diamond rings in hand, there was no engagement.

A couple of clear villains emerged from the shambles: Weber himself and a tired series that prizes made-for-TV manipulation over the human connections it claims to value above all else.

There was also a clear hero: Hannah Ann Sluss, the 23-year-old we were all making fun of a couple of weeks ago for dotting her i’s with hearts, but who boldly and confidently stood up for herself and rejected Peter’s weaselly rationalizations after he sabotaged their engagement.

The third person involved in this mess, Madison Prewett, also 23, was coaxed back into Peter’s arms after “Bachelor” host Chris Harrison personally delivered the news of Peter’s broken engagement. This strikes me less as altruism than a desperate attempt to get Peter paired off and stave off criticism that the entire season was a colossal waste of time.

But Peter’s mother Barb very bluntly told Peter and Madison on Tuesday that their relationship is doomed to fail. While I think it was impolitic of her to sabotage her own son on live TV like that, I also think she’s probably right given her disdain for Madison (evidenced by the rude faces she made on camera every time Madison opened her mouth) and that of the rest of Peter’s family. How does a relationship that’s already on shakey ground withstand that kind of familial disapproval?

But let’s back up and retrace how we got to this sorry point.

Weber was never a popular choice as star of this “Bachelor” season, one that was marked by tedious sniping among the contestants and Peter’s seeming inability to form more than shallow connections with any of his would-be mates.

Madison, a foster parent recruiter from Auburn, Ala., was an early front-runner, but just before she, Peter and two other women jetted off to Australia for “fantasy suite” week, she told him she’d be hard pressed to continue dating him if he had sex with the other two on their overnight dates. Deeply religious, she was saving herself for marriage.

Peter, on the other hand, was renowned for his sexual prowess. His claim to fame, and likely the reason he was chosen as Bachelor, was that he had sex four times with “The Bachelorette” in a windmill fantasy suite. So to no one’s surprise, except maybe Madison’s, Peter confessed he’d been “intimate” (whether with one or both of the other women was never specified) and Madison bolted.

She did come back, but his indiscretion hung like a cloud over their relationship and she left him in the Australian outback, seemingly forever.

This is where Peter could have used his powers for good instead of evil.

Hannah Ann, a model from Knoxville, Tenn., adored Peter; his family adored Hannah Ann. (That clip we saw ad nauseam of Barb wailing at Peter, “Bring her home to us”? The “her” was Hannah Ann.) But Peter was obviously gaga for Madison. The day after the breakup he told Hannah Ann that despite her obvious devotion to him his heart was “being pulled in two different directions.”

The honourable thing to do would have been to send Hannah Ann home then and there. Instead he claimed the very next day that he’d found “true love” with her. “My heart chooses you forever,” he told a very surprised Hannah Ann before pulling out a pear-shaped diamond ring.

It’s the same ring Hannah Ann put back in his hand weeks later after Peter confessed he couldn’t give her his entire heart.

Onstage in the studio, Hannah Ann lambasted Peter for downplaying his feelings for Madison. “I had no idea what I was saying yes to. That’s called being blindsided,” she said. “If you would have sat me down and had an honest conversation you know that my instinct would have picked up on that you were not ready for a commitment with me …

“And that’s the most hurtful part is that you didn’t respect me enough just to have that open conversation with me.”

She left him with this zinger: “If you want to be with a woman you’ve got to become a real man.”

Peter apologized a lot but never really explained why he did what he did. Was it pride? FOMO? A desire to please his family? A sense of pressure not to leave the show still single?

Whatever the reason, his actions did nothing to endear him to viewers who were already very displeased with him. And it’s hard to feel unreserved enthusiasm for his and Madison’s relationship given his shoddy treatment of Hannah Ann.

This is the third season in a row of “The Bachelor” to finish without a so-called happy ending. Arie Luyendyk Jr. dumped his fiancée for his runner-up; Colton Underwood got jilted by his favourite but got her to agree to continue dating him; and now this.

But maybe the issue isn’t the show’s failure rate but the whole premise that a man getting down on one knee to propose to a woman he’s known for barely two months is the pinnacle of romantic love.

Warner Bros. and ABC remain unbowed. They’re debuting yet another “Bachelor” spinoff on April 13, “Listen to Your Heart,” in which the contestants are all musicians, to be followed by a new season of “The Bachelorette” on May 18 starring Clare Crawley, the oldest franchise star at 38.

Maybe she’ll get a genuine shot at finding a mature and respectful partner, but I wouldn’t hold my breath.",[]

The World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic on Wednesday, March 11, 2020. (The Canadian Press)

As COVID-19 continues to spread, health officials are urging British Columbians to ensure they take the proper steps to get tested while also not spreading the virus to others.

“Now is the time to put some distance between us to keep our germs to ourselves,” provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said earlier this week, reiterating crucial steps of prevention she has noted since mid-February.

The virus has spread rapidly in B.C. over the past few weeks. There have been at least 46 cases and one death. Globally, there have been more than 118,00 confirmed cases and 4,300 deaths, the majority of them in China, Italy and Iran.

That includes at least four cases of community transmission, which means it remains unclear how those cases were contracted but were not from travelling.

So how do you know if you have the novel coronavirus? How can you tell if it is COVID-19 and not the flu or cold? And most importantly: What do you do if you are, in fact, infected?

Symptoms of COVID-19:

The symptoms of the novel coronavirus are similar to a common cold or flu, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada.

That includes a fever and cough but most importantly difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. In severe cases, symptoms can include severe lung infections.

Health officials have warned that it can take up to 14 days, or two weeks, for symptoms to appear and can range from mild to severe. Seniors and those with underlying medical conditions are most at-risk of seeing adverse impacts if they contract the virus.

Out of precaution, health officials have made it clear: if you feel sick, stay home.

""Now is the time to put some distance between us to keep our germs to ourselves,"" Henry says. #COVIDー19 — Ashley Wadhwani (@ashwadhwani) March 7, 2020

The B.C. government has now added an online assesment tool for those who think they may have the disease, and what steps they need to take based off their symptoms.

How the virus spreads:

Coronavirus is transmitted through larger liquid droplets – such as when a person coughs or sneezes. That means the virus can enter a second person’s system through their eyes, nose or throat if in close contact.

While the virus is not known to be airborne, or transmitted through the particles floating in the air, and it is not something that comes in through the skin, it can be spread by touch if a person has used their hands to cover their mouth or nose when they cough.

Health officials recommend to always cough or sneeze into the arm and wash your hands regularly. People should also avoid handshaking and hugs.

A good rule of thumb: Stay at least six feet away from another person.‎

How to get tested:

Anyone who thinks they may have the virus is being urged not to panic, and most importantly to stay home.

Anyone in B.C. who develops symptoms should first call HealthLink BC, by dialing 811, to talk to a health care worker and determine the most appropriate next steps.

The nurses at HealthLink BC will complete an exposure risk assessment of callers with compatible symptoms, such as cough or influenza-like symptoms. In some cases, nurses may suggest a caller go see a health care provider for assessment and testing, either at an urgent primary care centre or walk-in clinic.

Our 811 navigators and nurses are doing an incredible job with record high call volumes – providing support to 3291 callers yesterday. We are adding more staff and more phone lines to resolve the intermittent busy signals some people have experienced. @TeamPAL #COVID19 — Adrian Dix (@adriandix) March 12, 2020

It is highly recommend that anyone who may have COVID-19 call ahead to tell the clinicians that they are coming.

COVID-19 testing is done through a nasopharyngeal swab or throat swab.

Anyone who is tested may be told to self-isolate until the tests can be analyzed in a laboratory. Test results can be found by calling the B.C. Centre for Disease Control coronavirus hotline at 1-833-707-2792.

What happens if you have COVID-19:

Anyone with COVID-19 is being placed in quarantine, at their home or in the hospital, for at least 14 days. In order to be released from quarantine, an infected person must have two consecutive negative tests at least 24 hours apart.

The BC CDC suggests that if you are sharing your home to stay and sleep in a room with good airflow that is away from others. Other precautions include using a separate bathroom, if you can, avoid sharing household items, flush the toilet with the lid down, and clean and disinfect common areas once a day.

Is there a cure?

At this time, there is no vaccine for this particular coronavirus, and health officials say it could take many years to create.

There is no specific treatment, but many of the symptoms can be managed with home treatment such as drinking plenty of fluids, rest and using a humidifier or hot shower to ease a cough or sore throat, according to HealthLink BC.

Most people recover from coronaviruses on their own, however for people with more serious illness, supportive care in or out of hospital may be needed.

Washing your hands frequently and staying home when you’re feeling ill is more effective than facemasks in controlling the spread of a virus. (Black Press Media file)

With new novel Coronavirus cases emerging all over the world, health officials are urging residents to take precautionary measures to prevent more individuals from getting sick.

Canadian health officials are urging people to wash their hands frequently, with soap, for at least 20 seconds at a time and avoid touching their face or other people.

Handshakes and embraces should also be avoided.

“Wash our hands, stay home when you’re sick, stay home from school, stay home from public events, stay home from visiting people in long term health [facilities] and hospitals,” Health Minister Adrian Dix said at a news conference in early March.

Lucky for us, a 17-year-old developer from Oxford, England has designed an easy way to make sure we all properly wash our hands.

William Gibson, the teen behind washyourlyrics.com, has created a poster generator that takes your favourite song and automatically turns it into a hand washing infographic.

“All you need is the song title and artist,” the website reads.

Were you looking forward to a vacation this spring but are now worried about the COVID-19 pandemic?

Canada is under a global travel advisory due to the novel coronavirus. Canadians are being urged to avoid non-essential travel and Transport Canada is warning that repatriation flights are not currently being operated, which could leave those who choose to go abroad stranded.

For hotel stays and airlines outside of Canada, check with your airline, your hotel or your travel agent for their cancellation policies. Some travel insurance is continuing to cover COVID-19 but many providers are not, deeming it a “known circumstance,” which is typically excluded from coverage. Trip cancellation insurance may be an option for those who booked before news of COVID-19 broke.

All air passengers are required to wear masks, although some airlines have removed or relaxed physical distancing requirements on board.

– Illustration by Sierra Lundy

Should I shave? I flip this question over in my mind a dozen times. I know Zoe does, and he’s seen her before. Then again, she says he’s in his 70s, and a natural bush was a given back when he would have been around women my age. Also, a bit of hair might provide just the slightest means of protection, even if it’s only an illusion. I throw the razor in my bag just in case.

I’m heading to meet my stepsister, who is taking me to my first ever life-modelling gig. There, I will pose nude for the sake of art. Drawing me will be a single client, Charles, and Zoe, who I’ve insisted come along. She’s modelled for him before, and has arranged this session at my inclination of interest.

Nudity is a strangely loaded concept. The various attitudes and implications related to exposing one’s body are beyond contradictory, and the lines between empowerment, exploitation and exhibitionism are muddy at best. But nudity is universal! Everybody has a body and why shouldn’t we feel casual about seeing them and having them seen by others? Women’s figures are beautiful and deserve to occupy more than just sexual spaces. I tell myself I feel okay about others seeing my naked body, but I know that I am lying to some degree.

This is where Charles comes in. Charles participates in a weekly life-drawing class, where a group of people gather around a nude model and draw for two hours. I’m hoping that his interest in the human figure in a desexualized context, and my participation in this exchange, will be a way to confront my own internalized taboos and insecurities. I want to be confident in nakedness, I want to feel good about my body in a platonic “here I am, no big deal” kind of way.

So I set out, flipping between anxiety and confidence, excitement and dread. I meet up with Zoe and we debrief. She reassures me. She tells me that the hardest part is coming up with and holding new poses. I suddenly realize I haven’t considered the logistics of this. Shoot. I don’t know a single pose. But Zoe says it’ll be fine, that they just come naturally and there are no wrong positions. She says to twist; twists are interesting.

I mull over her advice as we hop into the car. In the back is a pile of clothes that she tells me to look over. I pull out a like-new super-soft sweater — high quality and in black. It’s like it was made for me.

“Have it!” she says. I stuff it in my bag, and am distracted from our destination just long enough to feel minor relief.

Eventually, we park at the base of Charles’s driveway and the moment of “is it too late to turn around?” hits. It is. The dread takes over and fills my feet as we trudge up the driveway. Charles’s door is bright red. I am pulsing with anxiety as Zoe knocks on it.

Charles opens the door. He is a small man with grey hair and a black beard. We head up to the kitchen and his wife, Sally, jumps right into the conversation. She offers us Girl Guide cookies. I can’t believe what we’re here for. I can’t believe I’m doing this.

The studio is impressive. There are work tables easels, shelves of materials, drawers of different paper sheets, toolboxes of charcoals, and jars of sketching pencils. A grey paper backdrop hangs from a roller on one wall and onto the floor, making a stage. It is illuminated by a menacing spotlight. I am thankful for the professionalism it portends. Also intimidated.

Charles says there’s a robe for me to wear in the bathroom whenever I decide to get ready. I follow his direction and head to “change.” This doesn’t seem like the right word when there’s nothing to change into — but “strip” is worse.

I begin undressing.

My body and I are on relatively amicable terms. I don’t fall too far outside of the desirable norm. But puberty brought large, heavy, wideset breasts to my otherwise petite frame. This is supposedly a good thing, according to almost everyone I complain to. To me, it has always been a source of deep insecurity.

I struggle to get the cuffs of my jeans over my ankles and realize I’ve left my socks on last. How unsexy. Is that a good thing? I avoid looking down at myself as I slip into the robe. It is silk. As I step back into the room, they are still setting up their things and I stand waiting, unsure of when to take the robe off. I’m anxious to get it over with.

Charles explains that we will start with a few one-minute poses, then move onto two minutes, then a couple of fives, and finish with one or two long holds. “Whenever you’re ready,” he prompts.

I slip the silk off and drop it in a pile to the side. Zoe is smiling at me. I feel surprisingly relaxed now that I’m actually just naked. Yet I am certainly aware of the shallowness of my breathing.

I move into the spotlight and decide to start facing backwards. I raise one arm over my head and twist my torso. They both remark that this is a great position.

So it begins. One minute seems longer than it usually does. Then it’s done and I twist a different way.

“You’re a natural!” Charles says. He is engaged in polite conversation with Zoe.

I listen to the scritch-scratch of their pencils. I examine Charles’s studio meticulously. It’s almost boring. Now the five minutes. Time ticks away ever so slowly. I realize that I am so focused on staying still that the whole naked thing isn’t really a thing. Finally Charles calls time and tells me I can take a break and stretch. I again become acutely aware of my nakedness and pull my arms across my chest. I feel my body’s awkward posture outside of a deliberate position. The break is the longest part yet. I am relieved when we start again.

We do a long pose and I read every single title on Charles’s bookshelf. They are organized by subject. Suddenly the session is over; I slip back into the robe and briskly head for the bathroom. Jeans have never felt so comforting.

When I emerge, Charles and Zoe are comparing drawings as Sally gushes over them. They all applaud me as well, and I don’t know how to take the compliments. We say our goodbyes and I run down the driveway.

“So, how did that feel?” Zoe asks excitedly.

“I don’t know. Fine, I think.” It’s the truth. I’m not quite sure how I feel. I’m glad I went through with it and I’m glad it’s done with. I still feel nothing as we part ways. But later, as I travel back home, I am suddenly struck with shame. I can’t quite place its source but I find myself pushing the memory of the day out of my mind, avoiding reflection, not ready to process it.

Was I expecting something bigger? I don’t feel empowered. I don’t feel exposed. I don’t feel a new confidence in my body. I just feel weird about requesting an arrangement to stand naked in a stranger’s basement.

I carry Zoe’s sketches, rolled up with two elastic bands, under my arm as I wait to transfer busses. It’s late. It’s cold now, and I remember the sweater Zoe has given me. I put it on under my bomber jacket and I’m instantly warm. I think of our relationship and how great it is to have a sister who knows me, who sees me, who reminds me I exist beyond skin. Our closeness has nothing to do with our physical bodies.

When I get home I unroll the three pages and show my girlfriend the drawings.

“Whoa. She got your tits perfectly,” she says.

Coming up on his 18th year in the auto industry, Tanner Caouette currently serves as general manager and managing partner of Jaguar, Land Rover and Volvo Kelowna, as well as being a partner at Vernon Hyundai. He joined the Wyant Group in 2016, several years after moving to the Okanagan.

“No two days are the same,” he says of why he’s stayed in the industry so long. “It doesn’t matter the brand, or the situation. It’s just that you’re always dealing with people, and you’re changing people’s lives. You’re providing one of the biggest purchases in their life, and I like being a part of that.”

Despite admitting to being a bit of a workaholic, Tanner makes time to enjoy the many amenities in the Okanagan. An avid golfer, he also spends much of his leisure time with his wife and their three dogs.

“We take them paddle boarding. My wife’s better than I am, but we get out a few times a month,” he says, laughing. “I like to spend as much time on the lake as possible.”

The pair also makes a point of travelling when they have the chance.

“Every couple of years we try to do something that’s really out there,” says Tanner. “We went to South Africa in 2016, and Dubai in 2018. Dubai was just absolutely incredible. It’s hard to put into words. Everything is so opulent. We went to one of the biggest mosques in the world, and it was built with marble and 24-karat gold, and it’s just so amazing and beautiful, and so different.”

The 7 Sins

envy:

Whose shoes would you like to walk in?

Tom Brady. He’s a winner. The greatest quarterback of all time. And what’s more impressive is he’s been able to be at the top of his game for two decades. He was an underdog when he entered the NFL and has been able to overcome any and all obstacles. He’s evolved to succeed in today’s game, and he’s also one of the greatest leaders in the sport.

gluttony:

What is the food you could eat over and over again?

Pizza. I grew up in a small town, and I worked at a mom-and-pop pizza place while going to school. We used to experiment with all sorts of ingredients and would come up with some of the best (and worst) recipes. It is definitely my guilty pleasure food.

greed:

You’re given $1 million that you have to spend selfishly. What would you spend it on?

I would take my wife on a lavish holiday. There is so much of the world we have not seen, so I would want to experience some of the amazing sites this world has to offer. If there was any left over, I’d buy a classic Land Rover Defender.

wrath:

Pet peeves?

Bad service.

sloth:

Where would you spend a long time doing nothing?

Here. There’s so much to do in the Okanagan Valley, between the beaches, parks, lake, mountains, etc. I have three dogs and the only thing I need more of is time to “do nothing” with them.

pride:

What is the one thing you’re secretly proud of?

My mom. She is the most powerful woman I have ever met. She is my inspiration.

lust:

What makes your heart beat faster?

I know it’s cliché, but my wife. She is the perfect combination of sexy and sophisticated. After 12 years together, she still gets me fired up.

Live where you love.

That’s the theme of this year’s Grand Prizes in BC Children’s Hospital’s Choices Lottery: win the draw and you can choose your very own dream home in your favourite location – South Surrey (Morgan Creek), Tsawwassen, downtown Kelowna, Squamish, Vancouver (Olympic Village), Courtenay (Crown Isle), or downtown Victoria.

Or, you can choose $2.2 million tax-free cash.

“This year’s grand prize packages are the best yet!” says Erin Cebula, Choices Lottery spokesperson. “The home located in Morgan Creek, South Surrey, is truly one of a kid. It is 6,225 square feet, with four bedrooms, two guests suites, seven bathrooms, and a double-car garage.”

And there’s more to this year’s biggest biggest prize, built by Red Tree Creative Homes, in one of the province’s finest and most serene golf course communities: it features a gym and yoga room, high-tech features, and elegant styling and design, a main floor bar and even a personal library office – plus a jaw-dropping walk-in closet. And it comes in a $2.9 million Grand Prize package.

So, it’s a true suburban oasis. Or live in the heart of outdoor recreation – in a 3,656 square-foot ‘Sea-to-Sky’ home in Squamish – or in sunny Tsawwassen, with a modern home steps away from Centennial Beach. There’s also the downtown Kelowna option, with a brand-new condo at ONE Water Street, an exciting luxury development with views spanning Okanagan Lake.

And there are two Vancouver Island options – a home at Crown Isle golf and resort community in Courtenay, or a unique townhome in downtown Victoria, steps form the Legislature and James Bay!

And last but not least, one of this year’s most popular Grand Prize homes is a 3-bedroom condo at Pinnacle on the Park – a terrific chance to own Vancouver real estate in the heart of Olympic Village, False Creek:

1228,mapleridgenews,https://www.mapleridgenews.com/marketplace/say-cheese-this-denturist-brings-smiles-back-to-life/,Say cheese! This denturist brings smiles back to life – Maple Ridge News,'Mar.',2020-03-02,"Visit Danielle Ramos at the new Lower Mainland Denture Centre at C2-12460 191 St. in Pitt Meadows.

Danielle Ramos is very artistic and good with her hands. With those skills in mind, what would you guess is her ideal career?

The answer, believe it or not, is denturist!

“I love working with my hands, and when I make dentures I have to consider every detail,” Ramos says. “I’m rebuilding someone’s smile.”

Every person’s smile is different, and Ramos hand crafts dentures to custom fit each client. Square teeth, tapering, each facet is important to get all the details just right, and that takes an artistic touch.

“I love that I can combine the craft of building the dentures with being able to interact and care for my patients.” Ramos calls herself a “teeth geek” and is happy to chat about dental health.

“People are welcome to stop by my new office just for a chat or some guidance. If I can’t help them I will make sure to direct them to someone who can,” she says.

From Brazil to Pitt Meadows

Ramos was born and raised in Brazil, and moved to Canada in 2004. After a few years working as a live-nanny she was accepted to a very competitive denturist program.

“I felt really privileged to be chosen,” she says.

Soon after graduating in 2011 she started her mobile clinic, bringing dentures to patients around the Lower Mainland with house calls and hospital visits. Ramos is also a Board Member at the Denturist Association of BC and has been a pre-clinical instructor at CDI College since 2016. While she’s committed to continuing the mobile clinic, she’s also excited to be opening the Lower Mainland Denture Centre in Pitt Meadows to better serve that community.

“I’m happy to be in Pitt Meadows, I love the little community here. It’s also quite under-served as before I opened, people had to travel over 30 minutes to get dentures from a denture specialist,” she says.

Dentures make you smile

Through her work at the Lower Mainland Denture Centre Ramos has experienced firsthand how crucial dentures are to a person’s health and wellbeing.

“When you’re sick, a big part of getting better is being able to eat — being able to enjoy your favourite foods,” Ramos says, and a comfortable set of dentures can help. “People think that just older people get dentures, but my youngest client is 20 years old. People might lose their teeth from medication they took, injuries, or accidents.”

You rely on your teeth your whole life, and that means your need for dentures could happen at any age. But dentures help with more than just nutrition.

“A good pair of dentures gives you confidence. The ability to speak and the ability to smile. In your everyday life how would it be if you weren’t able to smile? Getting a job, public speaking, dating and finding a partner. We use our smiles for everything.”

To learn more, stop by the brand new Lower Mainland Denture Centre at C2-12460 191 St, right next to Hwy 7, call 604-457-3763, or email info@lowermainlanddenture.ca.

Guy can help you find your family’s next home here as well, just give him a shout at 778-868-7448.

With growth and change ongoing, do you wonder about the value of your Langley home?

Housing values in new and established neighbourhoods have nowhere to go but up, predicts Guy Biggar with Guy Biggar Real Estate and Langley Luxury Estates. He has not only helped luxury property sellers achieve record prices since arriving in the city, he’s worked with clients buy and sell properties at all price points. Guy’s experience tells him the area is primed for further growth.

“Langley is drastically undervalued and Lower Mainland developers are actively looking to the Fraser Valley, based on the availability of land and its comparatively lower price,” he says.

Guy Biggar | Profile Film from 360hometours.ca on Vimeo.

Added interest affects your home’s value

This kind of demand, and interest from people looking to move to Langley to enjoy everything it offers families, plus future development, is driving up home values and selling prices, Guy notes. “The 200th Street corridor from Highway 10 to Highway 1 has become like the West Broadway of Langley. All the big players are coming to town and putting millions of dollars of infrastructure in place. That has an impact on residential real estate values,” he says.

Families putting down roots

Besides his passion for real estate, health/fitness and family are at the top of Guy’s priority list. Married with an infant son, he and his wife chose Langley as a great place to settle down and raise a family.

A former firefighter and Canadian Armed Forces officer who loves to play recreational hockey in his spare time and is a former competitive athlete, Guy likes the mix of amenities and services. And their young family represents the kind of people the community is attracting. “We love living in the Fraser Valley, especially the community atmosphere and the space to roam,” he says.

Modern marketing gives you the edge

Whether you’re curious about your home’s value or your life situation is changing, Guy invites you to contact him for a consultation. He uses the latest technologies to promote his clients’ properties, including incorporating video to boost your home’s appeal. Injecting his colourful personality into the mix and showing your home in this unique way – drone photography is a specialty – are among the ways his experience and energy help get the most for your home.

“Whether you’re looking to sell a luxury home, a large acreage or a condominium, our state-of-the-art marketing program sets the bar higher and gives you high exposure for your property,” Guy says.

While he embraces technology and social media, he often draws on lessons learned from his father Gerry and uncle Larry, who spent more than 40 years in the business in Richmond, where Guy grew up. “It’s quite a family affair. They were phenomenal mentors for me, especially when I started out nine years ago.”

1320,langleyadvancetimes,https://www.langleyadvancetimes.com/marketplace/building-new-confidence-can-be-this-easy/,Building new confidence can be this easy! – Langley Advance Times,'Mar.',2020-03-02,"Toastmasters experience is a great way to gain confidence, whether you’re just starting out life or well into retirement.

Gaining confidence in yourself can have a positive effect in every area of your life.

Toastmasters International, which has nearly 30 clubs between Langley and Surrey, can take credit for creating its fair share of confident people, through its programs teaching public speaking, communication and leadership skills, says Michael Bown, a District Director in B.C. for the organization.

“We support people with a number of things, but communications and leadership are the bread and butter, all resulting in greater confidence,” he says.

Nervous? Don’t worry, you’re supported

If you’re feeling uneasy about being in a space where speaking to others is a central element, you’ll be glad to learn guests are not required to speak at their first meeting. “We want people to sit back, listen, observe and enjoy the meeting,” Bown says. “They can speak when they’re ready as it’s a self-paced program. The clubs provide a supportive and positive learning experience, and everyone is trying to improve each other.”

Modern education tools available online

If you haven’t investigated Toastmasters in a while or are just starting to get curious, its Pathways educational program may be new to you. Its 11 project-based categories range from dynamic leadership and effective coaching to innovative planning and visionary communication. Using an online assessment tool that helps determine a Path, you pick the area you’d like to improve on and follow the steps. “Pathways uses modern methods to cater to people’s specific needs and learning styles,” Bown says. “If someone wants to grow in public speaking, there’s a focus on that, or communication, management skills and more.”

Plenty of experience to draw from

Not only has ToastmastersInternational been around since 1924, the organization today has nearly 300 clubs in British Columbia alone. Within them you’ll find a mix of in-house corporate programs and community clubs, and a lot of wisdom and expertise from longtime members who have helped others achieve their public speaking, communication and leadership goals.

Get your message across in a big way

One of the exciting things happening right now within Toastmasters, Bown says, is the International Speech Contest. Individual clubs are in the process of holding in-house competitions, and winners advance through various local, District and International levels, ultimately competing in the World Championship of Public Speaking in Paris this August! Not everyone is expected to compete, but Bown says the competitions offer a good opportunity for members and their guests to hear some inspirational speaking.

1407,abbynews,https://www.abbynews.com/marketplace/renting-in-abbotsford-your-next-home-is-close-to-everything/,Renting in Abbotsford? Your next home is close to everything! – Abbotsford News,'Mar.',2020-03-16,"Open concept living is yours at the Grand Skymark rental building in East Abbotsford, due for overall completion in the coming weeks.

When you’re searching for your next home, location is everything, they say.

The same can be said for rental accommodation, especially in busy East Abbotsford, where a 103-unit residence is in the final stages of construction on Eleanor Avenue. The Grand Skymark is being built in the heart of this desirable and growing neighbourhood by longtime Abbotsford family company, Anjalie Developments.

Walking distance to many things

Andy Martens Jr., a director with Anjalie, says Grand Skymark’s location – steps from the thriving Sumas Way corridor – and its modern living spaces are so far appealing to everyone from singles and students to couples and families. Especially so, given the shortage of rental opportunities in the neighbourhood.

“You’re within a two-block walk of The Old Spaghetti Factory, The Keg, Cactus Club and many other restaurants, the post office, a walk-in medical clinic and a liquor store, as well as Save-On Foods and four banks,” Andy says. “Not only that, you’re three miles south to the border, two minutes from Highway 1 and a short drive or bike ride to the University of the Fraser Valley.”

Suite sizes to suit your lifestyle

Grand Skymark’s rental units start at $950 a month and range from compact micro-suite bachelors to one-, two- and three-bedroom homes – the sixth-floor corner units are close to 1,600 square feet and feature vaulted ceilings, lofts and amazing views! With nine different open-concept floor plans to choose from, you’ve got a variety of options, whether you’re looking for simplicity or need room to spread out. As Andy says, sharing a spacious three-bedroom suite three ways can make it affordable for all!

Modern interiors, well-appointed kitchens

Standard features designed for all-season comfort include a vinyl plank flooring/carpeting combination, premium blinds, in-suite laundry and oversized showers – many units have fireplaces! The kitchens include an all-Whirlpool major appliance set, subway tile backsplash, soft-close cupboards and drawers, and extensive pot lighting. And the centre island or extended eating bar concept in every suite provides handy mealtime or entertaining options!

Built-in security and safety, bonus from Telus

In the controlled-entrance underground parking garage there’s 125 stalls, plus several charging stations for electric vehicles. Outside, find ample visitor parking and an outdoor common area. Located at the end of a quiet street and with premium soundproofing built in, this building offers peaceful living, close to everything. And all tenants for the first year receive free internet/cable through an agreement with Telus!

With the four-storey East Wing completed, stop by and tour a suite now. To register your interest online to receive updates, visit grandskymark.com/register, or for more information, call 604-302-2082 or email info@grandskymark.com. You can also follow Grand Skymark on Facebook.

Photo: Toyota

When is a new car really new? That question might be on the minds of new-car buyers as they scope out the 2020 Volkswagen Passat

When is a new car really new? That question might be on the minds of new-car buyers as they scope out the 2020 Volkswagen Passat.

The Passat could be called a second-tier midsize sedan, meaning it falls below the line in popularity compared with top-rung models such as the Toyota Camry, Honda Accord, Hyundai Sonata and the Nissan Altima. But with increasing preferences for utility vehicles, few if any of these class members are experiencing upticks in sales.

For the Passat’s first redesign of any significance since the 2012 model year, VW has chosen to rework the car in subtle ways. Most body panels, including the hood, fenders and door-panel skins, are new, and the headlights and taillights are more elegantly shaped. But what’s most noticeable is the enlarged and aggressive-looking grille as well as the swept-back roofline that Volkswagen now considers “coupe-like.”

The net effect is a sedan that’s more attractive while still retaining its longstanding understated appearance.

Revisions to the Passat’s passenger compartment are a bit more obvious. There’s a new control panel that looks decidedly high style. Only the gauges and the driver-information screen interrupt the ventilation outlets, which extend ribbon-like across the full width of the dashboard. A new glass-covered 6.3-inch touch-screen (on the smallish side in this class) comes with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity.

Beneath the sheetmetal, the Passat remains unaltered, unlike the versions sold in Europe and China that are built using VW’s latest MBQ platform. So it’s no surprise that all key measurements — length, width, trunk room and distance between the front and rear wheels — closely mirror those of the outgoing sedan.

Most sedans in the Passat’s class offer two or more powertrain options (including hybrid choices) and some even make all-wheel-drive available. The Passat offers only a turbocharged 2.0-litre four-cylinder that makes 174 horsepower. For 2020, there’s a new torque converter for the transmission plus software updates for the engine’s electronic controls. Torque output increases to 206 pound-feet from 184.

Carrying over is the six-speed automatic transmission that directs power to the front wheels.

Fuel economy is rated at 10.2 l/100 km in the city, 6.9 on the highway and 8.7 combined.

The base Passat Comfortline starts at $29,000 in Canada, including destination charges. It comes with just the basics including air conditioning, heated front seats and a few power-operated items.

The Highline adds dual-zone climate control, leatherette upholstery (instead of cloth) and power trunk lid and 17-inch wheels (16-inch wheels are standard.

On the safety front, the Highline also gets automatic emergency braking, pedestrian detection plus blind-spot monitoring that alerts when other vehicles are approaching from the rear in adjacent lanes.

The Execline ($38,400) tops out with power sunroof, power passenger seat and heated rear seats (all seats are leather covered), automatic high-beam headlights, navigation and premium six-speaker Fender-brand audio. In addition, 19-inch wheels are standard.

Execline buyers also get lane-keeping assist plus adaptive cruise control that maintains a safe distance to the vehicle in front and adaptive headlights that pivot as the Passat turns.

Paddle shifters and a rear spoiler are Execline options, along with an R Line package. It includes a unique grille, rear spoiler, brushed stainless steel pedals and aluminum door sills.

Ultimately, it doesn’t matter if the Volkswagen Passat is considered entirely new or merely revised. As well, the lack of a hybrid or an all-wheel-drive option might not be of great concern.

What counts most is the sedan’s style, roominess, content, economy of operation and reasonable price point. With these virtues, the Passat stands a better chance of ending up in more driveways.

What you should know: 2020 Volkswagen Passat

Type: Front-wheel-drive midsize sedan

Engine (h.p.): 2.0-litre DOHC I-4, turbocharged (174)

Transmission: Six-speed automatic

Market position: Domestic automakers have curtailed the midsize-sedan class (Ford’s is abandoning it completely), but the remaining players continue to introduce significantly new or revised models as they battle for market share.

Points: Modest redesign departs only slightly from the previous model. • New interior styling adds more high-tech accessories. • Base turbocharged four-cylinder engine makes more torque than before, but falls short of most competitors’ outputs. • Lack of performance, hybrid options and AWD could limit buyer interest.

Active safety: Blind-spot warning with cross-traffic backup alert (opt.); active cruise control (opt.); emergency braking (opt); pedestrian detection (opt.)

The all-wheel-drive hybrid uses a four-cylinder gasoline engine instead of the previous V-6, which means a big loss in total system power but an increase in fuel economy of a claimed 19 per cent. Photo: Toyota

Comfort, roominess and capability are the 2020 Toyota Highlander’s key strengths, as they have been for the past 18 model years.

When it arrived for 2002, the Highlander was one of the initial part-car, part-sport-utility-vehicle models on the market. By the time a third-row seat was added a couple of years later, it had become one of the most popular Toyota vehicles.

The previous Highlander’s oversized trapezoid-style grille was not its most welcoming feature, but the nosepiece of the new fourth-generation model improves on that misstep and could serve as a template for future Toyota vehicles. The remainder of the body, from the hood to the liftgate, is also more attractive and correctly conveys a sense that the Highlander is a quality machine.

That also goes for the roomier cabin. A bigger vehicle means an increase in the second-row seat’s fore and aft travel to 11 centimetres from 8.6. That means more legroom. As before, there’s space for eight passengers, or seven when the second-row bucket seats replace the standard bench seat.

The Highlander’s dashboard is more dramatically shaped with an available 12.3-inch touch-screen that juts out, right next to the luminescent gauges. An 8.0-inch screen is standard for most other trims.

Underpinning the Highlander is Toyota’s New Global Architecture that the automaker claims is stiffer and helps deliver a quieter ride plus a smaller turning circle.

Revised powertrain offerings start with a 3.5-litre V-6 that carries over from 2019 and makes 295 horsepower and 263 pound-feet of torque.

The optional hybrid model constitutes significant change for the Highlander. Replacing the previous 306-horsepower V-6/electric-motor combo is a 2.5-litre four-cylinder with two integrated electric motors for a net system output of 243 horsepower. This is far less punch than outgoing system, but Toyota says the all-wheel-drive hybrid’s estimated 6.7 l/100 km in combined city/highway driving is 19 per cent better. Gasoline Highlanders achieve an estimated 10.3 l/100 km, combined.

The hybrid’s more compact (but more energy-dense) battery pack is located beneath the rear seats so there’s no loss of stowage or passenger space.

The V-6 is linked to an eight-speed automatic transmission, while a continuously variable unit with Normal, Eco and Sport modes is standard with the hybrid models.

For 2020, three different AWD systems are available. The L , LE and XLE trims ship up to 50 per cent of the engine torque to the rear wheels when the front wheels begin to slip.

The Dynamic Torque Vectoring AWD, optional for the Limited and Platinum trims, can vary the rear torque between the left and right wheels (the torque-vectoring part) for increased control when turning. Mud & Sand and Rock & Dirt modes are part of the system, as is a Rear Driveline Disconnect feature that unhooks the driveshaft from the rear wheels when not needed, which conserves fuel.

The hybrid’s AWD uses an electric motor mounted in back. It powers the rear wheels when accelerating and while cornering, for added control.

Highlander pricing starts at $41,800, including destination charges, for the base L and includes heated front power driver’s seat and a wide assortment of active-safety features.

From that point, both content levels and prices climb steadily, topping out with the $55,800 Platinum trim, which includes self-leveling headlamps, heated second-row seats, panoramic moonroof, surround-view camera, heated and ventilated front seats, and a head-up information display for the driver.

Note that all but the base L trim can be ordered with hybrid propulsion.

The 2020 Highlander might look radically different from the outgoing model, but its advancements in useable space, technology and fuel economy are really what make this a standout utility vehicle.

What you should know: 2020 Toyota Highlander

Type: Front-/ all-wheel-drive utility vehicle

Engines (h.p.): 3.5-litre DOHC V-6 (295); 2.5-litre DOHC I-4 with electric motors (243)

Transmissions: Eight-speed automatic; continuously variable (CVT, hybrid)

Market position: The Highlander is considered one of the top-performing family utility vehicles on the market and is also viewed as one of the roomiest and most technologically advanced.

Points: Major redesign improves the looks, especially at the front end. • Standard V-6 engine delivers plenty of power, while optional hybrid system places greater emphasis on lowering fuel consumption. • Added cargo space makes for a more versatile vehicle. • Toyota’s quality reputation and strong resale values contribute to the Highlander’s popularity.

Driver assist: Blind-spot warning with cross-traffic backup alert (opt.); active cruise control (std.); emergency braking (std.); pedestrian detection (std.); lane-departure alert/intervention (std.)

Does is matter? – Chilliwack Progress,'Mar.',2020-03-18,"The T8 eAWD blends two electric motors with a 2.0-litre internal-combustion engine to produce 400 horsepower and an estimated 4.2 l/100 km in combined city/highway driving.

Volvo has maintained a strong relationship with buyers who appreciate understated elegance along with the automaker’s abiding concern for safety

Through decades of ups and a few downs, Volvo has maintained a strong relationship with buyers who appreciate understated elegance along with the automaker’s abiding concern for safety. The 2020 XC60 epitomizes both of these values along with leading-edge technological advancements.

The utility vehicle is one of a quartet of Volvos with a 60 suffix in the name, including the S60 sedan, V60 wagon and V60 Cross Country wagon.

The XC60 (XC stands for cross country) seems somewhat duplicitous since the V60 Cross Country also comes with a hike-up stance, but the five-passenger XC falls into the tall-wagon bracket. It’s sort of a junior version of the seven-passenger XC90 and with the current utility-vehicle craze will ultimately be more popular than the V60.

In terms of design, however, the V60 and V60 Cross Country arguably get the nod over the square-ish XC60, but the XC dominates in terms of cargo and passenger capacity even though it’s noticeably shorter.

You know a Volvo is a Volvo by the way the interior is designed, especially the XC60’s standard leather-covered seats with power lumbar support. The suggestion here is that aching backs after long drives just might become a thing of the past.

A vertically positioned 23-centimetre touch-screen is the centrepiece of a clean and tidy dashboard that’s notably absent of knobs and dials. The XC60 retains an actual shift lever instead of buttons.

The standard eight-speed automatic transmission is part of the three available powertrains.

A turbocharged 2.0-litre four-cylinder — called the T5 — is found in the base all-wheel-drive Momentum. It makes 250 horsepower and 258 pound-feet of torque.

The T6 R-Design’s turbocharged and supercharged version of the 2.0 puts out 316 horsepower and 295 pound-feet. At lower engine speeds, the supercharger alone provides the boost, but above 3,000 rpm the turbocharger joins in.

The top performer is the T8 Inscription eAWD plug-in hybrid that puts out 400 horsepower and 472 pound-feet of torque. The system’s front and rear electric motors — supported by a lithium-ion battery pack — contributes 87 horsepower to the hybrid’s output and can operate independently of the internal-combustion engine for up to a claimed 27 kilometres.

Opt for the Polestar Engineered and the T8’s output climbs to 415 horses and 494 pound-feet. Polestar is a Volvo offshoot that specializes in electric vehicles. The T8 eAWD has the greatest output of all available powertrains and also has the lowest fuel consumption. Volvo estimates 4.2 l/100 km in combined city and highway driving. By comparison, the T5 is rated at 9.9 l/100 km, combined.

Pricing for the Momentum starts at $48,400 and, along with the leather seats, includes a panoramic sunroof and power-operated tailgate.

The R-Design has a sport-tuned suspension, blacked-out grille and trim, premium leather seats and 19-inch wheels.

The Inscription is topped up with chrome exterior trim, unique “Driftwood” interior finishings, Harmon Kardon-brand sound system and there’s more electronic active-safety features to help avoid collisions, or at least mitigate them.

At the pinnacle of the XC60 lineup, the $91,200 Polestar Engineered comes with beefier brakes, 21-inch wheels (22s are optional), high-end Bowers and Wilkins audio package, and shock absorbers that are manually adjustable to one of 22 firmness settings. The fact that they can’t be electronically controlled from inside the XC60 likely means that few buyers will bother fiddling with them once the novelty wears off.

On the options list is Volvo’s semi-autonomous Pro Pilot assist that handles steering and braking on well-marked highways at speeds up to 130 km/h.

If your taste in luxury automobiles tends to eschew the usual mainstream contenders from Germany and Japan, Volvo is certainly worth considering and the XC60 makes a solid starting point.

What you should know: 2020 Volvo XC60

Type: Four-door, all-wheel-drive utility vehicle

Engines (h.p.): 2.0-litre DOHC I-4, turbocharged (250); 2.0-litre DOHC I-4, supercharged and turbocharged (316); 2.0-litre DOHC I-4, supercharged and turbocharged with electric assist (400/415)

Transmission: Eight-speed automatic

Market position: For much of its existence, Volvo has taken an uncommon approach in automobile design and engineering. Vehicles such as the XC60 dare to be different in terms of powertrains, styling and safety content.

Points: Attractive redesign is as good or better than the competition. • Top-notch interior comfort reinforces luxury image. • Unorthodox forced-induction systems for the 2.0 engine creates more instant throttle-pedal response. • Standard content begins at the luxury level and just goes up. • An odd mix of standard and optional active- safety systems. • Plug-in hybrid is tops in power and fuel economy.

Active safety: Blind-spot detection with backup assist (std.); active cruise control (std.); pedestrian detection (std.); lane-keeping mitigation (opt.)

Photo: FCA

There’s nothing ‘eco’ about 6,000 pounds of metal and glass, but it hauls more than its gasoline counterparts and has decent fuel economy

The last two model years have seen the adoption of turbo-diesel engines by all domestic-based light-duty pickup brands. That includes the Ram 1500 turbo-diesel that returns to the group for 2020 following a one-year time-out.

In the automotive world, the pickup category is the most hotly contested. Millions are sold in North America every year. Of those, about 95 per cent are made by Ford, General Motors (Chevrolet and GMC) and the Ram division of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA). The stakes are huge.

The Ram 1500 has made quite a name for itself lately, winning numerous awards and accolades. That and some aggressive marketing has translated into steady sales growth along with a corresponding increase in respect among truck shoppers.

The only piece missing was the turbo-diesel that disappeared for the 2019 model year, primarily due to emission-related issues. But now the so-called EcoDiesel has returned, with added trailer-tugging and cargo-load capacities.

So how do the numbers stack up? The Ram’s made-in-Italy 3.0-litre V-6 puts out 260 horsepower and 480 pound-feet of torque, which is a gain of eight per cent and 14 per cent, respectively. A new turbocharger, redesigned fuel injectors and pistons and increased compression ratio are credited with the improved performance.

The Ford F150 turbo-diesel (also a 3.0-litre V-6) delivers 250 horsepower and 440 pound-feet, and GM’s 3.0-litre inline six-cylinder turbo-diesel in the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra has 277 horsepower and 460 pound-feet. Yes, the numbers are close, but the Ram holds a definite edge in the crucial torque department.

It’s also a horse race for official fuel economy. GM leads the pack at 8.9 l/100 km in combined city/highway driving, followed by Ram at 9.7 and Ford at 9.8.

The EcoDiesel’s maximum payload and towing capacities have increased to 1,045 and 5,710 kilograms, respectively, from 855 and 4,027 kilograms.

The EcoDiesel can be specified with all Ram body styles and box sizes, including the extended-length Quad Cab and four-door Crew Cab models. A two-door regular-cab version is also available, but only for fleet customers. Most trim levels can be outfitted with the diesel, too, including the Sport and off-road-oriented Rebel.

Aside from the diesel, the Ram is available with a 3.5-litre V-6 that produces 305 horsepower and 269 pound-feet of torque. That can be temporarily increased by up to 90 pound-feet with a belt-drive 48-volt “eTorque” motor/generator. This mild-hybrid system replaces the traditional alternator and uses a lithium-ion battery to add power under hard acceleration.

Optional is a 5.7-litre V-8 that delivers 395 horsepower and 410 pound-feet, and when equipped with eTorque it has slightly more towing capacity than the EcoDiesel at 5,795 kilograms.

All Ram engines are linked to eight-speed automatic transmissions.

Aside from what’s under the hood, the 2020 Ram 1500 has no shortage of tricks up its sleeves to be competitive. The optional air suspension can raise or lower the ride height and keep the truck level when it’s loaded.

Then there’s the trick multi-function tailgate. The split design allows you to open either or both sides, or you can drop the tailgate as a single unit for loading/unloading larger and/or longer objects.

The interior can also be loaded with luxury amenities and a dominating 30-centimetre touch-screen that’s so large it can be split into two screens. It looks intimidating, but the layout is intuitive and the system is easy to use.

Ram EcoDiesel pricing starts at $51,300, including destination charges. That’s about $5,200 more than the base gasoline V-6 and $3,250 more than V8-equipped Rams.

If your work and/or play requirements call for plenty of torque-rich pulling and hauling performance while keeping fuel consumption in check, the updated EcoDiesel option will be most welcome.

What you should know: 2020 Ram 1500 EcoDiesel

Type: Two- /four-door, rear- /four-wheel-drive light-duty pickup

Engine (h.p.): 3.0-litre DOHC V-6, turbo-diesel (260)

Transmission; Eight-speed automatic

Market position: The benefits of diesel power are fuel efficiency and low-speed pulling power. There’s 480 pound-feet of peak torque available at 1,600 rpm. By contrast, the 5.7-litre gasoline V-8 is rated at 410 pound-feet and at a much higher 3,950 revs. The diesel costs more to buy, though.

Points: Redesigned turbo-diesel engine provides greater efficiency and pulling power. • The cost for the optional powerplant seems high, but it more or less in line with competitive turbo-diesel models. • For now, the competition plays second-fiddle for peak torque. • Interior leans on the premium side, especially the oversize U-Connect touch-screen.

Driver assist: Blind-spot warning with cross-traffic backup alert (std.); active cruise control (opt.); emergency braking (opt.); lane departure warning (std.)

1461,theprogress,https://www.theprogress.com/autos/what-you-should-know-subaru-legacy/,What you should know: Subaru Legacy – Chilliwack Progress,'Mar.',2020-03-06,"Aside from some subtle exterior styling changes, the 2020 Legacy looks much like the 2019 model. Continuing with tradition, the base price includes all-wheel-drive. Photo: Subaru

Subaru has its utility vehicles, but this all-wheel-drive sedan could be its best value

Sedans in general are somewhat of a hard sell lately, but that shouldn’t necessarily be the case with the 2020 Subaru Legacy. Providing space and security for five passengers is its primary function, and transporting them over a variety of terrain is well within its comfort zone.

Other mainstream automakers have tried offering all-wheel-drive as an option to their non-luxury sedans, with mixed results, but Subaru’s growing success partially rests on its Symmetrical AWD that’s standard in all models, except the BRZ sport coupe. And Subaru does so while still remaining competitively priced.

The seventh-generation Legacy isn’t significantly different from the previous iteration, but subtle changes to both ends of the car as well as restyled fenders and doors combine to make for a more appealing package.

As with most of the lineup, including the also-new 2020 Outback wagon, the Legacy is constructed using the Subaru Global Platform that’s claimed to do a better job providing comfort, driving agility and collision protection. The front and rear suspension components have also been engineered to deliver more precise handling and fewer jarring incidents on rough roads.

The new Legacy is now fractions longer between the front and rear wheels as well as in overall length and width. The cabin provides about the same ample legroom and headroom as before, but the dashboard has a more organic look and feel. All Legacy models except for the base come with a vertically orientated 11.6-inch touch-screen that somewhat resembles an Apple iPad. And since it’s not angled toward the driver, the various communications, infotainment and ventilation settings are fully accessible to front passengers and visible to those in back. The base Legacy comes with a seven-inch screen.

For 2020, the engine choices consist of a 2.5-litre four-cylinder that puts out 182 horsepower and 176 pound-feet of torque. It’s standard in all but the top two trims, which are fitted with a turbocharged 2.4-litre four-cylinder producing a healthy 260 horsepower and 277 pound-feet.

Both engines connect to continuously variable transmissions with eight simulated gears controlled by steering-wheel paddle shifters. (An actual shift lever is located in the centre console.)

For best fuel economy, the base 2.5 is rated at 8.8 l/100 km in the city, 6.7 on the highway and 7.9 combined.

The AWD’s active torque vectoring system applies light braking to the inside front wheel when cornering, allowing the car to turn better.

At $28,600 (including destination charges and fees), the base Legacy Convenience comes with a partial lineup of dynamic safety technologies such as emergency braking, adaptive cruise control (maintains a safe distance from the vehicle in front) and lane-departure warning.

The Touring gets dual-zone climate control, heated front seats (power-operated for the driver), windshield de-icer and 17-inch alloy wheels that replace the steel versions.

The Limited gets 18-inch wheels, a unique grille and rear bumper, aluminum pedal covers and LED fog lights. A power passenger seat and auto-leveling and pivoting headlights are also part of the equipment list.

The Limited GT and the Premier GT come with a power moonroof and distracted-driver mitigation, along with the turbo four-cylinder (the same engine is used in the seven-passenger Subaru Ascent utility vehicle).

As the sportiest choice, the turbo GT trims deliver plenty of zip and they hold tight in the curves with minimal body lean. The Legacy’s cabin is also a quiet place with very little bothersome road or wind noise. The one complaint would be the numb steering that somewhat detracts from the car’s driving enjoyment.

That quibble aside, the Legacy’s mix of comfort, spaciousness and performance is equal to, or better than, other midsize sedans, with the added benefit of all-weather and all-road mastery.

What you should know: 2020 Subaru Legacy

Type: All-wheel-drive midsize sedan

Engines (h.p.): 2.5-litre DOHC H-4 (182); 2.4-litre DOHC H-4, turbocharged (260)

Transmission: Continuously variable (CVT)

Market position: Amongst its peers, the Legacy is the only sedan with standard all-wheel-drive: It’s also included in nearly every Subaru, which has helped the automaker steadily increase sales and market share.

Points: New styling varies slightly from the previous edition, but is still more attractive. • Interior appointments are near-luxury and the various controls are easily mastered. • Base engine delivers decent power, but the turbocharged engine steals the show. • All Subaru needs to do now is add a hybrid version to the lineup.

Active safety: Blind-spot warning with cross-traffic backup alert (opt.); active cruise control (std.); emergency braking (std.); inattentive driver alert (opt.)

L/100 km (city/hwy) 8.8/6.7 (2.5); Base price (incl. destination) $28,600

BY COMPARISON

Nissan Altima

Base price: $29,950

Nissan’s midsize sedan matches the Legacy with standard all-wheel-drive.

Kia Optima

Base price: $30,300

Great style, a roomy interior and non-turbo, turbo and hybrid engine choices.

Honda Accord

Base price: $30,300

One of the most popular sedans offers two turbo I-4 engines plus hybrid option.

1462,theprogress,https://www.theprogress.com/autos/a-bmw-toyota-collaboration-clearly-benefits-both-brands/,Toyota collaboration clearly benefits both brands – Chilliwack Progress,'Mar.',2020-03-06,"The Z4 is a gorgeous piece of art, especially in a matte colour that shows off the curves and edges. Not so noticeable is a 10-centimetre increase in front track width and 6.5 centimetres at the rear. Photo: BMW

A BMW-Toyota partnership creates two vehicles so dramatically different that they’re impossible to compare

Three years isn’t an overly long time to wait for a new or renewed model to arrive. It must have felt like an eternity, however, for die-hard BMW fans awaiting a new Z4 sports car. They went cold turkey from model years 2017 to 2019 after the previous Z4 retired.

Worse still, fans of the Toyota Supra sport coupe have spent more than two decades wondering if and when their favourite nameplate would reemerge.

Well, the wait for both models has ended, thanks to a new platform jointly engineered by both automakers.

For Toyota, a modern interpretation of the Supra coupe was the goal, while BMW’s stylists crafted a two-seat-convertible shape that’s particularly stunning. The up-sweep of the Z4’s body creases flair out just above the taillight lenses, while the rocker panels are cut upward in the same fashion. Add an aggressive-looking nose with dominating air intakes, and the new Z4 makes a bold statement with a more substantial stance.

It’s about 10 centimetres longer than the previous convertible (most of that increase is ahead of the engine bay) although the distance between the front and rear wheels is reduced by about 2.5 centimetres.

The distance between the left and right tires — the track width — has been upped by nearly 10 centimetres in the front and 6.5 centimetres at the rear.

BMW states the design achieves a 50:50 front-rear weight balance, which is considered ideal for handling control and ride comfort.

The Z4’s power soft-top deviates from the previous version’s rather complex folding setup. The new top weighs less, which helps lower the car’s centre of gravity, and takes up less room when folded, which means increased (by 50 per cent) trunk space. The top can also be opened and closed at vehicle speeds of up to 50 km/h.

The aluminum-trimmed dashboard is elegant and the controls are straightforward. There’s a 12.3-inch gauge display plus a 10.25-inch information/navigation screen controlled by BMW’s iDrive rotary dial on the centre console, just to the right of the shifter.

The sDrive30i runs with a 2.0-litre turbocharged four-cylinder that’s rated at 255 horsepower and 295 pound-feet of torque. The more performance-oriented M40i is equipped with a turbocharged 3.0-litre inline six-cylinder that puts out 382 horsepower and 369 pound-feet.

Comfort, Sport and Sport+ modes — optional with the sDrive30i and standard with the M40i — adjust engine, transmission and steering responses according to driver preferences. A locking differential maintains equal torque split between the rear wheels, which BMW says makes for greater cornering precision.

Those who prefer to shift for themselves will be saddened that a manual gearbox is not offered. Your only transmission choice is an eight-speed automatic with manual controls.

The four-cylinder model will accelerate to 60 mph (96 km/h) from rest in a BMW-recorded 5.2 seconds, while the six-cylinder cuts that time to 3.9 seconds.

The four-cylinder sDrive30i will be the thriftiest of the pair, although final numbers for it haven’t been released. Consumption for the M40i is known, however: 10.3 l/100 km in the city and 8.0 on the highway.

For $65,450 (including destination charges and fees), the base Z4 gets a 10-speaker audio system plus some active-safety technologies such as forward-collision warning (with low-speed braking), pedestrian detection and lane-departure warning. A Driver Assistance Package with dynamic cruise control, blind-spot detection and rear cross-traffic alert is optional, as are M sport seats (more side bolstering), premium Harmon Kardon-brand audio and 19-inch wheels (18 inchers are standard).

Also available is a back-up assistant that will automatically steer the Z4 into a parking spot while the driver controls only the accelerator and brake pedal.

The BMW/Toyota collaboration has clearly benefited both brands, but if fun in an attractive wrapper is what you seek, the Z4 makes a great choice.

What you should know: 2020 BMW Z4

Type: Two-door roadster

Engines (h.p.): 2.0-litre DOHC I-4, turbocharged (255)

3.0-litre DOHC I-6, turbocharged (382)

Transmission: Eight-speed automatic

Market position: The joint effort between BMW and Toyota in platform engineering and development has resulted in the creation of two very individual sports models that go their own way in design and purpose.

Points: The execution of the roadster’s looks is head turning. • Interior design is classic BMW, with straightforward modern controls. • Base turbo I-4 provides plenty of power, but the turbo I-6 delivers much greater output. • The lack of a manual transmission for either powerplant will be a disappointment for some. • More size makes the Z4 more useable.

Driver assist: Lane-departure warning (std.); emergency braking (std.); pedestrian detection (std.); Blind-spot warning with cross-traffic backup alert (opt.); active cruise control (opt.);

L/100 km (city/hwy) 10.3/8.0 (M40i); Base price (incl. destination) $65,450

BY COMPARISON

Porsche 718 Boxster

Base price: $67,600

Mid-engine roadster is available with outputs ranging from 300 to 414 h.p.

Jaguar F-Type convertible

Base price: $76,200

Roadster and coupe models come with four-, six- and eight-cylinder engines.

Toyota GR Supra

Base price: $66,750

Basically a coupe version of the Z4, but has 20 more h.p. than the sDrive30i.

Stop by this weekend for the Grand Re-Opening!

Kimberley Byers may be the new owner of Creekside Home Decor, but she’s not a new face. She’s been working at the beloved store since it opened in 2002 — and she worked at the sister store in Abbotsford before that. What’s more, former owner Gail Roscoe is NOT going to be a former employee now that Byers is in charge. You’ll still be able to visit with Roscoe when the store re-opens in March.

“Gail’s still working with us, and I’m really happy for that. I couldn’t have done it without her,” Byers says.

Roscoe is stepping back from ownership to focus on her family, and Byers is stepping up with fresh ideas for the space.

Refresh for spring

“We’re bringing in new furniture, new lighting, fresh paint, and a lot of new products,” Byers says. “We know people love the old store and you can be sure with our new renovations the store will still be warm and cozy with a modern farmhouse feel. We’re just re-configuring the layout so it makes more sense.”

The back of the store with all the primitive country decor will stay the same, but Byers is rearranging the rest. When the store re-opens on March 5 you’ll find an expanded baby section, lots of new stock including luxury bedding from Canadian brand Brunelli and popular classics Country Affair candles.

“We’re keeping your familiar favourites and bringing in a whole bunch of new stuff so we’re fresh and ready for spring,” Byers says. In January she travelled to Toronto to purchase new products that suit the Creekside style and are sure to inspire the store’s loyal customers.

“We’re working our butts off! It’s going to be an exciting change that’s not too far from the Creekside we know and love.”

It’s time to celebrate!

Visit the store for the Grand Re-opening March 5, 6 and 7 from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. to see the new space, explore all the exciting new stock, and get together with familiar faces.

“It’s going to be a party! We’ll have tasty treats for everyone, and lots of giveaways,” Byers says.

Click “Interested” on the Creekside Facebook Event and share it with your friends! Get here early on Thursday, because the first 100 customers will receive a free gift with purchase. Enter the daily draws, and put your name in for the grand prize draw of a Brunelli quilt and sham set. Don’t forget to enter the Facebook contest for a chance to win VIP treatment, with an hour to shop before the store opens Thursday morning… and a $150 gift certificate too!

My first priority as Mayor has always been to protect this wonderful community. As we respond to the crisis presented by COVID-19 under the State of Local Emergency, this priority is more important than ever. We have now over 2,000 confirmed cases in Canada.

I was disappointed and surprised to learn about the large number of Delta residents, young and old, that are ignoring the plea of our Provincial Medical Health Officer to distance ourselves by at least 2 metres to combat the spread of this invisible deadly virus. TWO METRES OF SOCIAL SEPARATION MUST be practiced by everyone. The global reality is that this virus will cause deaths in our City.

It is not OK to be physically close to your friends and neighbours during this pandemic. Instead, use technology and other means to remain socially connected.

We must heed the orders of the Provincial Medical Health Officer. As the Mayor, I am determined to use all powers under our Local State of Emergency to ensure our community is safe. I am directing City staff to take swift action to ensure compliance with the orders.

Our Police Officers and Bylaw Inspectors are responding to violations of these orders in addition to regular calls for service. You can help preserve their resources for real emergencies by obeying the orders and gauging the importance of your calls. Always call 911 in an emergency, but consider the situation before calling for routine issues. Call 811 if you have a non-urgent health question. Be patient. Delta staff are working hard to implement Delta’s emergency plan during this critical time.

As Mayor, I am pleading with everyone to take strong actions now while we can still limit the spread of this virus. We are running out of time. I am imploring everyone in Delta to stay home except for essential trips. Stay away from large gatherings in our popular parks and leisure destinations. Walk in your neighbourhood. Stay separate so we can protect not just ourselves, but also those in the community who are most vulnerable to the severity of COVID19. Everyone needs to do their part.

Make sure that you are not passing on this deadly virus and make sure you are not positioning yourself to receive it.

Our incredible Delta Staff, Police and Firefighters are working tirelessly to try to reduce illness and deaths due to the COVID-19 virus.

We cannot do it alone. It is the civic duty of all community members to serve our city, and our country, by staying home. We can only lessen the illnesses and deaths from COVID-19 with your involvement now.",[]
1561,northdeltareporter,https://www.northdeltareporter.com/marketplace/connecting-with-women-for-custom-care/,Connecting with women for custom care – North Delta Reporter,'Mar.',2020-03-16,"Dr. Ashleigh Lane at Arc Integrated Medicine has a passion for women’s health, and wants the women of North Delta to know relief is possible.

When Dr. Ashleigh Lane chose the name Arc Integrated Medicine for her clinic seven years ago, she envisioned an electric arc of light connecting two surfaces. Naturopathic medicine varies considerably between doctors, and in Dr. Lane’s practice the connection — or arc — between doctor and patient is crucial.

Dr. Lane grew up in North Delta, and it was her connection to the community that led her to focus on women’s health.

“There’s an overwhelming need for it here. There aren’t a lot of great options for women in the area. Plus I find fertility, menopause and other women’s health issues fascinating,” she says.

Arc Integrated Medicine now has four Naturopathic Doctors serving North Delta with a variety of interests from joint pain to digestive challenges, skin conditions and more. Dr. Lane helps women at all ages find relief from things like PMS, endometriosis, PCOS, thyroid disorders and other aspects of women’s health.

Menopause and Perimenopause

Hot flashes, insomnia, increased anxiety… menopause can be relentless. For decades medical practitioners have told patients to grit their teeth and wait it out, but Dr. Lane wants women to know relief is possible.

“A lot of the time my patients’ symptoms improve within a few weeks! It can be a really simple fix,” she says. “In menopause your hormone levels drop significantly, and sometimes they fall off too steep of a cliff. If we bring them back up a bit we can give your body time to adjust, then slowly bring them down over time.”

In your first appointment you’ll spend an hour with Dr. Lane discussing all aspects of your health to get a complete picture of contributing factors. The root cause of your symptoms is unique to you, and Dr. Lane will suggest treatments customized to your body.

“Hormone therapy is often low risk for a high return on quality of life.”

Fertility

When you’re trying to have a baby, it can be daunting to make the jump from the broad knowledge of your GP to expensive procedures at a fertility clinic. Dr. Lane can bridge the gap.

“We look for the root cause of your fertility issues through lab work, and investigating your diet and lifestyle,” Dr. Lane says. “There are a lot of different ways we can help.”

Through infertility some women learn they have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and treating that can help regulate ovulation. Other women may make diet changes to improve egg health. If the issue is sperm health, Dr. Lane can help with that too.

“Even if patients choose to visit a fertility clinic later, our treatments can be complementary to those procedures.”

Gaining confidence in yourself can have a positive effect in every area of your life.

Toastmasters International, which has nearly 30 clubs between Surrey and Langley, can take credit for creating its fair share of confident people, through its programs teaching public speaking, communication and leadership skills, says Michael Bown, a District Director in B.C. for the organization.

“We support people with a number of things, but communications and leadership are the bread and butter, all resulting in greater confidence,” he says.

Nervous? Don’t worry, you’re supported

If you’re feeling uneasy about being in a space where speaking to others is a central element, you’ll be glad to learn guests are not required to speak at their first meeting. “We want people to sit back, listen, observe and enjoy the meeting,” Bown says. “They can speak when they’re ready as it’s a self-paced program. The clubs provide a supportive and positive learning experience, and everyone is trying to improve each other.”

Modern education tools available online

If you haven’t investigated Toastmasters in a while or are just starting to get curious, its Pathways educational program may be new to you. Its 11 project-based categories range from dynamic leadership and effective coaching to innovative planning and visionary communication. Using an online assessment tool that helps determine a Path, you pick the area you’d like to improve on and follow the steps. “Pathways uses modern methods to cater to people’s specific needs and learning styles,” Bown says. “If someone wants to grow in public speaking, there’s a focus on that, or communication, management skills and more.”

Plenty of experience to draw from

Not only has ToastmastersInternational been around since 1924, the organization today has nearly 300 clubs in British Columbia alone. Within them you’ll find a mix of in-house corporate programs and community clubs, and a lot of wisdom and expertise from longtime members who have helped others achieve their public speaking, communication and leadership goals.

Get your message across in a big way

One of the exciting things happening right now within Toastmasters, Bown says, is the International Speech Contest. Individual clubs are in the process of holding in-house competitions, and winners advance through various local, District and International levels, ultimately competing in the World Championship of Public Speaking in Paris this August! Not everyone is expected to compete, but Bown says the competitions offer a good opportunity for members and their guests to hear some inspirational speaking.
