79,79,79,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/some-canadians-will-be-receiving-smaller-cerb-payments-in-june-here-s-why-1.4998144,Some Canadians will be receiving smaller CERB payments in June. Here's why.,,2020-06-24,"TORONTO -- When Erin O’Brien opened up her email last week, she was shocked to find a notice from the federal government informing her that she would not receive her Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) payment the following week.

The Ottawa mother said the email explained that she was receiving the smaller amount in June because she was given a $2,000 advance when she collected her first CERB payment in April.

“I didn’t realize that this was even going to happen,” she told CTVNews.ca during a telephone interview from her home in Ottawa on Wednesday. “I thought it would just be all in the end that they would fix things. Not halfway through.”

O’Brien is far from alone in her surprise at the sudden reduction in CERB payments this month.

Dozens of Canadians have written in to CTVNews.ca to share how they, too, received word from the government last week notifying them that they weren’t eligible for the full $2,000 in June because of the earlier advance.

Kimberly Drew said she will only be receiving $500 this month, instead of the $2,000 she was expecting because of the advance payment she collected in April.

“It was not explained well when the payment came out so it was a bit of a shock,” she said. “I am frustrated.”

WHY ARE THERE REDUCED PAYMENTS NOW?

According to one of the Service Canada emails a CERB claimant received and forwarded to CTVNews.ca, the extra $2,000 that some people collected at the beginning of the program was an “advance of four weeks of the CERB, which was issued in order to get money in your pocket as quickly as possible.”

“Because of this advance, you will not receive a payment when you complete your next report. This is equivalent to the first two-week period of the advance. Please continue completing reports. This shows that you are eligible for all weeks of the CERB, including the four weeks of the benefit covered by the advance payment,” the message continued.

The notice also informed claimants that CERB would be extended by another eight weeks with a maximum payable amount of $12,000 over 24 weeks, which equals $2,000 per month for 6 months.

Ashley Michnowski, the director of communications for Employment Minister Carla Qualtrough, explained that CERB was initially intended to be available for a total of 16 weeks to a maximum of $8,000 before the extension.

Because those Canadians who were eligible for Employment Insurance (EI) received an extra $2,000 when the CERB benefit began, they had reached their maximum payable amount in June.

“As a result, starting the week of June 8th, some people would have received their full $8,000 initial CERB entitlement for the first initial 16 weeks and will therefore not receive a regular CERB payment this month,” Qualtrough’s spokesperson said in a statement to CTVNews.ca on Wednesday.

The minister’s office said eligible CERB claimants will receive money again at the beginning of July at the start of the next pay period now that the benefit has been extended for an additional eight weeks.

“In order to ensure claimants receive the available funding through the extension of CERB, they should continue to complete their biweekly reports,” the statement said.

'CLEAR, CONCISE, AND CONSISTENT DIRECTION'

There was some initial confusion when the CERB benefit was first rolled out in April because some claimants received more money than others.

For example, some people who applied for both employment insurance (EI) and CERB received two payments, even though no one is eligible to receive payments from both programs simultaneously.

As another example, those who were already on EI may have also received more than the initial $2,000 CERB payment when they were switched over to the new program because of residual EI benefits they had already qualified for.

At the time, Qualtrough reassured Canadians the additional deposits were not mistakes and recipients would be contacted about next steps.

“The CRA and Service Canada are working together to ensure that these situations are reconciled and payments do not exceed the maximum amount allowed per individual of $8,000 over a 16-week period,” she said in early April.

“So it won't necessarily be a clawback situation. It might be, but you can’t apply for more than the $8,000.”

However, days earlier Treasury Board President Jean-Yves Duclos created some confusion when he said the double payments were paid retroactively for the four-week period dating back to March 15, the first day people could apply for CERB.

A spokesperson from Qualtrough’s office clarified later that week that individuals who received $4,000 collectively from both the EI and CERB program would be contacted.

Conservative employment critic MP Dan Albas said the confusion and panic some Canadians are experiencing now could have been avoided if they were told what the $2,000 advance was for when they first received it.

“We recognize that during a crisis things happen quickly, but it’s really up to the government to provide clear, concise, and consistent direction,” he told CTVNews.ca during a telephone interview on Wednesday.

Albas said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has had multiple opportunities during his daily press briefings to bring Canadians up to speed on this issue and to let those people who received extra payments know what is expected of them.

“That would have been the responsible thing to do because ultimately, leaders take responsibility for mistakes,” he said. “And unfortunately, people are now at the end of the month just before the rent comes due, are being told that they will have considerably less support than they were planning.”

NDP MP and employment critic Daniel Blaikie echoed those sentiments when he said that it is “inexcusable” the government hasn’t made more of an effort to provide them with proper notice. He said it would have been easy to put up a reminder about the upcoming reduced payments on the Service Canada website a month ago for people to see when they log in to file their biweekly reports to claim their benefits.

Blaikie also said that he doesn’t understand why the government is reclaiming that advance money now when they have extended the program by another eight weeks.

“There is no need to do this right now,” he said during a telephone interview with CTVNews.ca on Wednesday. “They’re [the government] going to collect the money one way or another eventually. Doing it in a way that gives Canadians as much lead time as possible benefits CERB recipients and I don't think it does any harm to the government.”

144,144,144,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/it-s-extremely-dire-legions-at-risk-of-closing-forever-1.4995224,"Legions across Canada could close permanently, asking feds to help",,2020-06-22,"OTTAWA -- Royal Canadian Legion halls across the country have been shuttered for months due to COVID-19, and now a number of them are facing the prospect of never being able to reopen.

With most ineligible for the host of federal aid programs being offered to help keep other businesses and charitable organizations afloat, hundreds of these facilities could be forced to shut their doors forever without federal intervention.

Legions are often seen as the heart of many communities -- where Remembrance Day celebrations are held and meals are made and delivered to those in need -- but because the pandemic has put a pause on events, it’s cut off crucial income streams like facility rentals that allow legions to keep their doors open to veterans and others.

It’s estimated that about 124 of the 1,381 Royal Canadian Legion branches across Canada are likely to close permanently, and another 357 are facing financial hardship.

“We're a 95-year-old organization. And in that 95 years, we have prided ourselves on being self-sufficient, we have not reached out for funding. But these are unprecedented times,” National Executive Director Steven Clark said.

The Royal Canadian Legion has written to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s office twice, informing him of the gaps in the current federal aid offerings, and says they have yet to receive a response. The Prime Minister’s Office disputes that claim, confirming at least one response has been sent.

A government source told CTV News a reason the legions can’t get funding is because their programs are not directly related to the fight against COVID-19, though thousands of businesses have been able to access billions of federal aid dollars to make ends meet amid the pandemic.

In an email to CTV News, spokesperson for the Office of the Minister of Families, Children and Social Development Jessica Eritou pointed to the Emergency Community Support Fund as something legions that support veterans “may” qualify for to adapt their programs, and committed to “work with organizations to ensure they have the support they need to support Canadians.”

However, that program is offered to help adapt programming in the era of COVD-19 and the Royal Canadian Legion says that it’s their understanding based on conversations with federal officials that it can’t be used to cover operational costs, which is their biggest need right now.

They are calling on the federal government to expand the program’s parameters or allow them to access some other funding option to help pay for costs like rent and utilities.

While some branches may have employees on their payroll and could be eligible for some assistance, most are volunteer-run.

“We've had, of our 1,381 branches 167 have applied for federal assistance programs, but unfortunately only 55 have received that funding so it's still a very small percentage,” Clark said.

Local branches have been given some emergency reserve funding from the national headquarters, and have turned to crowdfunding initiatives but still the money is running out. While millions of dollars are donated every year through the National Poppy Campaign, this money can’t be used to cover the operational costs associated with keeping these facilities open.

While legions have been struggling for years to attract new members, having to close due to the pandemic could prove to be the final straw for many.

The branch in Kenora says it can only last a few more months before its closure becomes permanent.

“It’s extremely dire. We were good for the short haul, but as this keeps going, and we don’t know really where the light at the tunnel is going to be, we’re just not going to be able to survive,” said President of the Kenora Legion Jerry Lava.

“We’re depleting our savings now to make sure we can maintain our expenses. We’ve mothballed pretty well everything in the branch we could,” Lava said.

In a statement to CTV News, spokesperson for Veterans Affairs Canada John Embury said that the department’s response to the pandemic “is ongoing, and we will continue to explore ways to ensure that we’re providing Canadians and our community partners with the support they need.

Branches like this are the first point of contact for veterans and offer them crucial services and support, and that’s why so many are worried about what the future holds.

“I come to the legion and I meet old friends, and the comradery. It’s a place where you come and tell your story,” said Joel VanSnick, who is the Royal Canadian Legion’s district commander for the Ottawa-area which includes 62 branches.

“Once our legions are shut down, they’re gone... Where are veterans going to go to meet?” he said.",[]
145,145,145,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/inside-the-covid-19-commons-liberals-pass-key-spending-before-summer-sittings-1.4987560,Inside the COVID-19 Commons: Liberals pass key spending before summer sittings,'Rachel Aiello',2020-06-17,"OTTAWA -- The federal government has passed billions of dollars in spending measures during a special House of Commons sitting, with the backing of enough opposition MPs to not prompt formal standing votes.

The conclusion of the special sitting marks the end of more routine gatherings of MPs, with the next time the House convenes set for early July.

Through a series of oral approvals, MPs signed off on approximately $87 billion in funds to tie over federal departments and, in this case, COVID-19 aid programs until the fall. The agreement to pass the funding was given “on division,” meaning no recorded vote was required.

The two spending bills were the first chance since the pandemic shut down the regular sittings for MPs to indicate whether or not they still have confidence in the Liberal minority, though the sitting came and went without that opportunity being taken.

The Liberals’ commitment to an extension of a key COVID-19 aid program, the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, was what secured them the support needed to pass the supplementary estimates -- otherwise known as supply or the next cycle of scheduled and new federal spending.

Because of the Liberals’ minority standing, they needed to have the backing of at least one of the other parties in order to pass the spending measures, and the stakes were considerably higher in this instance because any votes that have to do with money, such as the federal budget or the estimates, are traditionally considered confidence votes.

In any parliament, a government lives so long as it maintains the confidence of the House of Commons. This confidence is demonstrated each time a key vote passes.

Approving the funding comes after both the Bloc Quebecois and NDP signalled they were not interested in seeing MPs line up to cast ballots amid a pandemic -- which could have happened if the Liberals lost Wednesday’s confidence votes and a snap election was called.

JUST 40 SITTING DAYS IN LAST YEAR

Wednesday’s sitting marked the 40th day there has been some form of an actual of House of Commons sitting in the last year, which did include the usual suspension over the summer of 2019 and then the fall federal election campaign.

Though after that October vote, the Liberals waited until December to reconvene the House.

CTVNews.ca asked Government House Leader Pablo Rodriguez last week about the limited number of sitting days and, as a result, the limited number of government mandate items that have been able to progress. He said the time taken pre-pandemic to adjust to the minority reality was necessary and no one could have anticipated a global health crisis would hit.

“We suggested a very ambitious agenda, a very complete throne speech, with everything that comes with it, and then we had COVID,” Rodriguez said. “But even with COVID, we adapted.”

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said once again Wednesday that the agreement to sit under the current structure was reached with the backing of the NDP and Greens, and defended the Liberals’ approach to Parliament.

“Three different parties came together to make a determination of what Parliament would do,” Trudeau said.

“Every time something doesn't go their way an opposition party cries, ‘oh no’ and it's a dictatorship all of a sudden. It's sort of irresponsible and it undermines I think the strength of our democracy that we've been able to show through this crisis,” said the prime minister during his Rideau Cottage press conference.

SPECIAL COMMITTEE COMING TO AN END

Before the special sitting got underway, MPs held their second last meeting of the special all-party COVID-19 committee of MPs. The committee is the first real experiment with a hybrid parliamentary sitting in the House chamber, but that experiment is nearly over.

As has been the case in the 23 of these meetings so far, MPs offered up statements and riding-specific petitions, before going through a question period-style session where the Liberals were grilled on the shortcomings in their COVID-19 plans and on other key policy matters.

In the motion passed on May 16, which put in place the structure of the summer sittings, MPs voted to cease the special committee after Thursday’s meeting. Its end will also mark the end of some form of MPs meeting four days a week, with them not all together until the first of four special sitting days in July.

As of June 18, the special committee will cease to exist, leaving just the four gatherings— July 8, July 22, Aug. 12, and Aug. 26— before the prospect of a more ‘normal’ House of Commons could convene come Sept. 21.

And as Trudeau announced on Wednesday morning, the July 8 sitting will also be where Finance Minister Bill Morneau will present “an economic and fiscal snapshot.”

STUDYING REMOTE VOTING, RULE CHANGES

One of the major limitations that has yet to be worked out is how to allow MPs to vote remotely.

This question is one that the Procedure and House Affairs (PROC) committee has been diving deeper into and evaluating how a formal hybrid House of Commons session could occur, the rule changes required to allow that, and what it would take to implement a remote voting system. The committee has been given a June 23 deadline to report back to its colleagues.

The government—with the support of the NDP—has argued that Parliament has continued to function through the pandemic, noting that under the new structure, the government has faced more questions from the opposition than it would have under normal House sitting parameters.

However, the Conservatives, and to a certain degree the Bloc Quebecois, have characterized the special committee as essentially a knock-off of Parliament and called for a more robust resumption of sittings that would have allowed for more accountability on the massive government policies being rolled out, while respecting the health and safety of all on Parliament Hill.

So, it remains to be seen whether the recommendations out of PROC could result in a change of plans when it comes to the summer and fall sitting schedule.",[]

However, with eased restrictions the team, minus a few players caught abroad, is back on the pitch for restricted practices.

“Without contact, it's unrealistic in terms of decision making for the players, and pressure, but we are doing what we can,"" said Valour FC head coach and general manager, Robert Gale.

With only a third of the roster from the inaugural season returning for a second year with the club, the limitations have made it difficult for players to build chemistry, other than some video conference socials held during the lockdown.

""You're not obviously going to get the ball skills not playing with your teammates as much,” recently acquired midfielder, Fraser Aird said.

“But keeping yourself physically fit during the whole thing out running and stuff like that is key because we never know what's going to happen so we need to be prepared for that.""

Further to the challenge of running practices while maintaining physical distancing, is the fact that no one knows exactly what the league will decide when it comes to when, where and how it plans to forego a season, if it even does.

“What's it going to look like? Is it a tournament? Will we get any games in? All of those factors are still unknown, so I think it's been a challenge,” Gale said.

The uncertainty has challenged some players’ ability to keep focused, with no season opener in sight.

“It's probably most mental (the effects), the whole pandemic thing and getting used to it and coming back to training not knowing what the outcome is going to be or when we are going to get the call,"" Aird said about the challenges of training during the pandemic.

With no firm start date, Gale says his staff has been taking a “scientific approach” in preparing for a potential season, using a “sliding scale” to gauge how hard to push his players.

""We had one for a potential June first start, a potential July first start, and a potential August first start,” Said Gale.

“Obviously as more information becomes available then we kind of ramp it up towards competition.""

The airline announced Tuesday that it would end service to eight domestic cities and cancel 30 regional routes due to weak demand for both business and leisure travel in the midst of government-imposed travel restrictions and border closures.

In a statement, Air Canada said it expects the airline industry will take a minimum of three years to recover from the effects of the pandemic.

“As a consequence, other changes to its network and schedule, as well as further service suspensions, will be considered over the coming weeks as the airline takes steps to decisively reduce its overall cost structure and cash burn rate,” the company said.

In a statement sent to CTV News, Transport Minister Marc Garneau called the airline's decision an ""unfortunate development.""

""This decision by Air Canada will be very disappointing to the residents and communities affected by these service cuts. We understand the impact this will have on many Canadians across the country and we continue to work with Canadian airlines and airports during this challenging time,"" Garneau said in the statement.

Airports set to lose routes have also expressed disappointment in the decision.

Tiffany Chase, a spokesperson with Halifax Stanfield International Airport, told CTV News that “these interregional connections are very important to maintain [an] essential transport network and provides our travellers with more choice and opportunity.”

Three flight routes to Halifax are disappearing. Regina has also been hit by Air Canada’s decision, losing three routes as well.

James Bogusz, President and CEO of the Regina International Airport, said that this will have a financial impact on the airports themselves.

“We are heading towards having to draw on our line of credit at around September, maybe early October,” he told CTV News. “It’s a really challenging situation. So any lost flights’ revenue is another blow to the airport.”

Air Canada reported a net loss of $1.05 billion in the first quarter of 2020, including a net loss of $688 million in March alone.

Earlier this month, Air Canada CEO Calin Rovinescu was one of more than 130 signatories to an open letter calling on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the country’s premiers to loosen travel restrictions as the industry struggles to stay afloat.

In May, Air Canada predicted it would lose nearly $20 million per day in the second quarter as a result of pandemic border shutdowns. In response, the airline has reduced its workforce by approximately 20,000 employees, representing more than 50 per cent of its staff, through layoffs, severances, early retirements, and special leaves.

Starting tomorrow, they will also be booking middle seats on flights again, ending their policy on physical distancing in an attempt to pack planes once more.

Here is a list of the Air Canada routes that will be suspended indefinitely. The airline said they will contact affected customers and offer them options, such as alternative routings where available.

387,387,387,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/canada-extends-ban-on-foreign-travellers-to-july-31-1.5005997,Canada extends ban on foreign travellers to July 31,,2020-06-30,"OTTAWA -- The Canadian government has extended the current ban on most international travellers until July 31.

The federal government first shut the border to non-Canadian citizens, with limited exceptions, to limit the spread of COVID-19 in mid-March. The extension on the foreign travel ban was made through a federal order recommended by Health Minister Patty Hajdu, dated June 29.

The ban allows permanent Canadian residents, the immediate family members of Canadian citizens, as well as diplomats and air crews, to come into Canada, though anyone who has symptoms of COVID-19 will still not be allowed to enter Canada.

“The introduction or spread of the disease would pose an imminent and severe risk to public health in Canada, the entry of persons into Canada who have recently been in a foreign country may introduce or contribute to the spread of the disease in Canada, and no reasonable alternatives to prevent the introduction or spread of the disease are available,” reads the government’s reasoning for the ongoing ban, in part.

This ban exempts the United States, which entered into a separate agreement with Canada shortly after the halt on all other foreign travel. The U.S. travel restrictions have been renewed until July 21 at least, meaning that all discretionary travel remains prohibited.

“To protect Canadians and to ease the potential burden non-essential travellers could place on our health care system and its frontline workers, the CBSA has implemented travel restrictions across all ports of entry in all modes of transportation… All travel of an optional or discretionary nature, including tourism and recreation, is covered by these measures,” said Canada Border Services Agency spokesperson Rebecca Purdy in an email.

This decision to extend the ban comes after the European Union agreed to a set of recommendations that will allow travellers from other nations, including Canada, to visit EU countries. The United States did not make the list of safe countries.

Last week Global Affairs Canada issued a reminder to Canadians that despite some countries partially reopening their borders, the national advice remains to avoid all non-essential travel outside of the country.

The mandatory 14-day self-isolation for any non-essential worker entering Canada remains in effect, as do all other aspects of the Quarantine Act.

To help Canadians stuck abroad, the government offered travellers an emergency loan of up to $5,000 to get home, and after chartering flights to repatriate stranded Canadians the department says the “final few” flights will be scheduled in the coming weeks, with no further trips planned.",[]

The family came up behind the bear, and Brian pulled on the tub but lost his grip -- but he realized the bear's ear was loose. They looped the boat back around, and after a final tug the bear was free and swam safely to shore.

Hurt said the whole ordeal lasted about five minutes.

When they got back to the resort bar, word of their courageous act had already spread thanks to some campers watching on the shore.

The Hurts learned from people at the bar that the bear had been running around with the tub on its head for three to four days.

The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources had been contacted several times but had been unable to locate it thanks to the rural, wooded landscape, Hurt said.

Bolton says, despite the ongoing and “clearly” political detention of Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, there shouldn’t be a “prisoner swap” some are suggesting.

“I know Canada's being abused now. Its citizens are being held without any reason what[so]ever by the Chinese authorities, and I know there's a debate about this in Canada. All I can say is, bear with us on this. It's important we stick together,” said Bolton told Evan Solomon in a radio interview about his newly released book memoir about working in Trump’s White House: The Room Where It Happened.

The full interview aired Tuesday on the national iHeartRadio talk show The Evan Solomon Show.

“If this is the way China treats a country like Canada now, imagine how it will treat Canada when its influence around the world has expanded,” Bolton said.

As The Associated Press has reported, Bolton’s book details his time in the White House, and includes several allegations including a claim that Trump asked China for help winning the upcoming presidential election.

Bolton also writes that Trump made matters worse by implying that Meng’s extradition could be used as a bargaining chip in trade negotiations.

'BIG MISTAKE' TO RELEASE MENG

Asked if the Trump administration was using Canada by asking the Trudeau government to act on the U.S. extradition order and arrest Meng in Canada in order for Trump to have leverage with China, Bolton said Trump was the only one in the administration to think of Meng’s arrest as a political tool in China trade talks.

“It would be a big mistake to trade a criminal prosecution against Huawei and its chief financial officer for some kind of trade deal with China, which honestly, I don't think China is going to abide by anyway,” Bolton said.

For U.S. politicians the trade-based argument against dropping the extradition proceedings is different than the current conversation unfolding in Canada, where 19 high-profile former diplomats, politicians and academics have all called on Canada to consider halting the extradition process in order to get ""the two Michaels"" released.

Kovrig and Spavor were arrested separately in the days following Meng's arrest. Both men had been held in China without charges from December 2018 until June 19 when they were formally charged with espionage.

When asked about a swap, the prime minister strongly shot down the idea saying, if countries around the world including China saw that “arbitrarily arresting random Canadians” would be leverage to “get what they want out of Canada,” that would put Canadians abroad at risk.

Asked whether he thought the arrests of Kovrig and Spavor was retaliatory, Bolton said: “I think it clearly was for political reasons.”

“I don't think it should be a prisoner swap,” Bolton said.

“Huawei is an arm of the Chinese State... It's heavily subsidized and guided by decisions of the Chinese government, and it's part of the of the Chinese effort to affect telecommunications and information technology systems all over the world,” Bolton said.

TRUMP 'TOLERATED' TRUDEAU

Among the revelations in the book was that, according to Bolton Trump doesn’t like Trudeau and that he “tolerated” him. Asked why he thought Trump allegedly is not a fan of the prime minister, Bolton cited the early tensions of the NAFTA renegotiations.

“Part of the problem with the way Trump approaches foreign policy, in my view, is that he has difficulty distinguishing between the national interest of the countries involved, let's say the U.S. and Canada on the one hand versus the personal relationship between the leaders of the two countries on the other,” Bolton said.

He said, in his view, Trump’s personal feelings towards Trudeau “made it a lot harder to get things done.”

One particularly acrimonious interaction was at the 2018 G7 summit Canada hosted in Charlevoix, Que. It was after that meeting that Trump pulled out of the joint communique before he and his administration officials took aim at Trudeau, calling him “meek and mild” and “very dishonest and weak.”

“Trump felt that he had been backed into a corner in the G7 communique… When he saw Prime Minister Trudeau giving a closing press conference, he thought that he was unfairly treated, that led him to withdraw the U.S. from the communique… But that was an example where that personal reaction to what was being said led to a consequence that made the subsequent NATO Summit, for example, even more difficult than it would have been anyway,” Bolton said.

'HOPED TO MAKE A CONTRIBUTION'

Bolton did not testify in the Trump impeachment trial, and he has been criticized for saving the accusations about his former boss for his book, which Trump’s lawyers tried to get stopped from being released.

Asked to respond to those who have said Bolton has lost his moral authority after withholding what he knew to cash in with his book, Bolton said it’s “completely wrong.”

“Look, if my objective in life had been to make money, I never would have worked for the administration of Ronald Reagan, George HW Bush, George W. Bush or Donald Trump,” Bolton said.

He said he joined the Trump administration because he didn’t think it could have been as bad as people were saying.

“I hoped to make a contribution. The book is the story of whether I succeeded in that or not,” he said.",[]
391,391,391,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/canada-s-food-insecurity-problem-is-about-to-get-worse-due-to-covid-19-experts-say-1.5006252,"Canada's food insecurity problem is about to get worse due to COVID-19, experts say",,2020-06-30,"TORONTO -- Access to affordable and nutritious food is an ongoing struggle for many Canadian families and experts warn that the situation is likely to get worse by the fall because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

According to a survey done in May by Statistics Canada, almost one in seven (14.6 percent) Canadians indicated that they lived in a household where food insecurity was a problem. This number is up from 10.5 percent just two years ago.

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought distinct challenges to many sectors of the food supply chain that have reshaped their operations with physical distancing, the use of personal protective gear and equipment modifications – all of which are contributing to rising costs.

“To get food to market, companies across the supply chain will need to charge more,” Sylvain Charlebois of Dalhousie University’s food analytics lab told CTVNews.ca in an interview. “In the past, there wasn’t usually much relation between the food supply chain and retail costs, but now costs are going up all around because of COVID-19. That’s why food prices cannot drop.”

In 2017, the average Canadian household spent around $8,527 annually on food. The typical inflation rate is usually between 1.5 and 2.5 per cent. Charlebois expects that number to rise closer to four per cent once the pandemic is over.

“This fall will see the worst of it as some government programs like the CERB [Canada Emergency Response Benefit] come to an end. Then we will get the full economic picture of what we’re dealing with,” he says.

Charlebois said that the federal government is already pumping a large amount of money into the economy through the CERB and that any new financial aid programs would be unlikely. He suggested that more families will consider relocating outside of major cities in an attempt to reduce their cost of living.

Those likely to be impacted the most by the spike in food prices are Canadian families who were already financially vulnerable and struggling to make ends meet before the pandemic began. Statistics Canada found that Canadians with children are more likely to be in a food-insecure household.

Another contributing factor to food insecurity in Canada is race. According to FoodShare Toronto’s Executive Director Paul Taylor, Black and Indigenous Canadians are more likely to experience barriers to affordable food.

“We know that the people who suffer the most from food insecurity are Black and Indigenous people,” Taylor told CTVNews.ca. “Research shows that Black Canadians are 3.5 times more likely to be food-insecure.”

A study by FoodShare Toronto and the PROOF research team at the University of Toronto found that regardless of homeownership and immigration status, Black Canadians continue to suffer the most from food insecurity.

“Ultimately when we talk about food insecurity we’re also talking about racism against Black and Indigenous folks,” Taylor added. “As a country, we need to recognize that racism and anti-Black racism is having a significant impact on health outcomes and access to food.”

From a policy approach, Taylor points to measures that will improve the financial circumstances of low-income households, like a universal basic income and comprehensive services such as child and pharma care.

“We live in one of the richest countries in the world,” he says. “Canadians need a basic income and comprehensive social services. When working together these could have a meaningful impact on food insecurity.”",[]
461,461,461,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/lifestyle/simple-design-steps-can-take-your-garden-to-the-next-level-1.5003509,Simple design steps can take your garden to the next level,'John Raby',2020-06-28,"CHARLESTON, W.VA. -- The flower beds are finished, the vegetables are growing, and yet something could be missing from the backyard landscape: That “wow” factor.

Adding a personal touch to the lawn and garden doesn't have to be complicated or break the family budget. Homeowners can transform an ordinary looking landscape with some imagination, design, and perhaps the help of a local agriculture extension service, landscape professional or private nursery.

“A garden is really never finished,” said Jonathan M. Lehrer, chairman of the Department of Urban Horticulture and Design at Farmingdale State College on Long Island, New York. “Sometimes the most difficult thing is kind of taking that plunge and deciding you're going to develop an area or start a project.”

Some ideas that gardeners can use to start taking their yards to another level:

THE STARTING POINT

An arbour, pergola, lattice - even posts with netting wrapped around them - will grab attention, especially at a yard's entrance. It also adds height where homeowners normally think only about length and width, Lehrer said.

Adding clematis, climbing roses or honeysuckle along them will provide long periods of blooms.

Arbors decorated with lights can also define garden rooms and set up views to the space beyond, inviting exploration, said Katharine Pinney, a landscape contractor and designer in Los Angeles.

“Use them to lead your visitor through the garden,” Pinney said.

THE PATHWAY TO SUCCESS

A path with mulch, gravel, brick, pavers or flagstone with edging will encourage a stroll.

Pinney said the simpler the path's route, the better. But Lehrer suggests avoiding a straight, linear pathway.

“Trying to use more curves, twists and turns, that kind of adds the illusion of a longer length than it might be, that mystery of what might be around the next corner,” he said.

Pinney said the choice of pavers should reflect the architectural style of the house. But mixing materials, such as brick and flagstones, adds visual interest.

“In short, use your imagination!” Pinney said.

Placing decorative pots loaded with flowers along the way will create a focal point and add colour.

PLACES TO REST

Benches and tables are a must for homeowners wanting to make their yards a hangout. Having limited room shouldn't be a deterrent.

Pinney said she designs numerous small gardens because the old bungalow neighbourhoods in her area have narrow but deep lots.

“Dividing that narrow space into rooms makes the garden seem larger,” she said.

Pinney and Lehrer suggest building a fire pit, a cooking area, or a place for dining or simply to enjoy morning coffee.

GET PERSONAL

Pinney suggests incorporating items that reflect the homeowner's personality. One of her clients loved wine and held tastings with friends. Pinney said she planted wine grapes for the customer and used old wine bottles from restaurants to border a path.

Old brick from another customer's 1920s bungalow was incorporated into the border of an outdoor groundcover “rug.”

“A homeowner should think about what would make the garden a reflection of their personality and interests,” Pinney said.

Due to the coronavirus pandemic, Lehrer added, “I've seen people that are not going to be going to the beach. “So they're creating pool areas, adding inexpensive holiday lights and lanterns and bringing music outside.”

TIMBERRR!

Landscaping timbers can create tiered walls and stairs to bridge elevation levels in the backyard while creating more planting beds in between. They're also great for creating individual planters. Timbers are available in both natural and synthetic types.

Pinney said treated lumber secured with timber screws is best for terraces, but not for vegetable gardens.

AGREE TO TREE

Depending on the climate and sun requirements, consider planting small trees along the edges.

Japanese tree lilacs and crape myrtles provide vibrant summer colour. Trees with spring blooms include redbuds, white and pink dogwoods, flowering crabapples, ornamental pears and star magnolias. To get the earliest spring blooms, consider planting forsythias.

For northern climates, Lehrer strongly suggests the cornelian cherry dogwood. It has yellow flowers in the spring and red cherry-like fruit in late summer and early fall. The leaves turn red and orange in the fall, and as the tree ages, the outer bark peels, revealing a orange-brown colour.

“It's a four-season plant that is extremely tough,” he said.

WINGED FRIENDS

A big garden bonus is a visit from a butterfly or hummingbird. Plants that produce nectar and pollen can lure them in.

The 4-H Children's Garden at Michigan State University includes a butterfly house that is open in the spring. Education co-ordinator Jessica Wright said attracting butterflies means having compatible plants for the caterpillars they begin as. These can include fennel, dill and milkweed. Other flowering plants can act as butterfly magnets.

Among the plants that attract hummingbirds are bleeding hearts, cardinal flower, impatiens and petunias. Both butterflies and hummingbirds are drawn to bee balm, butterfly bushes and zinnia. Birds and butterflies do require water, so consider adding feeders or a bird bath.

“The interaction with nature is the next level,” Wright said. “It's great to see them enjoying your garden as well.”",[]
542,542,542,ctvnews,https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/what-you-need-to-know-about-toronto-s-mandatory-mask-policy-1.5006032,What you need to know about Toronto's mandatory mask policy,'Katherine Declerq',2020-06-30,"TORONTO -- Toronto will be making it mandatory to wear face masks while inside enclosed public spaces starting on Tuesday.

The motion was presented to city council last week—with the support of Toronto Mayor John Tory and Medical Officer of Health Dr. Eileen de Villa—in an effort to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 as more businesses start to reopen in the city.

Here's what you need to know:

When do you need to wear a mask?

According to the mayor, the masks will be mandatory in all public and enclosed indoor spaces. This means they will be required on public transportation such as the TTC and ferries to the Toronto Islands, as well as inside shops, grocery stores and malls.

Toronto residents will not need to wear masks while at home, eating on a restaurant patio and at most workplaces where physical distancing is possible. It would also not apply to child-care centres.

“It is about public spaces where the general public has free and ready access, to try and limit the risk,” de Villa said.

While not mentioned in the bylaw, health officials have previously said that residents should wear a mask anytime where it is challenging to social distance from others.

What happens if I can’t wear a mask for health reasons?

All health officials and politicians agree that if someone is suffering from a medical condition that makes it difficult to breathe or function while wearing a mask, they should not wear one. They ask that those people try their best to remain physically distanced from others while in public spaces.

Children under the age of two also do not have to wear a mask.

When will the bylaw take effect?

The bylaw will take effect on July 7 and last until the first city council meeting of the fall, which is scheduled for the end of September or early October. At that time, council will either extend the bylaw, amend it or discontinue it.

What does this mean for schools reopening in early September?

Local health officials say the decision about whether or not children or teachers wear masks while in school is up to the provincial government. The Ontario government, in response to the mandatory mask policy, has said that it is actually up to each individual school board to decide on classroom policies.

“Each board right across the province has the flexibility,” Ontario Premier Doug Ford said on Tuesday. “Everyone is going to have different guidelines.”

Will there be a fine for not wearing a mask?

The mayor admitted there would not be “aggressive enforcement” when it comes to the mask policy, but rather his government will focus on education.

“To be candid about it we don’t really have the resources to go around and look at every store and look at every person that is in one of those places,” he said. “We are going to rely on people by and large to get educated and to do the right thing.”

At the same time, Tory said that it is up to every business to have a policy in place to ensure compliance, suggesting a “no shirt, no shoes, no mask, no service” model.

Who else is doing this?

The mayors of Brampton, Mississauga and Caledon also announced on Tuesday they intend to pass similar bylaws requiring masks to be worn inside public spaces.

Brampton Mayor Patrick Brown said the bylaw in his city could be in effect by July 7.

No timeline has been provided for the bylaw in Mississauga or Caledon.

Why is it not mandated provincially?

The Ford government has said they will not be requiring the wearing of masks, but rather will encourage their use. Speaking on Tuesday, the premier said that the needs of regions like Peel and Toronto will be different from those in northern Ontario, which is why he can’t make masks mandatory.

“But each region has the authority to make their own rules,” he said. “I will support them on any decision that they make.”

Why is this policy necessary?

Experts have said that wearing a mask will prevent the wearer from spraying droplets on others, helping curb the transmission of the disease if they are asymptomatic.

De Villa said that requiring masks in indoor settings is essential to preventing the spread of COVID-19, but that compliance will need to be as high as 80 per cent in order to work.

“The reality is that the virus continues to circulate and that we still need to be careful,” she said.

Randy VanDerStarren was granted rare access to 60 locations in Toronto for the project, including attractions, sports fields, buildings and places of worship, to name a few.

Dubbed “TOgether,” the photos will be compiled into a book which will compare pictures of empty places in the city normally teaming with people and images of the same spaces as they reopen and see people return.

“You could get depressed, if you actually looked at all these empty buildings,” VanDerStarren told CTV News Toronto Monday. “I have a very rare lens that I get to look through to see that vitality come to life again.”

The ‘TO’ in ""TOgether"" is for Toronto and the project wouldn’t have been possible without VanDerStarren’s partner, Deputy Mayor Michael Thompson, who helped get permission to enter some the most tightly controlled places.

“While it was difficult with respect to the process, the fact of the matter is that we knew that the darkness that existed in the city as a result of COVID and everything being shutdown wasn’t permanent, but we really needed to capture that,” Thompson told CTV News Toronto.

“And at the same time, we needed to be aware as to what happens when we’re back again. We’re alive, we’re energized.”

Money raised throught the project is being directed to DonateTO –which is helping community organizations through the recovery.

VanDerStarren is volunteering his time for ""TOgether,"" and said being granted the access has been an honour and privilege.

”I hope the work we do not only captures these locations, but does it in a way that you, as a viewer, as readers will look at the book and will look at the gallery that will come out of this and say ‘that’s my city, and I’m part of its recovery, I’m part of overcoming this virus’, he said.

VanDerStarren said he hopes to finish taking the pictures of Toronto’s reopening by the fall and show off all the comparisons by the end of the year.",[]

Speaking at Queen’s Park on Tuesday, Ontario Premier Doug Ford responded to questions about a Greater Toronto Area mayor who called for the government to change its policy as certain regions were given the green light to reopen amid the COVID-19 pandemic and others were not.

“We have to encourage people,” Ford told reporters. “I’ll be having that conversation and I highly, highly recommend you go outside and you’re in large groups or you’re in shopping centres, wear a mask.”

The premier went on to say that while his government thinks wearing face coverings is “critical”, policing 14.5 million people would be “very, very difficult.”

“We just don’t have the manpower for bylaw and police officers to be chasing people without masks,” he said.

The Ford government released a new list of regions in Ontario that can advance to Stage 2 of the reopening phase on Monday.

As of this Friday, the only regions not allowed to move forward to Stage 2 are Toronto, Peel and Windsor-Essex. They will remain in Stage 1 until at least next week, when the province will reassess the data and decide if they are ready to move forward next Friday.

The areas excluded from moving forward to Stage 2 remain the province's COVID-19 hot spots. Ontario reported 184 cases of COVID-19 on Tuesday, 118 of which were recorded in Toronto, Peel and Windsor-Essex.

""For the regions still staying in Stage 1, Toronto, Peel and Windsor-Essex, we ask you please be patient because we can't let our guard down,"" Ford said on Monday.

The decision to reopen certain areas of the GTA has caused concern for some municipalities. Markham Mayor Frank Scarpitti, whose region borders Toronto, has called on the government to make the wearing of masks mandatory, saying that without a province-wide strategy areas that reopen may experience a spike in COVID-19 cases or a second wave.

“We need the same rules across the province of Ontario. It becomes difficult for the public to understand what a rule is in one jurisdiction versus another,” Scarpitti said.

“If the provincial government does not move forward making it mandatory to wear masks, I’m asking the retailers and even some of the restaurants to impose no masks, no service.”

Scarpitti added there would be exceptions for people with health conditions that make it difficult to wear a mask.

Ford told reporters that he will be speaking with Scarpitti Tuesday afternoon about his concerns.

At the same time, Ontario’s Minister of Health Christine Elliott said that guidance from health officials remains the same—physical distancing is still the most effective way to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

""The guidance we have received from the chief medical officer of health as well as the other public health experts at the command table is that the physical distancing is still the most important rule to follow, that we should continue to do that for the foreseeable future, and that masks should be worn in situations when that's not going to possible,” Elliott said.

""A number of retailers have decided that they want masks to be worn if people want to enter and that's the retailers right to do that. So it's not mandatory, it's recommended, again when physical distancing can't be achieved.""

Province releases guide for businesses reopening

The Progressive Conservative government also acknowledged on Tuesday that customers and workers may not feel confident visiting stores or providing services. In that light, the government has released a new downloadable “toolkit” offering tips and guidelines for employers reopening their businesses for the first time since the pandemic was declared.

The guide is meant to help businesses identify risks for transmitting the disease and create a safety plan to help control the spread of COVID-19. One hundred and thirty-three sector-specific labour guidelines will also be included in the toolkit.

“Over the past few weeks, we've taken steps to build the necessary confidence that will help everyone prepare, adapt and get our economy going again,” Ford said.

“That means giving employers confidence that they have what they have and can open their doors. It also means giving workers confidence and we have to give customers confidence and that is how we will get our economy roaring once again.""

Safety is top of mind as we reopen. Today we launched a new guide to help businesses develop safety plans, including these steps:

✅Identify risks

✅Determine next steps

✅Creating a plan

✅Implementation

✅Communication to staff and customers https://t.co/5oWhnwHxQ8 pic.twitter.com/omQ3xXj7Pn — Doug Ford (@fordnation) June 16, 2020

One month after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 situation a pandemic, researchers surveyed more than 1,400 parents to see how their children were faring.

Not only did parents report that 79 per cent of kids were spending more time on screens, only 2.7 per cent of kids were meeting the recommended 60 minutes of physical activity per day.

“We've got a lifestyle of our children and youth that is sub-optimal to begin with. Twelve to 15 per cent meeting healthy sleep, healthy screen time, healthy physical activity guidelines. And that's dropped by close to 80 per cent during the crisis,” Mark Tremblay, study co-author and researcher at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Research Institute, told CTV News.

“This has been collateral damage to the lifestyles of kids.”

The study, published in International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity this week, also found that 41 per cent of children were sleeping more -- a positive finding, according to Tremblay, but one that may be attributed to boredom.

Fifteen-year-old Aneira Cleur says without school and extracurricular activities to keep them occupied, she and her friends have become “pretty lazy.”

“A lot of them are just lying in bed all day,” Cleur, who considered herself fairly active before the pandemic, told CTV News.

Her 13-year-old sister, Kerri, says that without the need to go anywhere or the ability to see her friends, she lost her motivation to leave the house.

""It was frustrating because there was what we little we could do,"" their father, Adrian Gay, told CTV News. ""They really weren't keen on venturing out when we forced them to. So it was tough.""

But as COVID-19 restrictions begin to ease across the country, and warmer weather draws more kids outside, experts warn it may not be enough to recondition kids for a healthier lifestyle -- especially in the event of a second wave.

""This could be the new normal for quite some time,” Trembley explained.

“We simply can't afford to shrug our shoulders and say, ‘It's okay this is just the way it's going to be.’ The consequences of that would be fairly serious.""

Trembley notes that, on average, Canadian parents were already struggling to encourage their children to meet daily activity guidelines and have less screen time.

Earlier this week, a study commissioned by ParticipACTION to support the annual Report Card on Physical Activity for Children and Youth, found that, before the pandemic, Canadian children were barely getting a passing grade for overall physical activity.

According to that study, only 39 per cent of children aged five to 11 and youths aged 12 to 17 met the national physical activity guidelines.

“Already we had a challenge to try and increase the proportion of kids that are benefiting from healthy movement behaviours,” said Tremblay.

""Now we're going to have to rehabilitate the population somewhat just to get back to that already rather weak baseline.”

Moving forward in the pandemic, Tremblay says it’s imperative that health officials focus on the promotion of healthy behaviours as well as disease prevention.

""Wouldn't it be great if, as a result of this rather horrible circumstance, that on a population level, families, and the communities they live in recalibrate themselves to ones where healthy active living becomes much more normative than it has been in recent years in Canada,” he said.

Experts recommend that parents incorporate physical activity into daily routines as much as possible and look for opportunities to be active as a family, while setting limits around screen time in the home.",[]
566,566,566,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/this-drug-can-treat-90-per-cent-of-cystic-fibrosis-patients-but-it-s-not-available-in-canada-1.4991938,"This drug can treat 90 per cent of cystic fibrosis patients, but it's not available in Canada",,2020-06-19,"TORONTO -- Struggling to breathe is one of the main symptoms of the novel coronavirus that has recently swept across the country. But for Nicole Stringer, who suffers from cystic fibrosis, it's been the reality for her entire life.

For Stringer, every breath is a battle. Now, she's fighting for access to a drug that could change that.

The Kelowna, B.C. woman was born with cystic fibrosis (CF), a genetic disorder that causes mucus to clog her lungs and damages her organs. On top of that, Stringer is also infected with a superbug, a bacteria called Pseudomonas aeruginosa which can't be killed by antibiotics.

Stringer uses puffers, an oxygen machine and takes a hundred pills every day to control symptoms like fever and nausea. But she's still constantly in and out of hospital, and plagued by the knowledge that at any time, her lungs could fail.

Her best friend, also a CF patient, recently succumbed to the disease.

Stringer has tried every treatment -- including travelling to the U.S. to become the first Canadian CF patient to try an experimental treatment called phage therapy, which uses viruses to kill bacteria. No treatment so far has truly helped.

""I have developed resistance to almost all of the antibiotics that I can take,"" she told CTV News. ""So now I have lung infections that are just doing what they're going to do and I have nothing to fight them with anymore, so I am going to continue to get sicker.""

COVID-19 poses yet another risk to Stringer's life, and has kept her isolated indoors for months.

But she sees hope for her declining health in the form of a drug that is already improving the health of CF patients in the U.S.: Trikafta.

Cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in a specific gene, which create a faulty protein. Trikafta works by targeting that mutation to help the defective protein work more efficiently, with signs it can slow or even stop the progression of the disease.

""Within a week's time many people have had less mucus, they can run up the stairs, they can play with their kids, so it is a drug that's life changing, it's transformational for people with a fatal genetic disease,"" Kelly Grover, CEO of Cystic Fibrosis Canada, told CTV News.

Trikafta is a combination of three drugs: elexacaftor, tezacaftor, and ivacaftor. The therapy can potentially treat up to 90 per cent of CF patients, according to a press release by Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, the company behind the drug.

However, Stringer can't access it, because it's not approved in Canada.

""To have something that … is life-changing that it's right there, but we can't grab it, is the most frustrating thing of my life,"" she said.

Trikafta has made all the difference to Stephi Lee, an American artist and online influencer. Several American patients have documented significant improvements on their YouTube channels.

""Listen to this,"" Lee says in one video. She inhales. ""I didn't even cough.""

Part of the frustration for Canadian patients is that the drug was fast-tracked for approval in the U.S. last year, where studies show it helps to improve lung function by up to 14 per cent.

Grover said it was ""horrendous"" that we haven't seen any progress towards approving the drug here, considering it was approved so quickly within the U.S.

""In the U.K. they are fast-tracking its approval, Ireland and Switzerland have said they will fund it as soon as it becomes approved,"" she said. ""And so every country seems to be clamouring to get its hands on this drug for people with CF, and in Canada we can't even get it into Health Canada for safety reviews. So we're very concerned.

""Patients are really being held hostage in Canada because of that.""

Cystic Fibrosis Canada is calling on Canadian governments and regulators to collaborate with each other and manufacturer Vertex in order to accelerate the approval of Trikafta in Canada, so that it can be made available to patients there.

But the real problem is price. In the U.S., the listed cost for Trikafta is US$311,000 per year.

According to Cystic Fibrosis Canada, in order to get to a Canadian price, the manufacturer must first apply for Health Canada approval of the drug, after which Canada's drug review and reimbursement processes kick in. The Patented Medicine Prices Review Board will determine the maximum price a company can charge for a new patented drug sold in Canada. What public and private insurers pay is negotiated with the company. A body called the pan-Canadian Pharmaceutical Alliance negotiates the price that consumers will actually be paying on behalf of the provincial, territorial and federal programs.

The estimated cost for one Trikafta patient in Canada could be more than $400,000 a year.

And Vertex hasn't even applied to sell it here, amid speculation it would not be approved at that price.

An evidence report put out on April 27 by the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER), an independent watchdog for drug pricing in the U.S., investigated Trikafta and three other CF treatments by Vertex.

ICER gave the drug their highest ""A"" evidence rating a vote of confidence in the drug's transformative effect on patients' lives but added that the price was far too high.

They estimated that the health-benefit price benchmark for Trikafta should be between US$67,900 and US$85,000 per year, which would require a 73 to 78 per cent discount from the drug's current listed price.

In a press release for the report, David Rind, ICER's Chief Medical Officer, said that ""despite being transformative therapies, the prices set by the manufacturer costing many millions of dollars over the lifetime of an average patient are out of proportion to their substantial benefits.

""When a manufacturer has a monopoly on treatments and is aware that insurers will be unable to refuse coverage, the lack of usual counterbalancing forces can lead to excessive prices,"" Rind said.

""Patients who receive the treatments will benefit, but unaligned prices will cause significant negative health consequences for many unseen individuals those throughout society who will experience financial toxicity and may have to delay care, forego care, or even abandon insurance as their out of pocket costs and premiums are driven upward.""

But Canadian doctors and patients say that the drug being unavailable in Canada doesn't fix the price problem.

""I think we need a long-term solution,"" Dr. Pearce Wilcox, a respirologist at St. Paul's Hospital, told CTV News. ""We recognize that medication like this and others are very expensive medications and that's the reality and the public system will have challenges in coming up with that funding.

""On the other hand … cystic fibrosis is a rare disease. So, the long term solution is we need some type of strategy that recognizes rare diseases and the challenges of costs for these medications.

""In the shorter term, there needs to be some of innovative approach,"" to allow patients to get access, he added.

The pharmaceutical company does provide a compassionate care program that allows the sickest patients to have access to medication at a discount, but many patients dealing with a lot of suffering in their day to day lives still will not qualify for that, Wilcox said.

""I think everybody has the right to a life-changing drug,"" Grover agreed. ""I think at this stage we need to get it into the queue, so that the public and private payers can negotiate with the manufacturer to [a] price that makes sense to the Canadian system. And right now we can't even get it into the queue to assess its safety.""

The population of Canadians with cystic fibrosis is around 4,300, ""so you're talking about thousands that this [drug] could help,"" Grover said.

Wilcox said he has been working with cystic fibrosis patients for more than 20 years, and has seen a lot of initiatives introduced over the years to improve care.

But Trikafta is in ""the game-changer category,"" for him in how much it can improve quality of life and slow the progression of the disease.

""There is a medication that has the chance of making a dramatic difference in their, their outcome, and yet … we have very limited access to this compound,"" he said.

For Stringer, the drug feels like her last chance.

""If I don't get Trikafta, I'm going to continue to get sicker,"" she said. ""I could be one infection away from dying. That's really all it takes, is one infection.

""The life that I have right now is not life,"" she added. ""I'm at home all the time, I need oxygen a lot of the time. I barely have enough energy to get up and go into my living room. I'm 28 years old and I don't have a life.""

Stringer made her own urgent appeal directly to Vertex, through Health Canada's Special Access Programme the only way a Canadian can access medication not yet available for sale in Canada but was turned down.

There is a government push to assist her, led by Conservative MP Dan Albas from B.C.

On May 4, he and 58 MPs signed a letter addressed to Health Minister Patty Hajdu asking what she is doing to ensure that Canadians get access to the drug.

In the letter, they mention that Vertex has ""signalled their willingness to negotiate and conclude a Price Listing Agreement with the pan-Canadian Pharmaceutical Alliance.

""During the negotiation period, they have offered to supply their drugs to Canadians suffering with CF for free,"" the letter continues.

""As the Minister of Health, please provide us with an update on what you are doing to support the negotiations with Vertex and ensure that Canadians have access to these life-saving and life-changing drugs.""

Stringer, and other patients like her, are waiting to see if anything comes of the letter, and if Trikafta will come to Canada or not.

In the meantime, Canadian patients with cystic fibrosis will have to remain in limbo, caught between hope and reality.",[]
567,567,567,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/as-the-race-for-a-vaccine-ramps-up-so-do-calls-for-vaccine-injury-compensation-1.4983341,"As the race for a vaccine ramps up, so do calls for vaccine injury compensation",,2020-06-13,"TORONTO -- Canada may be at the forefront of the race to develop an effective COVID-19 vaccine, with a clinical trial already approved, but experts warn we have fallen short in developing a fund to compensate those who may be injured by vaccinations.

With immense political and public pressure to develop a vaccine, a process that can take years, researchers are carrying out trials at an unprecedented pace in efforts to bring a successful vaccine to market in a matter of months.

And although vaccine-related reactions are rare, experts say a new vaccine -- especially one developed using new technology -- may come with unknown risks.

At least 19 countries already have programs in place that compensate individuals injured by vaccines, but Canada does not.

In fact, it is the only G7 country without such measures in place, and experts are now calling on the federal government to prepare in advance of the COVID-19 vaccination program.

“If you do suffer an adverse event, a serious adverse event, one of those very rare events, you should be compensated,” said Jennifer Keelan, a retired researcher who worked at the University of Toronto’s Department of Public Health, told CTV News.

“An ideal process is to think about these things before you implement the mass vaccine program, rather than reacting.”

Adverse reactions to vaccines are rare, but have had deadly repercussions in the past.

In 1976, the U.S. government rushed to develop a swine flu vaccination over fears of the next big pandemic. The immunization program was halted after 10 weeks due to reports that the vaccination increased the risk for Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), a rare form of paralysis that starts in the feet and creeps up the body.

Though the associated risk was approximately one in 100,000, more than 450 people developed GBS after receiving the vaccine. Of those, 25 died.

Similarly, in 2009, the H1N1 influenza vaccine, while largely deemed safe, was linked with cases of narcolepsy in Europe.

Experts warn that vaccine manufacturers may demand legal protection against lawsuits regarding adverse reactions to a new vaccine.

In 2009, the Canadian government put forth an emergency process to release the H1N1 vaccine without waiting for Health Canada to review the results of clinical trials concerning the vaccine’s efficacy.

According to the Canadian Medical Association Journal, Canada agreed to indemnify the vaccine’s manufacturer, Glaxo-SmithKline, from potential lawsuits.

At the time, the federal government was said to be considering a no-fault compensation scheme, or a vaccine injury compensation program. However, no such program was ever created.

Quebec is the only province that offers such a plan for adverse reactions stemming from immunizations.

In other provinces and territories, any healthcare costs associated with an adverse vaccine reaction would be covered through the public health system or, if disability occurred, through disability income.

According to the Canadian Vaccination Evidence Resource and Exchange Centre, the only other recourse would be through litigation. However, there is a limited understanding of the number of vaccine-injury related lawsuits in Canada.

CTV News contacted the federal government to see if there was any consideration for such a program in light of the circumstances surrounding COVID-19. A request for comment was not returned.

“Some of these individuals may actually be front-line workers, personal support workers, health-care workers, or those working in long-term care centres who will be asked to receive this vaccine not only for their benefit, but to protect the patients, the people they are caring for,” Dr. Kumanan Wilson, senior scientist at the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, told CTV News.

“Despite best practices being taken, if these individuals are harmed, we need a system in place to help compensate them in the event of injury.”

Wilson and Keelan have been calling for Canada to implement a vaccine injury compensation program for nearly 10 years.

In a 2011 report for the University of Toronto’s Munk School of Global Affairs, the researchers noted that, “the history and experience with vaccine-related injuries in many other western countries also suggests that it is highly probable that Canada will be faced with circumstances.”

At the time, Keelan noted that a no-fault compensation program for vaccine-related injuries would not only benefit people who suffer harm, it might also give those who are waffling about whether to get a vaccine the incentive they need to go ahead.

""We want people to be vaccinated. Vaccines are incredibly safe and they are one of the most effective public health measures that we have for preventing vaccine-preventable diseases,” she said in a 2011 interview with CTVNews.ca.

“We want them to have confidence in our publicly funded vaccine.""​

In a report to the World Health Organization in December 2018, the Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety wrote that no-fault vaccine injury compensation programs are considered a measure to maintain confidence in immunization programmes.",[]

Cineplex Inc., in this undated photo. (The Canadian Press)

B.C.’s two major theatre companies, Cineplex Inc. and Landmark Cinemas, are reopening some theatres in B.C. as the province enters Phase Three of its restart plan.

The Toronto-based movie theatre company, Cineplex, has made ticket purchases available online for a number of locations through the province, according to its website on Tuesday (June 30). Theatres which appear to be opening for viewings on Friday include locations in Nanaimo, Vancouver, Langley, Victoria and Burnaby.

There will be some changes for movie goers, however, to ensure physical distancing. This includes a staggered seating reservation system and contactless ticket purchases. Guests will not be able to use cash, except for the purchase of a gift card and will have to have exact change.

Concession options will be limited, as well.

Guests are being asked to arrive no more than 15 minutes prior to the movie start time. While masks are not mandatory, they are being recommended and those who don’t have a mask will be supplied one at no extra cost.

Behind the scenes, the movie theatre company has confirmed that seats, handrails and children’s booster seats will be wiped down with industrial-grade cleaning products between each showtime, followed by a deep-clean of the entire auditorium and lobby each evening.

The reopenings come as Cineplex vows to sue U.K.-based chain Cineworld PLC for calling off a $2.8-billion takeover of the company. On Monday, Cineplex said the COVID-19 pandemic had a “material negative effect” on its operations and resulted in a $178.4-million loss in the first quarter.

Theatre locations set to open Friday include:

Burnaby

Kelowna

Langley

Nanaimo

Richmond

Surrey

Vancouver

Victoria

Meanwhile, Landmark Cinemas will also be reopening its doors Friday, with similar safety measures.

“We ask movie lovers join us in doing their part to protect members of their community, including our employees, by staying home if they are experiencing any symptoms,” a statement from the company reads.

There, classic movies will be screened such as Jurassic Park, Jaws, The Empire Strikes Back, Wonder Woman, and ET: The Extra-Terrestrial. Tickets will be $5 through the week and $2.99 on Tuesdays.

Landmark theatres screening movies include:

Campbell River

Courtenay

Cranbrook

Dawson Creek

Fort St. John

Kelowna, Grand 10

Nanaimo

New Westminster

Alessia Cara emerged the top winner at this year’s Juno Awards, scooping up three trophies in a pre-recorded ceremony that paired celebration with an acknowledgment that more needs to be done to represent the diverse voices of Canadian artists.

While the Junos usually mark the biggest night for the country’s music industry, the Monday event, which streamed online, took on a noticeably different tone in isolation. Missing were those euphoric acceptance speeches inside a massive venue filled with adoring fans, replaced with a handful of intimate performances and some serious reflection on the future.

Running a bit over 90 minutes, the Junos were handed out at historic speed, with 42 categories announced by presenters that included “Stranger Things” actor Finn Wolfhard and singer Jessie Reyez, who also pocketed her third career Juno during the event.

But it was the 23-year-old Cara who shone brightest as her deeply personal 2018 “The Pains of Growing” picked up both album and pop album of the year, while she also won songwriter of the year for her work on several of its tracks.

It was an uplifting finish for the Brampton, Ont.-raised pop singer after her dreams of hosting the awards show were dashed in the wake of COVID-19. She was originally lined up to be MC for the televised event in Saskatoon last March before organizers pulled the plug in response to the pandemic.

Cara was quick to jump onto Twitter after she came out on top, posting a characteristically humble “um whaaaaaaat” before retweeting congratulatory messages from a couple of her followers.

Aside from the big wins, Monday’s ceremony took on a sense of social urgency as greater awareness surrounding representation of Black, Indigenous and other artists of colour became a topic some of the presenters addressed.

CBC Radio host Odario Williams, who’s also a member of hip-hop collective Grand Analog, opened the show with a candid acknowledgment of the many shortfalls of Juno Awards past.

He noted that it took 15 years after the first ceremony in 1970 before soul and reggae artists were included in the list of categories, while it wasn’t until 1991 when the first rap recording award was given to Maestro Fresh Wes.

“I’ve got to give a shout out to the Black and Indigenous Canadian artists of the ’70s, the ’80s, the ’90s that are true pioneers in the growth of our musical landscape,” he said, pointing to Liberty Silver, who was the first Black woman to win a Juno in 1985.

While Juno organizers have made efforts to improve diversity among its nominees in recent years, president Allan Reid recognized that much work still needs to be done.

“We are committed to the long-term inclusion and amplification of Black voices and a more equitable industry for all,” he said at the outset of the show.

“We are working on an action plan with specific commitments that we will reveal this July. We must do better for our BIPOC members of the music community, and we welcome you to hold us accountable.”

A number of the night’s music performances also put the subject of racism in Canada at the forefront.

Halifax alt-pop duo Neon Dreams, who were selected as breakthrough group this year, gave a sombre performance of “We Were Kings.” The coming-of-age reflection was co-written by lead singer Frank Kadillac about his own experiences rising above stereotypes, racism and high school bullying.

Indigenous singer Iskwe went outdoors to play ”Little Star,” a song paying tribute to Colten Boushie, Tina Fontaine and the lives of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls, filmed within the Mississaugas Of Scugog Island First Nation territory.

Other highlights included two-time winner Shawn Mendes, who was selected as artist of the year. “Senorita,” his duet with girlfriend Camila Cabello, won single of the year, making him the first artist to pick up that award for three consecutive years.

Breakthrough artist went to Oshawa, Ont.-born pop singer Lennon Stella, who’s already established herself as an actress on the primetime musical-drama series “Nashville.”

Avril Lavigne pocketed the fan choice award, which is voted on by viewers, for the second year in a row, and the third time in her career.

Among this year’s most surprising winners is Governor General Julie Payette, who’s a member of the Ottawa Bach Choir that won best classical album, vocal or choral.

Bryan Adams’ “Shine a Light” won adult contemporary album, giving the musician his 17th Juno win and putting him behind only Celine Dion and Anne Murray as the artist with the most Junos.

Julian Taylor released his newest album last week called The Ridge, and its title and first single pay homage to a farm he stayed at in Maple Ridge during his childhood.

Singer, songwriter, and storyteller Julian Taylor may be kicking it on the music scene in Toronto – both in studio and on stage.

But it’s his roots, and a few specific childhood memories of time spent on a Maple Ridge farm, that he’s bringing to life with in his newest solo album, The Ridge, released last week.

LISTEN

Taylor described the title song and first single, which was actually premiered back in April, as a dramatic, minor-key ballad that tells a story – in snapshots – of a young boy’s life on a farm before they had to sell it and move on.

For him, much of it is based on the true story of summers spent with his aunt and grandparents at their farm in Maple Ridge. And with his lyrics, he shares memories of following his older sister around the barn, chicken coop, and pastures of that farm wearing his little rainboots, catching frogs, shovelling manure, and chasing chickens.

“I spent every summer in Maple Ridge from the time that I was four until I was 14,” Taylor shared with The News.

“My grandfather is John Skanks. He ran the famous boxing gym there and his wife, my step-grandmother is Carol Skanks. I didn’t go to school there, but I trained at the boxing gym each summer.”

Last Friday the “The Ridge” was released and that same evening a few family & friends surprised me with a little social distancing soirée. I had no clue and was totally taken back. It was awesome. Thanks everyone all over the world for your kindness. I’m glad you like the album. pic.twitter.com/OAdHrYMnj2 — Julian Taylor (@jtaylorband) June 23, 2020

The eight-song Americana album was originally scheduled for a fall release date, but Taylor decided to speed up the release, in hopes his songs might bring joy to listeners in what he calls “troubled times.”

“I’d really like the heart of this record and the stories to connect with people. These are letters to members of my family. It’s something that everyone has – family (whether chosen or not) and memories.”

He co-produced it with long-time collaborator Saam Hashemi and recorded at The Woodshed, Blue Rodeo’s studio in downtown Toronto.

In addition to exposing many personal truths with this latest album, Taylor sees The Ridge as a way to reach out and help others.

Taylor plans to donate a portion of the sales from the album to a scholarship he started in honour of Bruce Adamson.

“This is something near and dear to my heart,” Taylor explained. “Bruce was my bandmate for over a decade before he ended his own life. I started this scholarship in his name to help at-risk children who are interested in pursuing music.”

Thank you @AppleMusic my producer friend @Saampler sent me these snaps shots and I’m kind of floored. Such good company to be in and it’s the first time on the charts so I’m feeling blessed. Thank you to everyone for listening to the new record. pic.twitter.com/pEMnLCJEJ1 — Julian Taylor (@jtaylorband) June 19, 2020

Taylor is a musical chameleon – who can be found performing rhythm and blues one day, and funk, soul, or rock the next.

The baritone vocalist, who happens to also play guitar and piano, is also described as a prolific musician who has released 10 studio albums in the past two decades.

He cut his teeth in the music industry as frontman with the Staggered Crossing band before the group disbanded in 2007 and he ventured out on a solo career. And since then, Taylor has toured across Canada numerous times and has shared the stage with such world-renowned acts as Nickelback, Jeff Healey, Midnight Oil, Collective Soul, and Blue Rodeo.

Classified as a major label veteran on the Toronto music scene, Taylor was personally invited to perform at the Olympics in Salt Lake City and Vancouver, and his songs have been placed in popular TV programs such as “Elementary,” “Private Eyes,” “Kim’s Convenience,” “Haven,” “The Good Witch,” and “Younger.”

With all tour dates currently on hold due to COVID-19, Taylor is doing regular livestreaming for his Patreon supporters, plus performing several public livestreaming performances including a recent concert for Mariposa Folk Festival, in partnership with the National Arts Centre.

668,668,1135,mapleridgenews,https://www.mapleridgenews.com/entertainment/maple-ridge-author-releases-first-in-icelandic-inspired-fantasy-young-adult-novel-trilogy/,Maple Ridge author releases first in Icelandic-inspired fantasy young adult novel trilogy – Maple Ridge News,'Ryan Uytdewilligen',2020-06-27,"Brooke Carter published The Stone of Sorrow, Book One in her Runecaster series with Orca Publishing

“I’ve always been intrigued by my Icelandic family history and by the wonderfully weird customs and myths in Icelandic culture,” said Brooke Carter, author of The Stone of Sorrow.

The Maple Ridge writer told The News that when she was in grad school, she studied a lot of Scandinavian literature and was obsessed with the sagas.

“The little germ of the idea for this book has been growing for a long time,” Carter assured.

The Stone of Sorrow follows seventeen-year-old Runa Unnursdóttir, who spends her days daydreaming of sailing away and exploring the world instead of studying the runes and learning her spells.

When a rival clan led by an evil witch raids the village and kidnaps her sister, Runa is forced to act and travel to the site of an ancient runecasting competition to try to win back the magical gem.

“During my MFA candidacy at UBC, I was fortunate to study with Susan Juby and she encouraged me to expand on a writing exercise I did about a young Runecaster who longed to sail away from her home,” Carter recalled.

That became the first pages of her own Icelandic saga.

“This series follows in much the same vein as the ancient ones—it’s about struggling through difficult times and fighting darkness with magic and hope,” she added.

Carter said it was important to her that any YA book she writes—particularly when fantasy has a lot of sexist tropes and traditionally patriarchal themes—reflects the young people who are reading it today.

”I wanted a feminist Viking-era fantasy, one that was concerned with female agency and self-determination,” Carter explained.

She also said Maple Ridge played a role in her inspiration – nature and wildlife, particularly Gold Greek, directly shaped some of her writing.

Additional to The Stone of Sorrow, Carter has also wrote Another Miserable Love Song, Learning Seventeen, Lucky Break, The Unbroken Hearts Club, and Double or Nothing.

“COVID-19 has hit the book industry hard,” she added, “and it has had a huge impact on our local libraries and bookstores. I’ve been fortunate to work closely with Black Bond Books in Valley Fair Mall – they have a display in store for The Stone of Sorrow – and they’ve been incredibly supportive of authors.”

The Stone of Sorrow is out now and can be bought from Black Bond, direct from Orca, or online anywhere books are sold.

It is book one in her Runecaster series with Orca and Book Two, The Saga of Lies, comes out in April of 2021, and Book Three, The Sisters of War, is due in April 2022.

With concert venues closed and most performers staying at home without gigs, Allan Reid said he’s focused on giving this year’s Juno nominees the recognition they missed after the pandemic sidelined a weekend of accolades in Saskatoon several months ago.

But he said this year’s show, which is skipping broadcast TV and going directly to CBC Gem, will look undeniably different than ones in the past.

“This is not the Juno broadcast that you would see on television — it’s not 12 performances and six awards,” explained Reid, who serves as president of the Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (CARAS).

Instead, the show is cramming two nights of trophies into a brisk ceremony recorded in isolation.

Winners in a dizzying 42 categories will be announced over 90 minutes, putting the marquee nominees for single and album of the year in the same spotlight as more obscure ones, such as world music and children’s album.

Presenters include Toronto Raptors’ Chris Boucher and two-time Juno winner Jessie Reyez, while songs will be performed by Iskwe, Neon Dreams, the Dead South, and Alessia Cara, who was originally supposed to host the cancelled television event.

The Junos will stream on CBC Gem, and CBC’s Facebook, YouTube and Twitter pages on Monday at 7 p.m. ET.

Reid spoke with The Canadian Press about making a different sort of Junos show, how the virus is slamming the music industry, and what it all means for the 50th anniversary of the awards set for next March.

CP: There are a number of significant changes to this year’s Junos, including that Alessia Cara stepped away from hosting duties. But she’s also this year’s top nominee with six nods. How will she be involved in the show?

Reid: Alessia is going to have a one-time performance of “Rooting for You” (a song that helped her pick up the songwriter of the year nomination). It’s an exclusive premiere from her new EP called “This Summer: Live Off The Floor,” which is coming out in July. She recorded it pre-pandemic.

CP: How about Jann Arden, who was originally supposed to be inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame by Anne Murray on the broadcast? Those plans have been sidelined, but is something going to materialize later?

Reid: We felt this was not the time… those are lifetime moments. So we haven’t finalized details. We are trying to figure out how to accomplish that, whether it’s around the 50th anniversary, or another way, we’re not sure. (There were) so many disappointments with the show not happening and that was definitely one of them.

CP: Speaking of the 50th anniversary, the Junos are slated for Toronto next year to mark the momentous occasion. The celebration would be the first time in a decade that the awards have taken place in the city. But considering the virus, is that still on?

Reid: Obviously, COVID is has changed everything. As a music event that is a mass gathering — from all of our events to the broadcast — we have to be taking into consideration: What if there is a second wave? Things are still relatively unknown about what the future will hold, so we need to make plans, and alternate plans, to make sure that we can still do a celebration. But what exactly that’s going to be, right now we’re still working through. I don’t think there’s anybody who can say for sure if we’re going to be able to gather 15,000 people in the Scotiabank Arena next March.

CP: After the last-minute cancellation of the 2020 Junos, do you plan to return to Saskatoon?

Reid: We’re working on a three- to five-year plan at all times with future cities. The challenge for Saskatoon is that everything was spent — it wasn’t like we cancelled a month before the event, (it was) 48 to 72 hours. And so all the food had been delivered to the convention centre for the gala dinner, the stage was fully built, we were starting rehearsals. The whole machine was rolling. So, from an investment standpoint, it requires new investment to make that happen again. Hopefully we’ll get a chance to go back.

CP: What about the Canadian music industry as a whole? Since the country effectively shut down live entertainment, we’ve seen musicians rally for financial support from the federal government, but there’s a more uncertain road ahead for live music. You’re head of CARAS, a non-profit that supports performers, so how do you see this shaping up?

Reid: The music industry — like sports, like restaurants — has been hit incredibly hard. It’s devastating to see artists lose their livelihoods who can’t tour. Yes, we’re very fortunate to have a government that’s providing (assistance) to try to make ends meet, but I’ve had so many conversations with artists who are just going, “I don’t know much how longer I can go. I’ve got to find another way to make a living.” If they’re not on the radio and not generating that kind of performance income, it comes from performing live. And I’m extremely worried of what’s going to happen to the venues across this country. If this is prolonged from three-and-a-half months into next year, how do those venues survive? And if they go away then where do the bands go to play?

Westcoast Harmony Chorus sings a cappella with more than 60 members of varying ages from all over the Lower Mainland – rehearsing on Wednesday evenings in Surrey.

While the coronavirus pandemic halted those physical practices, Westcoast Harmony is still performing traditional barbershop, contemporary pop, and rock arrangements together – now virtually over Zoom.

Kelly Collins a Maple Ridge member of the chorus, said the group has been rehearsing together that was since March.

One of the projects that has kept Westcoast Harmony busy is a 49-person rendition of O Canada, performed through zoom,

“Making the video took dedication, and time – I personally learned that a digital recording isn’t as forgiving as a live performance,” Collins said. “We had to bring our A game not only in vocals but with our face, our eyes! It was incredible and fun – I am so proud to be a part of this group of amazing people!”

Westcoast

The members all learned and recorded their video independently at home and submitted it for editing, an undertaking Downton said will continue on into new projects.

“Music, combined with a strong sense of community will always find a way to be together,” Collins said.

Grammy-winning country group The Dixie Chicks have dropped the word Dixie from their name, now going by The Chicks.

The band’s social media accounts and website were changed on Thursday to the refer to the new name for the band, which is made up of Martie Maguire, Natalie Maines and Emily Strayer. The band also recognized that the name was already in use by a band in New Zealand.

“A sincere and heartfelt thank you goes out to ‘The Chicks’ of NZ for their gracious gesture in allowing us to share their name. We are honoured to co-exist together in the world with these exceptionally talented sisters,” the band said in a statement.

The move follows a decision by country group Lady Antebellum to change to Lady A after acknowledging the word’s association to slavery. A statement on The Chicks’ website said “We want to meet this moment.” The term Dixie refers to Southern U.S. states, especially those that belonged to the Confederacy.

The Chicks, who are releasing their first new album in 14 years next month, also released a new video for their new song, “March March” that features videos and images from the recent Black Lives Matter rallies.

Lady A received criticism with their name switch after a Black singer revealed she’d been performing as Lady A for years.

The Chicks are the best selling female group in America with more than 33 million albums sold in the United States, according to the Recording Industry Association of America. Formed originally in Texas as a bluegrass group, the band hit commercial fame with their breakthrough album “Wide Open Spaces.” The band has won 13 Grammys.

The band was shunned by country radio over an incident in 2003 when lead singer Maines criticized then-President George W. Bush because of the Iraq War. They responded to the backlash with their song “Not Ready to Make Nice,” and swept the Grammys in 2007 winning three of the top all-genre categories.

A trip down memory lane transported 90-year-young Harold Pattern back to a horrifying moment in the old Hammond Theatre, when he watched his sister being shot only a few feet away.

Thankfully, the six-year-old Haney boy would soon learn that his sister was in fact alive and it was all make believe. Kathleen – who he believed was about 20 at the time – would not only survive but go on to perform in a few other theatre shows.

“But, I remember bawling my head off. That was my sister up there,” Pattern shared.

“I remember thinking some SOB shot her.”

Just a few weeks ago, the Legion Garden resident was sorting through some old family photos and ran across a few faded black-and-white images of his sister all dressed up for her role as Moonyeen Clare in the Maple Ridge Players’ Club production of Smilin’ Through.

Her character was killed by a jealous suitor in a three-act romantic comedy hosting in the former Hammond Theatre – now long gone – Pattern noted.

RECENT NEWS: The show must go on

The date was Friday, Jan. 11, 1935.

“That one really stuck in my mind. Here I see her laying there, dead, and I’m screaming, ‘someone shot my sister’.”

Turns out Kathleen wasn’t the only thespian in the Pattern family.

Their mother, Winnifred, was also involved with the theatre group for a time, often in front of house. But in this same show, Mom was also on stage as the Carteret’s family maid.

Pattern only recalls attended a handful of theatre performances after that traumatizing day 85 years ago.

But he, the baby among the five siblings, had an artistic bend too, and Pattern would take to the stage himself during his teens.

He played drums in a band first known as the Musical Knights and later rebranded as Herb Henry and Orchestra.

Over the course of about four years, he performed at a number of local venues, including the Old Aggie Hall, the Masonic Hall, the Sampo Hall in Webster’s Corners, the Pitt Meadows Heritage Hall (still standing), plus a number of other community halls around the Lower Mainland.

“All I have is a pair of drum sticks left,” and a lot of memories, Pattern reflected.

RECENT NEWS: Maple Ridge film studio plagued by vandalism as owner waits to reopen

This walk down memory lane was all sparked by the picture of his sister.

“I don’t know how long I’m going to be around. I am 90, afterall,” he said, explaining his quest to sort through old papers and pictures and prepare to be pass them along to his three children, six grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.

In addition to finding the pictures in his photo album, he found an old theatre bill for the show, recognizing some familiar names among the cast of characters and crew.

The list included former Maple Ridge alderman Reginald Franklin; Nick Mussallem, son of former car dealership owner and MLA George Mussallem; Russell Kirkpatrick of Kirkpatrick Sand & Gravel; and Ivan Hambly, who took over the Haney Gazette after James Junior Dougan’s death.

“They’re all gone now,” Pattern said.

But the memories live on, he said, at least for him.

Several Metro Vancouver-based tribute bands are uniting to raise money for charities during an online music festival.

The day-long Tribute Webfest 2020 is set for Saturday, June 27, in support of a diverse number of organizations chosen by each of the nine bands involved, through Canadahelps.org.

“With the loss of live shows and festivals in the time of Covid19, we wanted to create something unique and special for all of you who are missing the live music experience,” says a post on facebook.com/tributewebfest2020, where all of the 45-minute live sets will be streamed from 1 to 8:30 p.m. on Saturday.

“The level of talent on the roster are some of the best musicians playing in Canada today and we’re sure the lineup will have something for everyone. There will also be an interesting list of personalities from the broadcast and music industry that will be your hosts during the event.”

(Story continues below link to livestream)

The fundraising goal is $25,000 for the festival, which will feature the bands Eagle Eyes (playing music by the Eagles), Arrival (ABBA), Bad Moon Riders (CCR), The Hip Show (Tragically Hip), Fo Fighters (Foo Fighters), Reckless (Bryan Adams), Fair Warning (Van Halen), Dreams (Fleetwood Mac) and Montreal-based New World Men (Rush).

All performers are donating time to the cause, along with broadcast video director Gene Greenwood of TourBus TV, host/co-producer Larry Hennessey (JACK 96.9), host Michael Williams (former MuchMusic VJ), tech director Jeff Scharf, and executive producer/host Joe Foley.

“Together we can show everyone the Canadian Spirit is alive and well in these difficult times,” says the festival’s Facebook event page.

The supported charities are Food Banks BC, Alzheimer Society of BC, Music Heals, Pacific Parkinson’s Research Institute, Greater Vancouver Food Bank, Fondation Santé Urbaine, McGill University Health Centre Foundation, BC Cancer Foundation and The Gord Downie & Chanie Wenjack Fund. As well, all bands will be supporting The Frontline Fund.

An international award-winning performance by the BC Girls Choir is back in the running for the top Children’s Choir of the World through the Llangollen International Musical Eisteddfod.

Having gone and unexpectedly claimed the top prize in 2018, artistic director Fiona Blackburn was hoping that the choir could do it again this year – but COVID-19 put a physical stop to that opportunity.

Instead, Llangollen – the 75-year-old competition, which takes place in a small Welsh town – uploaded all of the winning performances since 1994 onto their website and is asking audiences to cast their votes for the 2020 winner.

Maple Ridge members of the winning choir included Sydney Coates, Carly Roberts, Mila Tkatchouk, Ella Treleaven, Maeve Whalley, and from Pitt Meadows, Erin Ryu and Manae Ryu.

Blackburn said the initial win was significant because only two Canadian choirs have been named for the past quarter century (Newfoundland being the other).

“The competition has been cancelled this year, but people from all around the world are encouraged to ‘sit in the judges’ chairs’ and vote for their favourite performance,” she said, a tad disapointed about not getting to return to the community.

“The charm of that particular place… I will never ever forget it,” Blackburn assured.

The artistic director lived in Maple Ridge for several decades until making the move to Vancouver Island several years ago.

“We get together on Saturdays with girls age six to seven, all the way up to teenagers,” she said, adding that she happily makes the trip each week from the island for that practise.

“We use Coquitlam as a base. There are members from Bowen Island to Mission… White Rock, Langley, Maple Ridge, and Pitt Meadows,” she explained.

While performance prospects such as the International Choral Kathaumixw and been cancelled and their next international tour is planned for 2021, Blackburn is encouraging people to visit the Llangollen website and have a listen to the choir.

The BC Girls Choir performance is of ‘Ban, Ban, Caliban’, which describes the ogre in Shakespeare’s The Tempest.

People can visit https://llangollen.tv/home-2020/children-corau-plant and cast their vote.

After a brief illness Dr. James Peters Johnson passed away peacefully on Saturday, June 27, 2020 at the age of 81. Jim was born on May 26, 1939 in Hamilton, Ontario. In 1964, he graduated with his O.D. degree from the College of Optometry of Ontario (in Toronto) and has been an active practitioner for 56 years in Hamilton Ontario, Sechelt British Columbia and in the Vancouver area. In 1978, he was inducted as a fellow in the American Academy of Optometry, and from 1976 to 1979 he taught at the School of Optometry and Vision Science, University of Waterloo.

Jim was an enthusiastic organist, an exceptional hobbyist and member of the Canadian Toy Train Association, and a worthy mentor to all young relatives.

Extended members of the Johnson, Peters, and Bays families will not soon forget him. Cousin Number Two was a founding member of The 77 Club.

Jim is survived by three brothers: Gilbert (Denise) of Cobourg, Dennis of Guelph, and Stephen (Wendy Warnken) of Toronto. Uncle Jim is fondly remembered by Piers (Brie Gillespie), Maximilian (Elizabeth Whelan Marcolini), Elliott and Emma, as well as great-nieces Beatrice and Peregrine. He is especially missed by two godsons – Donald (Cindy) Johnson of Vegreville Alberta and Elliott Johnson.

Jim is sadly missed by good friend and former wife Pamela Earle. He is predeceased by his parents, Dr. Arthur A. Johnson and Pearl (Peters) Johnson U.E. His family is thankful for the care and dedication of the staff at Ridge Meadows Hospital and Surrey Memorial Hospital in British Columbia during his final days.

In his senior years, Jim made an annual trip to Cambodia and his friends there send this message: “We have lost a kind man who has helped many people brighten up their eyesight and many children with school materials. He will Rest in Peace and his acts of kindness will be remembered by many people here in Cambodia. He will always be missed.” The ashes of James Peters Johnson will rest in a Buddhist Temple in Cambodia.

In lieu of flowers, please make a donation to a charity of your choice in memory of Dr. James Johnson. A celebration of his life will be announced at a later time. Messages can be left for the family at an on-line Guest Book at www.mapleridgefuneral.caObituary",[]
707,707,1174,mapleridgenews,https://www.mapleridgenews.com/marketplace/how-to-make-your-tax-refund-work-harder/,How to make your tax refund work harder – Maple Ridge News,'Jun.',2020-06-29,"Use your refund to help reach your financial goals

“Sometimes you just need a little help getting back on track, and that’s where a payday loan from MyCanadaPayday.com can help,” says Sundeep Thind, manager of MyCanadaPayday’s Surrey office.

When that tax refund comes in, it’s easy to see it as “free” money to treat yourself to something fun – a weekend away, or special purchase you’ve been eyeing for awhile.

But remember, your refund is actually a percentage of your own hard-earned income, so if you really want to get the most from your refund, it pays to pay yourself first:

1. Start an emergency fund: Your tax refund is the perfect opportunity to start your emergency fund – money set aside in case of situations like income loss or unexpected car repairs. Start with as much as you can afford, building up over time until you have enough to cover three months of bills. When the unexpected happens, you’ll be prepared.

2. Send it directly to savings: Setting up direct deposit allows quicker access to your refund, and can make it a lot easier to save that money: instead of sending it to your primary chequing account, direct your refund right to your savings!

3. Pay down your credit: Most can benefit from paying off credit card debt. If you have multiple cards, put your refund onto the card with the highest interest rate to save money over time in interest charges, and boost your credit score!

4. Put it toward a major financial goal: Maybe it’s time for a more reliable car or to think about buying your first house. A larger downpayment can make major purchases much more affordable longterm, lowering the amount paid over time and offering long-term advantages like lower interest rates. Your tax refund can help make your financial dreams a reality!

5. Start a retirement account: While retirement savings can be tough to commit to with so much else tugging on your wallet, every bit helps. If you’ve already started saving through an RRSPs, RIFs or Tax-Free Savings Account, your tax return can give your savings a boost. Even better, that contribution will lighten your tax burden next year!

6. Invest in the online stock market: Today online investing is becoming easier and much more accessible, allowing beginners and professionals alike to create a diversified portfolio. Robo-advisors provide sophisticated algorithms, comprehensive dashboards and interactive reporting that allow you to take a set-it-and-forget it approach and still see long-term benefits.

7. Spend it (wisely) on yourself: There’s no harm in spending a little of your tax refund on yourself, but as with so many things, the key is moderation. Maybe it’s time to pay for that certification or class, or invest in a stand-up desk. These are ways to use your refund to invest in yourself!

When you need short-term help

If your refund was not as much as you were expecting, or worse yet, you end up owing this year, easy, safe and secure options are available through Canada’s licensed payday loan specialists.

“Sometimes you just need a little help getting back on track, and that’s where a payday loan from MyCanadaPayday.com can help,” says Sundeep Thind, manager of MyCanadaPayday’s Surrey office.

“We have the entire process online, including the one-page application form, and our specialists are here to help you reach your financial goals.”

The Sugar Lake Recreational Properties is your waterfront base for year-round adventures. The 66-lot shared interest lakefront development features 45 fully serviced RV lots and 20 cabin sites, all just steps from the beach and lake.

Summer is all about experiences we’ll share for years to come: Paddles on the lake, forest trails to explore and tall tales told around the campfire – maybe about the fish that got away that very afternoon!

The chance to write your summer story is here.

(And even better, you can add to it come fall and winter!)

Your story starts at Sugar Lake, just an hour east of Vernon and less than two hours’ drive from Kelowna – so easy to get to, but what a difference once you get here.

The Sugar Lake Recreational Properties is at the heart of lake life – your waterfront base for the adventures yet to come. The 66-lot shared interest lakefront development features 45 fully serviced RV lots and 20 cabin sites, all just steps from the beach and lake.

While other regions in the Okanagan and Shuswap can quickly get busy with boats, swimmers and other recreation enthusiasts, here you’ll enjoy many of the same opportunities, but away from the crowds, in your own piece of paradise. And if you simply want to share the sun with your go-to beach read, that’s just fine too!

Rounding out the amenities onsite are a new dock with boat slips available for lease, group picnic areas to share a meal with family and friends, and even an on-site guest lodge, with its own licensed, full-service bistro.

Of course, not all experiences are focused around the lake, so from Sugar Lake, it’s easy to turn the page and choose your own adventure.

Outdoor recreation opportunities take you off the lake and into thousands of hectares of forest begging to be explored. Cast your rod into nearby rivers and streams, or head to the hills of Silver Star, where summer and fall mountain biking gives way to winter skiing and snowshoeing.

Just 14 kilometres north, explore Cherryville, where recreation opportunities include bird watching, horseback tours, fishing and more in the foothills of the Monashee Mountains. Continue east to Monashee Provincial Park to enjoy spring wildflowers, hiking, fishing and some of the oldest rock formations in Western Canada.

And a little farther afield to Nakusp, experiences include inviting hot springs, a thriving local arts community and the waterfront walkway overlooking Upper Arrow Lake.

Ready to write your next chapter at Sugar Lake? Learn about vendor financing for your own carefully selected RV site or cabin, and about maximizing your investment with the option of renting out your site or cabin when you’re not using it. The management team can oversee all the details, and if you change your mind, withdrawing from the rental pool is just as easy.

(Contributed)

Music is known to help improve people’s lives.

From children in hospitals to seniors, palliative care patients, those with AIDS and HIV, at-risk youth, people in rehabilitation and people grieving the loss of others.

However, music therapy programs across the country are facing an uncertain future.

Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, some programs have put on pause, while other therapists have turned to virtual methods to support their students.

But, a musical therapist with the Ridge Meadows Association for Community Living came up with a novel way of bringing her services to those who need them – drive-by music therapy sessions.

“I realized that we all had to adapt and find ways to function, and that I needed to model not only survival but also how to thrive in a rapidly changing world,” said RMACL music therapist Birgit Giesser.

Ridge Meadows Association for Community Living provides services for adults and children with disabilities and Giesser thought it was crucial to connect with her students who might potentially feel isolated due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

People, “who may not fully understand the pandemic but are still experiencing the full breakdown of their normal lives,” she said.

So, Giesser created mobile sessions for her students following provincial health guidelines.

“Music therapy for me is about activating the joy, curiosity and skills we have within us and sharing them with one another. Music makes our lives meaningful and helps us cope with challenges,” noted Giesser.

Music Heals, an organization that raises money and awareness for music therapy across the country, funds the Community Living program in Maple Ridge, and matched money raised from last years Tea-ki Bar Social hosted by T’s Once Upon A Tea Leaf, where the back alley is turned into a cocktail party with DJ’s, vendors and food trucks.

READ MORE: A thirst for positive change

But, like many charities across the country, Music Heals has lost about $970,000 in revenue due to the cancellation of fundraising events, including this years Tea-ki Bar Social.

Since Taryn Stephenson, who runs the Music Heals Charitable Foundation and who is also co-owner of T’s, started working with Music Heals, she has become more “hyper-aware” of the healing power of music.

“I really wanted to make sure that people in Maple Ridge had access to that,” she said.

And, said Stephenson, if they don’t have people who believe in the power of music and want to make donations to the charity, then they run the risk of current programs not being sustainable.

“What a sad day to not have music fill the hallways of facilities and hospitals,” she said.

Since 2012 the organization has funded 32,000 hours of music therapy across Canada.

Four Maple Ridge Secondary students are hoping to make names for themselves in the NCAA next season.

Jaxon Brant, Noah Bradly, Cole Low, and Jacob Pahnke have seen plenty of success with their lacrosse careers so far and scholarships to Division I and II schools are their latest achievements.

As members of the Ridge Meadows Burrards they have won provincial championships with both their U-15 and U-18 squads, and now they’ve conquered B.C., the athletes are hoping to replicate the feat in the U.S.

Brad Rennie coached the young men when they were playing for the Burrards U-15 squad. He mentioned being impressed with their accomplishments but not surprised.

“They just seem to be a different breed of athlete to be honest with you,” Rennie said. “Not only were they pivotal leaders on the field, they’re also excellent leaders in the community as well, and that’s why they stand out.”

He said coaching the players as they rose through the local ranks was an honour.

“I’ve learned as much from these guys as they have from me. Competition’s within their blood, so it’s been fun as a coach to sit back and watch all the hard work they’ve put in to reap the rewards at this time in their careers.”

Jacob Pahnke will play at the highest level of the four. He received a four year scholarship to play lacrosse at Div. I school, Canisius College in Buffalo, New York.

He said it was a relief to finally settle on a place to continue to pursue his passion for the sport.

“You spend two years talking to schools and going to all the tournaments, so it felt good to make a decision,” Pahnke noted, adding he’s looking forward to playing the sport he loves while getting an education at the same time.

Cole Lowe, who earned a four year scholarship to North Greenville University in South Carolina, is excited to branch out on his own for the first time.

He said he will major in international business, and has set a few goals for himself in the sport.

“Hopefully I’ll make the all-state team down there,” Lowe said. “I’m going to have to hit the gym, get my fitness up, and then kill it on the field.”

Jaxon Brant and Noah Bradley will have the benefit of going to the same school. They have both accepted scholarships to Lander University in Greenwood, South Carolina.

“I’m really excited to go there,” said Brant. “I’m excited to be on my own, and to have the freedom, and grow up a bit. It’s a new chapter.”

In addition to playing lacrosse, he plans on studying graphic design, and hopes to become a firefighter some day.

His future room mate, Bradley, said he never thought he would be able to get this far with lacrosse.

“Honestly, I’m kind of humbled by it,” he said. “Just to be there playing with some top end players… it’s going to be fun.”

A commitment to grinding on the field has resulted in the honour, he said.

“I think my strength is the effort I put into my game,” Bradley said, “Typical I like to go for those ground balls.”

Travis Gathercole was the coach of the Ridge Meadows Burrards U-18 team which just won this year’s provincial championship.

He is quick to heap praise on the talented young players.

“All of those kids did whatever was asked of them and they did it to a very high standard,” Gathercole said.

“I’m not at all surprised they got the offers they did. They’re great kids, great athletes, and they’ve got good heads on their shoulders.”

The coach also pointed out a lot of praise deserves to go to scholarship recipients’ team mates who pushed them on to success.

“If you look at the overall picture, they wouldn’t have achieved what they have if they didn’t have the quality of athletes to train against consistently.”

Dear Editor,

[RE: Haney Hotel owner fights province to re-open his main entrance, June 25, The News online]

I could not believe my eyes when I noticed that the main entrance to the Haney Hotel was being closed!

That is an establishment that has been here for nearly three-quarters of a century, and to see such a cold and callous act – to destroy their main entrance – is unbelievable.

So, their main entrance is now going to be in the back alley? Only one entrance and exit, is that allowed for fire and safety reasons?

I would hope not.

Why is the entrance to Chevron still allowed of Lougheed Highway?

If I was to guess why this is happening, I would think this could be a beginning of plan by the province to expropriate the property for whatever reason.

RELATED LETTER: Government needs to help, not hinder Maple Ridge business

Or, is it because of the state of emergency in place by the B.C. government, giving them the powers to do what ever they deem necessary, which they seem to be reluctant to give up?

However, there a very bad smell to the whole proceeding – this is [not] any form of resemblance of a democratic society.

This is my considered opinion.

If you have a letter you’d like to submit to the editor for consideration, please email us at editor@mapleridgenews.com. Look forward to hearing your thoughts.

Dear Editor,

[Shared letter sent to Maple Ridge Mayor Michael Morden and council]

I would like to suggest that Maple Ridge implement an on street-parking permit.

This is a device used in many cities in North America and is used to supplement operating funds for the city and create a safer access for emergency vehicles when neighbourhoods have become plugged with street parking.

My neighbourhood for instance, between the hours of 6 p.m. and 6 a.m. is hard for even one car to navigate the street, let along if a fire truck should need access.

I know it is human nature to avoid the need to purchase the ability to legally park on the street. They then would be more likely to use their driveway/garage in order to negate the purchase of an on-street parking permit.

For those who still wish street parking between the hours of 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. (overnight parking), they would either pay for a permit ($100/per year) or in violation of this bylaw would receive a ticket issued by bylaws enforcement officers for $100 for each parking infraction.

I only suggest this because I feel it has become more and more dangerous as most of our neighbourhoods contain many secondary suites, which overwhelm the planned parking alloted when the subdivision was first planned.

UNRELATED LETTER: Re-opening too early could prove deadly to man

Many homeowners don’t use their garage for parking, many use them for storage or a place to put their junk.

Many home with lane access to driveways don’t use their driveways, opting to park in the front of their homes instead, adding to the ongoing problem.

These people would be more apt to use their driveways if they were presented with the idea that they would need to purchase a permit to legally park on the street.

These methods are currently in use in White Rock and Vancouver.

IDEA TOSSED AROUND BEFORE: Permits for residential parking in Maple Ridge?

Between the cost of permits and the issuing of fines, this bylaw could generate an adequate amount of funds that would fund the hiring of new personnel required to staff this bylaw enforcement, and with a considerable amount to go into the city operation budget.

Lastly, I would like to amplify the fact that we are reaching a dangerous situation that could affect the ability of fire trucks and ambulances from reaching a house fire, a heart attack victim in need of intervention by EMS, or a child needing medical attention.

The legal issue of the municipality failing to correct these situation could, in the future, lead to legal hardship for the municipality that could easily prove that the safety of its taxpaying citizen were neglected.

Please give this serious consideration and please see the need for this suggestion and how it can be instituted at no cost to the city. In fact, the city will not only make money on this bylaw, but will also have the ability to hire more personnel to enforce these new bylaws.

Thank you for listening.

SAME ARGUMENT MADE LAST FALL: Implement a parking permit system

Dear Editor,

[RE: Haney Hotel owner fights province to re-open his main entrance, June 25, The News online]

Here we have an employer and owner of commercial property no doubt pays a large tax bill.

I would hazard to guess he provides some of the hotel rooms for housing to people in transition, as well as tourists to our city – and he is being hammered by the province and city over a driveway that will impact his business.

Why is the driveway of the Salvation Army not being closed?

RELATED: Haney Bypass work underway in Maple Ridge

They are the only property on that corner to retain a driveway.

The reason for closing his driveway is that corner is a high crash zone.

This is a pretty poor excuse.

The Salvation Army probably create more traffic and pedestrian issues than the hotel, and yet they are provided access – be fair and close all the driveways near that corner.

There might be another reason, other than laziness, that motivates people to leave poo in bags beside the garbage cans – and it has nothing to do with COVID, one letter writer suggests. (Special to The News)

Dear Editor,

[RE: Maple Ridge dog walker pissed with discarded poop bags, April 12, The News online]

Dear Maple Ridge dog walker, who is pissed with discarded poop bags, I want you to know that you are not alone.

We community members, who take pride in the cleanliness and sanitation of our community, understand the frustration about the dog poop bags.

I also would like for you to think about this…

Have you ever seen someone attempt to make an environmentally friendly decision by leaving a pop can or bottle beside the garbage can in hopes that a Good Samaritan would pick it up and recycle it responsibly?

Did you know dog poo is banned from our city garbage cans?

Did you think that these people might be trying to be like the person who made an attempt to recycle the pop bottle by placing it beside the garbage can, not in it.

My point is, people leaving their doggy doodoo has been going on long before COVID came around.

These people who are leaving the poo under the garbage bin most likely are not scared of touching the garbage bin handle and they aren’t lazy after all, they just know the harmful effects this biohazard has on our environment.

When dog poo is put in the landfill and not disposed of correctly, it harms vegetation and exposes people and other animals to bacteria and parasites.

Have you ever visited the Pitt River Regional Greenway? It is a beautiful walking trail along the Fraser River in Pitt Meadows.

I recently visited this trail on a Father’s Day walk with my dad.

Believe it or not, I did not see one bag of dog poo anywhere. I believe the reason for the scarcity of the dog poo filled bags were because of the accessibility of all the wonderful dog poo bins! This area is maintained by the Metro Vancouver Parks and in my humble opinion, the City of Maple Ridge and also Pitt Meadows should take notes and implement this genius idea.

Why is it that at places, such as off-leash dog parks and other trails, where many of our fur babies love to walk are deprived of dog poo waste bins?

If they created half as many dog waste bins as they did garbage cans, this would actually give the citizens responsible choices to make while disposing of our crap, literally.

Maybe we wouldn’t be finding all these little bags of doggy poo poo everywhere and we wouldn’t have as many Maple Ridge dog walkers who are pissed with discarded poop bags.

752,752,1219,mapleridgenews,https://www.mapleridgenews.com/opinion/finlayson-b-c-s-economy-devastated-by-pandemic-and-the-measures-taken-to-contain-it/,Finlayson: B.C.’s economy devastated by pandemic – and the measures taken to contain it – Maple Ridge News,'Jun.',2020-06-24,"‘Policy-makers should be acutely sensitive to the financial health of the overall business sector’

In its June 2020 Monetary Policy Report, the U.S. Federal Reserve – America’s central bank — observed that the COVID-19 pandemic “poses acute risks to the survival of many small businesses,” adding that widespread failures among such firms “would adversely alter the economic landscape of local communities and potentially slow the economic recovery and future labor productivity growth.”

The B.C. government would be wise to take this message to heart. Small businesses, as defined by the government’s statisticians, account for 98 per cent of all enterprises and approximately half of private sector jobs.

In the current challenging and uncertain economic climate, policy-makers should be acutely sensitive to the financial health of the overall business sector, including smaller firms.

Many of these companies are in sectors that have been hard-hit by pandemic-related social distancing, outright business closures, dwindling consumer demand, and reduced investment – for example, food services, accommodation, recreation, non-essential retail, travel, arts and entertainment, construction, and personal services.

Compounding the risks for small firms, they also tend to be more financially fragile than larger companies, with most having limited cash reserves and lines of credit.

Although B.C. has done a good job flattening the curve of COVID-19, the province’s economy has been devastated by the pandemic and the measures taken to contain it. For 2020, the Business Council forecasts that economic output (GDP) in the province will drop by almost 8 per cent, which is far greater than the GDP losses experienced in previous recessions.

As of mid-June, B.C. is down 350,000 jobs compared to early 2020 — a catastrophic fall in employment. While the worst of the COVID-19 economic downturn may be over, the consequences of steep declines in GDP, employment and business activity since February are expected to be felt for years to come. And much of the pain will be visited upon smaller and mid-sized enterprises in every sector and region of B.C.

The dramatic slide in consumer spending and business activity triggered by mandated closures across large segments of the economy, coupled with the virtual cessation of travel, border closures, and the onset of a global recession, has already led to casualties among B.C. firms.

Under the government’s staged economic reopening plan, many formerly shuttered businesses are – or soon will be — open again.

However, in sectors like retail, restaurants and bars, leisure, recreation, hotels and motels, and personal services, businesses are now required to maintain strict social distancing for customers and staff, to limit the number of people on-site, and to devote more resources to cleaning and sanitation.

This amounts to a significant change in the operating environment for many businesses, one that is likely to translate into both lower revenues and higher costs.

Looking ahead, a substantial number of businesses will not last through the end of 2021. We estimate that at least 10 per cent of the 200,000 B.C. businesses with paid employees could be gone in the next 6-18 months.

Some will make the difficult decision to cease operations, while others will be forced into insolvency because they are no longer able to cover their bills or service their debts.

The impact of a shrinking private sector will not be limited to business owners/operators. Fewer firms also mean lost jobs for B.C. workers, less vibrant communities, and greater economic hardship for families.

Faced with this alarming prospect, the provincial government must do what it can to minimize mortality among locally-based companies. Equally important, it should focus on creating an environment that supports business start-ups to help fill the gap that will open up as thousands of existing companies fail.

Despite a few positive steps, to date the NDP government has come up short in supporting the business community and in encouraging new business formation.

In fact, the government has largely carried on with its pre-pandemic policy agenda, which paved the way for increased tax and regulatory burdens for most businesses and higher payroll costs for employers.

A change of direction is necessary if policy-makers are interested in kick starting economic recovery and making British Columbia a top-ranked jurisdiction for new private sector investment and entrepreneurial activity.

Germany has launched a coronavirus tracing app that officials say is so secure even government ministers can use it. Smartphone apps have been touted as a high-tech tool in the effort to track down potential COVID-19 infections. (Hannibal Hanschke/Pool Photo via AP)

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau recently announced the release of a nationwide contact tracing app. He remarked that it would be “something you can just download and forget about.”

In the wake of demonstrations in response to the killing of George Floyd, the Minneapolis Public Safety Commissioner stated that the police had begun tracking down protesters through a process he analogized to “contact tracing.” Whether or not contact tracing apps are or will be used to locate demonstrators, it is clear that the barrier between public health officers and police officers is permeable.

Blurring these lines is dangerous on multiple fronts. New surveillance technologies aimed at combating COVID-19 could be co-opted as a foothold to strengthen the surveillance state. In turn, skepticism of state-promoted contact tracing technologies may lead to insufficient adoption of them by the public, undermining their effectiveness and taking away a potentially important tool to fight the pandemic.

Legal precedents

This situation is not the first time that public health, privacy and law enforcement have collided. In the case of Vancouver Police Department vs. BC Centre for Excellence (BC-CfE) in HIV/AIDS, the Vancouver Police Department demanded private medical records from the BC-CfE in connection to an aggravated sexual assault case.

The implications of this request were massive. The BC-CfE has records on almost all known HIV-positive people in the province that include personal, demographic and even genetic information. Understandably, the BC-CfE resisted the request.

The B.C. provincial court held that society’s interest in protecting the confidentiality of the records outweighed the objectives of the police investigation as disclosure of patient and research information in furtherance of a criminal investigation would “erode the Centre’s ability to maintain a comprehensive program for HIV-Aids research and treatment. The benefits to society from that research are immeasurable.”

A similar argument could be made of any request to access data collected to fight COVID-19, such as data collected through contact tracing. It is not difficult to conclude that many people would refuse to voluntarily enrol in contact tracing apps like Alberta’s TraceTogether if they believed their information was not safe, as polling has suggested that privacy is a a significant concern with respect to such apps. Without buy-in from a critical mass of users, a contact tracing app would likely fail.

Structural framework

Yet legal arguments to protect our privacy through court proceedings are not enough in the post-COVID era. A broader structural framework to ensure privacy for health information is required.

Former Ontario Privacy Commissioner Dr. Ann Cavoukian developed a concept known as “privacy by design” in the late 1990s. Though many of the principles of this concept are geared toward the creation of information systems, they could well be applied to a data framework. The most pertinent foundational principles are as follows: the approach to privacy should be proactive rather than reactive; privacy should be the default setting and; transparency.

If properly crafted, a statute could make the government’s COVID-19 tracking efforts achieve privacy by design; it could ensure that any information collected for the purposes of COVID-19 surveillance be used only for health purposes, precluding use for any other purpose.

This would not only make privacy the default setting, but would also be a proactive approach, acting to prevent the state from engaging in violations of privacy, rather than attempting to reverse the damage in court after it has been done. Furthermore, a statute could ensure improved transparency by mandating that users be asked for permission each time before any identifiable data about them is used, informing them of the purpose of that use and then notifying them again once that information has been used.

New crisis solutions

The COVID-19 crisis is unprecedented, as are the measures we have collectively taken in response. We are all understandably keen to take whatever action is necessary to bring this virus to heel. Yet we must also remain vigilant.

Temporary impingement on rights and liberties all too often become permanent. As many have pointed out, this is not the last global pandemic nor, given the climate crisis, the last major catastrophe that will occur in our lifetimes.

The demand for increased bio-surveillance will grow in order to prevent this, and future pandemics. The Charter of Rights and Freedoms, of course, contains provisions protecting our privacy as well as our right to life, liberty and security of person. However, it is clear that in order to realize these rights, further action is needed to keep the realm of public health officers and police officers separate. Privacy and transparency need to become the default, not something that must be fought for in a courtroom after the fact.

The barrier between public health officers and police officers must stay intact. The challenges we face in the months and years ahead will not be easy to overcome, but we must face them with open eyes and to ensure we avoid an Orwellian pandemic in which we entirely lose control of our right to privacy.

Although men have been assigned the stereotype of working the backyard BBQ, it is a joy that is shared by most home culinary enthusiasts. It’s a summertime passion. The smoky essence of smoldering charcoal starts my mouth watering as my mind conjures up recollections of flame-licked meats, and fire roasted vegetables. With a few basic tips, you can overcome any barbequing intimidation you may have.

Overcooking lean meats is one of the most common mistakes made. Although it is imperative for poultry to be fully cooked, this does not give you the right to transform it into dry charred remains.

Brining can help protect light-meat poultry and lean pork. This is a technique that involves soaking in a salt-water solution for a period of time prior to cooking. Not only does this add moisture to the center of the meat, but also seasoning, as the salt saturated water is drawn in. A simple brining formula would be: one quarter cup table salt dissolved in 4 cups of water for pieces of poultry or lean pork. Let the meat sit in the brine for at least 1 hour in the refrigerator. Remove from the brine, pat them dry, and cook as you normally would. This brining process will provide a moisture protection shield to help keep fully cooked meats juicy. However, this is only a safeguard – overcooking is still possible, but this lessens the chance. The only other consideration you may need to give your recipe is the amount of seasoning. The meat will already be seasoned somewhat from the salt in the brine, so back off on the saltshaker.

Try this technique the next time you are barbequing chicken breasts, pork chops, pork tenderloins or pork loins. You will be impressed with the results.

The salt used can be any salt: Kosher, Sea, etc. – the important aspect is to ensure that the granules are the same size as table salt. A coarser grind will result in less salt per equal measure as more air trapped between the larger particles.

It is important to mention that this is the simplest form of brine: water and salt. There are many more complex recipes available on the internet that will bring flavor and moisture, but this easy brine is a straightforward starting point. Another essential pointer to bring up is that red meats are typically not brined; marinating is better for red meats, but that’s slated for another column topic.

Dear Chef Dez,

I love barbequed chicken with the skin on, however it always seems to get burned on the outside well before the center gets cooked. I know many people cook skinless chicken pieces and they have no problem, but I enjoy having the skin on. However, the fat from the skin promotes flare-ups, and thus gets burned. How can I avoid this without losing my enjoyment of having the skin?

Tracey S., Abbotsford

Dear Tracey,

Indirect heat is the way to go to conquer this problem. When using direct heat (with the flames directly below the meat) the skin will drip fat onto the flames and cause flare-ups, and thus create excessive burning. Depending on what type of barbeque you have, setting it up for indirect cooking will be different. Many ceramic charcoal BBQs will have a ceramic plate for heat diffusion, while gas grills will mostly rely on having a burner turned off under the meat and closing the lid. This will utilize the heat from the other burners to do the job.

It’s getting easier to access a swab test for COVID-19, but you still need a referral from a doctor, and a little courage. (Jessica Peters/ The Progress)

First of all, I need to sincerely apologize to the health nurse who performed my COVID-19 test.

I don’t always act like the melting Wicked Witch of the West, growling and pawing at my own face. Then again, who knew that swabs were half-a-foot long and could reach around to scratch your brains.

For the rest of you, I’ll back up a bit. It all started last week, with a post-workday nap that turned into a deep sleep.

Then there was the dry cough, the runny and tender nose, the pain in my forehead. Ultimately, there was the fact that all of the above didn’t disappear with a good dose of allergy medications.

I called in sick, because clearly I had caught a cold. And in addition to the ultimate cure of hot soups and daytime television, I had to go for a COVID-19 test. If we’ve learned anything from COVID-19 it’s that distancing works. And even the slightest chance that I may have spread the novel coronavirus around the office in the preceding days sent a flu-like shiver up my spine.

The first part was the easiest. I called up my family doctor’s office and told them I was sick. The doctor called back the next day and agreed I needed a test. A family member picked up the requisition and I was on my way to the Chilliwack Public Health Unit.

READ MORE: VIDEO: New COVID-19 testing machine takes load off B.C.’s virologists and labs

I ran through the raindrops to the front door, only to be turned around to the side of the building I had sprinted past.

Around the corner, signs on the building and markings on the ground direct you where to stand and what to do. A nurse was waiting at the doorway, ready to screen me for my symptoms. With that out of the way, I was in the building, which has been temporarily turned into a make-shift COVID-19 testing ward. The first thing I noticed is that the windows are all sealed off with poly and tape.

A few wide rows of spaced apart chairs face away from the entrance, and a few testing areas have been curtained off along one wall.

Distancing is in place that is well above the suggested two metres, and it made me feel safe. It also reminded me that this is a serious threat to some people’s health. It underscored why I was standing there, requisition in hand, sniffles in my nostrils, and a fear of what’s about to happen. I would have preferred to be back at the office, writing. Prior to COVID-19, I wouldn’t even have blinked twice at going to work with a dripping nose. A bit of cold medication, some strong coffee and tissues and I would have been on my way.

But we know more now, don’t we? If anything, staying home when sick should be adopted as the new normal.

I’m sent to a curtained off area, and we run through the list of questions. As my ‘yes’ answers pile up faster than the ‘no’ answers, the hypochondriac within me feels like maybe I do have the virus.

When it was time to tilt the head back, and let the nurse do her thing, I felt immensely brave. But as brave as I am in my heart, my body always has other plans. I felt my eyes widen as the swab entered my nose and quickly jammed up. My eyes teared. I gagged. I grabbed my chin, for some unknown reason, coughed and snorted and began to make those aforementioned witchy noises.

With no luck on the right, she moved to the left. I felt the swab glide up easily and for a slice of a second, I thought this would be easier. Of course, I was wrong and I was once again writhing in the chair.

So the bad news is, I’m utterly ridiculous. The good news is, it was over very quickly and shouldn’t be avoided for any reason. Results are quick, available on myehealth.com within 24 hours, and if you test positive they will call in the same time frame.

Also good news? My COVID-19 test that day was negative and it was likely just that regular ‘old’ coronavirus — the common cold. As of today, I’m one of more than 171,000 people who have been tested for COVID-19 in B.C. To date, there have been 2,775 cases in this province, and 168 deaths. Eleven people are in the hospital today with COVID-19, and five of those are in an ICU.

And so, despite the temporary discomfort, I would do it again.

For more information on how and when to get a COVID-19 test, visit www.bccdc.ca, call 8-1-1, or contact your physician’s office.

Dear Editor,

[RE: Get tough on crime but leave law abiding, registered gun owners alone, June 13, The News]

Mr. O’Brian spelled out quite clearly the implications of the Order In Council (OIC) firearm ban on legal firearm owners in his well-written letter, but there is a greater issue behind it.

That is the use of an Order In Council to pass such major, wide-sweeping legislation without parliamentary procedure and due process.

All 338 of our sitting MPs were elected by the people to represent all citizens in Canada.

This use of an OIC has robbed Canadians proper debate in the House of Commons and second reading in the Senate, thus denying Canadians due process in a fully functioning democracy.

On that basis alone, the use of the OIC tool must not be allowed to stand, for it sets a dangerous precedent.

If it is allowed to stand, what’s to stop future governments from using this tool to pass legislation to trample the rights of another group?

Will an Order In Council, for example, be used to enact mandatory euthanasia for anyone over, say, 85 years old, because they might be a burden to the healthcare system?

Impossible, you say?

I urge anyone reading this to revisit history, for things like this have happened before, and it would be incredibly naive to think it couldn’t happen again.

Disarming a population – from farmers, ranchers, sport shooter, and collectors – was proven to be the first step to some of the greatest human rights abuses in history by governments that have lost their way.

This use of an Order In Council, or, shall I say, abuse, was not just a slap in the face of democracy. It was a right cross, and Canadians need to remember the lessons of history in order to avoid repeating it.

Submit letters to the editor through our website, via email or in writing.

Dear Editor,

I will avoid the inevitable downsizing to either a condo or apartment complex as long as my wife and I can maintain our detached home and yard.

The writing is on the wall though as we already need to hire-out maintenance work that is beyond us now.

But what is the alternative, if we oppose high density developments?

Yes, such developments come with their own problems including increased traffic.

Urban sprawl is a problem that all municipalities must deal with. It is better to build up, isn’t it, then to see productive farmland built over and lost, along with habitat for birds and animals.

As humans, we also need green spaces.

UNRELATED LETTER: Predictions of COVID reality 30 years into the future

Too much has been lost because of developers taking the easy and cheapest way out – aided and abetted by municipal planning departments – by paving over paradise as the song from the 1960s said.

It was true then, and it is still true today.

For most people in this part-time, minimum-wage-with-no-benefits economy, owning a detached home anywhere in the Fraser Valley is a pipe-dream.

But people need housing and higher density developments can provide that.

Such developments need to be people friendly, not simply boxes to warehouse people in – as that comes with its own set of social problems and isolation.

I might hate the idea of eventually downsizing, but I hate the sight of urban sprawl even more.

This pandemic should be a wake up call to become as self-sufficient in food production as possible. So, for that reason alone, higher density is the only viable future as the population grows. Otherwise the future will be the fulfillment of the Fraser Institute long held dream of seeing the entire Fraser Valley covered in housing from the Coast to Hope.

I couldn’t imagine anything more horrific.

Robert T. Rock, Mission City

SoundON is a province-wide campaign and resilience fund to help bring British Columbia’s music community back together and provide desperately needed support to those connected to the sector – artists, presenters, production staff and venues.

The first project of its kind in Canada, it is the ultimate in community and collaboration as it brings together industry members from across the province with one common goal – to bring the province’s vibrant music industry back to life.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on the once effervescent music industry in BC, said Lindsay MacPherson, executive director at Music BC.

“It is a pain that has been felt by so many, especially those working in arts and culture. A group of leaders from across the industry have come together to collaborate on a way to bring back life to the sector,” MacPherson explained. “We have everyone from city officials, promoters, presenters, venues, production, and artists working on the project. Our aim is to be highly collaborative, in an unprecedented way, to bring our beloved industry back.”

The music industry in BC was among the first sectors to be closed due to COVID and will be among the last to reopen, a scenario that is predicted to create devastating consequences for the industry.

Without immediate action, more than 90 per cent of Canadian independent music venues are anticipated to permanently close within the next six months.

SoundON.ca will fund and stream uniquely curated content through the lens of festivals and presenters.

With the help of public funding, corporate sponsors, and individual donors, SoundON aims to put economic flow back into the industry.

The website also provides music lovers worldwide a whole new way to discover music in BC. Amazing shows from across our province will be featured.

SoundON is produced by a volunteer collective from the music sector, who are passionate about making a difference.

The first stages, announcing today, invite presenters from across B.C. to apply to curate shows that will be streamed on SoundON.ca beginning July.

An anticipated 100 shows will be produced to showcase the incredible diversity of British Columbia’s music community. While shows will be free to watch on SoundON.ca, donations will be encouraged to help fund the project through its ongoing phases.

SoundOn is presented in part with initial funding from Creative BC, the Province of British Columbia, several corporate sponsors, and private funders.

(Theatre in the Country/Special to the Langley Advance Times)

Since early April, Langley’s Theatre in the Country (TIC) has been presenting live streaming productions to a growing audience of viewers.

So far, they have presented 12 distinct scripts from one-acts to full plays from material largely in the public domain.

With a rotating group of 45 plus performers they have offered shows from Oscar Wilde to the Thin Man series.

This week they will present their first full length modern play, Nana’s Naughty Knickers, with playwright, Katherine Disavino in attendance via Zoom from Los Angeles.

DiSavino is a Los Angeles writer who serves as an executive story editor on CW’s Nancy Drew.

Her four published plays have been translated into multiple languages and performed around the world.

What protagonist Bridget saw as a unique opportunity to stay with her favorite Nana in New York for the summer, quickly turns into an experience she’ll never forget.

It seems her sweet Grandma is running an illegal boutique from her apartment, selling hand-made naughty knickers to every senior citizen in the five borough area! Will her Nana get arrested – or worse – evicted?

When Theatre in the Country shuttered its doors on March 16, artistic director Reg Parks said they had no idea when or if they would reopen, but they started planning on how to keep their performers and patrons active and engaged in a live theatre experience.

“The idea is simple: using their bank of over 45 performers they will perform a new costumed, readers theatre show each weekend on Friday and Saturday night,” he said. “The audience that has been asked to pay what they can starting at $5. It is the company’s hope that no one needs to miss out on a play just because of financial uncertainty caused by a layoff or otherwise.”

Parks said TIC will open their doors with a two-person musical titled The Last 5 Years by Jason Robert Brown.

It will feature two veteran TIC performers, and an audience reduced to 50 from their normal capacity of 200.

Other shows will also be offered with casts of two to five and will be announced at a later date.

Theatre in the Country is a community based dinner-theatre which was founded by Reg and Erin Parks in 2013.

It was first located in Maple Ridge, before moving to downtown Langley three years ago.

Nana’s Naughty Knickers will be performed nightly on July 3 and 4 at 7:30 p.m.

Tickets and information on upcoming performance is available at https://theatreinthecountry.com.

798,798,1265,langleyadvancetimes,https://www.langleyadvancetimes.com/entertainment/langley-filmmaker-revamps-award-winning-documentary-about-his-own-addiction-story/,Langley filmmaker revamps award-winning documentary about his own addiction story – Langley Advance Times,'Ryan Uytdewilligen',2020-06-27,"A Ravaged Soul: Anatomy of an Addict was originally released by v12films in 2014

Langley resident Brian MacDonald recalled sneaking around between classes to score drugs throughout the 1990s.

He was an instructor at the time, owning and operating Vancouver’s Broadcast College in the midst of a career that had taken him on-air and into the management side of the industry.

MacDonald told the Langley Advance Times that was also the time an addiction to heroin took over his life.

After cleaning up in 2002, MacDonald decided to follow a passion for film and start his own production company – v12films.

“We produce documentaries on the human condition and struggle,” he said. “Stories of redemption.”

MacDonald began with his own story and began to explore the journey of addiction through a one-hour documentary called A Ravaged Soul – first released in 2014.

“It takes a look at the downtown East Side of Vancouver,” MacDonald explains. “It’s an ugly story and hard to watch.”

The filmmaker said he left no stone unturned, frankly discussing sexual and physical abuse that preceded his addiction.

Key members of his life speak in A Ravaged Soul, including MacDonald’s mother and his ex-wife, the mother of his child.

He credits their son as his major inspiration for turning his life around.

“It’s a really emotional 60-minute ride,” he assured.

Stan Mingo, a former dealer from the Vancouver Downtown East Side also appears in the documentary, a man MacDonald referred to as “the king of the heroin trade.”

MacDonald said Mingo speaks openly about his experiences and a time when he even plotted to kill MacDonald.

Altogether, the documentary charts MacDonald’s experiences of getting sober through his own eyes and the views of others who were and remain close to him.

“I guarantee it is as honest of a documentary that you will see and I’m proud of it,” MacDonald assured.

His first attempt at the production in 2014 led to an Official Selection award at the REEL Recovery Film Festival in New York.

MacDonald has since released a myriad of documentaries in the past five years, most of them dealing with drug addiction and the stigmas that go with the territory.

Today, the owner of v12films said he updated his inaugural work by updating the situation and some of the documentary’s technical aspects.

“The production value was weak so I brought it up to a more professional standard and up to speed,” he said.

With the stresses of COVID-19, MacDonald said the documentary had plenty for relevancy as drug use as, in his words, gone off the charts.

With other productions in the works including a dramatic pilot called The Orchestration of Audrey, MacDonald invited people to contact him at v12films.canada@gmail.com to view the documentary.

“If someone you love is suffering from addiction, please contact me to show them the film,” he said.

MacDonald is 18 years clean and moved to Langley 14 years ago to be closer to his ex-wife and son.

People can visit http://www.v12films.com/home to find out more about MacDonald and the production company.

Westcoast Harmony Chorus sings a cappella with more than 60 members of varying ages from all over the Lower Mainland – rehearsing on Wednesday evenings in Surrey.

While the coronavirus pandemic halted those physical practices, Westcoast Harmony is still performing traditional barbershop, contemporary pop, and rock arrangements together – now virtually over Zoom.

Anne Downton, a Langley member of the chorus said the group has been rehearsing together that was since March, but said they do missing singing together – but the impersonal method will have to due in the meantime.

“This was a way to sing together, and it’s been wonderful to hear the group sound again,” she said.

One of the projects that has kept Westcoast Harmony busy is a 49-person rendition of O Canada, performed through zoom and edited by Downton.

“We also really want to contribute to our local communities’ celebrations; we know Canada Day celebrations are looking different this year, so we wanted to be able to share our music, and hopefully bring joy to everyone who watches,” Downton said.

The members all learned and recorded their video independently at home and submitted it for editing, an undertaking Downton said will continue on into new projects.

Andrew Strain photo.

On the West Coast, we know that the province’s fertile valleys are ripe with, well, food and wine. But did you know that the area that stretches from the fields of the Fraser Valley to the vineyards of the Okanagan is also an ideal spot for outdoor play?

For every fresh peach that’s devoured, there’s an orchard to cycle through. For every Pinot that’s sipped, there’s a paddle that first needs to be dipped in a cool lake. So, embrace this delectable yin and yang, and rediscover your next great BC adventure.

Explore the Fraser Valley

In British Columbia, we’re blessed with natural settings that are as fruitful as they are beautiful. Rolling fields, vineyards, and wide-open spaces are all ready for exploration – and adventure.

A trip just east of the city to the Fraser Valley is the quickest way to immerse in farm life. Beginning in Langley, you can nibble your way from farm to farm to Abbotsford and beyond – all family-run operations that boast everything from fresh-from-the-garden fruits and vegetables to homemade waffles, ice creams, and ciders. Among the pretty landscapes and grazing cattle, you can ride the rapids during a river-rafting excursion or try your hand at catch-and-release sturgeon fishing near Chilliwack. To understand more about local Indigenous culture, opt for a guided tour of the area’s significant sites.

Road Trip to the Okanagan

There are many ways to journey to the Okanagan, and we know them all: the oft-travelled Highway 1; scenic Highway 7; Highway 5/Highway 97, a.k.a. “the fast route”; and Highway 3/Highway 97. But don’t rush along these corridors.

Fuel up at coffee shops and dig into some of the best home cooking anywhere at famed roadside diners in Hope. With bellies full, test your mettle on winding trails or seek out quiet spots at local green spaces. Pedal fast and furious at bike parks or visit historic ranches and outdoorsy resorts, and consider staying awhile.

Valley summers were made for places like Vaseux Lake. Grant Harder photo.

Enjoy Lakeside Adventure

Spend more than five minutes in BC’s sun-kissed Okanagan, and you know that wine touring, craft breweries, cideries, and meaderies are prime for summer visits. Also prime for warmer months? Hours spent on a boat, swims in hidden coves, and long, leisurely paddles with your pod.

Beyond the shorelines, explore the bucolic valleys and the sustainable agritourism that fuel this lakeside lifestyle. Try two-wheeling among the vineyards – a novel way to visit local wineries near Penticton. Hike the Okanagan’s many trails, discover local Indigenous culture near Osoyoos, or visit a family farm for homegrown treats. Another option? Take it all in from a patio at one of the region’s premier winery restaurants. Cheers to that!

Grace Storteboom celebrated her 90th birthday at Cheam Village in Agassiz on Sunday (June 28) afternoon surrounded by a few dozen physically distanced friends and family members.

Steve “Elvis” Elliot crooned tunes fit for the King himself, serenading Grace and her guests with hits like “Don’t be Cruel,” a few gospel favourites and “All Shook Up.”

Storteboom was clearly having a wonderful time, and so were her guests. Before starting his rendition of “It’s Now or Never,” Elliot asked Storteboom if she had any Italian blood in her. The sassy nonagenarian proudly declared her Dutch heritage but told Elvis “I can be anything you want me to be.”

Local dignitaries MLA Laurie Throness and District of Kent Mayor Sylvia Pranger also stopped by to pass on their well wishes. Storteboom received more than 150 birthday cards from the community, including one from The Observer.

On Tuesday (June 23), Agassiz Speedway announced the July 4 Freedom Summer Classic, a full afternoon of racing to be streamed via the Agassiz Speedway Facebook page.

The upcoming race will feature mini stock cars and dwarf cars racing from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. and midgets and street stocks racing from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.

“One time, one night only,” the promotional poster reads. “No spectators; just for the love of freedom and racing.”

This race has been in the works since at least mid-June, in which Darrell Porayko called on the racing community via social media for a first-come, first-serve race featuring a maximum of 20 cars; the current provincially-mandated gathering restrictions meant the drivers and crew members present could only amount to 50 people total.

Three days before the official announcement, speedway officials said American Independence Day was “looking good for an exhibition race.”

“No points, no money,” the June 20 post said. “This is only to satisfy your hunger to race.”

Were it not for the pandemic, the 2020 racing season would normally have begun on May 2. Up until the plan for the July 4 race came to be, drivers were limited to test and tune dates and speedway staff worked on maintaining and updating the track and facilities, missing the rush of racing all the while. Speedway staff had no general meeting for much of the pandemic until June due to stricter gathering restrictions.

The Langley Speedway Historical Society donated vintage trophies for the Freedom Summer Classic.

The Reach Gallery Museum is open again, and the public is invited to view the latest exhibitions.

The facility first closed its doors in mid-March in the midst of three exhibitions that were intended to be open until late spring, and began offering online content to allow people to interact with the exhibitions from home.

The site reopened on June 1, and those exhibitions will now remain open until late August.

The exhibitions include “a soul is not made of atoms,” a solo exhibition by Vancouver-based artist Trevor Van den Eijnden that features immersive sculptural and light installations.

Also featured is Glimmers of the Radiant Real, a touring group exhibition from Ontario making its only western Canada stop at The Reach, and Art on Demand 6.2, the latest installment in The Reach’s Emerge exhibition program, which mentors young and emerging artists and curators in the Fraser Valley.

Adrienne Fast, curator of arts and visual culture at The Reach, said in-person programming – classes, workshops, and camps – has been put on hold. But The Reach continues to regularly update its website with educational materials and interactive activities.

She said The Reach has implemented a number of changes that include hand sanitizing stations, physical-distancing measures, directional signage, and an increased cleaning schedule.

Summer hours of operation are Tuesday to Friday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Saturdays from noon to 5 p.m. Visit thereach.ca for more information.

A short film that is based in Abbotsford is part of an online Vancouver documentary film festival that is streaming online from June 18 to 26.

The film Have You Forgotten Me? takes place in Abbotsford and is about a Sikh family and the oldest Sikh Temple in North America.

Anchored by the letters of a wife left behind, Vancouver-based director Baljit Sangra considers one Sikh family’s story of separation and assimilation, and of creating community in a new country.

The film is included in the DOXA Documentary Film Festival and is featured in this year’s Shorts Program: BC Voices.

DOXA was originally scheduled to take place in Vancouver from May 7 to 14. The online festival features more than 64 films – shorts and features – from across Canada and the world.

Films will be available to watch on demand for the duration of the festival. Once unlocked, viewers have 24 hours to watch the movie of their choice.

Virtual tickets for each film are $8 general and $6 for seniors/students/low income. A $60 pass provides access to all the films. The films and tickets are available at doxafestival.ca.

— The music video for Isaiah Faber’s (Powfu) “death bed (coffee for your head) ft. beabadoobee” was filmed mostly at Abbotsford Mill Lake Park. The song has over 440 million views on Spotify and the video has over 90 million views on Youtube. Screenshot from Youtube music video.

A two-month-old song from a Mission artist has become the biggest music hit to come out of the Fraser Valley in recent history.

Isaiah Faber, known as Powfu, released “(coffee for your head) ft. beabadoobee” in April 2020, and the song been heard by over 440 million people on Spotify.

The music video, much of it filmed at Abbotsford’s Mill Lake Park, has reached over 90 million views on Youtube. Faber’s other music videos are also filmed at various Abbotsford locations.

In order to become the Fraser Valley’s biggest hit of all time, it would have to surpass the Carly Rae Jepsen’s smash 2013 hit “Call Me Maybe,” which has over 1.2 billion views on Youtube.

It seems music runs in the family as Faber’s father, David, is the lead singer of the Canadian punk band Faber Drive. Faber Drive, also hailing from Mission, was nominated for a Juno Award in 2008.

Local love and a world of design possibilities come together at this Ashley HomeStore.

What’s your style? Finding a way to reflect that in your home can send you searching through Pinterest, streaming the latest HGTV special or shopping store to store to find one that speaks to you in your price range.

Or, you could browse a world of styles, sizes, materials and colours in one location!

From Vintage Casual, Traditional, Contemporary and anything in between “there’s always something for every budget, and something for every taste,” says Nichole Dansie, from Ashley HomeStore in Abbotsford. “Whether you’re moving out for the first time and you’re looking for that starter sofa or you’re decorating your dream home, you’ll find the styles that you love here.”

Where others source from outside manufacturers, Ashley HomeStore is a complete design-manufacture business, meaning you won’t find other brands on the showroom floor. What you will find is a wide selection of furnishings to suit just about every home and every style.

While the company’s North American presence allows for savings that only larger-scale manufacturing affords, the local, family-owned Fraser Valley stores serving Abbotsford, Langley and Coquitlam demonstrate the value of neighbours helping neighbours.

“I think one of the best qualities our HomeStores offer is that we’re very focused on your experience. That means we’re here to work with you to answer any questions you have – before or after you leave the store,” Dansie says.

TIPS FROM ASHLEY HOMESTORE

Measure! Before you leave the house, break out that measuring tape. “Measurements are very important, not only for the space it’s going into, but also your doorways, hallways, stairwells and elevator,” Dansie points out. The last thing you want is to LOVE that 90-inch couch but find your elevator is only 86” tall.

Consider your colours. Are you trying to match a particular paint sample or floor colour? “I find a lot of people will bring in a piece of flooring with them. One person even brought a piece of drywall painted with their wall colour,” Dansie says. “And remember, lighting is so important, but it can be difficult to get a clear reflection of that under showroom lights. We’ll often suggest people take a pillow cushion outside to the natural light to get a better idea of the true colour.”

In addition to in-home delivery and set-up, with extensive health and safety protocols in place, Ashley HomeStore also offers 1 year of in-home service with their delivery. Products also include a one-year manufacturer’s warranty, with additional options available.

905,905,1372,abbynews,https://www.abbynews.com/marketplace/a-bright-future-awaits-for-your-cabinets/,A bright future awaits for your cabinets – Abbotsford News,'Jun.',2020-06-22,"Give new life to your tired, worn out cabinetry, millwork and furniture

If you love the style and colour of your kitchen cabinets, but hate their worn appearance, the solution may be easier and more affordable than you think!

Cabinet refinishing can return the look you love at a fraction of the time and cost of new cabinets, explains Tracy Booth, who has been professionally refinishing cabinets for more than 30 years.

“Are you wanting to spend $30,000 or are you wanting to spend $2,000?” asks Booth, owner of Gleam Guard Cabinet Refinishing, serving Greater Victoria and Vancouver Island.

While cabinets can go slightly lighter or darker, Booth emphasizes that his focus is on returning the cabinets to their original appearance, not changing their appearance.

“Wood has character and we want to preserve that character. Our goal is to restore, not change,” Booth says.“If areas have gotten dull or worn, we can fix that. That’s what makes us cabinet refinishers. A Gleam Guard trained professional can tint and make them look like new, which is a very technical skill.”

Technique and experience matters

The distinction is important, as refinishing – compared to simply painting or staining – takes a unique skillset. “It’s important people know that the person who is in their kitchen has the training to do the perfect matching,” notes Booth, whose Gleam Guard is BBB-accredited with an A+ rating.

“While we repaint painted cabinets; we do not paint brown cabinets white.”

To ensure the perfect, long-lasting finish, preparation is key. A Gleam Guard trained professional begins by prepping the surface with a vigorous clean, then professionally matching and applying the new colour. To complete the process, a wood floor finish is applied for a long-wearing result, protecting your cabinets from hazards such as water damage, grease and dust (with the added benefit of being easier to clean and maintain).

The entire dust-free process takes only a day or two, and there’s no need to unload your cabinets – easy!

Not just for kitchen cabinets … or wood

For those who’ve chosen a different material for their cabinets, you’ll find help here, too!

“We also do laminate refinishing – any product that your cabinets are made of, we can clean it and put a fresh finish on it,” Booth says.

In fact, all interior millwork can be refinished, so think beyond the kitchen to your built-in bookshelves, doors, windowsills, furniture and more.

To learn more, visit gleamguardcabinetrefinishing.ca. The Gleam Guard team is working during the current COVID precautions, taking steps to keep staff and clients safe, but for those who are self-isolating, Booth is happy to make appointments for later this summer.

In a letter penned by Rob Dhanu and signed by 20 other lawyers, the argument is put forth that if liquor stores and laundromats and Walmart remained in operation amid the COVID-19 pandemic, why couldn’t the courts?

And with phase two in B.C. seeing yet more businesses able to open safely, why not provincial courts?

“Charter scrutiny will require us to ask how it was possible that British Columbians could receive a massage or a haircut but still not access their courts?” the letter states.

(See below for the entire letter, unedited.)

The letter goes so far as to say that: “One of the greatest court systems in the world is in its worst moment of crisis as numerous criminal matters dangle on the precipice of oblivion.”

Why oblivion? Why is delay so serious? Any non-lawyer who has spent any time in courts will know that nothing moves quickly. And time and again, it’s these very defence lawyers asking for adjournment after adjournment.

• READ MORE: COVID-19: B.C. provincial court to reduce operations

• READ MORE: COVID-19: B.C. supreme and provincial courts suspend regular operations

Asked about this perceived hypocrisy – defence lawyers who constantly adjourn files now complaining about delays – Dhanu responded that very few matters ever go to trial as they are resolved before that stage. He said files are often adjourned so that resolution can happen in the background. Many things need to happen outside of court including, for example, discussions with Crown, reference letters being completed, expert assessments made, and counselling or treatment arranged.

What is of great concern to all defence lawyers is delays that violate the Charter rights of the accused, rights that are now further enshrined in the so-called R v. Jordan decision that says all provincial criminal matters need to be resolved in 18 months, from charge to trial (or resolution).

What could prove to be of great concern for the justice system going forward, according to Dhanu and his colleagues, is the definition of “exceptional circumstances” where delay is allowed under Jordan.

The novel coronavirus outbreak that led to a global pandemic is about as exceptional as it gets, so clearly Jordan arguments will be a no-go, right?

Not so fast, say the lawyers. According to the court, in Jordan exceptional circumstances lie outside the Crown’s control in that they are reasonably unforeseen or unavoidable. But Dhanu says the analysis doesn’t end there. He says the Crown must “proactively mitigate the delay” and help prevent “a possibly devastating cascade of delay issues.”

He argues further that if the courts open in several weeks or months with protective measures in place such as plexiglass and hand sanitizer, then the question will be, why couldn’t this have been done sooner since they did it at, for example, the liqour store?

And if the courts open in several weeks without such measures, even more questions around delay will be asked.

An even further argument is being made regarding the BC Supreme Court, which in places like Chilliwack functions side-by-side with provincial court. The BC Supreme Court is re-opening its doors (supposedly) this week, while the much busier (from a criminal perspective) provincial court is limited to two courtrooms in Surrey and one courtroom in four other courthouses in the Lower Mainland as of June 8.

“There will be an obvious inconsistency if one level of court in this province is open for business and the other is not,” Dhanu writes.

All of this is to say that COVID-19 is a terrible yoke on an already over-burdened justice system.

And while I am not a lawyer, I don’t for a second believe any Crown counsel will agree that delays stemming from the pandemic will count towards the Jordan 18-month ceiling. Will any judge buy the argument? We will see, but I don’t know.

But that doesn’t mean these 20 lawyers don’t plan on floating that boat when provincial courts are back up and running in the coming weeks.

——————

The full letter penned by Fraser Valley defence lawyer Rupinder (Rob) Dhanu and signed by 20 lawyers sent to the B.C. government this week:

QUIS CUSTODIET IPSOS CUSTODES – “WHO WATCHES THE WATCHERS?” ~Juvenal

A growing tsunami of criminal cases may be at risk of never seeing the light of day due to delays arising from the coronavirus pandemic and the response of British Columbia courts. In mid-March of this year, all three levels of our court system effectively shuttered their doors to all but the most “urgent” of cases. Unfortunately, even these most urgent of matters could not proceed due to the woefully inadequate technological infrastructure at the disposal of the court system. Today, we are face to face with an ever-increasing log jam of delayed hearings that add daily to the already clogged corridors of our courts. The continued inability of our court system to stem the tide increasingly raises the spectre of unreasonable delay under section 11(b) of the Charter.

Thus far, the overwhelming assumption among court stakeholders has been that Covid-19 constitutes “exceptional circumstances” when it comes to R. v. Jordan and delay. According to the court in Jordan, exceptional circumstances lie outside the Crown’s control in the sense that they are reasonably unforeseen or unavoidable. But the exceptional circumstances analysis does not end there. Both the justice system and Crown must also proactively mitigate the delay resulting from a discrete exceptional circumstance. This is the sword of Damocles that now hangs over our justice system in terms of a possibly devastating cascade of delay issues arising from continued closure and a seeming inability to efficiently or effectively pivot to deal with them.

Much of the current criticism against our justice system has centred around the failure of technology to pick up where the closure of our courts left off. There can be no doubt that the tradition laden court system has lagged behind advancements in technology that have reshaped our daily world. However, the technology issue is a proverbial red herring. Even if the technology available to our courts were far more advanced, the vast majority of hearings still could not have proceeded. That is because in person hearings are required to tender exhibits, for credibility assessments to be made, to allow juries to sit or myriad other reasons underpinning our system of justice. Thus, the technology issue may factor into the delay analysis but it plays a far lesser role than the real question. That being whether our courts took reasonable steps to mitigate issues of delay using the considerable resources they did have at their disposal.

Charter analysis will begin with the fact that, unlike many other jurisdictions that imposed strict “lockdown” policies, British Columbia’s approach was to require safe operation of a broad range of services designated as essential services, to protect the health care system and maintain access to key services and supplies. Many non-essential businesses remained open, provided they could operate safely. Our court system and related legal professionals were designated an essential service by the government of this province. From hospitals to laundromats and liquor stores to large retailers with numerous locations and employees, essential and non-essential businesses across the province quickly responded to social distancing directives in a timely if painful manner in order to keep their doors open. Thus, the delay analysis begins with the question of why our courts could not pivot in a timely manner to do the same.

Analyzing inconsistencies in the response of our courts will inform the delay analysis. On March 13, 2020, a joint notice was issued by all three levels of our courts that they had developed a coordinated approach to manage impacts of coronavirus on their operations. However, this coordinated approach did not translate to what was actually occurring on the ground for long. Due to the nature of appellate practice, the British Columbia Court of Appeal was able to shift gears to online hearings courtesy of Zoom video conferencing technology in a way trial courts simply could not.

But the real dichotomy in responses will likely lay between British Columbia Supreme and Provincial courts. Supreme courts opened for at least some in person hearings including trial matters in May by simply employing social distancing protocols. Meanwhile, our Provincial courts remained closed. Our Supreme Court announced that they would be reopening their doors on June 8, 2020 (although if this actually occurs remains to be seen). On the other hand, the workhorse for most criminal matters, the Provincial Court, directed a far more limited opening of 2 courtrooms in Surrey and 1 courtroom in 4 other courthouses in the Lower Mainland and Fraser Valley as of June 8th. There will be an obvious inconsistency if one level of court in this province is open for business and the other is not. This inconsistency is perhaps most glaring in courthouses where both Supreme and Provincial courts function side by side within the confines of the same building. For instance, a litigant could seemingly walk into Victoria Supreme Court to have their day in court but it would apparently be too dangerous to do so in the Provincial courtroom next door.

The delay analysis will not only involve exploring inconsistencies between our courts, but also with government. On May 6, 2020, the provincial government announced that Phase 2 of British Columbia’s Restart Plan would commence as of May 19 and include restoration of a wide array of services including elective surgeries, dentistry, physiotherapy, massage, the retail sector, hair salons, restaurants, pubs, libraries, offices, sports, parks, child care and much more. The government further announced that Phase 3 would commence in June and would include reopening of schools, hotels, parks and movie theatres.

Meanwhile, on May 7, 2020, our Supreme Court directed that all criminal matters scheduled for any type of appearance up to and including May 29, 2020 were to be adjourned. One day after this, on May 8, 2020, the Provincial Court announced “Covid-2” or the second phase of yet further rolling adjournments for all criminal law matters scheduled for trial or continuation between May 19 to July 3, 2020. If any in custody trials in the month of May were believed to be urgent, accused, their counsel or Crown counsel were required to arrange for an “Urgency Application”. Otherwise, consent to the adjournment would be deemed to have been provided.

The incongruous and similarly timed announcements of our government’s Phase 2 Restart Plan and the announcement of “Covid-2” by our Provincial Court, as well as its unnamed equivalent from Supreme Court, raises further questions when assessing delay. Dr. Bonnie Henry, British Columbia’s provincial health officer, had declared that citizens of this province were able to safely resume numerous services and activities including those involving close physical contact. By May 15, 2020, health authorities were directing that gyms could reopen. Charter scrutiny will require us to ask how it was possible that British Columbians could receive a massage or a haircut but still not access their courts?

The delay analysis will not only involve scrutinizing inconsistencies but also assessing outcomes. If our courts reopen weeks or months from now with some physical distancing measures in place, a somewhat different courtroom layout with plexiglass and hand sanitizer added for good measure we will have to ask why it took so long for such basic measures to be taken when businesses of all sizes accomplished such changes within days. If they reopen without some of those basic measures in place even more questions will be raised as to delay. In fact, some observers have already noted that courtrooms, where counsel, court clerks, the judge and witnesses typically sit approximately 6 feet apart from one another are better situated than many businesses to respond to the pandemic. Assessing outcomes will involve working backwards to see whether resources were made available by government to our courts on a timely basis, whether proper expertise were engaged and when as well as myriad others questions to determine whether circumstances remained exceptional.

Charter challenges will not be limited to delay alone as the “Urgency Application” process implemented by our courts is also vulnerable. Under section 7 and 11(d) of the Charter, all Canadian citizens have a right to a fair trial. The “Urgency Application” process turns these Charter rights on their head by reversing the burden so an accused person, who is presumed innocent, has to make application to even have an opportunity to access this right. This includes individuals who are in custody awaiting trial and whose very freedom is at stake.

Perhaps even more problematic, the “Urgency Application” process turned out to be a straw man as virtually no such application was successful. This is because our shuttered court system actually did not have the ability to accommodate even so-called urgent trial proceedings. As a result, the potential for constitutional argument exists that the “Urgency Application” process was, in fact, a veneer of due process used to dress up the closure of our court system. A hearing process with no chance of success is not due process and strikes at the core of our constitutional values. Further, failure to bring an “Urgency Application” meant you were deemed to be giving away this right. This is problematic for every single litigant but especially so for self-represented accused whose trial rights were summarily stripped from them by the very courts sworn to uphold them.

Each day that passes while our courts remain closed or operating at greatly reduced capacity creates a devastating domino effect on all currently scheduled matters. Add to this a possible flood of delay applications as litigants argue their right to a timely and fair trial has been violated. One of the greatest court systems in the world is in its worst moment of crisis as numerous criminal matters dangle on the precipice of oblivion. Now is the time for bold action as well as increased innovation and transparency or we risk reaching the point of no return.

People have opinions. And you, reader, may be one of those people going: “whoa, whoa, whoa, what about …”

That’s a natural impulse. But when it comes to racism and protests, it’s awful easy to get sucked down a rabbit hole of other people’s misleading or misguided arguments.

Two circulate so frequently that they’re worth addressing.

First: George Floyd.

He wasn’t perfect. The degree of his imperfections are a matter of some disagreement, even if sensible people agree that he didn’t deserve to die for them.

The second part of that sentence is what’s key here. George Floyd’s death provided the ignition that began the current focus on racism in society. But whatever one wants to think about that life, it doesn’t affect the core facts underlying the current re-examination of society.

Simply: in many, many places, the colour of one’s skin affects one’s likelihood of dying at the hands of police; and one’s chances of professional and life success.

That’s what this is about, but those who aren’t subject to racism can tend to forget it under a deluge of news and information.

Imagine you have two identical 13-year-olds (or two six-year-olds or two 20-year-olds or two 30-year-olds) with the same family background, education, and everything else down the line. Countless studies show that if one is Black (or, in Canada, Indigenous), something bad is far more likely to happen to the one who is not white.

That all leads to things like the wife of a Black wine shop owner fearing her husband will be killed by police in his own store if he is present when officers go to check on a security alarm that went off.

It leads to things like First Nations men and women in Canada feeling unwelcome in, and being driven out of, key societal institutions by racism. It leads to them distrusting – often with good reason – our country’s institutions.

Many of us know someone with a sketchy past who turned their life around. But white people are more likely to be given the opportunity to do so than those who aren’t. This is what “systemic racism” is. It doesn’t mean everybody is racist. It means that our society is riddled with things, big and small, that collectively end up penalizing people for having a different skin tone.

Sometimes systemic racism results in someone dying who wouldn’t if they were white. Often it leaves a person without the same access to the opportunities afforded to white colleagues. Even if one were to put aside Floyd’s unjust end – and one cannot ignore it – we still need to deal with everything else faced by those who look different.

One other thing:

Some people take issue with the Black Lives Matter rallying cry. The standard is that “all lives matter.” It’s a response that is, to put it kindly, problematic. But it’s not always made with bad intentions. Often, it’s one borne of a lack of information, or a misreading of what the statement Black Lives Matter really means.

RELATED: Black Lives Matter posters ripped down and defaced in Abbotsford

“Black Lives Matter” doesn’t mean only Black lives matter. It doesn’t mean they matter more than the lives of other people. It just means they should matter. Period. You probably agree with this.

Demonstrators are stating, simply, all lives should matter, regardless of race, but that they don’t. That’s the core message of Black Lives Matter. It’s just Black Lives Also Matter doesn’t have quite the same potential as a rallying cry.

The premise of Black Lives Matter is that while society values white lives, it values those of Black people to a much lesser degree. All the data underscore this fact. In Canada, we also know this applies to Indigenous people.

Ottawa has repeatedly promised, but failed, to address severe water problems on First Nations reserves. Our federal government has been found by the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal to have continuously underfunded the on-reserve child welfare system.

And Ottawa has continuously fought against having to repay that money to Indigenous kids. The list goes on.

Demonstrators want all kids to have the same chance at success, all teens to be confident they aren’t being judged based on their skin colour, and all adults to not have to think about their race when they head for a job interview.

The core message of demonstrators is that all our lives should matter equally, and that our neighbours and friends shouldn’t face discrimination that we know exists. It shouldn’t be controversial.

Chilliwack born-and-raised trumpeter and vocalist, Bonnie Northgraves, will be performing at Bozzini’s Upstairs Lounge on Thursday, June 25. (Submitted)

After months of silence at Bozzini’s Upstairs Lounge, music is once again ringing out from the intimate Chilliwack concert space.

On June 4, Tsean Miller brought the Church of Rock to the stage. It was the first concert in almost three months to take place there after venues around Chilliwack and the world shut down due to COVID-19.

Now artistic director Emmanuel Asprakis is bringing in the next artist – Chilliwack born-and-raised trumpeter and vocalist Bonnie Northgraves on June 25.

With the Vancouver Jazz Festival being cancelled this year Asprakis took that as the inspiration for a jazz show being one the first events happening at Bozzini’s now that COVID-19 restrictions have eased.

“I was supposed to be playing at the Jazz Fest this year and singing the anthem on Canada Day, so it’s really lovely to have been invited to Bozzini’s to play,” said Northgraves, who now lives in Vancouver. “[I’m] so looking forward to performing in my home town.”

Northgraves performs her own original music as well as being a key member in Company B Jazz Band, Jeff Gladstone and the Bad Ideas, T Lizzy, and many others. She is a performer, recording artist, teacher, and clinician. She is passionate about music and hopes to spread her love of jazz through performance and education.

Her singing is smokey and rich, and her trumpet playing is a call to the early jazz styles of New Orleans. In 2019 Bonnie Released her debut album Between Then And Now.

Bozzini’s Upstairs Lounge typically seats 32 people, but due to physical distancing measures, only 16 seats will be available.

Bonnie Northgraves performs Thursday, June 25 at 8 p.m. (doors at 6:30 p.m.) at Bozzini’s Upstairs Lounge. Tickets are $20. To reserve call 604-792-0744.

The music video for Isaiah Faber’s (Powfu) “death bed (coffee for your head)” was filmed mostly at Abbotsford Mill Lake Park. The song has over 440 million views on Spotify and the video has over 90 million views on Youtube. Screenshot from Youtube music video.

A two-month-old song from a Mission artist has become the biggest music hit to come out of the Fraser Valley in recent history.

Isaiah Faber, known as Powfu, released “death bed (coffee for your head) ft. beabadoobee” in April 2020, and the song been heard by over 440 million people on Spotify.

The music video, much of it filmed at Abbotsford’s Mill Lake Park, has reached over 90 million views on Youtube. Faber’s other music videos are also filmed at various Abbotsford locations.

In order to become the Fraser Valley’s biggest hit of all time, it would have to surpass the Carly Rae Jepsen’s smash 2013 hit “Call Me Maybe,” which has over 1.2 billion views on Youtube.

It seems music runs in the family as Faber’s father, David, is the lead singer of the Canadian punk band Faber Drive. Faber Drive, also hailing from Mission, was nominated for a Juno Award in 2008.

Surrey’s White Hart Public House is among the first bars in Metro Vancouver to feature live entertainment in the post-COVID world.

The Newton-area pub welcomed back live bands a couple of weeks ago, starting with “house band” The Wingnuts on June 5.

“I think we’re one of the first bars to have live music again, definitely, because we wanted to get ahead of that curve,” said pub operator George Hart. “We knew we could do it safely, so we figured why not, let’s get it going again.”

For now, measures to stop the virus from spreading include clear plastic sheets hung between tables and encouraging physical distancing, among other rules.

“The hardest part is reminding people that they can’t dance, which isn’t easy,” Hart said with a laugh.

At a news conference Monday (June 15), provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry was asked about dancing in nightclubs and bars.

“It is going to be challenging because we know there are some things like dance floors that are not going to happen right now, as well as we know that singing, singing in a group, can be a very dangerous thing for this virus,” Henry said.

“We’ve seen that in a number of places around the world, including recent examples in the States south of us where singing groups in churches, even with physical distancing, have led to transmission of cases, and singing in other situations as well. So those are all things we need to work through, and I know Worksafe is working with the industry to come up with some reasonable guidance for that.”

Restaurants and pubs across the province were allowed to reopen to dine-in guests more than three weeks ago, as part of Phase Two in B.C.’s Restart Plan. Last Thursday (June 11), Henry removed the 50 per cent capacity restriction, allowing restaurant and pub operators to determine their capacity so long as guests are able to physically distance by at least two metres.

On Friday night (June 12) at the White Hart, the band Spank The Plank played a mix of classic rock songs for a few dozen people who paid $10 admission online, through Eric McCauley’s Good Time Bookings page on eventbrite.ca.

“It’s a family-run business, and we want to make sure everyone is safe and follow the proper restrictions put in place by Worksafe,” said McCauley, who books bands at the White Hart.

“We’re sold out tonight, pretty much, and we’re keeping it to around 42 people,” Hart added. “We’re doing advance ticket sales, and one of the shows sold out in an hour, the Tragically Hip tribute, Roadside Attraction (on June 27). Other bands have sold out in a couple of days, and some are selling out at the door. People can line up, six feet apart obviously, and if we have room then they can come in.”

• RELATED STORY: B.C.’s new COVID-19 cases remain low, no deaths since Friday.

Other bands on the calendar this month include Robert Graves Band (June 19), March Hare (June 20), The Rattlers (June 24) and Rob Montgomery/Nadine States (June 30), plus karaoke Tuesdays.

Hart and his family took over operations of the former Hook and Ladder pub site last year.

“We changed the name to White Hart after our soccer team’s stadium, which is White Hart Lane,” said Hart. “It’s an ode to Tottenham (the soccer club in London). My family is from there, I have the tatttoo, we’re diehard fans. In September of 2019 we came up here from Bear Creek (Pub), just a better location, bigger. We renovated it, painted it with Tottenham colours, everything, got the sign up and yeah, we’re ready.”

Spank the Plank drummer Wes Lawrie said it’s fun for the band to again perform “for people who appreciate it.”

Prior to Friday night at the White Hart, his last gig was set for March 16 at a venue in Whistler.

“We were just ready to leave my place, everything loaded, and we got the call to not bother, it was closed, everything was shut down,” Lawrie recalled.

“As a musician this has been very tough, and just very different,” he added. “But it looks like we’re getting going again, and we’re hearing about other gigs happening at some places, so I’m sure we’ll be playing again soon. This is definitely something I haven’t experienced before.”

Pawan Deol and Michael P. Vidler, who created the short film Unkept, won best short and best director at the 2019 Chilliwack Independent Film Festival (CIFF). The founder of CIFF, Taras Groves, is waiving entry fees for all Black, Asian and minority ethnic filmmakers for his festival. (Submitted)

The founder and director of an independent film festival has made it easier for Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) filmmakers to submit their work and have their voices heard.

Taras Groves of the Chilliwack Independent Film Festival (CIFF) announced this week that he is waiving submission costs for all BAME filmmakers.

CIFF is the first film festival in B.C. to do this, he added.

“Whilst we have been able to showcase numerous minority and Indigenous filmmakers over the years… we feel compelled to do more, especially given what is currently going on in the world today with Black lives and systemic racism,” Groves said.

“This is no different in the arts. And actions are louder than words.”

Submissions costs can quickly stack up for independent filmmakers making it very difficult for them to break through.

This is a “conscious attempt to form an enduring effort to provide a platform for more voices to be heard,” Groves said. He is encouraging other organizations and festivals to follow suit.

Film and the arts may seem small with everything that is going on in the world today but Groves said he still believes it’s an important means for sharing new voices and changing perspectives.

The festival, which began in 2017, normally takes place in November each year. A date for the 2020 CIFF has not yet been set, but it will be going ahead.

Faye Paris’s newly released book OX Daddy ox: Memories from the Heart shares the joys, sorrows, and tribulations of growing up from a child’s point of view.

“I was inspired to write a book honouring my dad and all dads for being there for their children. Even dads in the animal kingdom are amazing… gorilla dads groom, cuddle comfort and discipline their offspring – a lot like my dad.”

She calls it a children’s book for adults, and it is classified under memoirs and parenting.

The effect of this father-daughter relationship is unquestionably powerful and compelling, reads the description. An imperfect man tries to teach his daughter to be better than he is as a person. This is an outcome he expects his daughter to accomplish; this is an outcome his daughter feels she can never achieve. Over the years she views this man with imperfections differently. Still, she loves and respects him while driven by the impact of his values on her life.

Faye Paris’s newly released book ‘OX Daddy ox: Memories from the Heart.’ (Submitted)

Paris describes her favourite memory from the chapter called ‘A Sticky Situation.’

“It is about my dad trying to teach me how to paint my bedroom closet as a young child. While trying to paint a closet wall, I dripped paint on the newspaper protecting the floor. When I walked on the drips the newspaper stuck to my shoes. I lifted one foot then the other foot, but the newspaper would not come off. I was stuck and frustrated. My dad lifted me off the ground, pulled the newspaper off my shoes, and consoled me,” Paris said.

“In that moment, he was my hero. It is astounding how a small gesture can turn a dad into a superhero from a child’s perspective.”

One of the messages she wanted to send to dads and all parents is that children see the world differently depending on their developmental stage. Sometimes as parents we forget that children are not just little adults, she said.

Paris is a registered clinical counsellor who enjoys not only counselling but teaching, speaking, and providing trainings about the arts and mental health issues.

When she finished writing the book, she realized it was her own form of therapy.

“By the time I described the last memory of my dad in this book, I realized writing this book was a way for me to deal with my own grief at losing my dad.”

At only 50 pages long, it’s a fairly quick read with lots of illustrations, all of which represent children’s attempts at drawing as they grow-up.

Illustrations are by Shen-Mei Li and photos are by Larry Paris.

She is now in the process of writing a book about her mother, a relationship she calls “more complicated, but interesting.” She also has plans to write a book about maintaining one’s own mental health.

You can buy OX Daddy ox: Memories from the Heart on Amazon.ca for $24.99 (paperback), $31.99 (hardcover), or $4.99 (ebook).

Brian John Harwood of Kansas Stone and Dustin Bird have gathered their friends in the music industry to deliver a new single, “Together We’re Strong.”

The video for the track is in memory of Capt. Jennifer Casey and features clips from the Royal Canadian Air Forces’ Snowbirds and of Capt. Jennifer Casey herself, who was excited about spreading inspiration across Canada through her work on this project.

“We were devastated to learn of the tragic loss of Capt. Casey,’ Bird said. “As Canadians, we wanted to use the power of music to encourage and bring people together in a time of adversity.”

Proceeds from the track will be donated to the Unison Benevolent Fund, a Canadian music industry charity whose mission is to help professional music-makers in times of hardship, illness or economic difficulties.

The duo co-wrote the track, which features 18 Canadian country artists, including former Langley resident Aaron Pritchett, Cory Marks, Jason McCoy, Alee, and Jason Blaine – among many others including both Harwood and Bird.

“Staying positive together is the one thing that we have the power of doing. Unity is strength,” added Harwood.

As the live music and touring industry has come screeching to a halt, many artists are struggling to find ways to keep the music playing during the time of COVID-19.

Harwood and Bird said the project works to uplift everyone including other artists, fans and the worldwide country community, while raising funds for those struggling within the music industry.

Amanda Power, Unison’s executive director, added that now more than ever, members of our music community are depending on Unison’s COVID-19 Relief Program.

“Thanks to the generous efforts of the artists involved, every dollar raised from ‘Together We’re Strong’ will allow us to provide direct relief for music-makers and music professionals during this difficult time,” Power explained.

To donate, people can text UNISON to 45678 or visit unisonfund.ca, where donations will be matched by Spotify.

Since its release there have been almost 60,000 streams on Spotify and over 20,000 video views.

A Chilliwack artist’s property was aglow with lighted sculptures Saturday night as she held a public art exhibition outside her own home.

Not knowing when the next time her work would be installed inside a gallery, Sylvie Roussel-Janssens decided to create her own gallery. She opened her home and yard to friends and the public for a one-night show on June 6.

“I feel like sometimes you really have to take things in your own hands. Cultural institutions are very prudent. They may not be the ones who will think outside the (white) box first,” Roussel-Janssens said. “If and when they do, they will have been nudged by the daring ones: the artists.”

During the COVID-19 pandemic, she has been busy by working on new projects which were on display that night.

Large house-shaped structures of red, blue and yellow stood at the foot of her driveway as smaller pieces lit up the deck and the walls of the garage.

For a long time she has dreamt of travelling with her art, but due to the fact that her work is in three-dimensional sculpture form, it needs to be easily transportable.

Showing, moving, storing and selling sculpture is difficult, she admits.

Roussel-Janssens is constantly figuring out new designs so she can make her sculptures foldable, collapsable or stackable.

“Nothing makes me sadder than looking at boxes containing artworks that do not get a chance to live. For me, it is not enough to make a piece. I want it to have a life after the studio, to go in the world.”

A successful fundraiser benefitting widows and orphans of Kenya brought in more than $10,000 on the weekend.

The giant garage sale fundraiser hosted by Voice of Hope saw a steady stream of folks as they browsed through the thousands of items for sale set up in a Chilliwack barn on Saturday, June 27.

To help with physical distancing protocols, people could only go one way through the garage sale which was filled with kitchen items, linens, books and more.

A total of $10,100 was raise that day for widows and orphans of Kenya. More money is expected to come in from a handful of larger-valued items, like a hospital bed, that they are selling on social media.

Voice of Hope is run by a group of Chilliwack women. They have been working to improve the quality of life for Kenya’s impoverished widows and orphans since 2013. Normally, they would be planning a trip to visit Kakamega, Kenya, in October but with the restrictions due to COVID-19, they have put their trip off until the fall of 2021.

The women have been collecting donated items for the giant garage sale since January.

Saturday’s fundraiser was so successful, they will be having another giant garage sale on Saturday, July 18 from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. at 7350 Barrow Rd. There will also be hot dogs for sale.

Anyone who missed the June 27 garage sale fundraiser and would like to help with the cause can donate bottles and cans to the ongoing Voice of Hope bottle drive. Bottle and cans can be dropped off any time at 7350 Barrow Rd. Look for the “Bottles and cans drop off” sign on the south side of the grey building with red doors.

Additionally, if you would like to donate to the next garage sale fundraiser, you can drop off items at the above address on July 15 and July 16 from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.

The Corolla GR (the initials stand for Gazoo Racing, which is the automaker’s home-grown performance division) is expected to arrive in 2022. The turbocharged 1.6-liter three-cylinder engine and probable six-speed manual transmission come from the rally-inspired subcompact GR Yaris (not for North America), rated at 257 horsepower and 266 pound-feet of torque. The numbers are likely to carry over to the Corolla GR. Also, the Yaris GR’s all-wheel-drive system isn’t expected to transition into the Corolla. A starting price in the low-$30,000 range is expected.

With apologies to the Beatles tune, Blackbird, The Sleuth notes that General Motors’ Cadillac division will use the Blackwing designation for the brand’s top-performing “V” sedans that are due to arrive in late 2020, namely the upcoming CT4-V Blackwing and CT5-V Blackwing. The CT4 version gets a turbo V-6 with an output of about 400 horsepower, while the CT5’s supercharged V-8 could reach 640 horses. There’s no word regarding Blackwing models for any of Cadillac’s utility vehicles, but given that the brand’s key luxury competitors offer higher-output variants of similar vehicles, it’s possible that Blackwing versions for the full range of XT wagons as well as the big Escalade might already be in the planning stages.

Is BMW adding to its X lineup?

That’s what The Sleuth hears is in the works, to be labeled the X8. That makes eight such utility/tall-wagon models, beginning with the X1. The X8 is being designed as a “coupe,” which is essentially a four-door tall-bodied hatchback similar in silhouette to the X4 and X6 models. It’s expected that the new flagship X8 will offer the same turbocharged inline-six-cylinder and V-8 engines as the 8 Series coupe, with output ranging from 335 to 617 horsepower, the latter assigned to a sporty X8 M, which is also expected. A plug-in hybrid model is also likely. At this point, information is sketchy concerning an expected arrival date, but sometime in 2022 seems probable. As for pricing, count on well north of $100,000 in Canada

Mazda’s plans for the Mazda6 revealed:

The Sleuth is hearing that the automaker’s midsize sedan will receive nothing short of a complete makeover for the 2023 model year. The highly touted (by most automotive writers, at least) four-door has been a sluggish seller in a world that’s still in love with utility vehicles. The next Mazda6 will employ a new rear-wheel-drive architecture, replacing the current front-wheel-drive platform. All-wheel-drive will also be available. The new 6’s styling will be inspired by the 2017 Mazda Vision Coupe concept. For thrust, expect an inline six-cylinder gasoline engine and a 48-volt electric-assist motor/generator capable of delivering extra torque when needed. There are rumours of 350 maximum horsepower with this layout, which would likely make the Mazda6 a stellar performer.

Lexus plans a new flagship luxury utility vehicle:

The Sleuth hears there’s a good chance that the sleek LF-1 Limitless concept vehicle that went on display in 2018 will emerge in production form for the 2022 model year wearing the LQ designation. It’s also expected to use the same turbocharged powerplants as the big LS and LS hybrid sedans that make 416 and 354 horsepower, respectively. The arrival of the five-passenger LQ might also mean the retirement of the truck-like eight-passenger LX utility vehicle, although that’s far from certain at this point.

Ups and downs

Up: Music for electric BMWs:

According to a story in the New York Times, film-score composer Hans Zimmer is creating a melodic sound for the BMW’s upcoming i4 electric sedan, which launches for the 2021 model year. By then, European and U.S. regulators will require all electric vehicles (normally silent) to emit noises/sounds to alert pedestrians to their presence. Zimmer has produced music for The Da Vinci Code, Inception, Top Gun (1986), Interstellar, Pirates of the Caribbean and others.

Why just have any sound for the electric BMW i4 when it’s stopped when Hans Zimmer can compose something special. Photo: BMW.

Up: Hybrid Mustang delayed:

Ford is reporting a gasoline-electric power system for the Mustang won’t happen until the start of the 2023 model year, when a next-generation model will roll out. Originally, the option was set to launch later this year for 2021. The Mustang hybrid is said to combine the current 5.0-litre gasoline V-8 with an electric motor at each front wheel.

The base engine makes 246 horsepower. Photo: Jaguar.

Virtually all automakers have figured out that the key to current and future business success is in utility vehicles of varying sizes and descriptions.

That lesson hasn’t been lost on Jaguar, which launched the E-Pace for the 2018 model year. It serves as a junior partner to the mid-size F-Pace wagon that arrived for 2017.

If you’re interested in new or used Jaguars, be sure to visit TodaysDrive.com to find your dream car today!

The E-Pace name sounds like it might refer to an electric vehicle, but it uses good-old-fashioned gasoline propulsion. Jaguar’s I-Pace tall hatchback wagon is Jaguar’s sole electric, at least until the 2021 XJ sedan arrives. The E-Pace rests on a front-wheel-drive platform derived from the Land Rover Evoque (Jaguar and Land Rover are owned by the same company). Like the F-Pace, however, the E-Pace has standard all-wheel-drive.

The F-Pace and E-Pace are unmistakable as kin, right down to their similar-looking front-end shapes that are clearly influenced by other Jaguar fleet members. The common thread also extends to the opposite end, where the fashionably sloping liftgate looks attractive enough, but results in reduced cargo space when compared to other more squared-off designs.

The cabin appears equally inviting, especially the cockpit-style driver’s pod that could have been lifted straight out of the F-Type sports car. The touch screen is nice and big and the large, round ventilation controls will no doubt assist the fumble-fingered.

The E-Pace is more than 30 centimetres shorter and nearly nine centimetres narrower than the F-Pace, and is more than 20 centimetres shorter between the front and rear wheels. But the real surprise is that the E-pace actually outweighs the bigger Jag by 34 kilograms, which goes to show that compactness doesn’t necessarily result in a corresponding reduction in heft.

Fortunately, the E-Pace is up to the task of quickly and efficiently hauling passengers and cargo, using a turbocharged 2.0-litre four-cylinder engine that’s rated at a respectable 246 horsepower and 269 pound-feet of torque. It’s standard in the P250 models.

For significantly more oomph, the E-Pace P300 R-Dynamic trims come with a turbo 2.0 that puts 296 horsepower and 295 pound-feet of torque.

A nine-speed automatic is the sole transmission choice.

The all-wheel-drive hardware depends on the engine, starting with a permanently engaged setup for the P250 models. The P300 R-Dynamic’s “Active Driveline” powers only the front wheels in normal driving conditions. When traction loss is detected, the system can direct nearly all of the available torque to the rear wheels and to a specific rear wheel, if necessary.

Active Driveline’s standard torque-vectoring system “uses the brakes to (balance) the distribution of engine torque between all four wheels during cornering.” According to the company, this reduces the vehicle’s natural tendency to travel in a straight line even when the steering wheel is turned (called understeer).

Common to all E-Pace models is a low-speed cruise-control system that regulates the vehicle’s speed between two km/h and 30 km/h. Interestingly, active-safety technology such as blind-spot warning and adaptive cruise control are not standard, although lane-keeping assist is.

E-Pace pricing starts at $51,700, including destination charges. For that pile of cash, you get a reasonable level of standard content, but to move closer to the luxury zone you’ll need to select the R-Dynamic or Checkered Flag versions for leather seat coverings, panoramic roof, navigation, head-up info display and 19-inch wheels (18s are standard).

The performance-laden P300 R-Dynamic adds about $5,700 to the base price, but you also get larger brakes, 20-inch wheels plus a bit more comfort content.

Whatever the choice, the E-pace is an enticing little cat, with the looks, luxury and power that fits with the Jaguar name and reputation. And it’s a utility vehicle.

What you should know: 2020 Jaguar E-Pace

Type: Four-door, all-wheel-drive compact utility vehicle

Engine (h.p.): 2.0-litre DOHC I-4, turbocharged (246/296)

Transmission: Nine-speed automatic

Market position: The E-Pace is one of a growing legion of smaller premium utility vehicles. many of which resemble their larger stable mates. In some cases, these models have replaced traditional sedans in their respective lineups.

Points: Nicely balanced design presses all the right “want-it-now” buttons.

• Both base and higher-output versions of the turbo-2.0 engine should prove more than acceptable in the power department. • Jaguar’s aversion to offering manual transmissions is typical of most luxury brands these days. • Surprisingly heavy when compared with similarly sized wagons.

Active safety: Blind-spot warning with cross-traffic alert (opt.); active cruise control (opt.); emergency braking (std.); lane-keeping assist (std.)

L/100 km (city/hwy) 11.0/8.4 (base 2.0); Base price (incl. destination) $51,700

1007,1007,1474,theprogress,https://www.theprogress.com/opinion/opinion-why-the-fuss-about-wearing-a-mask/,Opinion: Why the fuss about wearing a mask? – Chilliwack Progress,'Eric Welsh',2020-06-30,"Do the non-medical reasons for not wearing masks in a pandemic outweigh potential benefits?

When I was just a little kid, I liked wearing masks.

It was the 1980s, at the height of the ninja craze. I’d watch Enter the Ninja with my friends, then I’d grab my sword (stick) and throwing stars (made out of paper) and spend the rest of the day skulking in shadows and assassinating other ninjas (trees).

Those were good times, but eventually I had to leave the mask wearing behind. It’s cute when you’re eight years old. It’s disturbing when you’re 18.

But the COVID-19 pandemic has given me an opportunity to be an adult and wear a mask without having to plot a bank/liquor store robbery.

Just last week I donned my cloth face mask and followed my wife into a local grocery store. While she shopped, I darted from place to place, stalking her through the aisles. I hid behind the Doritos. No, wait! I ducked behind a stack of Diet Coke. She never saw me until it was too late and the bucket of ice cream was already in the buggy.

Stealthily!

So much fun, and I wonder why more people aren’t taking advantage of this once-in-a-lifetime chance.

READ MORE: Fraser East health region has become B.C.’s COVID-19 hotspot

READ MORE: Some movie theatres set to reopen this week following lengthy COVID-19 shutdown

Grabbing takeout from a burger and fries place last weekend I did a quick count of masks. There were 27 people in the joint and my wife and I were the only ones covering our faces. We wear masks because she has Multiple Sclerosis, which puts her in the ‘could die if you get COVID’ category. We try to reduce our potential exposure as much as possible while still living life, but we are very much in the minority everywhere we go.

Why is that? Individually, we’re all being asked to do just two things during the pandemic.

Wear a mask and don’t get all up in anybody else’s space.

Both should be easy enough. I get that some people may not be able to wear a mask for medical reasons related to breathing, but for the rest of us is there really a good reason not to?

Maybe it’s a comfort thing, and I can understand that because one does get heated wearing a mask. But it shouldn’t be a deal breaker to wear one for a half hour in a store if it’ll help keep those COVID numbers down so stores can stay open, should it?

Maybe it’s a vanity thing? While many people may be reluctant to cover up their faces, people cheer wildly when I conceal my ugly mug, so this isn’t something I can relate to. But is looking good a good enough reason to risk prolonging a pandemic? And if it’s more about being embarrassed or ‘looking silly,’ think about how much easier it would be if everyone wore a mask.

I tell my children, ‘Don’t care about what other people think of you,’ and I’ll walk the walk on that.

Maybe people think I look goofy in my space mask, with all its stars and planets and stuff, but I don’t care.

It doesn’t hurt me in any way and even if it doesn’t make a difference in the spread of COVID-19, it might make one of my fellow humans feel a little safer standing close to me in public.

So I’m an unapologetic space ninja doing my thing.

If it’s a ‘nobody’s going to tell me what to do and you people are all sheep’ type of thing, I don’t know what to say.

If you hate the government, okay. If you distrust science, whatever. But even if wearing a mask is in fact completely useless, it shows that you are a compassionate person who cares about the people around you, and you are willing to do your part to help protect them.

And if you can have a little fun with it in the process, what’s the harm?

The Easter service was closed to the congregation and to the public to attend in person at they church but was live streamed to the internet. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jonathan Hayward

By Levi Minderhoud

Imagine that, over the past couple of months, you have devoured most of the food in your kitchen. You, your spouse, and your children are growing hungry. You drive to the local grocery store. But when you walk up to the entrance, an attendant says, “sorry, COVID-19 restrictions require us to only allow 50 people into our store at a time. We are already at our legal 50-person capacity. Please sign your name to the bottom of this waiting list and we’ll call you next week when it is your turn to enter the grocery store.”

You return home hungry.

Of course, we all recognize this scenario as absurd – some things cannot wait for another day. While following rules and taking precautions are necessary during a pandemic, essential services must continue for the good of society.

This denial of basic necessities is not so different from what is happening to people of faith throughout British Columbia. Although grocery stores, hospitals, and many other sectors of the economy deemed “essential” are not subject to a cap of 50 persons on their premises, this restriction continues to apply to worship services. But worship services are an essential service to hundreds of thousands of Christians, Jews, Sikhs, Muslims, and other faith groups across the province.

In the Bible, Jesus says that, “Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.” Christians require more than food, medical treatment, or employment income to thrive. Christians thrive by hearing the Word of God and by gathering together with fellow believers.

• READ MORE: B.C. faith leaders, Horgan discuss need for virtual religious ceremonies

• READ MORE: COVID-19: B.C. church services resume with public health limits

The Apostle Paul also describes how members of the church are like parts of the body. The human body cannot thrive if major parts of it are missing. Similarly, a church cannot thrive if a majority of its members are missing. Weekly, in-person worship services are a vital opportunity to hear this life-giving Word of God and participate in the sacraments.

The case for the essential nature of worship services was recently made in an open letter sent to Premier Horgan, Health Minister Dix, and Provincial Health Officer Henry. This request to Expand BC Worship Services was signed by 143 churches in British Columbia in early June. That letter, to date, remains unanswered.

Some people, perhaps including our leaders in British Columbia, may doubt that corporate worship services are essential, but this mentality betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of the Christian religion. Just as medical treatment is to the injured, food is to the hungry, and work is to the unemployment, so the participation in collective worship services – hearing the preaching of God’s word, receiving the promise of baptism, participating in holy communion, praising God collectively in song and prayer, and fellowshipping with other believers – is to the spiritually deprived Christian.

Although Christians can derive some benefit from online worship services or in small groups, such worship services are akin to feeding someone a bread-only diet for months. It will sustain a person for a while, but it will eventually result in serious health complications. Similarly, Christians are starving for the nourishment that comes from full worship services.

I recognize that, given the reality of COVID-19, mass gatherings remain limited in general. But worship services are not just typical gatherings. Nor are they hobbies akin to yoga. Although worship services are considered similar to concerts, sporting events, and festivals in the explicit order against mass gatherings, worship services are categorically different than these activities in that they are – or are supposed to be –constitutionally protected, and doubly so.

The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees the freedom of peaceful assembly and freedom of religion, both of which are seriously infringed upon by the limit of 50 people for worship services. According to these freedoms, British Columbians have a double constitutional right to attend religious worship services. They do not have a similar constitutional right to camp overnight, attend a movie theatre, dine at a restaurant, or stay in a hotel. Yet, Phase 3 of British Columbia’s Opening Plan removes restrictions on these activities, while maintaining the cap of 50 people at a worship service, even when some churches can seat thousands.

In light of the essential and Charter-protected nature of worship services, the leaders of British Columbia’s pandemic response should immediately change the Order of the Provincial Health Officer on Mass Gatherings to specifically allow for larger worship services. Raising the limit of people to 100 or allowing a certain percentage (e.g. 50%) of a church’s capacity to gather for worship would be a good first step, and in line with what other provinces are successfully doing.

As much of society re-opens around us, the provincial government must trust churches to operate safely and cautiously. It’s time for people of faith to declare that our spiritual food, distributed in weekly worship services, must not be rationed. It’s time for the provincial government to respect the freedom of the hundreds of thousands of people of faith in our province. It’s time to expand worship services in British Columbia.

As I plan the July memorial service for my father, I am continually frustrated by a set of illogical and constantly changing rules. I can’t have more than five, or is it 10, or is it 50 people present? And, they have to be able to stand at least six feet apart. I should probably sanitize everything in sight.

As the guest(s) arrive, I need signage that leads to the hand-sanitizing stations. We will not sit. And once the ceremony is done, everyone must leave the area. No consoling hugs and keep those tears inside the non-medical masks.

• READ MORE: Chilliwack Progress Letters

If we were only a professional sports team, or if we could call this event some kind of protest or like some, we could just ignore all those rules. And, by the way, none of the recent outbreaks have been linked to any of the unsanctioned rallies we all watched on the news. If only life was normal.

If we went about our normal, free-citizen business, we would be like Justin Trudeau and all those other “do as I say and not as I do” people. And my family would say goodbye to my dad in a private, dignified, and loving way that causes no harm to anyone.

I didn’t have any choice to be born white or brown and neither did you.

United States President Donald Trump didn’t choose not to be born Black or anything else. The people of our countries are diverse in colour.

People who are rioting are not addressing the underlying problem, and governments on most levels have not addressed or dealt with it correctly.

People are hurting and dying because they want to be heard and start change in society. This is no excuse for violence. Burning cities, looting someone’s livelihood and destroying the economy for any reason does not “right the problem.” It is hoped peaceful protests will.

I didn’t choose this country as “my home and native land” but I’m so thankful I was born a Canadian – a second generation person growing up in Chilliwack. I have not had to live under oppression like some of our neighbours have experienced. It must be difficult, but rioting is not the answer.

Stay safe and be kind.

I (as many people do) wholeheartedly support movements towards these much-needed changes. From my lens, it seems as though the world is taking notice of other voices that have been aching to be heard for so long, through the forms of documentaries, books, and listening to people’s diverse experiences. My hope is that this leads to greater understanding, as this is an essential step towards building a future that is more equitable for all.

However, it seems that so many people believe that to be for one thing you have to be against another, and that is just not how things need to work all of the time.

In my household, we’ve been feeling a lot of digital daggers of hatred from the general public lately.

Let me explain.

My husband is a police officer. I’m sure that you have noticed an awful lot of negative social media and news attention around police. It is way easier to find negative stories about police officers than positive ones. This generally seems to be the case, but it is especially true right now.

• READ MORE: B.C. to review Police Act amid growing calls to defund police

• READ MORE: When protesters cry ‘defund the police,’ what does it mean?

Police agencies hire their members from the same human population as every other organization, so of course not all police officers are going to be wonderful human beings. Some of the actions of police officers shown in the media are disgraceful, to say the least. Obviously, former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin falls into that category.

Police officers who conduct themselves in this way by no means make up the majority of the police officers in the world.

On the contrary, they make up a tiny fraction of the general policing population. Negative policing stories are simply reported on with much higher frequency than accounts of police assisting people out of a dangerous situation, lending a helping hand to someone in need, or showing compassion.

Let me put it to you this way. Out of all the articles you’ve ever read about elementary school teachers, how many of those articles were about child abusers or sex predators? How many of those articles focused on teachers who went above and beyond to help prepare their students for an upcoming exam? You’ve probably read more articles about teachers who turned out to be predators than teachers who gave their all to help a student succeed. Does that mean that most teachers are sex offenders? Absolutely not. That is my point. What generally gets reported on are the tantalizing stories, not the mundane everyday stories that are not newsworthy. The exact same principal applies to the depiction of police in the news and on social media.

I wish people could understand what the day-to-day of policing is really like. On a daily basis, police officers respond to calls from the public where they are asked to bring justice and peace to pretty awful situations.

While doing this, they are shouted at, spat on, and worse. My husband has personally been called to deal with some incredibly reprehensible situations this year and has helped to arrest people who have committed some of the most horrific crimes imaginable. Because of this, he has been in some extremely dangerous situations. He loses peace over it, he loses sleep over it, he has nightmares, and then he repeatedly experiences hatred towards him because he wears the police badge. Nonetheless, he gets up in the morning, puts his uniform on, and goes back out to do his job to help make our communities safer. This can be very hard to watch as a spouse.

My husband is a genuinely kind and compassionate person. He has taught me more about understanding and empathy towards people from all walks of life than anyone else I’ve ever met. But to be honest, I know dozens of police officers who, just like my husband, also have a heart of gold and the actions to back up their intentions. It breaks my heart to see all of the police officers being painted with the same ugly brush based on the conduct of a select few whose actions have become highly publicized.

I suppose this letter to the editor is just a public service announcement from a police wife, who is hurting alongside the rest of the world. It is honourable to be working for positive changes for the world, and I truly hope that you are.

Please remember that while doing so, you don’t need to be against the kind-hearted and dedicated police officers who are working towards the same positive end goals that you are working towards.

Our elders built this country and we reap the benefits of their hard work.

Yet not only are elders often overlooked, they face troubling levels of abuse from physical to financial to emotional.

And now, amid a global pandemic, seniors are bearing the brunt of the illness, made worse by further abuse. Outbreaks at retirement homes have been particularly devastating, and the consequences of public health advice to stay home and employ physical distancing mean many seniors are left more alone than ever.

Even worse, B.C.’s seniors advocate Isobel Mackenzie says the pandemic forcing many to remain isolated is increasing their likelihood of experience elder abuse.

• READ MORE: All your local, regional and national COVID-19 coverage in one place

“Recognizing the signs of elder abuse and knowing who to report it to is key.”

The provincial government recently announced $1.89 million in grants, $550,000 of which is going to Seniors First BC to try to help with the problem of elder abuse.

“We are using this funding to educate and protect seniors from malicious COVID-19 related frauds and scams that try to trick seniors into giving out their personal information online or over the phone,” executive director Rick Gambrel said. “We also run a seniors abuse and information line… a victim services program and referrals to an in-house lawyer.”

Elder abuse, including neglect, is defined as a single or repeated act, or a lack of appropriate action, that causes harm or distress to an older person.

It can take place in a senior’s home, a care facility or in the community, and often involves a person in a position of trust or a situation of dependency. The abuse can be physical, emotional, verbal, financial, sexual, spiritual or neglectful.

According to statistics from Seniors First BC, approximately eight per cent of seniors in B.C. experience some form of abuse, but this number may be even higher due to under-reporting. Pay attention to the elderly people in your lives and do your best to ensure elder abuse is not impacting them.

It’s the least we can do.

But throughout all of this is something even more insidious, I suggest, namely, an epistemological crisis in our world.

Epistemology is the area of philosophy that deals with the origin and the source and the nature of knowledge. What does it mean to “know” something? Where do you get your knowledge from? How do you know this or that?

These are questions that some of us are asking one another more and more every day as misinformation and, more insidious, disinformation, permeates the public discourse.

Have you ever noticed how the smartest people you know, either in person or through public networks such as the media, often express uncertainty, doubt, and even change their minds?

And have you ever noticed how the most ignorant people you know are steadfast and seem to know everything?

• RELATED: COLUMN: Fighting an ‘infodemic’ amid a pandemic

• RELATED: COLUMN: The call for full-scale economic reopening is an argument to cull the herd

The epistemological Catch-22 we find ourselves in is that the more chaotic our world becomes with pandemic fears, racial tension on the rise, and economic uncertainty underlying it all, the more people seek answers. But those answers are hard to find, and bad answers are worse than more questions.

Remember that episode of Seinfeld where the topic of abortion came up? The gag from the 1990s sit-com was that while the main characters constantly had different people they were dating, they were all quite superficial about the relationships so there was never anything serious discussed. But on the obviously controversial topic of abortion, and with Elaine dating a perfectly handsome man, Jerry asked her what her new beau’s thoughts might be on the subject? “I’m sure he’s pro-choice,” she awkwardly stuttered, soon to be proven wrong.

What does this have to do with anything these days? Well so many of us have social media relationships, in my case a pretty large network of local people on my Facebook account with whom I share Progress news stories, sometimes anecdotes about what I see around town, and many people interact with me. And while there are a great many controversial day-to-day subjects that come across my desk or my social media feed, the unintentional misinformation and blatant disinformation regarding this COVID-19 pandemic of late has been staggering, to the point where I have had to start “unfriending” people who share nonsensical memes and outright lies.

But I can’t keep up.

I’m used to kooks and conspiracy theorists and far right or far left trolls sending me messages or commenting persistently on matters they know nothing about.

But sometimes lately, with some otherwise rational and reasonable individuals with whom I’ve dealt with on news stories or community events, I feel like Elaine in Seinfeld not wanting to ask, but wondering: “You aren’t a conspiracy theorist, right? Oh no, you are!?”

With a desire for answers about why things are happening, in the face of terrifying doubt and uncertainty, far too many people are falling prey to the unintentional misinformation of the ignorant but worse, the intentional disinformation of the malevolent.

Public health officials and politicians are not getting this perfect, but they aren’t lying. The guy sharing memes mocking Trudeau is probably unintentionally spreading misinformation, and the gal sharing a link to something that you’ve seen over and over that contradicts what public health officials are saying is also probably unintentionally spreading lies.

As an optimist I think, sure, maybe we can’t get the malevolent social media users to change their ways, but I think if we all put our mind to it, we can help shift the narrative of the ignorant toward the truth or at least the pursuit of it.

The truth matters, right?

1014,1014,1481,theprogress,https://www.theprogress.com/opinion/letter-canada-needs-to-rethink-illegal-firearms/,LETTER: Canada needs to rethink illegal firearms – Chilliwack Progress,'Jun.',2020-06-18,"As the Chilliwack Progress reported, MP Mark Strahl had some harsh words to say about the announcement by the prime minister and his officials banning the sale of military-type arms to private individuals.

The action was at long last brought to the fore by the recent event in Nova Scotia, but this issue has been discussed by Canadians over many decades. And so, after much consultation prior to the last election and acutely in recent days, a federal government finally took action.

I couldn’t disagree with Strahl’s words more. There is nothing “cowardly” or “underhanded” about doing what a majority of Canadians have wanted for a long time, that is the elimination of firearms capable of mass murder. It comes as no surprise that a Conservative MP along with his party and now today the ignorant words of a Tory candidate for the Conservative leadership would accuse their own government of malfeasance.

Now, I completely understand that Mr. Strahl would want to curry favour with his base.

I am positive that there is seething anger in gun shops over this ban, but the inescapable truth is that legal gun owners and hunters, even those that go to our nice shooting range, do not think that assault-style weapons should be in civilian hands. As for the problem of guns coming into Canada from mainly the U.S., I agree that a lot more should be done to interdict these illegal weapons.

Some research into Mr. Strahl’s public statements shows no propensity on his or even his party’s part when in power, to budget enough funds for stricter border enforcement, nor does one find strong statements from Strahl advocating for more punitive jail terms for those who own illegal handguns or those who commit crimes with their use.

I wonder if this MP has been lobbying the provincial government to enact more severe punishments for illegal hand gun use?

Illegal hand guns can be obtained easily in Mr. Strahl’s riding.

They have been used here. They are regularly found mixed with drugs, money, knives and other dangerous items in homes right here in Chilliwack.

It is time for Mr. Strahl to begin at long last to advocate to the proper authorities, at least in this province, for a complete rethinking of the effects of illegal firearms. His rhetoric may save lives and help our society which is one of his jobs.

So, perhaps a little less indignation for political purposes and a lot more positive action would be a way forward for this MP.

One can continue to hope.

Remember we elect our official to work for us!

Re: “Chilliwack mayor’s anti-racism words amount to ‘grovelling and self-flagellation”, Chilliwack Progress Letters, June 11, 2020 (online).

• READ MORE: LETTER: Chilliwack mayor’s anti-racism words amount to ‘grovelling and self-flagellation’

Thank you for publicizing your views. They are indicative of the problems we face here locally, where poisonous ideals and white privileges have been fostered and fed so well that they might be so articulately regurgitated by people like yourself.

It has been a problem in this town since my grandfather collonial-strolled into it more than 120 years ago.

This underbelly of outdated viewpoints, flawed since inception, has grown unchallenged due to the socioeconomic climate contained within. It’s bad for business, bad for politics, bad for safety to challenge or criticize the local extremist ideology and so it’s seldom done. When progression is ventured, as it was ever so mildly by Mayor Ken Popove, it is met with a white backlash only comparable to deep southern states or South Africa.

• READ MORE: Mayor of Chilliwack says it’s time to have ‘uncomfortable conversations’ about racism

You use several terms that indicate you have researched support for ideals and feelings that you already held. It is a tragic commonality to all of the well-articulated letters.

Your argument is so ridiculously outdated and ill-informed that trying to educate you on any of your points would be akin to explaining calculus to a seven-year-old. They must be intended to elicit the support of other local racist extremists.

Your letter is an abhorrent encapsulation of why we need leaders like Mayor Popove to take the small incremental steps this enclave of racism and homophobia will allow.

I implore co-operation and togetherness but there is no starting point for commentary like this. These views will never make this area a better part of Canada for our indigenous, minority or LGBTQ citizens. Citizens who contribute to the community equally but receive no equal regard. These views will never allow for sociological growth or social justice or rich diversity. These views are dangerous. These views are wrong.

Thank you Mayor Popove. At first I felt you didn’t say enough, now I remember why you couldn’t say more.

This might sound harsh but it’s said out of love. Love for the beauty of this geographic location and genuine love for the people of my community. But it’s time to grow up now Chilliwack and take a stand against the continued fostering of these tragic ideals.

Kari Medig photo.

As British Columbians, we seek solace in the mountains, humbled and exhilarated by their magnitude. In eastern BC, dramatic landscapes – with their towering peaks, plunging falls, and charming towns – help us connect with nature on a grand scale. This summer, discover larger-than-life mountains and outdoor adventure in places like Fernie, Revelstoke, and Valemount. While the journey may take longer, the experience will leave you awestruck.

Explore Dramatic Mountain Landscapes

Once you’ve been, you know. Mountain ranges in this part of BC are on a different scale. Even the most seasoned adventurist is speechless at the sight of the Rocky Mountains. Mount Robson Provincial Park, home to the largest peak in the Canadian Rockies, is a must-see.

This area is home to seven UNESCO-designated parks, including Mount Assiniboine Provincial Park. Explore the mountain ranges with a lift-accessed alpine hike, or plan a stay in a backcountry lodge surrounded by ancient peaks.

Enjoy Outdoor Adventures

If you love the outdoors, you may have already paid a visit to the Kootenays or Valemount for the abundance of activities. But, once is never enough. From hiking to biking, paddling to golfing, there’s plenty to keep you entertained.

With four lift-accessed bike parks (including Golden’s Kicking Horse Mountain Resort) and 600-plus trails, the Kootenays are a mountain biker’s paradise. Whether your ascent is lift- or leg-powered, you can conquer some of BC’s best-known bike trails, maneuvring through tight singletrack and wheeling through alpine wildflowers.

Paddle the calm waterways or navigate raging rapids. Kootenay Lake, home to the world’s largest trout species, is prime for fishing. Tip: hire a guide for insider knowledge. Meanwhile, tee time is served with spectacular mountain views when you golf at one of the 25 championship courses in the Kootenays.

Experience Authentic Mountain Culture

A trip to BC’s mountain towns, as wild and vibrant as the nature surrounding them, is a rite of passage for every British Columbian. Tucked into valleys, on shores of rivers, and along old railway routes, communities like Fernie and Cranbrook are pulsing with energy and entrepreneurial spirit. Spoiler alert: the vibe is infectious, if you haven’t already been.

As you may have observed, a feverish pursuit of outdoor activities and great coffee are common traits, but each town has its own personality and charm. Swing by a java joint, like Nelson’s Oso Negro, to find friendly faces and a laid-back vibe. Absorb the ethos of each place by visiting Indigenous-owned businesses, exploring historic attractions, popping into boutiques, and meeting interesting characters.

In the mountains, a day of adventure almost always ends with an après. Sip craft beer on a sun-drenched patio, and live like the locals do – if only for a short while.

Want to get back the cabinets you love? Gleam Guard offers a quick, dust-free and cost-effective solution.

We love the idea of a kitchen that looks as good as it works, but thinking about the dust, disruption and cost of a full-on renovation? That’s another story.

The good news is that it IS possible to get back to the cabinets and millwork you love quickly, and at a fraction of the cost of a new kitchen.

And even better news: the only prep you’ll need to do is clearing off your countertops!

“Many homeowners love the cabinets and millwork in their home, but over time, the finish has become worn or dull. They don’t want – or need – all-new cabinets, so the refinishing solution is perfect,” says Tracy Booth, owner of Gleam Guard Cabinet Refinishing, serving Chilliwack and the Lower Mainland region.

The key is to choose a professional with the experience to create a beautiful, lasting finish, using techniques that won’t fill the air with aggravating dust particles, says Booth, who’s been professionally refinishing cabinets for more than 30 years.

Here’s why it works:

Choosing qualified refinishing professionals means you’ll get your kitchen back to the way you want it, without the cost of new cabinets – as little as $2,000 instead of $20,000 to $30,000, for example.

You don’t need to remove old cabinets or replace door and drawer fronts – in fact, you don’t even need to empty your cupboards and drawers! “Our average prep time for customers is 10 minutes,” Booth says. (And if you don’t have much to clear off your countertops, it’s even less!)

The dust-free process starts with your Gleam Guard professional prepping the surface with a vigorous clean, then matching and applying the new finish. A wood floor finish provides a long-wearing result, protecting your cabinets from hazards such as water damage, grease and dust.

There’s no lengthy planning, demolition and construction period. “Our trained cabinet refinishing professionals will have your cabinets looking great and ready to go within one to two days,” Booth says.

All interior millwork can be refinished, so think beyond the kitchen to your built-in bookshelves, doors, windowsills, furniture and more.

How do you practice ice skating without a rink?

The Sungod Skating Club took their spring training online, bringing community, exercise and expertise into their members’ homes in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Off-ice strength and conditioning, technical dry-land jump classes, dance classes, social events, and guest appearances from high-profile athletes within the sport have made this a spring to remember for Sungod Skating Club.

“It is a lot of work to put together this online project on top of everything else the club is doing these days, but to see the athletes so engaged and to provide additional support to them has made the efforts all the more worthwhile,” says Director of Programs Kevin Bursey. “We’re definitely making lemonade out of lemons these days.”

Before the pandemic hit, club skaters performed their biannual Ice Show to the largest audience the club has seen in over two decades.

“We were so lucky to have scheduled our production a week earlier than normal, so after three months’ hard work the club was still able to present their efforts to the community of Delta before everything shut down,” club president Harman Sidhu says.

In the months since, Sungod Skating Club has continued to make memories for their members by inviting Olympian Patrick Chan and two-time Canadian national champion Nam Nguyen to deliver online sessions and answer questions. Nguyen encouraged the skaters to continue with their off-ice pursuits and gave pointers on how he himself was handling these new challenges.

No ice… No problem!

The club has hosted online competitions for beginner and advanced members where young skaters perform skills, exercises and small routines on the floor in their own homes via video conferencing. A panel of judges assesses and scores their efforts, and innovative animation allows them to hold an awards ceremony where top performers see their virtual selves on top of the podium.

“I’m pretty sure we’re the first skating club to venture into this area of provision to our members. It’s an exciting concept that gives our skaters motivation towards staying involved,” Bursey says.

At the beginning of June parents and skaters took part in an interactive cooking session with performance nutrition dietician Kelsey Moore. Later in the month the entire club is competing in a three-day decathlon-style event dubbed “No Ice… No Problem” with fitness challenges for all ages. Wearing custom shirts made by a local North Delta business, members will bond and stay in shape so they’re ready to return to the ice.

Online Skating programs designed to focus on balance, agility, and coordination will help prepare skaters to step on the ice. The club plans to continue using these new modes of teaching even when arenas are operational again, to enhance on-ice coaching.

(photo courtesy Ric Wallace – WhiteRockBeach.ca)

White Rock’s promenade and pier may be open, but one popular waterfront element – the artists walk – is still missing.

And it’s not likely to reappear until plans can be worked out to allow it to operate safely under COVID-19 restrictions, according to city cultural development manager Elizabeth Keurvorst.

In a brief verbal presentation and written memo to council on June 15, Keurvorst was responding to a question to council from local artist/photographer Ric Wallace.

Wallace had asked whether the artists walk was to re-open, with physical distancing measures.

He noted that the White Rock Farmers Market is currently accepting non-food vendors; that council is taking measures – including providing picnic tables – to help support waterfront restaurants; and that even some buskers have returned to designated outdoor areas in the city.

But Keurvorst pointed out that resuming the artists walk – which in pre-pandemic times provided space on the grassy area just west of the museum to some 14 exhibiting artists – would create challenges under current provincial restrictions.

Ordinarily, individuals pay a $150 annual fee to participate in the artists walk, which enables each to set up, display and sell their artwork in a six square-metre space, and keep 100 per cent of the proceeds of sales.

“In looking at how we can restart, we look to the provincial health office, and there are two considerations that we would want to look at before re-opening the artists walk,” Keurvorst said.

“One would be physical distancing…as people walk the promenade they tend to veer onto the grass to allow for that six-foot distancing, that two-metre distancing,” she added.

READ ALSO: White Rock Farmers Market back with a difference May 3

“As well, the public health order has put out guidelines for farmers markets, when it comes to including artisans, but there is a market manager present to monitor that – we wouldn’t have that at the artists walk. We would need to look to the provincial health authorities’ cross-departmental team in order to look at reopening the artists walk, so there is a lot of work to do before we can open it again.”

Coun. Christopher Trevelyan asked whether there had been any consideration given to alternative locations for the artists walk.

“The short answer is no, but the same principles would apply; looking to the provincial health officer to help us with any guidance on both buskers and artists,” Keurvorst said.

Trevelyan sought, and received, assurances from Keurvorst and chief administrative officer Guillermo Ferrero, that staff is actively studying ways to bring back the artists walk.

“In concert with all the other services we’re doing, we’re looking at the Pop-Uptown Gallery, we’re looking at the artists walk, buskers and all the services we offer,” Keurvorst said.

In her memorandum, she noted that artists who exhibited in 2019, but could not this year, have been encouraged to participate in online marketing in association with the city’s Virtual Canada Day event on July 1, and also online art shows offered in partnership with Semiahmoo Arts.

“Re-thinking how the tents are set back and how walkers are able to walk between or behind to maintain physical distancing, where artwork is stored, and how far down the beach, we want to stretch, will be important for us to comply with the provincial health distancing requirements,” she wrote.

Section 90 of the Community Charter provides that a city council can hold a meeting that’s closed to the public if it concerns “personal” information about an “identifiable” individual, concerns labour or other employee relations, or the “acquisition, disposition or expropriation” of land if council thinks such disclosure could harm the city’s interests.

The Charter also allows city councils to do business inside a closed meeting if the information they are considering is prohibited from disclosure under the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act, or the matter involves “the consideration of information received and held in confidence” concerning negotiations between the city and higher levels of government.

READ ALSO: Surrey disbands homelessness society during closed meeting

This is quite cut-and-dried. It is therefore not to be used as a vehicle by council majorities, on matters not captured by the aforementioned provisions set out in the Community Charter, to sneak one by the electorate they purport to serve.

Moreover, it is certainly not to be used as an excuse for politicians to duck accountability, when asked why an item was dealt with in a closed meeting when the matter did not fall under any of these provisions.

City councillors revealed this week that council decided to disband the Surrey Housing and Homelessness Society’s board during a closed meeting last Thursday apparently because the mayor wanted to bring its governance “in-house.”

Mayor Doug McCallum would then not comment on the matter as it had been dealt with in a closed meeting.

Expedient for politicians, unfair for the public they were elected to serve.

This is not the stuff of transparency. Rather, it is opaque and anti-democratic.

A Go Fund Me campaign has been launched to help a family of seven who lost their home to this fire in Whalley on Tuesday, June 23, which Surrey firefighters tackled at 103rd Avenue and 143rd Street. (Contributed photo: Rick Chapman)

It is comforting to know that, in cases of personal tragedy and extreme adversity, not only family and friends but also complete strangers are more than willing to help you.

Three recent local tragedies come to mind.

On June 1, Jasvinder Singh Riar, age 31, died at work, at the Canadian National Railway’s Thornton Yard in North Surrey, leaving behind his wife, his nine-month-old son, and his mother, paternal grandmother and sister. That was one mighty responsibility he shouldered, being the sole provider for his family.

But at this time of writing, 866 donors have contributed $96,959 through a GoFundMe campaign online, toward helping his family.

This past Sunday, which happened to be Father’s Day, tragedy struck another local family when Surrey realtor Kashif Sheikh, 46, drowned while trying to save his daughter who had slipped into a creek near a waterfall in the Okanagan.

Sheikh leaves behind a wife and four children.

By Wednesday morning, 939 donors to a GoFundMe campaign had raised $95,230 to help Sheikh’s family.

Of course, no amount of money will ever replace these two men. But the money being raised in their memory will surely help take some of the burden off their survivors, who are undoubtedly suffering from the shock, confusion and grief that is particular to sudden and unexpected deaths.

Now, a third local fundraising initiative has been launched to help a Surrey family of seven whose home was destroyed in a fire on Tuesday in Whalley.

The fact that strangers, some of whom can ill afford it, will help others in times of need serves to remind us that ultimately none of us are really alone.

And we can all take some comfort in that.

Submitted photos taken from March 23 to May 1 in Surrey show dog owners allowing their dogs to roam and play – and even do their business on – using sports fields, despite signs clearly stating dogs are prohibited.

The Editor,

Dogs are prohibited on athletic fields everywhere to protect the health and welfare of the athletes who use the fields. Why do dog owners purposefully disregard the welfare of those athletes and others who use the fields for their intended purpose?

It’s shocking that during the COVID-19 crisis, when people are expected to raise their social consciousness and take actions to protect the health of other people, that dog owners carry on as usual, disregarding laws that don’t suit them.

Dog owners who use athletic fields for their own private off-leash dog park and dog toilet, are breaking municipal laws. I see more than 35 dogs a week on the South Surrey Athletic fields at 20th and 148 Street. Things are as bad or worse at Sunnyside Park. Thirty-five dogs equal 35 piles of defecated excrement on the fields and and urine everywhere.

I know people think it is convenient to use the local sports field, that driving to the dog park adds unnecessary carbon to global warming, and that their dog is perfect. But owning a dog carries responsibilities to the environment, to your city and to other people.

We don’t spread human waste on sports fields or send it to the landfill for obvious reasons. Dog turds are worse.

Obey the laws and leave the athletic fields to the athletes.

By Curt Taylor Griffiths

As a member of the Provincial Municipal Policing Transition Study Committee, which created the transition plan for the new City of Surrey Police Department, I feel compelled to respond to several assertions made by Peter German in the media, including in the June 11th issue of the Now-Leader.

German argues that the quality of policing will not improve with the transition from RCMP to a municipal police force. It will. The Surrey Police Department will deliver policing services within a community policing framework that is best practice and evidence based. It will be flexible and adaptable to the changing needs of one of Canada’s most dynamic communities. The delivery of policing services will be decentralized, focusing on the communities of South Surrey, Cloverdale, Newton, Fleetwood/Guildford, and City Centre/Whalley. Officers will assume ownership of the districts.

German states that the Surrey RCMP has 843 officers. This figure includes vacancies and officers on secondment to specialized units. The actual strength of the detachment is 792 and the number of deployable officers is fewer than that. The new SPD will have 805 officers, the majority of whom will be involved in front line service. Compared to the current deployment of RCMP officers in Surrey, there will be 16 per cent more uniformed SPD officers on the street.

Peter German: Costs of new police force will handcuff Surrey taxpayers for a generation

German raises the issue of increased salary costs associated with the new SPD. The collective agreement that will be negotiated between the RCMP union and the federal government is likely to include a provision that RCMP officers in B.C. have wage parity with their municipal counterparts. This would result in a 20 per cent wage increase for RCMP members. Notably, RCMP-policed municipalities will not be at the bargaining table, but will get the invoice. If wage parity is achieved, the costs of RCMP contract policing and municipal policing will be similar, even with the 10 per cent federal subsidy for RCMP.

German asserts that training the new members of the SPD will be a problem. It will not. The transition plan calls for 68 new recruits to be hired and trained over a two-year period at the Police Academy at the Justice Institute of B.C. The staff at the academy assured the transition committee that this number can be accommodated. The remaining hires will be officers who are currently in service. Although there has not been a formal survey of in-service officers, anecdotal evidence suggests that the SPD will be successful in hiring currently serving officers from other police services, including the RCMP. The transition plan calls for a gradual change-over from RCMP to municipal, with SPD members replacing RCMP officers over a period of time.

German raises the issue of community safety, arguing that criminals will have a “field day” during the transition. Unlikely. The graduated transition plan will ensure the department is fully staffed at all times. Protocols have also been established for investigative file continuity during the transition.

In German’s view, municipal police services do not create a greater sense of identity. They do. In contrast to their RCMP counterparts, municipal police officers generally spend their entire careers in one community. This facilitates ownership and partnerships. The SPD will be able to recruit a workforce that reflects the diversity of the community, an impossibility in an RCMP detachment where personnel decisions are not made at the local level. The arrival and departure of officers and the Officer in Command of the detachment is determined by the organizational needs of the RCMP rather than by those of the municipality.

The men and women of the RCMP who have policed the city for the past 70 years have served admirably. However, Surrey has outgrown the RCMP model. It was the last municipality in Canada with over 350,000 residents without an independent police service. The City of Surrey had its own police service from 1887 to 1951. In many ways, it is returning to its roots.

Once again, we are confronted with the good, the bad, and the ugly.

First, the good. It’s heartening that, despite the risk and fear generated by this pandemic, volunteers such as those at Whalley’s City Centre Church have nevertheless stepped up to make more than 10,000 bag lunches for people in need of a break, at Surrey Urban Mission.

The selflessness of such sandwich slingers is, shall we say, soul-inspiring.

Second, there is the bad and the ugly. The following covers both categories.

Year-round, we are confronted with examples of loathsome behaviour.

People who steal money from poppy trays during Remembrance Day, people who run off with Salvation Army donation kettles at Christmas time, people who taint candies at Halloween. Behaviour both ugly, and bad.

It’s unconscionable that someone would break into a school at any time, let alone during a pandemic, to steal equipment that children need.

But 20 counts of breaking into schools?

That’s no one-off ‘mistake,’ hopefully to be remedied by an attack of conscience. Nor is it an act of down-and-out desperation, nor mischief.

It’s a career choice, and a bad one at that.

Bad, and ugly.

Thankfully, people who choose to do good instead help push that pendulum back in the right direction, which makes their work all the more profound.

Those who prey on others must live with themselves.

Surrey council’s avowed intention to create a municipal police force would end over 70 years of RCMP service to the community and terminate a 20-year contract signed in 2012.

Since 1935, the federal government has allowed its federal force to police municipalities, with over 150 contracts currently in place.

The reasons are obvious – a quality, cost effective police service. The RCMP did not ask to become Surrey’s municipal force. Residents overwhelmingly voted to replace the Surrey Municipal Police in a 1950 plebiscite.

So why does Surrey now wish to end its contract with the RCMP? The reasons given float between a safer city, greater accountability, and that Surrey is now a big city.

It is extremely unusual for a municipality to unilaterally end its contract with the RCMP, other than when communities amalgamate.

Once gone, never to return is the federal mantra, as it underwrites significant contract policing costs. Below are the real issues.

THE QUALITY OF POLICING WILL IMPROVE

Wrong! The quality of police officers on the street in the Lower Mainland is virtually the same whether they are municipal or RCMP. This is the result of common standards. At the end of the day, it boils down to having sufficient street resources and specialized units to deliver the level of policing required by a community. This is not the function of one force or another.

SURREY COUNCIL WILL GOVERN THE NEW FORCE

Wrong! Municipalities do not appoint police boards – the province does. The municipality has two seats on a police board. RCMP detachments typically report to a council appointed safety committee. Surrey recently changed this reporting structure, with the RCMP commander reporting only to the mayor.

A MUNICIPAL FORCE WILL BE COST-NEUTRAL

Wrong! Make no mistake, a municipal force will cost more than the RCMP. Nobody knows how much more, for one simple reason. The RCMP has not been engaged in the discussion.

Consider the following.

1. In 2018, the per capita cost of policing in Surrey was $284 compared to $458 in Vancouver – a 60 per difference.

2. Surrey detachment has 843 officers. Any force policing Surrey needs more resources. To suggest that the new force can perform its duties with the same number, or less officers is poppycock.

3. The RCMP patrol model is one person per car. Many municipal forces are contractually required to employ a percentage of two person cars.

4. RCMP members maintain most of the investigations they are assigned during a shift, rather than referring them to detective units.

5. The salary differential between the RCMP and municipal police is between 15 and 20 per cent.

6. A new force will offer a salary commensurate with the highest municipal police salary.

7. Ten per cent of Surrey’s policing costs are covered by the federal government.

8. Transition costs include tens of millions of dollars for clothing, vehicles, and infrastructure.

9. Surrey will be required to deal with all lawsuits, such as police car accidents.

10. The cost of recruiting 800 plus employees and training them is huge.

It is reasonable to project that Surrey will require a force of at least 1,200 police officers to cover off existing needs, and the new patrol model. Combine that with a 15 to 20 per cent increase in salaries, the loss of a 10 per cent subsidy, a huge capital investment, and transition costs, and the increased cost to Surrey taxpayers will be in the hundreds of millions of dollars.

RECRUITING A NEW FORCE WILL NOT BE A PROBLEM

Wrong! Where do you find 800, or 1,200 police officers? It is estimated that up to 150 municipal police officers from other Lower Mainland forces may bridge over to be closer to home or for promotions. RCMP pension portability remains an issue, despite Surrey bravely suggesting it is not. Nobody has even surveyed how many RCMP members are interested in joining, but the RCMP attrition rate is quite low. Where then will the bulk of the new force be recruited? Overseas? Other provinces? Will hiring requirements be reduced? And how will this provide a better level of policing?

TRAINING A NEW FORCE WILL NOT BE A PROBLEM

Wrong! The Police Academy at the Justice Institute of B.C. is woefully under resourced, with an aging and outdated infrastructure that struggles to keep up with the current attrition rate of municipal forces. It has no present ability to expand and provide the numbers of recruits required for Surrey or to backfill other departments. Despite a brave assertion that there is a plan, the need to train hundreds of police officers to an acceptable standard will be a huge cost to the Province and municipalities.

THE NEW FORCE WILL MAGICALLY REPLACE RCMP

Wrong! Any transition would rely heavily on a continued RCMP presence, meaning two police chiefs, multiple communication systems, different cultures, policies, and command structures. A one-year timeframe is pie in the sky. Recruiting, training, and new infrastructure will take much longer.

SURREY WILL BE SAFER

Wrong! Naysayers skate around the fact that Surrey’s violent crime severity index in 2018 was at a 10-year low. The local detachment has done everything asked of it by the City to deal with the illegal drug market, domestic abuse complaints, gang violence and routine calls for service. During a transition, organized crime may well have a field day. Transferring institutional knowledge, intelligence and sources is not an easy task for police.

MUNICIPAL FORCE CREATES BETTER SENSE OF IDENTITY

Wrong! The RCMP has responded to millions of calls for service over the past 70 years. Hundreds of RCMP officers make their homes in Surrey. They are volunteers – hockey, baseball, soccer, and football coaches. Many have been injured on the job and five made the ultimate sacrifice. It is our national police force, with which all Canadians identify.

The current, integrated nature of policing in the Lower Mainland has withstood the test of time, commissions of inquiry, and challenging cases. The citizens of Surrey should do what they want, but with their eyes wide open. Trading the yellow stripe of Canada’s national police for the blue stripe of a municipal force must not be a knee-jerk decision taken with blinders on. Taxpayers will endure the consequences for a generation.

In the first season of HBO’s True Detective, Matthew McConaughey’s character, Rust Cohle, tells detectives – who are working to solve a decades-old murder case – that “time is a flat circle.”

“Everything we’ve ever done or will do, we’re gonna do over and over and over again,” he says.

It’s arguably McConaughey’s most memorable line from the dark, police drama, and has been oft-repeated, meme’d on the internet time and again, perhaps more as a result of the actor’s self-assured delivery than because it provides any real wisdom.

Nevertheless, I’ve found logic in it lately, as we all begin to stumble out of the darkness that is COVID-19 quarantine and emerge from hibernation to re-enter the world, throwing open the shades triumphantly even if we’re still not quite sure what day it is.

Perhaps it’s because I have found myself with free time on my hands, but the days have somehow felt like they’re moving both fast and slow at once, in the same way that a microwaved convenience-store burrito can be cold but somehow still burn your tongue.

Maybe time is even going backwards. Who knows?

Someone mentioned to me earlier this week that, by the end of this month – it’s June now, for those scoring at home – we’ll be halfway through 2020, meaning we have just six months to go before we can turn a page on this hellish year.

It took me by surprise. We’re halfway through? How? It feels like only a few weeks ago that I was using up my remaining 2019 vacation days to go on a vacation with my wife. We went on a plane and everything.

But that was February.

Today is Thursday. What’s tomorrow? December?

Who knows.

The truth is, these last months have all melted together into one long Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day.

In the before times, I’d wake up just before 7 a.m., get ready for work and be out the door by quarter to eight, arriving at the office a few minutes early to ensure I could snag a much coveted parking spot.

But working from home, I rolled out of bed later and later each day, yet still made it with minutes to spare. When your office is 30 feet from your bedroom, time becomes irrelevant.

Once on the clock, my routine was upended, too. Pre-pandemic, I would never eat cereal at my desk at 2 p.m. or spend my coffee break debating which pair of pyjama pants was best for casual Friday. One day, I showered on my lunch break.

My days off would get a little murky, too, as my early-quarantine goals – which ranged from a pledge to exercise daily or to use my off-time to learn a new skill – were eventually replaced by video games and sitcom binging, for hours on end.

I once stayed up until 4:30 a.m. to watch a Korean League Baseball game. I don’t know why.

The clock has struck midnight on such slothfulness, however, and in the long run, maybe it’s for the best. I leave the house for work now. I have reason again to wear pants.

And at some point, I really am going to get into a daily exercise routine.

Maybe tomorrow. Or by October, at the latest. It’s just a few days away.

Many will agree with Surrey Councillor Doug Elford when he says, “Twitter is a sewer.”

Sadly, though, his Safe Surrey Coalition has been wallowing, luxuriating even, in its mire.

And, not only in this most recent instance, in which a so-called “unauthorized person,” who, at that moment at least, was in complete control of the keys when he or she accused the police of murder in posts on Twitter and Facebook.

The civic slate has been engaged in a sustained smear campaign against the RCMP through its social media posts, digging up whatever it can find to put the Mounties in a bad light. This particular example, while the most egregious, is not a one-off.

Not only was the post beneath contempt, but that it was posted under the banner of a civic slate, one with majority control of Surrey’s affairs, is beyond disturbing.

READ ALSO: Safe Surrey under fire for ‘sickening’ social media posts accusing RCMP of murder

For Mayor Doug McCallum, after all has been said and done, to claim he, “and certainly Safe Surrey Coalition, have tremendous respect for the RCMP,” brings to mind the words of Humpty Dumpty: “When I use a word, it means just what I choose it to mean – neither more nor less.”

Speaking of eggs, surely the cracks now running through the SSC’s shell, resulting from the shock waves produced by its own political social media grenade, cannot simply be repaired with an “oops,” and vows to not allow it to happen again. That’s not enough.

There needs to be a reckoning, if this civic slate is to exorcise itself, in the public eye at least, from whatever foul processes that hatched such an unfortunate social media post in the first place.

Booking my annual summer trip home to Newfoundland had never before involved navigating airline websites and COVID-19 updates through a waterfall of tears.

But this is 2020.

And for me and thousands of other Canadians living far away from their aged, ailing parents in the pandemic, an undercurrent of angst has become part of life.

Parenting through COVID-19 is not really easy for anyone. Having a second baby while your boyfriend is an essential worker is no easier. Read that here.

The thought of boarding a packed Dash 8 airplane with my two teenaged daughters spikes my anxiety. Some people say I shouldn’t do it. They say it’s too risky this year.

Still, I have to find a way to get to Newfoundland. I have to see Mom and Dad.

“Nobody is healthy at 92,” my father told me on the phone two days ago. “I feel weak all the time, and my appetite is affected.”

Dad used to be the dapper fellow tipping his felt fedora to everyone he passed on the sidewalks of Grand Falls-Windsor, a placid town planted in a vast valley of evergreens. He was Grand Knight of the Knights of Columbus, president of the local chapter of the Canadian Red Cross, and a campaign manager in provincial elections. In the early 1970s, he dined with Joey Smallwood at the Confederation Building in St. John’s.

My parents are still in the white two-storey house they bought in 1967. But Dad lives in darkness, robbed of his eyesight because of glaucoma. A painful prostate condition forces him to use a catheter. Taking a shower has become an exhausting ordeal. He has dropped 30 pounds since last year.

“That’s a lot of weight,” he says. “That’s my illness.”

""She never complains, never feels sorry for herself and never gives up.""

And then there’s my saintly, sweeter-than-an-angel, superlatively steady mother. She survived a heart attack in 1999, the drowning in St. John’s Harbour of a beloved son in 2011 and the deaths of her two sisters in 2017 and 2018. Because of Dad’s condition, she is a full-time caregiver at the age of 87.

Is she bitter? Not one bit.

“Just kind of be optimistic, that’s all,” she says. “And enjoy the moment.”

Every time I call home, Mom laughs and talks about happy things — like her impassioned decluttering, the spring leaves or last evening’s delicious roast. Unlike her writerly daughter, she doesn’t spend time exploring the gloomiest, grittiest recesses of her psyche. She never complains, never feels sorry for herself and never gives up.

But there are excruciating moments. Dad had to go to the hospital in an ambulance last year. A week ago, he fell to the kitchen floor.

“It’s very difficult,” Mom says. “But we’re married, and I’m the one to look after him. I wouldn’t want anyone else to look after him. Only me, as long as I can.”

My parents have three living children, eight grandchildren and one little great-grandson, but not one of us lives in Newfoundland. We are scattered across Canada — from a picturesque peninsula in Nova Scotia to the pea soup fog of the Bay of Fundy, from a red brick duplex in Toronto to a shiny skyscraper in downtown Calgary.

Yes, we sound like a Stompin’ Tom song.

""I had to trust Mom and Dad to take care of themselves. I had to make peace with my own powerlessness.""

After all my parents did to raise us and give us unlimited educational opportunity, they deserve to have at least one of their offspring nearby — especially during the pandemic.

Dad doesn’t see it that way.

“I don’t think you have to be together in this day and age,” he says. “I love the grandchildren. I keep in touch with them. That’s enough.”

Still, I practically have a PhD in guilt over the situation — and the pandemic multiplied the effect. Before COVID-19, I knew that if my parents needed me, I could be in Newfoundland within a few hours. There was comfort in that.

Suddenly, the Rock was closed. There was a gigantic, invisible, impenetrable wall separating me from Mom and Dad. Like everyone, I was stuck.

The “what ifs” plagued me in the early days of isolation. What if my parents get COVID-19? What if I can’t go to Newfoundland until 2021? What if Dad needs to move into a nursing home? What if my kids never see their grandparents again? What if the worst happens?

Determined to help my parents, I kept offering to order their groceries online. When they turned me down for the tenth time, I finally accepted they weren’t interested in my new-fangled foolishness.

Still, I implored Mom to stay out of stores. And like a stuffy schoolmarm, I reminded her to wash her hands.

""'I don’t expect them to just wither away in a couple of seconds.'""

“Muh dear, I’m washing my hands all the time,” she said, possibly slightly annoyed. “I got my hands rubbed raw from all the washing.”

So, I had to stop trying to parent my parents. I had to trust Mom and Dad to take care of themselves. I had to make peace with my own powerlessness.

It helps to have amazing relatives. On Easter Sunday, my cousin Regina showed up at my parents’ door to drop off a sumptuous Newfoundland supper of salt meat, cabbage and turkey. Leo, my father’s 80-year-old little brother, takes Dad out for snacks and a walk three times a week.

Regina and Uncle Leo are COVID heroes.

The Atlantic travel bubble started on July 3. Still, I haven’t figured out when, how or if my daughters will see their grandparents again. My car is probably too old for a 14-hour road trip. I booked flights, but I cancelled them when the airline changed my itinerary to include a plane change in Toronto.

As I search for a solution, my 13-year-old daughter, Rose, doesn’t doubt she will go to the Rock and visit Nan and Pop Power.

Loss is a very real and difficult thing to navigate for kids and parents. Here's how one mother keeps the memory of lost grandparents alive.

“I know I will see them again because I’m optimistic,” she told me. “I don’t expect them to just wither away in a couple of seconds.”

So, I dream of a warm afternoon in August. And in this dream, I’m packing a picnic basket and driving my beautifully optimistic mother and equally optimistic daughters to Gorge Park in Grand Falls-Windsor.

The government had been under pressure to make the subsidy more accessible, specifically by loosening the requirement of a 30 per cent drop in revenues, so more companies under that cut-off can qualify.

Speaking in Toronto, Morneau says the rules will be changed so amounts paid out will be proportional to revenue declines due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The program is the heart of the Liberals' promise to help Canadians get back to work, even if has to be at a slower pace, as the pandemic wanes.

Morneau's fiscal update last week boosted the budget for the program to $82.3 billion from $45 billion in a sign of impending changes and an extension beyond this summer.

Morneau says the program will now end Dec. 19.

He's hoping the extension will give companies confidence to rehire workers, knowing what the rules are and that the program will be around for longer.

The most recent federal figures for the program show the government has given almost $20.4 billion in payroll help to about 262,200 companies.

The government's proposed changes to the wage subsidy are part of a bill that will be debated next week when the House of Commons sits, including a one-time disability payment and extensions to some court deadlines that were both in a bill that failed to pass the Commons in June.

Speaking in Ottawa on Friday afternoon, Employment Minister Carla Qualtrough said the bill will widen the number of recipients from those receiving a disability tax credit to include those receiving Canada Pension Plan disability payments or supports from Veterans Affairs Canada.

Each would receive a $600 one-time, tax-free payment, she said.

The legislation proposes offering the payment to anyone who applies for the disability tax credit within 60 days of Parliament approving the bill.

""This financial support matters. Canadians with disabilities can have confidence that we will bring this project past the finish line,"" said Qualtrough, who has responsibility for disability issues.

As casinos across the country open, the gaming floor looks decidedly different. For the most part, table games are closed and there are fewer slot machines to choose. Reminders about physical distancing are scattered about on floors, walls, doors and around elevators.

Many amenities are closed. Forget valet service, buffets, live shows, spas and nightclubs. Casinos are built for escapism, but there is no escaping COVID-19.

Casinos are applying the same kind of cleaning discipline once reserved for washrooms to their entire site, using long-lasting antimicrobial sprays to disinfect surfaces, wiping down slot machines between each use, and providing disinfectant wipes and sanitizer throughout the gaming floor.

Many casinos are no longer open 24 hours, instead closing down for a few hours each morning to clean.

Plastic barriers are common at slots, gaming tables and food and beverage counters, and a number of casinos are employing technology to minimize the need for lines, including live count capacity monitors and apps that tell casino visitors when it’s their time to enter.

Those who enjoy casinos want to get back to the machines and tables after three or four months of dark gaming floors, says Paul Burns, CEO of the Canadian Gaming Association. But they understand the experience is going to be different, just like every other facet of public life.

“Where we’ve had reopenings, demand has been good. Customers do want to come back but they also want to know it’s safe. We have to get this right for customers.”

Alberta was the first province to reopen its casinos. It isn’t requiring masks, though strongly recommends them, and also hasn’t set capacity restrictions beyond requiring a two-metre distance.

Casinos in all the Atlantic provinces are allowed to reopen (except Newfoundland and Labrador, where they have been illegal for many years.) But some operators in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick have yet to reopen.

Saskatchewan reopened its casinos last week and beginning Friday, casinos are permitted to reopen in the parts of Ontario that are entering Stage 3.

Quebec’s casinos will reopen over the next few weeks.

Manitoba and British Columbia have not reopened casinos. Health authorities in B.C. have included casinos in its Phase 4 plan, along with conventions, live professional sports, concerts and international tourism. That phase requires a vaccine, broad community immunity or successful treatments.

But casino operators are lobbying the provincial government to allow them to open their doors with approved health and safety plans.

It’s a safe bet casinos are big business.

There were 114 casinos in Canada when pandemic measures closed every one of them in a 72-hour period in March. According to the Canadian Gaming Association, the gaming industry accounts for more than 182,000 jobs in this country, along with revenues to governments and charities of $9.2 billion and spending on goods and services of about $14.6 billion.

‘GNAWING IN MY STOMACH’

But how many gamblers are willing to wager on a casino outing?

Marcia Coward-Wilson used to visit a Vancouver Island casino at least once a week, sometimes more. Vacations with her partner were planned around trips to casinos and it wasn’t uncommon for the couple to make a day’s road trip to visit all six casinos on the island in one day.

But due to the pandemic, Coward-Wilson, 66, says she won’t see the inside of a casino for a very long time.

“I certainly will not be going back when they open,” she said from her home in Merville, B.C.

Coward-Wilson has an auto-immune disease and worries about crowds, recirculated air and all the touched surfaces inside a casino.

“And COVID is still an unknown. Every day, you hear something new about it.”

Coward-Wilson says she won’t risk being able to see her three-year-old granddaughter to visit a casino. And she doesn’t think it would be that much fun anyway, what will all the worrying about getting too close to people and what she’s touched.

“I get a gnawing in my stomach that tells me I don’t want to go near a casino anytime soon.”

But many have shown their eagerness to get back to the casino floor.

News reports documented a long line of people outside Casino Regina when the doors were opened for the first time in three months on July 9.

In just three hours, the casino reached its maximum capacity of 250.

Jason Agecoutay in Yorkton, Sask. says he and his spouse were among those at the casino a few days later. He said there were “some great protocols in place” and he will return soon, though he hopes to see more staff wiping down slots next time.

The casino’s visitors have to undergo a health screening at the door, but masks are optional. The casino has spaced out its slot machines and reduced its hours of operation to allow for more cleaning.

“Maybe the biggest thing that impressed me was that they had machines turned off so you are forced to social distance while playing,” he told CTVNews.ca by email. “Unlike other casinos where they just ask you to social distance and leave all the machines running, you can clearly see the focus is on patron protection and not on making money.”

SAFETY MEASURES

Many casinos have detailed their reopening plans or operating protocols on their websites.

The yet-to-be-reopened South Beach Casino in Scanterbury, Man. says it will have slot attendants offering disinfecting wipes to players, disinfecting machines at least once every two hours, and completing a log of each machine’s sanitization schedule.

Elevator capacity is capped at four people and buttons will be sanitized at least once an hour.

Casino de Montreal, which is reopening Aug. 3, will open six sections at a maximum of 250 people each. Guests are asked to book their visit through a new RSVP system to get “priority access.”

Masks are mandatory, and visitors must sanitize their hands at the entrance and exit and when arriving and leaving tables. Casino-goers will be supplied with a stylus pen so they can avoid touching devices.

Slots are either spaced out or divided with plastic barriers, machines are only activated by an attendant if they’ve been disinfected and physical distancing is in place.

The casino will not operate valet service or coat check and even urinals are closed due to physical distancing.

Some table games have been modified so that only dealers handle chips and those that require players to touch cards, such as poker, will be closed. Players will be separated from each other and from the dealer by a plastic screen.

Quebec casinos will be the first to offer table games in Canada under COVID-19 restrictions. In some cases, health authorities have prohibited them, but in others, casino operators have determined they can’t make a go of running them under physical distancing measures when only two or three players can sit at a table, says Burns at the Canadian Gaming Association.

Other operators are installing barriers on the tables and will open them down the road.

NOT ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE IN ONTARIO

Many of Ontario’s casinos can reopen Friday, when much of the province enters Stage 3 of reopening. That excludes the Golden Horseshoe and Windsor-Essex, which will remain in Stage 2.

Under provincial guidelines, Ontario’s casinos cannot operate table games or buffets, must require face masks for customers, and must submit a reopening plan to the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario, which regulates casinos.

In the new phase, Ontario is increasing its indoor capacity limit to 50 people, and while Burns says he understands where health authorities are coming from, it’s not an economically feasible number for casinos.

“At 50 people, there is not a casino that will reopen.”

Gateway Casinos, which operates 12 sites across Ontario, has announced it won’t open any of its casinos Friday and has no timeline for doing so. Great Canadian Gaming Corporation’s website does not include any reopening information for any of its 13 sites in Ontario.

Burns says the industry is continuing to work with the province and the regulator to demonstrate “our operators are prepared to bring in limits that are responsible and safe.”

He says the province’s casinos have developed “very detailed and robust plans” to reopen that are being reviewed by public health experts before submission to the province. Burns points out that casinos already have surveillance systems that will make it easy to monitor the movement of people and to deal with people who are congregating.

Many of Ontario’s casino operators have sites in other jurisdictions where they have been allowed to open in compliance with public health guidelines. That direct experience, along with studying what is being done around the world, will only help the reopening process in Canada’s most populous province, says Burns.

But there are many moving parts, including new training of staff, getting buildings ready with signs and a newly spaced out gaming floor, figuring out how to deliver various games, and preparing adjacent amenities to reopen, including restaurants, hotels and salons.

“There is a great deal of experience and dedication going into this process,” he told CTV News from Toronto. “No one is going to rush to reopen.”

And certainly no one wants to reopen, only to close again for an outbreak.

THE ALBERTA EXPERIENCE

The five Alberta casinos owned by Century Casinos reopened June 13 and are operating at roughly 40 per cent of pre-COVID-19 capacity, said Geoff Smith, senior vice-president of operations.

With some “well-designed Plexiglass barriers” in place, about 50 per cent of the slot machines are open. In some cases, slots have been spread out to allow two-metre separation, in other cases, some have simply been turned off.

Employees are wearing masks at all Century casinos and they are required for visitors at three sites, Smith told CTVNews.ca from Edmonton. He says masks are “highly encouraged” at the other two sites and required when two metres of distance isn’t possible.

“I’d say, all together at all our casinos a high percentage are wearing them – north of 80 per cent.”

Casino visitors go through a wellness check and have their temperatures taken if there is any reason for concern, says Smith. Employees’ temperatures are taken every day before they enter the premises. Century implemented an ambassador job for management-level employees whose sole responsibility is to ensure COVID-19 measures are followed.

Smith says the “optics of the experience” are crucial, so that customers feel safe. A large portion of the casino’s normal clientele are 55-plus and some of that crowd hasn’t returned, he says. But at times, especially just after reopening, there were some lines on the weekends.

Live entertainment isn’t happening and Century Casinos are shifting their large promotional draws online beginning in August, says Smith. But restaurants are open and so is a comedy club at Century Casino Edmonton, with an occupancy limit of 100, and horse-racing tracks with up to 200 spectators.

“I think we can still provide the fun and entertainment people want but in a secure, responsible way. The close proximity and mingling of crowds has stopped, and who knows for how long.”

There is no indication from the province when table games will be permitted, but when poker and blackjack and the like is allowed again, River Cree Resort and Casino in Enoch, Alta. will be ready, says marketing director Jayme Behm.

The casino has already sourced specially-designed dividers to separate players from each other and from the dealer and has bought a chip sanitizer that looks like a big washing machine, says Behm. Each time trays of chips come to the cash cage, they will get a spin through the sanitizer.

River Cree, which is owned and operated by the Cree Nation just outside Edmonton, used its time during shutdown to install plastic barriers between each of its 1,350 slot machines, allowing each one to stay in operation.

Masks are not mandated at River Cree, except for employees who work in close quarters and for servers and bartenders. And guests are not undergoing health screenings to enter.

But the casino is providing complimentary masks, hand sanitizers and wipes (the latter in bright yellow canisters), and has a designated “extreme clean team” circulating the floor to wipe down surfaces. There is a hotline number patrons can call if anything needs attention or to report physical distancing violations or someone possibly displaying COVID-19 symptoms.

The casino also has real-time capacity scanners at every entrance, which indicate how many guests are in each of two casinos (a smaller one allows smoking). That allows managers to make “proactive and informed decisions” about capping capacity when it seems physical distancing can’t be maintained, says Behm.

The casino is exploring cashless and other no-touch technology and has already replaced the tradition of “hand pays” for slots jackpots, where winners had bills counted into their hands at the machine, with a credit slip paid out at the cash cage.

Head counts and traffic are definitely down over last year, says Behm, but that’s not surprising given live entertainment and big giveaways of jackpots and cars that bring crowds are all on ice for now.

The fear of the virus is certainly a factor, too.

“Some people are comfortable with going out and some people are not, whether that’s the grocery store, the casino or their uncle’s house. Some are not willing to come back yet.”

THIS VIRUS LOVES THE INDOORS

Raywat Deonandan, an epidemiologist and associate professor at the University of Ottawa, says he’s not generally a casino goer, but if he was, he wouldn’t be going right now.

“This virus loves indoor clustering of people and casinos are set up to gather people around slots and gaming tables,” he said.

Standing around with strangers, whether that’s in lines, around slots and tables or in bars or restaurants, poses a danger. The risk is amplified the closer people are and the longer they stay close.

“The second wave will be triggered by a super-spreading event and that’s going to be some sort of indoor mass gathering, whether that’s a church, a bar, a casino or a concert.”

He says Canada continues to ride a delicate balance between opening its economy and letting people live their lives, while controlling virus numbers.

“So that means looking at what’s really necessary and what’s a luxury,” he said. Schools, stores and factories could be seen as necessities, while things like bars, casinos and movie theatres are luxuries.

He acknowledges casinos in particular are big employers and even bigger generators of revenue for governments, but the risk is evident, he said.

It’s possible to minimize the threat, but it does take effort, time and resources, said Deonandan. The key is to keep the number of people inside a casino small and spread out. And he says masks should be mandatory for everyone at all times.

“That’s just not something you can get around.”

Employees should be doubly protected – with masks to handle outward transmission and visors to protect against inward transmission.

As for temperature checks, the professor thinks they may catch a few carriers of the virus, but fevers can easily be suppressed with over-the-counter medications and those who are infected but are asymptomatic or haven’t developed symptoms yet won’t be flagged by a thermometer.

It’s more important, he says, that casinos offer plenty of hand washing and sanitizing stations, along with strong messaging about hygiene, physical distancing, and not touching the face. And while the risk of surface transmission is believed to be low, it’s still important to properly and frequently disinfect the things that people touch.

Casinos also must invest in maintaining and upgrading air filtration systems and to ensure air is always moving, says Deonandan.

Surveillance and enforcement, something casinos are already adept at, are going to be critical to maintain physical distancing, says the professor. It will change the casino experience for many and maybe improve it for some.

“It’s really about what motivates someone to be in a casino. Are you there to socialize or to sit by yourself and gamble at a slot machine?” he said. In some cases, pandemic measures may boost the comfort level. Instead of jockeying for a spot at a craps table or sitting elbow-to-elbow playing poker, Deonandan says barriers to keep people apart could be made to feel like individual, spacious booths.

“Casinos have the resources and the motivation to get it right. They are motivated to get people in and keep them in, so people have to feel safe.”

SOUTH OF THE BORDER

The reality of the coronavirus has even hit home in Sin City.

Las Vegas, which opened its famed casino strip on June 4 to headlines about larger-than-expected crowds ignoring physical distancing and hardly a mask in sight, has now seen the majority of its operators institute mandatory temperature checks and masks for guests and employees.

Dice are splashed with sanitizer after every throw and dealers stand behind plastic shields. There are also plastic barriers between every two seats at bars.

But New Jersey took it a step further, deciding to ban alcohol (or drinks of any kind), eating and smoking in its nine casinos in Atlantic City, while limiting capacity to 25 per cent.

Many casinos in New York state are going the same route. Gamblers can only get water and non-alcoholic drinks at Oneida Nations Enterprises’ three casinos and must drink them from a straw with their masks in place. It is also among a number of the state’s casinos limiting entry to those who live within 160 kilometres. And if you live in 19 U.S. states that have elevated levels of COVID-19, you’ll be turned away.

The entry procedure, included in the casinos’ 25-page reopening plan, includes swiping ID to prove you’re not from a restricted state, lowering a face covering for three seconds to be visually checked, putting the mask back, and grabbing hand sanitizer.

Kewadin Casino in Michigan is recommending that those with “compromised immunity or vulnerabilities not visit,” and is prohibiting any congregating around slots. Mystic Lake casino in Prior Lake, Minn. is taking temperatures, limiting on-site smoking and providing an on-site health clinic for staff.

An anti-smoking group in the United States says about 170 casinos have gone smoke-free in the wake of COVID-19.

A TOUCHLESS CASINO

Some of the changes COVID-19 has wrought could be here to stay, says Burns at the CGA, but that likely depends on how long the virus poses a threat. What is for sure is that the pandemic is forcing innovation in a way few things could.

Long a bastion of cash, this pandemic, and the resulting reluctance or downright fear of handing bills, could push the casino industry to embrace digital payment options. Few casinos allow for contactless or mobile payments and many regulators don’t allow it. But the feeling is that the coronavirus will accelerate the conversation.

The CGA has been working on plans for going cashless for more than a year, says Burns. It recently released a technical proposal for the adoption of debit or cards or digital apps, such as Apply Pay, Google Pay, and PayPal and is now collecting industry feedback.

“We started looking into it last year but the pandemic has had a way of escalating timelines,” he said. “It’s not going to happen immediately, but these tools will find their way to the gaming floors in the coming months.”

The American Gaming Association in June found that 57 per cent of people who visited a casino in the past year said the option to use digital payments on the casino floor is important to them and 59 per cent said they are less likely to use cash because of COVID-19.

The trade group said alternatives should be available to anyone uneasy about using cash. And it said that limit setting within digital platforms – both in terms of dollars and time spent playing – could encourage people to gamble responsibly.

And innovation could ultimately lead to a fully touchless slot experience. Las Vegas-based Scientific Games has developed a mobile wallet and app that connects by Bluetooth to a slot machine. The player operates the machine from their phone and if they win, the money can go right back to their bank account or be turned into casino credits.

The company has also created a platform that notifies floor staff when a player leaves a machine so that it can be sanitized and tells a player through an app how recently a device was cleaned. When a player connects, the machines on either side become inoperable to maintain physical distancing.",[]

In late March, the healthy 73-year-old man was among the first COVID-19 patients admitted to the Humber River Hospital in Toronto. For the next 104 days, Iozzo would fight the infection in the hospital’s intensive care unit.

CTV News first reported Iozzo’s story back in April, when his daughter Gisella was unsure whether her father would survive the infection.

“I just hope my dad would be one of those miracles that come out of this story that shows the world that there's hope,” she told CTV News back in April.

Today, Iozzo is indeed one of those miracles. He was discharged from Humber River Hospital a few days ago and is now rehabbing at the Runnymede Healthcare Centre with the goal of returning home on Aug. 29.

“He's been here for five days, he's walking, up in a chair, he’s eating by mouth,” said Geeta Grewal, director of patient care at the facility. “He's actively engaged in activities so he's doing very, very well. “

“It's amazing because he's so positive and he's so motivated that he really wants to do well and we know that he's going to do well.”

When he was first admitted to the hospital, doctors noted that the infection had damaged his lungs and were unable to send enough oxygen to his blood, which eventually led to a kidney failure and dialysis.

“We were very concerned when he came into the ICU,” Dr. Sanjay Manocha, a critical care physician at the Humber River Hospital, told CTV News. “He was critically ill needing life support to go on the ventilator and through his journey in the ICU there were times where we weren't sure if he was going to survive.”

Iozzo said he doesn’t remember much from the ordeal.

“(For) two, three months it was black,” he said. “Three months in this dark room.”

“It was the worst.”

While thousands of Canadians have died from COVID-19 in the past few months, Iozzo has become quite the success story for the doctors involved.

“It's a great feeling to see someone who was that sick, go through a severe critical illness on life support to the point where we were not sure that they were going to survive,” said Manocha.

“It was amazing to see and it provides hope for us that we can provide the same for other patients who go through this illness as well.”

Manocha also hopes that Iozzo’s story will be an inspiration to other frontline workers and patients alike.

“By seeing someone, leave the ICU and surviving this, it actually puts faith back into what we do on a day-to-day basis for all of our patients,” he said. “This, I think, will help the team recognize that their efforts are not (in) vain.”

Iozzo still faces a long road to recovery, but Gisella is overjoyed with her father’s perseverance.

“It's just incredible for him to speak, for him to see what he's gone through and be able to tell his story and to hug me,” she said.

“I was just happy that when he woke up that he remembered my name because part of me didn’t think he was going to.”

In an effort to give back to the hospital, Gisella has turned to fundraising. She collects a bag of garbage along the Humber River recreational trail -- which is near the hospital -- for every $100 that is donated through her “Trash for Treasure” campaign. She hopes to raise $30,000 for the hospital’s foundation by the end of the year.

Meanwhile, Manocha said it’s cases like Iozzo’s that give doctors’ hope that they will be better prepared in the event of a second wave of the virus.

“I think we're in a better position to support people who come to the hospital and come into the ICU.”",[]

The virus sent him into a medically induced coma, he told CNN's Anderson Cooper Wednesday. And when he woke up, he was paralyzed.

""I really thought I had been involved in an accident or some sort of mishap,"" Case said. He has since had to learn how to stand and how to write.

Coronavirus infections and hospitalizations are on the rise across the U.S. With cases nearing 3.5 million in the country, health experts are learning more about the varied ways the virus manifests and the harrowing impacts that can remain during recovery.

Case has undergone intensive therapy in hopes of regaining the mobility he lost from his muscles atrophying. Doctors told him only time will tell what his recovery will look like, he said. But had his wife not pressed for his healthcare, he might not have recovered at all, he said.

Both Case and his wife, Anne Costa Case, were sick. But they said they had a hard time accessing a test because they had not travelled and did not know anyone who had tested positive.

Case might have stopped there, but when his symptoms progressed, they went to the hospital.

""When he started reporting the shortness of breath, we decided that's it, we need to go to the ER,"" Anne Costa Case said.

He was transferred to a different hospital, put on a ventilator and then put in a medically induced coma for 20 days, he said. Costa Case could not be there with him for all that time, but she asked the nurses to play his favorite jazz music for him.

By the time he woke up and she saw him again, he had lost so much weight he was barely recognizable, she said.

""It was probably the most emotional day of my life. Not being able to see him for almost five weeks, and there he was. And I just kept staring at him because he looked like a different person,"" she said.",[]
6,6,6,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/how-deadly-is-covid-19-for-children-here-s-what-we-know-1.5023528,How deadly is COVID-19 for children? Here's what we know,'Ryan Flanagan',2020-07-14,"TORONTO -- As it becomes clear that COVID-19 will remain a serious concern when the new school year starts in September, parents have a lot of questions.

How likely is it that a child will get the disease? What happens if they do? What are the symptoms to look out for? How many children who contract the novel coronavirus end up in hospital, or dead?

While there are still many unknowns about children and the novel coronavirus, the answer to that last question, at least, seems clear – and perhaps even reassuring.

""In Canada, the death rate is about one per 10,000 infected,"" Dr. Stephen Freedman, a Calgary-based pediatric emergency medicine physician and researcher, told CTVNews.ca on Monday via telephone.

One is the key number there. There have been 7,888 cases of COVID-19 in patients under the age of 20 in Canada, according to Public Health Agency of Canada data last updated Monday night. Of those thousands of young infected patients, only one has died.

We know that the one young Canadian to die after contracting COVID-19 is female, but nothing else – not their age, not whether their medical history left them at higher risk of serious complications from infection, not even if they died because of COVID-19 or died of something else after being diagnosed with the disease.

CHILDREN LESS LIKELY TO DIE

One death out of 7,888 cases in children and teenagers means that less than 0.013 per cent of young COVID-19 patients in Canada have died – a far smaller proportion than in Canadian COVID-19 patients as a whole, among whom the death rate is 8.1 per cent.

Most major countries have higher death rates for children with COVID-19 than Canada does, but even so, there is a clear overall pattern.

More than four per cent of COVID-19 cases in the United States have been fatal, but only about 0.2 per cent of patients under the age of 17 have died. In the United Kingdom, those figures stand closer to 15 per cent and 0.15 per cent.

A study of 100 children who contracted the novel coronavirus in Italy found that none of them died, even though more than 14 per cent of all known COVID-19 cases in the country have been fatal. A comprehensive study from Europe found a COVID-19 mortality rate in children of less than one per cent. In China, only one of the first 2,135 pediatric patients to have contracted the virus later died. Researchers from Ontario concluded that it is ""rare"" for children to die after contracting COVID-19 in high- or middle-income countries.

In many of the cases where children have died after contracting COVID-19, Freedman said, there is little evidence that it was actually the virus that killed them.

""They often are high-risk children who have significant co-morbidities that place them at risk for significant outcomes with any virus,"" he said.

Canadian children who contract COVID-19 are also less likely than older patients to land in a hospital or an intensive care unit. Approximately 1.5 per cent of young patients are known to have been hospitalized and 0.3 per cent received care in an ICU – numbers Freedman described as ""exceedingly low,"" especially given they stand at 9.8 per cent and two per cent, respectively, for all Canadian patients.

On and on it goes. While the virus clearly can infect children – remember, this was something that nobody seemed entirely sure of in the earliest days of the pandemic – there is also strong evidence that it is not as deadly for the youngest among us as it is for the rest of us, or as likely to cause severe illness.

""The risk is not dramatic in children,"" Freedman said.

""The risk is ... if there's a big spread and if families are not doing social distancing, that very rapidly within households, the virus, if it does spread rapidly from children to others, could make it up the chain in terms of ages and reach high-risk populations.""

'REASONABLE WORRY'

Early research out of Europe suggests that children are more likely to catch COVID-19 from adults than they are to transmit it to adults, and an Australian study is one of several to find evidence that reopening schools does not lead to child ""super-spreader"" events.

Those signs are promising, but Freedman says he understands why they're not enough for many parents to shake what he calls ""an appropriate and reasonable worry"" about schools reopening in September. They're not enough for him to be fully on-board with it, either.

""We actually don't know how big the iceberg is below the surface,"" he said.

""We do know [children] are less likely than a symptomatic adult to transmit it; we don't know, on a scale of one to 10, where they actually fit in that regard.""

Through his work at the University of Calgary and the Alberta Children's Hospital, Freedman is involved in two research projects aiming to help fill some of these gapsin knowledge. He's leading an international effort to gather information about 12,500 children who seek medical care because of COVID-19 infection, as well as another study examining children who are infected but asymptomatic, attempting to further determine the likelihood of them passing the virus on to their family members and receiving it from them.

Other mysteries involving COVID-19 and young people include multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, the rare complication that presents similar symptoms to Kawasaki disease, and the skin lesions that lead to a condition dubbed ""COVID toes.""

Answers to most of these questions are likely at least several months away, meaning children could be heading back to school before it is clear exactly how they differ from adults when it comes to COVID-19, or exactly what role school settings might play in extending the pandemic.

""It's really hard to extrapolate from one jurisdiction to another because the policies and procedures in place, the prevalence of disease, vary dramatically,"" he said.

""We've seen some examples where it's gone well and other examples where opening up schools has led to outbreaks … and significant transmission.""

Until there is more clarity, Freedman said, the best option for all Canadians is to follow the advice from public health authorities on limiting the potential for the virus to spread, even as new case numbers dwindle.

""What Canada has done really well is social distancing, wearing masks, good hand hygiene precautions – and we need to keep that up. Otherwise, we're going to see situations where spread becomes rampant,"" he said.

The bulletin, which lists ongoing and recently ended outbreaks of the coronavirus in health-care facilities around the region was updated around 3:30 p.m. Thursday. It indicates that outbreak restrictions were imposed at the facility on Thursday.

A spokesperson for Providence Health Care, which operates the hospital, said the NICU has been closed for cleaning, but the hospital's maternity unit remains operational and a satellite NICU has been opened.

Any babies born during the outbreak who need intensive care will receive it, the spokesperson said.

""There is no evidence of risk to patients elsewhere in the hospital,"" a statement from VCH says.

Moving forward, parents visiting their babies in NICU will be required to wear a mask and sign a visitor log, VCH said.

B.C. health officials did not announce any new outbreaks during their daily update on the virus Thursday.

Other than the new outbreak at St. Paul's, there are three ongoing outbreaks of COVID-19 at health-care facilities in B.C. Two are located in long-term care homes, while the other is in a hospital acute care unit.",[]
8,8,8,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/why-a-closed-border-hasn-t-kept-international-flights-out-of-canada-1.5025449,Why a closed border hasn't kept international flights out of Canada,'Ryan Flanagan',2020-07-15,"TORONTO -- News that 16 international flights carrying passengers who were later diagnosed with COVID-19 have landed in Canada since June 29 may have taken some Canadians by surprise.

After all, aren't borders closed? Hasn't the near-universal response to the pandemic been for countries to encourage their citizens to come home and discourage everyone else from visiting?

Why, then, are flights still arriving in Canada from international destinations including Addis Ababa, Cancun and Charlotte, N.C.?

The answer: Discouraging something is not the same as stopping it.

Yes, Canada's border has been closed to most non-Canadians since March 18, and to most Americans since March 21. Yes, the orders enacting those closures are still in force – until at least Aug. 21 for Americans and at least July 31 for the rest of the world. And yes, the demand for international flights plummeted in the early days of the pandemic and remains low now.

But flying a plane into Canada was never banned. When WestJet and Air Canada announced that they were suspending all their regular international flights, it wasn't because the government forced them to. It was because they calculated that doing so would be best for their business, as there were simply nowhere near enough passengers to make flying the routes worthwhile.

Since then, both airlines have resumed flights between Canada and destinations in the U.S. and overseas, albeit at frequencies far reduced from the pre-pandemic era. Many foreign airlines are flying between Canadian and international airports as well. A scan of the arrivals board on the website for Pearson International Airport in Toronto found that seven international flights from three different continents were scheduled to arrive within a three-hour span Wednesday afternoon.

Those flights, like all arriving from outside Canada, are still subject to many restrictions. For one, they are only allowed to land at four airports – those in Vancouver, Calgary, Toronto and Montreal. Additionally, only certain passengers are allowed to fly into the country: Canadian citizens and permanent residents, citizens' immediate family members, diplomats and air crews. There are also exemptions for temporary foreign workers, some students, anyone delivering urgent medical supplies, and others whose purpose for being in Canada is deemed to be essential.

Everyone entering the country for a non-essential reason must self-isolate for 14 days. Not doing so is a violation of the Quarantine Act and carries a maximum penalty of a $750,000 fine and six months in jail, although the publicly known penalties that have been levied during the pandemic are much smaller.

The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), which is tasked with following up with those who arrive in the country, has informed the RCMP of more than 21,000 cases in which they either could not contact the travellers or received what they describe as an ""indication of non-compliance"" with the Quarantine Act.

Nearly 1,500 of those cases were identified by the RCMP as serious enough to warrant a physical check-up, a PHAC spokesman said, and four resulted in fines.

It is not clear how many of the cases, check-ups or fines involved people who arrived in Canada by air. The spokesman said PHAC and the RCMP have been notified of 237 cases by the Canada Border Services Agency, which screens passengers at all entry points to Canada.

Similarly, although the government recommends that Canadians avoid all non-essential travel outside the country, it is not stopping anyone from leaving.

Border restrictions in some parts of the world may make it difficult for Canadians to get in, but other regions – including the nations of the European Union and some Central American and Caribbean countries – have made it clear that they are welcoming Canadians and other visitors.

There is nothing legally stopping any Canadian from taking a vacation to swelter in the sun in Jamaica, for example, by flying directly to and from Toronto, provided they self-isolate for 14 days upon their return.",[]

Rowe',2020-07-17,"MONTREAL -- Quebec public health authorities announced they would be using a new system for calculating the number of people who have recovered from COVID-19 and it sent the recovery numbers skyrocketing Friday.

Officials announced that 23,686 more people have recovered from the virus for a total of 49,939. That is 87 per cent of the total cases in the province, up from 67 per cent of Thursday.

The number drastically reduces the national number of active cases, which were 27,603 before the massive jump in recoveries. The number of active cases in Canada is now 4,058. The national recovery rate is now at 88 per cent, up from 67 per cent on Thursday.

According to Quebec, there are now just 1,566 active cases from the 57,142 positive cases reported.

Quebec did not specify what system they were using to calculate recoveries when they announced the dramatic increase Friday morning.



Quebec public health director Horacio Arruda will hold a news conference at 2:30 p.m.

** WATCH THE PRESS CONFERENCE LIVE HERE **

The number of new active cases continues to trend upward. Since Thursday, 141 more people have tested positive for COVID-19 in the past 24 hours, down one from 142 cases reported Wednesday. Monday and Tuesday had 109 and 129 new cases, respectively.

Authorities reported that just one person has died in the past 24 hours from COVID-19, and hospitalizations continue to drop.

The total number of deaths due to the virus is now 5,647 since the start of the pandemic. The one death was reported in Laval.



Hospitalizations due to the virus dropped again with 17 fewer people receiving treatment in Quebec hospitals for a total of 260. Of those, 16 people are in the intensive care ward, a decrease of four.The two hardest hit areas in the past 24 hours were Montreal with 78 new cases and Monteregie with 33 making up 77 per cent of the new cases in Quebec.

Quebec health professionals analyzed 14,952 samples July 15, which is 2,065 more than were performed the day before. (Quebec releases testing information from two days prior to the daily updates).

Previous story: Southern Alberta Hutterite colony under quarantine following COVID-19 outbreak

On Thursday morning, the town of Claresholm, M.D. of Willow Creek and Livingstone-Macleod MLA Roger Reid issued a joint statement indicating the Willow Creek Hutterite Colony was under quarantine as a result of an outbreak of COVID-19.

News of an outbreak confused Carol Wipf, a Willow Creek Colony member who says there have been no cases of COVID-19 and the five members who were tested were confirmed as negative.

""Nobody has COVID-19 and we're not quarantined,"" Wipf told CTV News.

Wipf says that regular handwashing is prevalent on the colony but face masks are not being used as ""we don't believe in that.""

She adds that no members of the colony attended the funeral for three girls from another colony who drowned in the St. Mary River in June. In early July, Alberta Health said there was potential COVID-19 exposure at the memorial service.

The joint statement of the neighbouring town, the municipal district and the local MLA was removed and replaced with a new version late Thursday morning with no specific mention of an outbreak on the Willow Creek colony.

""An outbreak of COVID-19 has affected the Hutterite colonies in the Claresholm area,"" read the updated version of the statement. ""The colonies are working with (Alberta Health Services) to quarantine and stop the spread of the virus where necessary.""

M.D. of Willow Creek officials confirm there are nine colonies within its boundaries.

In both versions of the statement, MLA Roger Reid addressed reports that some businesses and residents of Claresholm had been discriminating against Hutterite community members as a result of COVID-19 concerns.

""We must work together to ensure all members of our community are kept safe and positioned for a quick recovery,"" said Reid. ""Discrimination to anyone is unacceptable, and will not be tolerated.""

According to the statement, AHS is working with the affected colonies to ensure quarantine restrictions are being adhered to and that there is no risk to the general public.

""We are disappointed that the information related to this is perhaps stigmatizing certain elements of our community, "" said Doug Macpherson, Claresholm's mayor. ""Everybody assumed the worst and the rumours were running rampant. So, through a joint news release, we hoping to clarify that it's not running rampant in the M.D. It is contained.""

Alberta Health has not responded to CTV News' request for confirmation of the Willow Creek colony's claim of no COVID-19 cases.",[]

When coronavirus hit he was called to help once again,'Scottie Andrew',2020-07-16,"The man who made N95 masks so effective had been retired for over two years when the pandemic struck. But the inventor didn't think twice about returning to work when health-care workers needed him most.

Peter Tsai, a Taiwanese American scientist who invented the synthetic fabric used to make N95 respirators, which is considered the most effective barriers to prevent the spread of coronavirus, resumed work on sterilizing the masks in March as the coronavirus took hold in the U.S.

He spoke with CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, about resuming his work during the most challenging health crisis of the century.

""I felt I need to -- I need to help the health workers,"" Tsai said in his Wednesday appearance on Gupta's ""Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction"" podcast. ""You know, they put their lives at risk. What I know can help them.""

Tsai patented the technology used to make the masks in 1995.

Here's how it works: To block up to 95% of the particles that come in contact with the mask, Tsai made the filters using the corona electrostatic charging method. Put simply, the mask's filter contains both positive and negative charges. It can attract neutral particles, like bacteria from viruses, and polarize those particles, trapping them before they can pass through the mask.

But when Tsai heard about physicians and nurses who were treating coronavirus patients reusing the masks to prevent supply shortages, he got back to work.

Tsai dug in at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville's Research Foundation, working up to 20 hours a day to test new ways to sterilize the masks.

He tried a variety of methods: He left the masks out in the sun, put them in the oven, washed them with soap and steamed them, he said.

The best method, he found, was keeping the masks in 160-degree dry heat for 30 minutes, which can be feasibly done by hanging them in an oven.

But that's not his preferred method, he told Gupta: He recommends buying seven N95 masks and rotating them, using a new one each day. After using one mask, he hangs it in an isolated spot and doesn't use it again for seven days, so any bacteria it catches become inactive.

N95 respirators are the most effective face covering, but the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns against the public purchasing and wearing them. They're fitted to fit physicians' faces and can often become uncomfortable when worn for long periods of time, and if the public buys them up, healthcare workers could face a severe shortage of them.

But people should absolutely wear masks in public, even if they're not N95 respirators, Tsai told Gupta.

""Some people said, 'I don't care. I do not need to wear a mask,'"" he said. ""That is very selfish because you expose your germs to other people. So any mask is good.""",[]
12,12,12,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/cdc-extends-u-s-ban-on-cruise-ships-through-september-1.5027480,CDC extends U.S. ban on cruise ships through September,,2020-07-16,"WASHINGTON -- Federal health officials are extending the U.S. ban on cruise ships through the end of September as coronavirus infections rise in most U.S. states, including Florida.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Thursday that it was extending a no-sail order that had been scheduled to expire July 24.

In the order signed by CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield, the agency said the cruise industry hasn't controlled transmission of the virus on its ships.

The CDC said it was concerned whether cruise ships operating now with reduced crews were complying with practices designed to prevent transmitting the virus. The CDC said its concerns ""highlight the need for further action prior to resuming passenger operations.""

The order covers ships that can carry 250 or more passengers. The CDC said cruise ships are more crowded than most urban settings, and even when only essential crew remains on board, the virus continues to spread.

Companies that belong to an industry trade group, the Cruise Lines International Association, had already cancelled cruises until Sept. 15 because of ongoing discussions with federal officials over how to restart operations safely. Members of the group include Carnival Corp., Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings.

The trade group issued a statement saying it was committed to safety and would talk with CDC about appropriate steps to let cruises resume in the United States ""when the time is right.""

From March 1 through July 10, there have been nearly 3,000 cases of COVID-19 or similar illnesses and 34 deaths on cruise ships, according to the CDC. There have been 99 outbreaks covering 80% of the ships in U.S. waters, the CDC said. Nine ships are still dealing with outbreaks, the agency said.

Coast Guard figures show that on July 10 there were 14,702 crew members on board 67 ships.

Major cruise lines are trying to save cash and raise more money on the private credit markets to survive the pandemic. Carnival Corp. said last week that it expects to burn about $20 million a day in cash through the rest of this year.

Coronavirus infections are rising in 40 states, and daily deaths have climbed more than 20% from a week ago. Florida, where many cruises begin and end, reported nearly 14,000 new virus cases and set a single-day record of 156 deaths reported on Thursday, beating the previous high of 132 deaths reported Tuesday.",[]

In California, military doctors, nurses and other health care specialists were being deployed to eight hospitals facing staffing shortages amid a record-breaking case numbers. In Houston, an 86-person Army medical team worked to take over a wing of United Memorial Medical Center.

Several states have been reporting record numbers this week, contributing to a surge in the national death rate. The seven-day rolling average for daily new deaths has risen 34% from two weeks ago, while the case count in that period shot up 43%.

Florida reported 128 new deaths Friday and 11,345 new cases.

Texas reported 10,000 new cases for the third straight day Thursday and 129 additional deaths. California reported its largest two-day total of confirmed cases, nearly 20,000, along with 258 deaths over 48 hours.

There were signs across the Sunbelt that the virus was stretching authorities' capacity to respond. The medical examiner's office in metro Phoenix has gotten portable storage coolers and ordered more to handle an influx of bodies -- reminiscent of New York City at the height of the pandemic there.

In Florida, Miami-Dade County's commission gave code and fire inspectors authority to issue tickets of up to $100 for individuals and $500 for businesses not complying with guidelines to wear masks and practice social distancing. Police officers already had this enforcement power.

""We're going to put a heck of a lot of people out there,"" said Mayor Carlos Gimenez. ""Our people are going to go everywhere.""

Gimenez said that too few people, especially younger people, have been following the ""new normal"" guidelines, so the county needed another enforcement tool.

At least half of the 50 states have adopted requirements for wearing face coverings.

But in Georgia, Gov. Brian Kemp has banned cities and counties from requiring face coverings. He sued Atlanta late Thursday to prevent it from defying his order, but Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said she was prepared to go to court to maintain the local mask requirement.

For millions of parents in the U.S., Friday brought new information about how schools would cope with the pandemic after summer vacation ends.

Texas gave public schools permission to keep campuses closed for more than 5 million students well into the fall. Under the new guidelines, schools can hold online-only instruction for up to the first eight weeks of the school year, potentially pushing a return to campus in some cities until November.

Most Chicago children would return to the classroom two days a week and spend the other three days learning remotely once the school year begins under a tentative plan outlined by officials from the nation's third-largest school district.

Chicago Public Schools officials called the proposed hybrid approach preliminary, and asked parents, students and staff to weigh in. A final decision about in-person instruction for fall classes for the district's more than 300,000 students won't come until late August.

Worldwide, governments are frantically trying to prevent and put down fresh outbreaks and keep their economies running as the pandemic accelerates in some regions and threatens to come roaring back in others. Globally, confirmed cases numbered more than 13.8 million Friday and COVID-19 deaths totalled more than 590,000.

To cope with the pandemic's fallout, the United Nations said it is increasing to $10.3 billion its appeal for humanitarian aid.

Jens Laerke, a spokesman for the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, said in Geneva that the number of people who need assistance has more than doubled during the pandemic to about 250 million.

India's total confirmed cases surpassed 1 million, the third-highest number behind the United States and Brazil, and its death toll reached more than 25,000. That followed Brazil's announcement Thursday evening that its confirmed cases exceeded 2 million, including 76,000 deaths.

The continuing surge in India -- where experts believe the vast majority of cases are still being missed -- drove home concerns over the readiness of some countries to cope with outbreaks that could test feeble health care systems.

In sub-Saharan Africa, which already had the world's greatest shortage of medical personnel, nearly 10,000 health workers in 40 countries have been infected with the coronavirus, the World Health Organization said. More than half are in South Africa, where most of the continent's infections are as well.

Israel on Friday reimposed sweeping restrictions to tackle a new surge in what Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called ""interim steps"" to avoid another general lockdown.

Stores, malls, barber shops, beauty salons, beaches and tourist sites will also be closed on weekends. New virus cases have soared in Israel since restrictions were lifted in late May.

Japan's capital recorded a single-day record number of new coronavirus cases for a second straight day on Friday with 293. Tokyo was taken off a list of places around the country where discounts are offered under a government scheme to encourage domestic tourism.

Spain, which earlier in the pandemic was one of the world's hardest hit countries, was grappling with more than 150 active outbreaks, most of them in the northern Aragon and Catalonia regions. Health authorities asked the 5.5 million residents of Barcelona, the regional capital of Catalonia, to stay at home as much as possible to stem the virus' spread.

They also announced a local ban on social gatherings over 10 people, and nightclub and gym closures. Spain reported 580 new cases Thursday, the highest daily number since May 10.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson charted a different course, announcing that as of Aug. 1 the government was no longer asking people to avoid public transit and would stop advising workers in England to work from home.

The U.K.'s official death toll, which stood at more than 45,000 as of Friday, has for several weeks been the highest in Europe.

14,14,14,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/struggling-india-crosses-1-million-coronavirus-cases-1.5027991,Struggling India crosses 1 million coronavirus cases,'Sheikh Saaliq And Aniruddha Ghosal',2020-07-17,"NEW DELHI -- India crossed 1 million coronavirus cases on Friday, third only to the United States and Brazil, prompting concerns about its readiness to confront an inevitable surge that could overwhelm hospitals and test the country's feeble health care system.

A surge of 34.956 new cases in the past 24 hours took the national total to 1,003,832.

The Health Ministry also reported a record number of 687 deaths for a total of 25,602. It said 635,757 people have recovered and the recovery rate was continuing to improve at 63 per cent.

The grim milestone comes at a time when several Indian states are imposing focused lockdowns to stem the outbreak amid frantic efforts by local governments to protect the economy.

So far, three states -- Maharashtra, Delhi and Tamil Nadu -- have accounted for more than half of total cases. But in India's vast countryside, which is much less prepared and with weaker health care, the pandemic is clearly growing.

""The acceleration in cases remains the main challenge for India in the coming days,"" said Dr. Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, adding that a vast majority of cases were still being missed.

The continuing surge has forced authorities to reinstate lockdowns in some cities and states.

In Bangalore, a city that prides itself as the centre of of Indian technology innovation, the government ordered a weeklong lockdown that began Tuesday evening after the cases surged exponentially.

In Bihar, an eastern state with a population of 128 million and a fragile health system, a two-week lockdown was announced Thursday.

In Uttar Pradesh, the most populous state with more than 200 million people, authorities have started placing residents under strict weekend curfews, which will remain in place until the end of the month.

Other local governments are increasingly focusing on smaller lockdowns that shield the economy. Nearly a dozen states have imposed restrictions on ""containment zones"" -- areas that can be as small as a few houses or a street.

Dr. Anant Bhan, a global health researcher, said that India was likely to see ""a series of peaks,"" as the infection spread in rural areas. He pointed out that the capital of New Delhi and the financial capital, Mumbai, had already seen surges, while infections have now shifted to smaller cities.

India's response to the virus was initially sluggish and then it bought time by locking down its entire population of 1.4 billion people when Prime Minister Narendra Modi imposed a nationwide lockdown for three weeks on March 24.

""If (the) situation is not handled in these 21 days, the country and your family could go back 21 years,"" Modi said then in a televised address to Indians, many of whom were still unaware of the scale of the crisis in the country.

The nationwide lockdown, then extended for five more weeks, came at an enormous economic cost amid an unprecedented humanitarian crisis when millions of impoverished migrant workers were forced to return to the countryside due to job losses and hunger.

Aimed at increasing the capacity of the health care system, the lockdown slowed down the virus, but it wasn't enough. Cases kept increasing while testing still remained abysmally low and the virus rocketed through India's vast landscape -- from high up in the Himalayan Kashmir to the sprawling beaches of Kanyakumari in Tamil Nadu.

""Slowdown isn't eradication,"" said Jayaprakash Muliyil, an epidemiologist at the Christian Medical College in Vellore.

Muliyil said that India had to try and slow down the virus because it didn't have enough beds but was only partly successful since the ""requirement was quite large.""

India's public health care system is one of the most chronically underfunded in the world and access to hospitals in rural areas is very low. Experts say the challenge for India will be to tightrope the opening up of the economy while trying to restrict the increase in cases to manageable levels that don't overwhelm hospitals.

""India's strategy going forward will revolve around containment zones,"" said Rajesh Bhushan of India's federal Health Ministry. Once more zones are mapped out, health care workers will go from house to house and test those with symptoms, he said.

Experts say low testing remains a concern.

Dr. Ujjwal Parakh, a senior consultant at the department of respiratory medicine at Ganga Ram Hospital, New Delhi, said authorities could have been more transparent about testing guidelines.

Initially, India had some of the world's most stringent testing criteria and used only about a third of its testing capacity. After months of sluggishness, it has now ramped up testing, from a single lab in January to over 1,200. Over 300,000 samples are being tested every day. In some cities, it has also allowed tests without a doctor's prescription. ""The battle plan is to do all the things we know work. Open the economy, as much as it is safe. Track things very closely,"" said Jha. ""But don't let the virus get a foothold.""

When Margorie Hudson joined the RCMP in Manitoba in 1979 as one of the first Indigenous women on the force, she said she was shocked by the racist comments she heard from fellow officers.

“I didn’t understand what racism was until I joined the RCMP,” Hudson told CTV News in an interview Tuesday.

“They were saying racist things in front of me, about me, about the Indigenous people where I worked, because I worked on reserves mostly.”

Following a 31-year career with the RCMP, Hudson is now suing the force for alleged systemic racism she experienced on the job, including unequal pay, lack of opportunities compared to her white colleagues and years of discrimination that culminated in lasting psychological trauma.

When she finally quit the force in 2009, Hudson threw her police badge in the trash.

“I’ve talked for 31 years and they weren’t listening,” she said. “So I said, ‘You know what, I quit.’ And I threw the badge out and I walked out.”

Her complaints are detailed in a 16-page statement of claim filed last week in Federal Court. Hudson is the lead plaintiff in the proposed class-action lawsuit.

Hudson alleges that once, while investigating the case of a missing body in a river with two white officers, she overheard her one of her colleagues say, “Oh my God, it smells like a rotten Indian.”

“And I said, ‘Hey guys, I’m here,’” Hudson said.

On another occasion, she said she saw a corporal throw a large, metal flashlight at an Indigenous man. The flashlight was so heavy that Hudson feared the man would die, but fortunately the corporal missed.

“And then he said, ‘Oh I missed that f***ing Indian,’” she recalled.

She also alleges that a corporal once told her that she was “fat because all Indians are fat.”

The lawsuit also alleges that Hudson was sent to do ""countless dangerous jobs by herself with no back up, in situations where non-racialized RCMP members were not sent alone.""

In just two days, 80 other men and women have come forward with similar allegations.

Sometimes other officers were present and witnessed what happened but said nothing, Hudson said. She alleges that numerous complaints voiced to RCMP management were never investigated or were completely ignored.

“I can’t say it was everybody, but you can obviously all notice and see the racism happening and how we were treated different,” she said.

In a statement, the RCMP said it cannot speak directly to allegations that are now before the courts. The force also said there is no room for racism or any other kind of discrimination in the RCMP.

Eventually, Hudson began to speak out at work about the alleged racism she saw around her.

“I was labelled as a troublemaker because I would speak out. I thought, you know what, I’m not going to just stand by. This is wrong. This is totally wrong. The way they’re treating me and the way I saw other members being treated of different ethnic groups.”

But speaking out began to take a toll on her mental health. She says the RCMP disregarded her complaints, as well as the stress and other consequences to her physical and mental health.

“I was so stressed out I couldn’t even hold a pen. I couldn’t talk, I couldn’t do anything. I went to work and I could not work. I was so worn out from the fight.”

Lawyer David Klein, who represents Hudson, said his firm has been contacted by dozens of current and former members of the RCMP who’ve expressed similar instances of discrimination.

“We have a lot of people who have suicidal ideation, who suffer from PTSD,” he said.

Eleven years since she quit the force, Hudson said she has never stopped talking about her experiences with the RCMP. But now, as conversations about systemic racism in Canada reach the forefront, she says she’s speaking out for those who can’t.

“I know of a member that was forced out of the RCMP, he’s Indigenous, and ended up in a mental hospital. So those kind of people, I will fight for them.”

Mounties investigate racist letter sent to Pictou Landing First Nation chief,,2020-07-14,"PICTOU, N.S. -- The RCMP are investigating a racist letter sent last week to the leader of a First Nation who successfully battled for the end to decades of pulp effluent being poured into a lagoon near her Nova Scotia community.

Chief Andrea Paul of Pictou Landing First Nation and members of her Mi'kmaq community helped persuade the Liberal government to end the flow of treated wastewater into Boat Harbour.

Late last year, after the province rejected an environmental plan for an alternate pipeline, Northern Pulp announced it was mothballing the plant and it has been closed since the end of January.

Paul has said that after the decision and ensuing layoffs in the forestry sector, racial comments and threats have increased.

She recently posted on social media images of a letter sent to her office on July 10 that includes a drawing of an Indigenous person and a Black person hanging from a tree.

The caption says, ""This is what I think of about Natives and Blacks. You think you rule the world.""

Cpl. Jennifer Clarke, the spokeswoman for the Nova Scotia RCMP, says ""the content of the letter is unacceptable,"" and a police inquiry is underway into it.

Clarke also noted that police had earlier been contacted by the chief regarding a New Year's Eve incident.

""Chief Paul advised she was worried about her personal safety and that of her family as a result of a threat she received online,"" Clarke noted.

""We identified and interviewed potential suspects, worked with Chief Paul to help assess the risk to her and her family, and ensured that her family, who resided in a different part of the province, was contacted and monitored by the local detachment.""

Clarke said a member of the local RCMP spoke to Paul in January about the investigation and how to reduce the risk to her safety.

Pictou Landing First Nation fought for years to have the Boat Harbour treatment facility for effluent from Northern Pulp's mill in Abercrombie shut down.

The mill itself closed after Premier Stephen McNeil refused to allow the treatment facility to continue to operate past a legislated deadline, and proposed alternate pipeline route didn't pass an environmental review.

According to Jewish News, the trend first started Sunday night when Israeli writer and activist Hen Mazzig shared his family's experience with anti-Semitism after others used the hashtag to accuse Jewish people of being ""privileged.""

""#JewishPrivilege is when my grandparents were violently forced out of Iraq and Tunisia for being Jewish with only the clothes to their back. Along with 850,000 other MENA [Middle East and North Africa] Jews they arrived to Israel with nothing, only spoke Arabic, and lived in a tent/tin shack for years,"" Mazzig tweeted.

""I want all my Jewish followers to share the 'Jewish Privilege' them and their families experienced.""

Noah Shack, vice president of the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs (CIJA), told CTVNews.ca that #JewishPrivilege has, for years, existed as an anti-Semitic hashtag used primarily by conspiracy theorists.

""A lot of these tropes are well known about Jews controlling media and government, and the economy and unfortunately, a lot of these conspiracy theories have ended in the past with violence,"" Shack told CTVNews.ca in a phone interview on Monday.

""We're seeing a lot of traction on the hashtag now because Jewish people have sort of taken it over to discuss those experiences of persecution that have come about as a result of anti-Semitism, not just as something in the past but of course something that's very much alive and well today.""

After Mazzig's tweet, many others joined in on the conversation including stand-up comedian Sarah Silverman who said she experienced other children ""throwing pennies at me on the bus"" and had ""pastors in Florida calling for my death and telling their congregation that knocking my teeth out and killing me would be God’s work.""

Comedian David Baddiel tweeted that ""Jews don't always feel white, if by white you mean, to put it bluntly, safe."" Baddiel explained that he was just 12-years-old when he overheard a new teacher call him a 'Jew' and others agreed. He added that ""this is without getting into most of my mum’s family being murdered.""

Dov Hikind, founder of the campaigning organization Americans Against Antisemitism, also used the hashtag to tweet: ""I had the #JewishPrivilege of growing up without grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins because my parents’ friends were nearly entirely wiped out by Hitler.""

The hashtag has been used more than 100,000 times on Twitter as of Monday afternoon, trending in the U.S., Israel, the U.K. and Canada.

Shack said anti-Semitism is ""not just a relic of the past"" and that countries such as Canada, the U.S. and the U.K. are seeing a rise in discrimination against Jewish people.

""I am enjoying a life in Canada today, because a couple of generations ago somebody had the good fortune to be able to flee murderous persecution,"" Shack explained. ""Despite the fact that we live in such a wonderful open diverse and vibrant democracy here in Canada, I can't help but worry whether or not my children will be the next generation that's forced to flee.""

While Jewish people are using the hashtag to bring awareness to discrimination, a number of organizations expressed concerns online that hashtag is drawing attention to those tweeting anti-Semitic comments.

Danny Stone, the CEO of the Antisemitism Policy Trust, tweeted ""That #JewishPrivilege is trending makes me feel sick. It may not be a hate term but Twitter should know what this does to communities.""

The Campaign Against Antisemitism (CAAS) also criticized Twitter for not taking action to curb anti-Semitism on the platform, claiming that the social media site has a ""long record of enabling racism against Jews.""

""The idea that Jews are a 'privileged' group is a slur designed to deny that antisemitism exists and to imply that Jews are a cause of racism towards other minorities,"" the CAAS tweeted.

However, Shack said the attention the hashtag is getting is a ""good thing"" as it will amplify Jewish voices and ""drown out those of the anti-Semites.""

""It's important that people take note that this isn't something that just gets swept under the rug and that Canadians, Jews and non-Jews alike stand together and call it out and make it absolutely clear that this kind of hate [and] discrimination has no place in Canada,"" Shack said.

""Whether it's directed towards Jewish people, or any other people, it's just not what we're about here.""",[]

The announcement was made in a media bulletin on Friday afternoon. Manitoba has had 336 cases of COVID-19 since early March.

The cases announced Friday are all from a colony in the Interlake-Eastern Health Region.

The cases include:

A man and a woman in their 60s;

A man and a woman in their 30s; and

A woman in her 20s.

An investigation into the cases is ongoing.

Officials said the five-day test positivity rate has climbed to 0.43 per cent.

There are currently 11 active cases of COVID-19 in Manitoba and 318 people have recovered from the virus.

The death toll remains at seven.

On Thursday, 844 tests were performed, bringing the total to 73,885 since early February.

Hours will be changing at the testing site in The Pas due to temporary building maintenance. The building, located at 328 Fischer Avenue, will be open from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. on Monday, July 20, and then it will be closed on Tuesday, July 21, and Wednesday, July 22.

Only 10 regions stayed behind as the rest of the province, 24 regions altogether, leaped into the new stage on Friday, which allowed gyms, bars, dine-in services and cinemas to finally reopen.

For regions that are at Stage 3, indoor gathering limits will increase from 10 to a maximum of 50 people, while outdoor gathering limits will increase to a maximum of 100 people.

Ontario Premier Doug Ford announced earlier this week that health units in the Greater Toronto Area, along with a few others like Niagara and Windsor will not be moving forward and will remain in Stage 2 until further notice.

""We will keep working until every part of this province gets to Stage 3,"" Ford said Monday. ""My friends, this is great news. We are moving forward as a province but we can't stop, we won't stop until we get every worker in Ontario back to work and back on their feet.""

The province's Chief Medical Officer of Health, Dr. David Williams, previously said he hopes to see the entire province entering the next phase of reopening by the end of July.

But not all businesses cleared to open their doors will be greeting customers on Friday.

Cineplex Entertainment, Canada's largest chain of movie theatres, announced it does not plan to resume operations immediately in regions entering Stage 3.

""We are still reviewing what's being proposed by the province, so as a result we aren't in a position to open our theatres in Ontario on Friday,"" spokeswoman Sarah Van Lange said in a statement.

""While we are certainly excited for the day our operations can resume, our top priority has always been the health and safety of our employees and guests and ensuring that their time with us is safe, comfortable and welcoming.""

Van Lange did not say when theatres may reopen.

The Cine Starz chain, however, has said its locations in Ottawa and Orleans will be open for business. A company statement indicated locations west of Toronto would reopen as soon as Stage 3 rules take effect in the region.

The government rules for Stage 3 state that any businesses resuming operations must maintain physical distancing measures for the safety of both patrons and staff.

The provincial government announced the further easing of COVID-19 restrictions at long-term care homes during a news conference on Friday.

“We know this has been long and difficult months. It has been emotional, stressful and sad because you couldn’t see your loved one. I hope these last few weeks, because you’ve been able to go visit outside, has offered some relief, but I know that wasn’t possible for everyone,” said Premier Stephen McNeil.

“Get yourself ready for that visit and that long-awaited hug.”

The province first eased visitor restrictions in June, allowing residents to have outdoor visits with a maximum of two people.

The changes announced Friday will allow residents to visit with more people outdoors and limited indoor visits.

“COVID-19 has been difficult for all of us, but I think it’s especially true for those who live and work in our long-term care facilities, as well as their loved ones and families,” said Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Robert Strang.

“The restrictions that we implemented four months ago were done to protect the physical health of residents and were necessary. But we know that this isolation has had a toll on the mental and social well-being of residents and their families.”

Long-term care facilities can implement the following changes on July 22:

Up to five people can visit a resident outdoors at a time.

Up to three people can be designated for indoor visits, per resident, but only one person can visit at a time.

Facilities will establish designated locations for visits.

Appointments must be scheduled with the facility.

Visitors must wear a mask at all times during indoor visits.

Visitors may not need to wear a mask during outdoor visits, if they maintain a distance of six feet. But they must wear a mask if they wish to have limited physical contact, such as a hug.

Visitors must wear a mask when they arrive at the facility, where they will first undergo a COVID-19 screening process.

Residents and staff can gather in groups of 10 or less for dining, recreation, or socializing without physical distancing. Groups should remain consistent and visitors cannot join.

Sightseeing bus trips for groups of up to 10 people, including residents, staff and the driver, are allowed. However, residents and staff cannot get off the bus, and the vehicle must be thoroughly cleaned before and after each trip.

Licensed hair salons within long-term care homes can reopen to serve residents only. Hair salons must follow the guidelines set by the Cosmetology Association of Nova Scotia and must submit a safety plan to the facility within which they are located. The plan must include keeping a list of residents who visit the salon.

The province says long-term care homes can decide which changes they will implement.

“With new cases remaining very low we’re comfortable that we can now open visitation more and bring some more normalcy back into the lives of the residents and their families,” said Strang.

“We ask for families to be patient, to work with their facilities that have loved ones living in, and give those facilities time to make the necessary arrangements.”

He also stressed that visitors should cancel their visit if they are feeling unwell.

Adult residential centres and regional rehabilitation centres licensed by the Department of Community Services can also implement indoor visits under the same guidelines.

MASKS ON PUBLIC TRANSIT

The Nova Scotia government also announced Friday that drivers and passengers will be required to wear non-medical masks on public transportation, starting on July 24.

“The evidence on non-medical masks have evolved throughout the pandemic and our public health direction is evolving along with that,” said Strang.

“We certainly are learning that the public wearing non-medical masks is an effective tool in helping prevent the spread of COVID-19 … before a resurgence of COVID-19 happens, we need to make mask-wearing much more of a habit for all Nova Scotians.”

The mandatory mask requirement applies to municipal transit buses and ferries, school buses, community transit vehicles, and private taxis and shuttles.

Masks are not mandatory on buses or other vehicles that transport employees in a work situation, nor are they mandatory on provincial ferries, or ferries that travel between the Atlantic provinces.

Children under the age of two, and people with a valid medical reason for not wearing a mask, are exempt.

“The vast majority of Nova Scotians are able to wear masks … there are very few valid medical reasons to not wear a non-medical mask,” said Strang. “They’re mainly related to anxiety.”

He also noted some people with cognitive or developmental disabilities may not be able to wear a mask.

The provincial government will help public transportation services with supplies of masks for people who can’t bring their own, but passengers are encouraged to use their own masks as much as possible.

Strang also said, while masks will be considered mandatory on public transportation, the province won’t actively enforce the requirement.

MASKS IN HOSPITALS, HEALTH-CARE FACILITIES

Meanwhile, Nova Scotia Health announced Friday that, starting Tuesday, patients and visitors will be required to wear a non-medical mask when entering hospitals and other health-care facilities in the province.

NO NEW CASES OF COVID-19

The province reported no new cases of COVID-19 on Friday, for the second day in a row, despite having tested almost 1,000 people on Wednesday and Thursday.

The QEII Health Sciences Centre's microbiology lab completed 499 Nova Scotia tests on Wednesday and 491 tests on Thursday.

“We’re still testing a significant number of people, because as we continue to reopen the province, it’s important that anyone who has symptoms that could be from COVID-19 get tested and get tested early,” said Strang. “The only way we have to contain the virus is to know it exists and be able to have rapid public health follow-up around those cases.”

The latest case of COVID-19 was identified Tuesday and reported on Wednesday, in the Nova Scotia Health Authority’s central zone.

Strang said the source of the person’s infection remains under investigation.

“So, this is an important reminder to everyone that COVID-19 is still with us and we must all remain vigilant and follow public health measures as part of our new normal,” said Strang.

“We’re living with COVID-19 and we’re in this for the long haul.”

To date, Nova Scotia has 59,124 negative test results.

TWO ACTIVE CASES OF COVID-19

The number of confirmed cases remains at 1,067, though 1,002 cases are considered resolved and 63 people have died, leaving two active cases in the province.

Among the 63 Nova Scotians who died from COVID-19 are 53 residents of the Northwood long-term care home in Halifax.

There are no active cases of COVID-19 in any long-term care facilities and the Northwood outbreak is considered resolved.

There are also no longer any patients in hospital as a result of COVID-19.

“That in itself is an important milestone as well,” said Strang.

The province's confirmed cases range in age from under 10 to over 90.

Sixty-one per cent of cases are female and 39 per cent are male.

There are cases confirmed across the province, but most have been identified in the central zone, which contains the Halifax Regional Municipality.

The provincial government says cumulative cases by zone may change as data is updated in Panorama, the province’s electronic information system.

The numbers reflect where a person lives, and not where their sample was collected.

western zone: 54 cases

central zone: 903 cases

northern zone: 57 cases

eastern zone: 53 cases

The provincial state of emergency has been extended to July 26.

SYMPTOMS AND SELF-ISOLATION

Anyone who tests positive for COVID-19 is required to self-isolate at home, away from the public, for 14 days.

Anyone who travels to Nova Scotia from outside the Atlantic region is also required to self-isolate for 14 days and must fill out a self-declaration form before coming to the province.

Residents of New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador are no longer required to self-isolate when travelling to Nova Scotia, but they must provide proof of their place of residency at provincial borders.

Anyone who experiences one of the following symptoms is encouraged to take an online test to determine if they should call 811 for further assessment:",[]

Officials confirmed on Friday that nine more people have died of the novel coronavirus. On Thursday, the province recorded that five people had died.

The new cases and deaths reported come as most regions in Ontario begin Stage 3 of the province’s reopening plan.

Earlier this week, the province confirmed 102 new cases of COVID-19, the lowest number of new infections since March 25.

The recent infections bring Ontario’s total number of lab-confirmed cases of the disease to 37,274, including 2,746 deaths and 33,162 recoveries.

Where are the COVID-19 cases?

Ontario Health Minister Christine Elliott said that 28 of the province’s 34 public health units have reported five or fewer new cases of the disease on Friday, with 18 of them reporting no new cases at all.

According to Friday's epidemiology report, three of the new cases were found in Peel Region, seven were found in York Region, 38 were found in Toronto, and 21 were found in Windsor-Essex, a region that has grappled with outbreaks among migrant workers.

These regions have all been held back from advancing to Stage 3 of the province’s reopening plan because of their case numbers.

Of the new cases in Ontario, eight of them were under the age of 19, 53 of them were between the ages of 20 and 39, and 35 of them were between the ages of 40 and 59. There were 10 cases in people between the age of 60 and 79 and five cases in people over the age of 80.

The majority of total deaths to date have been reported in people over the age of 79. One person under the age of 19 who had COVID-19 has died in Ontario, but it is not clear if the death was caused by the disease or other health issues.

Eleven patients who died were between the ages of 20 and 39, while 113 were between the ages of 40 and 59, and 734 were between the ages of 60 and 79.

More than 1,800 people over the age of 80 have died of the disease, many of whom lived in long-term care homes.

As of Friday, there were 108 people in the hospital due to COVID-19. Thirty of those patients are in the intensive care unit and 21 of them are breathing with the assistance of ventilators.

Most of Ontario enters Stage 3 today. As we do, please continue to practice physical distancing and wear a face covering when doing so is a challenge, such as safely visiting a favourite local store.

COVID-19 testing in Ontario

In the last 24 hours, just over 31,000 COVID-19 tests were conducted by officials.

A whopping 23,686 people were recorded as newly recovered in Quebec on Friday. The undisclosed new system slashes the number of active cases in Canada by more than 80 per cent.

On Thursday, there were a reported 27,603 active cases across the country, but Friday’s announcement in Quebec brings the total number of active cases in Canada to just 4,058.

The change comes after weeks of Quebec’s recovery figures lagging behind other provinces with active cases still exceeding 25,000. Daily recovery numbers ranged from as low as 49 on Monday, to as high as 156 on Thursday.

There are now just 1,556 active cases in Quebec.

It’s unclear what has changed in the province’s criteria for designating a case as “recovered” since Quebec health authorities did not provide an explanation of their methodology before and after the new surge. Last month, the province back-pedalled on it announcement not to provide daily updates on the number of new cases after officials faced scrutiny and calls for transparency.",[]

In a unanimous decision, the court determined that the constitutional human right to stand trial within a reasonable time had been infringed upon. It was therefore justified to order a stay of proceedings, the court wrote.

In the case in question, Thanabalasingham, a refugee from Sri Lanka and Canadian permanent resident, was charged with his wife's second-degree murder, accused of having her throat cut.

He was arrested on the day of the murder, Aug. 11, 2012.

The stay was ordered in 2017 because he had no trial date almost five years after his arrest.

The Supreme Court's Jordan ruling established maximum time limits for proceedings, and the accused successfully invoked it. Thanabalasingham was released, causing an outcry among the population.

A few days later, Thanabalasingham was deported to Sri Lanka after an expulsion order on July 5, 2017.

The Crown continued to appeal the courts to try Thanabalasingham for murder, but failed after the Court of Appeal ruled that the stay of proceedings was warranted.

The SCC agreed with the Court of Appeal.

An emergency meeting was called early this week by four MPs to vote on whether to review ""safeguards which are in place to avoid and prevent conflicts of interest in federal government procurement, contracting, granting, contribution and other expenditure policies.""

The Conservatives will bring forward the motion and have also requested that Speakers’ Spotlight – the agency that paid out the prime minister’s mother and brother for WE speaking engagements – provide all records of speaking appearances, and the associated fees or reimbursements, by Justin Trudeau, his wife Sophie, his mother Margaret, and his brother Alexandre.

The committee’s partisan make-up is a shift from the last time the prime minister’s inner circle was embroiled in an ethics debacle. While Liberals dominated the roster during the SNC-Lavalin affair, ultimately changing the trajectory of the investigation, opposition members make up the majority of the committee today.

On Thursday, the WE deal was hotly debated at the finance committee as Youth Minister Bardish Chagger fielded questions about the lead-up to the now-halted student grant program, how WE Charity’s proposal to administer the program was reviewed and processed, and whether cabinet members knew about the prime minister and Finance Minister Bill Morneau’s close family ties to the organization.",[]

Baldor',2020-07-17,"WASHINGTON -- After weeks of wrangling, the Pentagon is banning displays of the Confederate flag on military installations, in a carefully worded policy that doesn't mention the word ban or that specific flag. The policy, laid out in a memo released Friday, was described by officials as a creative way to bar the flag's display without openly contradicting or angering U.S. President Donald Trump, who has defended people's rights to display it.

Signed by Defence Secretary Mark Esper on Thursday night, the memo lists the types of flags that may be displayed at military installations. The Confederate flag is not among them -- thus barring its display without singling it out in a ""ban."" Details of the policy were first reported by the AP.

""We must always remain focused on what unifies us, our sworn oath to the Constitution and our shared duty to defend the nation,"" Esper's memo states. ""The flags we fly must accord with the military imperatives of good order and discipline, treating all our people with dignity and respect, and rejecting divisive symbols.""

Acceptable flags listed in the memo include the U.S. and state banners, flags of other allies and partners, the widely displayed POW/MIA flag and official military unit flags.

Confederate flags, monuments and military base names have become a national flashpoint in the weeks since the death of George Floyd. Protesters decrying racism have targeted Confederate monuments in multiple cities. Some state officials are considering taking them down, but they face vehement opposition in some areas.

According to a Defence Department official familiar with the matter, the decision not to name a specific prohibited flag was to ensure the policy would be apolitical and could withstand potential legal challenges based on free speech. The official said the White House is aware of the new policy and that it takes effect immediately.

Trump has flatly rejected any notion of changing base names, and has defended the flying of the Confederate flag, saying it's a freedom of speech issue.

According to Esper's memo, the display of unauthorized flags -- such as the Confederate banner carried during the Civil War -- is acceptable in museums, historical exhibits, works of art or other educational programs.

The Marine Corps has already banned the Confederate flag. Gen. David Berger, the commandant of the Marine Corps, directed his commanders in early June to remove public displays of the Confederate battle flag. That flag, which some embrace as a symbol of heritage, ""carries the power to inflame feelings of division"" and can weaken the unit cohesion that combat requires, Berger said.

Military commands in South Korea and Japan quickly followed suit. The new policy does not affect or rescind those bans.

The other three military services were all moving to enact similar bans, but they paused when Esper made it known he wanted a consistent policy across the whole department. Now they will instead issue this new policy to their troops and employees.

Defence leaders have for weeks been tied in knots over the incendiary issue of banning the Confederate flag,

An early draft of the Defence Department plan banned display of the Confederate flag, saying the prohibition would preserve ""the morale of our personnel, good order and discipline within the military ranks and unit cohesion."" That version was shelved, and officials have been struggling since then to come up with a policy that would have the same effect but not create political havoc.

Esper discussed the matter with senior leaders during a meeting Wednesday, including some of the legal issues surrounding a variety of bans, which some officials believe could be challenged in court.

The final version is a compromise that enables Esper to enact a ban that passes legal muster and gives military leaders what they want, but doesn't infuriate the commander in chief.

According to the official, the new policy doesn't undo the bans already in place, and service chiefs and secretaries will still be able to enact additional more stringent policies restricting symbols they believe are divisive and harmful to unit cohesion. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss decisions not yet made public.

Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy told reporters on Thursday that he is still working on a policy that would remove all divisive symbols from Army installations.

He didn't mention the flag, but said, ""we would have any divisive symbols on a no-fly list.""",[]

Sgt. Helene Nepton said authorities are searching the St-Apollinaire area on foot with the help of dog handlers, ATVs and Wildlife Department officers in the search for Martin Carpentier.

Cabin and outbuilding owners are being asked to call 911 to facilitate police searches.

""The goal of this deployment is to search for new hints and secure properties,"" the force said in a Twitter message.

The 44-year-old suspect's two daughters, Norah and Romy Carpentier, aged 11 and 6, were found dead Saturday following an Amber Alert.

Nepton said the search has intensified since police reported Thursday Carpentier had allegedly stolen items from a trailer within the search perimeter.

Police believe Carpentier may be desperate and try to enter barns, trailers and cabins looking for materials to help him survive.

Owners are asked to have a police escort to search their buildings, but Nepton said there's no indication Carpentier is violent or poses a danger to the public.

Nine days into the search, she said there's also a chance he is unconscious or dead.

Investigators have said the girls and their father were believed to have been in a serious car crash on Highway 20 in the Quebec City suburb of St-Apollinaire July 8, but there was nobody inside the vehicle when they arrived on scene.

An Amber Alert was issued July 9 but cancelled two days later after the bodies were found.

Autopsies were performed on the two girls, but police said they won't reveal the cause of death until Carpentier is found.

Their funeral is scheduled for Monday in Levis, south of Quebec City.

Moore raised almost £33 million (US$40 million) by walking laps of his backyard, and received a knighthood after a special nomination from Prime Minister Boris Johnson.

The ceremony marked the Queen's return to her public duties after the coronavirus pandemic forced her to cancel virtually all of her engagements.

She knighted Moore with her father's sword, and praised him for his fundraising efforts, saying: ""Thank you so much, an amazing amount of money you raised,"" according to the PA Media news agency.

Earlier, the veteran had tweeted that he was ""ready and raring to go for what is a very special day.""

""I could never have imagined this would happen to me. It is such a huge honour and I am very much looking forward to meeting Her Majesty The Queen,"" he said earlier in the week. ""It is going to be the most special of days for me.""

Moore was accompanied to the ceremony on Friday by his daughter Hannah Ingram-Moore, son-in-law Colin Ingram, grandson Benji and granddaughter Georgia, according to PA.

""If I kneel down I'll never get up again,"" he said as he left his home for Windsor Castle earlier Friday.

This was the Queen's second important engagement of the day. Earlier, she saw her granddaughter Beatrice get married in a private ceremony in the castle's grounds.

Moore, who rose to the rank of captain during his military career, was recently promoted to honorary colonel in recognition of his efforts.

Johnson personally recommended to the Queen that Moore should be exceptionally honored, according to a Downing Street press release.

""Colonel Tom's fantastic fundraising broke records, inspired the whole country and provided us all with a beacon of light through the fog of coronavirus,"" Johnson said in the release.",[]

He tweeted, ""I hurt an entire community and it pained me to my core, I thought it couldn't get any worse.""

""Then I watched my own community turn on me and call me a sell-out for apologizing,"" the tweet went on to say. ""Goodnight. Enjoy Earth.""

He then added, ""Y'all can have this planet. I'm out!""

THE CONTROVERSY

ViacomCBS ended a decades-long relationship with Cannon this week after he was joined by controversial hip hop figure Professor Griff on a recent episode of the ""Cannon's Class"" podcast, where talk turned to Black people as the ""true Hebrews"" and included anti-Semitic conspiracy theories.

In 1989 Griff was briefly kicked out of the rap group Public Enemy after he made anti-Semitic comments, but later rejoined the group as its ''supreme allied chief of community relations,"" according to a New York Times article from that year.

During his appearance on Cannon's podcast, Griff doubled down on his past comments and said he was ""hated now because I told the truth.""

Cannon said that Griff was ""speaking facts"" and amplified Griff's views that Jewish people controlled the media, likening it to the power of the Rothschild family, banking scions who have long been targets of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories.

""The Masked Singer"" host also disputed that such views were anti-Semitic, saying Black people are the ""true Hebrews.""

""It's never hate speech. You can't be anti-Semitic when we are the Semitic people,"" he said. ""When we are the same people who they want to be. That's our birthright. We are the true Hebrews.""

On Monday Cannon posted a series of tweets about the controversy, writing ""Anyone who knows me knows that I have no hate in my heart nor malice intentions.""

""I do not condone hate speech nor the spread of hateful rhetoric,"" he wrote. ""We are living in a time when it is more important than ever to promote unity and understanding.""

He added that he is ""an advocate for people's voices to be heard openly, fairly and candidly.""

HIS APOLOGY

ViacomCBS has had a professional relationship with Cannon for several years and is the parent company of multiple networks including Nickelodeon, on which Cannon appeared as an actor starting in the 1990s.

ViacomCBS also owns MTV, where Cannon's comedy sketch series ""Wild 'N Out"" has been popular since its debut in 2005 and recently expanded to its sister network, VH1.

On Wednesday a spokesman for the corporation released a statement to CNN saying the company ""condemns bigotry of any kind and we categorically denounce all forms of anti-Semitism.""

""We have spoken with Nick Cannon about an episode of his podcast 'Cannon's Class' on YouTube, which promoted hateful speech and spread anti-Semitic conspiracy theories,"" the statement read.

""While we support ongoing education and dialogue in the fight against bigotry, we are deeply troubled that Nick has failed to acknowledge or apologize for perpetuating anti-Semitism, and we are terminating our relationship with him.""

That same day Cannon shared a lengthy post titled ""Truth and Reconciliation"" on his official Facebook page in which he demanded full ownership of his ""Wild 'N Out"" brand and said ViacomCBS was ""now on the wrong side of history.""

""I don't blame any individual, I blame the oppressive and racist infrastructure,"" Cannon wrote.

""Systemic racism is what this world was built on and was the subject in which I was attempting to highlight in the recent clips that have been circulating from my podcast. If I have furthered the hate speech, I wholeheartedly apologize.""

He also specifically apologized to the Jewish community.

""I must apologize to my Jewish Brothers and Sisters for putting them in such a painful position, which was never my intention, but I know this whole situation has hurt many people and together we will make it right,"" he wrote. ""I have dedicated my daily efforts to continuing conversations to bring the Jewish Community and the African American community closer together, embracing our differences and sharing our commonalities.""

He followed that apology with one on Twitter in a thread where he tweeted his thanks to rabbis and others in the Jewish community who he said had reached out to educate him.

Cannon tweeted that his comments ""reinforced the worst stereotypes of a proud and magnificent people and I feel ashamed of the uninformed and naïve place that these words came from. The video of this interview has since been removed.""

Fox, which employs Cannon as the host of their popular reality competition show ""The Masked Singer,"" released a statement Wednesday that he would be keeping his job with them.

""When we were made aware of Nick Cannon's interview with Richard Griffin on YouTube, we immediately began a dialogue with Nick,"" the statement read. ""He is clear and remorseful that his words were wrong and lacked both understanding and context, and inadvertently promoted hate. This was important for us to observe. Nick has sincerely apologized, and quickly taken steps to educate himself and make amends.""

CNN has reached out to reps for Cannon for additional comment.",[]
29,29,29,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/personal-assistant-charged-in-killing-of-dismembered-tech-ceo-1.5028321,Personal assistant charged in killing of dismembered tech CEO,'Michael R. Sisak',2020-07-17,"NEW YORK -- A personal assistant arrested Friday in the slaying of a 33-year-old tech entrepreneur who was found dismembered inside his luxury Manhattan condo was believed to have owed his boss a ""significant amount of money,"" police said.

Tyrese Haspil, 21, of Brooklyn, faces a murder charge in the death of Fahim Saleh, whose beheaded body was found Tuesday afternoon by a cousin who had gone to his apartment to check on him. Haspil had handled finances and personal matters for Saleh, whose ventures included a ride-hailing service in Africa.

Information on Haspil's arraignment or a lawyer who could speak on his behalf were not immediately available.

Police said officers responding to the cousin's 911 call discovered Saleh's clothed torso, bags containing a head and arms and an electric saw in the living room of his luxury seventh-floor apartment on the Lower East Side.

Investigators recovered security video showing Saleh exiting an elevator that leads directly into the full-floor, two-bedroom apartment, closely followed by a masked person dressed entirely in black, according to a law enforcement official who was briefed on the case.

The video also showed a struggle between the two that ensued at the entrance to the apartment, said the official, who wasn't authorized to discuss the investigation and spoke on the condition of anonymity.

NYPD Chief of Detectives Rodney Harrison said investigators determined that Haspil assaulted Saleh in the elevator with a stun gun a day before his body was found. Speaking to reporters about the arrest, Harrison would not say when police believe Saleh was killed, nor would he discuss other details about the case or take questions.

Investigators initially believed that the relative who went to check on Saleh may have interrupted the assailant before that person fled out a back exit. The medical examiner ruled the death a homicide after an autopsy found the cause of death was multiple stab wounds to the body.

Saleh was the chief executive officer of a ride-hailing motorcycle startup called Gokada that began operating in Nigeria in 2018.

Saleh's LinkedIn biography described him as a self-taught businessman who founded Gokada, building on his experience of first ""seeing an opportunity in his parent's native country of Bangladesh"" and starting that country's largest ride-sharing company. It said he also invested in a similar venture in Colombia.

""The headlines talk about a crime we still cannot fathom,"" Saleh's family said in a statement after his death. ""Fahim is more than what you are reading. He is so much more. His brilliant and innovative mind took everyone who was a part of his world on a journey and he made sure never to leave anyone behind.""

Investigators had been exploring whether the killing could have been related to Saleh's business dealings.

Apartments in the 10-story building where Saleh's remains were found sell for more than $2 million. The building was completed in 2017 as part of a wave of gentrification in the neighbourhood.

New Glasgow Regional Police responded to the parking lot of a business on Westville Road in New Glasgow, N.S., around 8:15 a.m. Wednesday.

Police found a 23-year-old man who they say came to Canada from California, but failed to self-isolate for two weeks after arriving in Nova Scotia, as required under the Health Protection Act.

The man was charged for failing to comply with the regulations, which carries a fine of $1,000.

“New Glasgow Regional Police would like to thank most residents who are adhering to the directives set forth under the Health Protection and Emergency Management Acts,” said police in a news release.

“But the small percentage of individuals who do not follow the directives are putting health and safety at risk.”

Anyone who enters Nova Scotia from outside the Atlantic provinces is required to self-isolate for 14 days upon arrival.

Residents who wish to report a violation of the Health Protection and Emergency Management acts are asked to contact their local police department’s non-emergency line.",[]
31,31,31,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/entertainment/theodore-tugboat-replica-vessel-up-for-sale-for-495k-1.5028423,'A new life chapter': Beloved 'Theodore Tugboat' replica vessel up for sale,,2020-07-17,"TORONTO -- After more than two decades of delighting children with themed tours and promoting Nova Scotia tourism, the province’s beloved replica of “Theodore Tugboat” may be destined for new waters.

On Thursday, the vessel’s operator Ambassatours Gray Line announced they are selling Theodore for $495,000.

“While we are deeply aware of Theodore’s significance as a Halifax icon, the reality is that we've been subsidizing Theodore’s operation for several years,” Dennis Campbell, the CEO of Ambassatours Gray Line, said in a press release.

With a red ball cap and friendly smile, the life-sized replica Theodore Tugboat was modelled after the title character in the popular children’s Canadian television program of the same name, which aired from 1993 to 2001.

Campbell made note of the fact that the character’s popularity has waned in recent years as the generation that watched the show grew up.

“Most children who watched the television show in the 90s, are now in their 30s,” he explained. “Demand for TV-show themed Theodore tours of the Halifax harbour has significantly diminished over the past several years.”

In addition to its fading popularity among children, Campbell said the COVID-19 pandemic has also added to the tour company’s woes.

“With a severe reduction in visitation to the waterfront, due to COVID-19, we’re encouraging Theodore, now age 20, to start a new life chapter,” he said.

The 20-metre long (65 foot) passenger vessel, which is also known as Theodore Too, was built in Dayspring, N.S. in 2000. Ambassatours Gray Line said the boat spent its early years promoting Nova Scotia tourism by travelling through the Great Lakes and Canadian and American eastern seaboard.

By the mid-2000s and onwards, Theodore was used solely for themed tours of the Halifax Harbour.

Now that it’s up for sale, Campbell said the vessel, which is registered to carry 49 passengers, may have value in a new role as a waterside cafe or pub, event venue, summer ferry, or unique Airbnb.

Theodore is equipped with two washrooms, sleeping quarters for eight passengers, an interior dining area, and a full kitchen, according to the operator.

The seller also said the boat has undergone annual “full marine maintenance.”

The listing for Theodore Too by Scruton Marine, marine brokers and consultants specializing in the sale of commercial vessels, includes several other specifications for the iconic boat.

Following news of Theodore’s listing, a couple of GoFundMe pages have popped up with the aim of purchasing the tugboat in order to keep it in the Halifax Harbour.",[]

According to the short-term rental company’s website, eligible guests can send the personalized kindness cards – with the option to add a financial contribution – to hosts they have given a four or five-star rating to in the past.

The gesture is intended to show “appreciation or encouragement” for the hosts, the company stated.

“Airbnb will charge no fee, and 100 per cent of your contribution goes directly to the host. The cards make it easy to reach out to a host who’s provided excellent service during a stay or an Airbnb Experience,” the website message reads.

Hosts who receive financial donations from past guests don’t have to keep them and have the option of passing along the donation to non-profit organizations that support COVID-19 responders who need to stay near hospitals or stay isolated with their family, Airbnb explained on its website.

In recent days, a number of Airbnb renters have taken to social media to share their outrage after the company emailed them to encourage them to send “kindness cards” with optional financial donations to their former hosts.

“Why would I donate to my host? I can’t even afford one house,” one Twitter user wrote in a post with an accompanying screengrab of the email she received from Airbnb.

Another guest called the message she received an “email solicitation” from the rental company.

“This is nuts. C-19 is tough on everyone, but I can’t imagine anyone with free money to give out of kindness for past business transactions, however nice they were. Shaking down customers?!?” she wrote.

A twitter user named Kimberly also appeared to be baffled by the kindness card request.

“Logging on to send a ~kindness card~ to people who *checks notes* own multiple properties?” she posted. “Top tier trolling @Airbnb!”

Steven White, an assistant professor at Syracuse University in New York, also seemed to be perplexed by Airbnb’s new feature.

“There’s a lot of weird COVID-related corporate marketing strategies, but Airbnb’s suggestion that I send a “kindness card” to a property owner who deigned to let me pay them money in exchange for sleeping at their property is weird even by these increasingly weird standards,” he wrote on Twitter.

An Airbnb spokesperson explained the company heard from “many guests who were interested in supporting and reconnecting” with past hosts.

“In the spirit of rekindling connections, we developed a new feature that allows guests to send virtual cards with messages of support and encouragement to hosts who provided excellent hospitality. If they wish, guests have the option to add a voluntary financial contribution,” the spokesperson wrote in an emailed statement to CTVNews.ca on Thursday.

Airbnb has also come under fire from hosts and guests on the platform for its refund policy in response to the pandemic.

In an effort to support hosts who have reportedly lost billions in revenue from cancelled bookings, the company set aside US$250 million in March to reimburse some of their losses.

Airbnb appears to be experiencing a recent boost in recent days, however, with guests booking more than a million nights’ worth of future stays on the platform on July 8, according to the company, which said it’s the first time that threshold has been reached since the beginning of March.",[]
33,33,33,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/business/lawyer-trump-s-delay-moves-over-taxes-harms-probe-of-others-1.5026878,Lawyer: Trump's delay moves over taxes harms probe of others,'Larry Neumeister',2020-07-16,"NEW YORK -- U.S. President Donald Trump's efforts to stall the release of his personal and corporate taxes to a New York state grand jury is jeopardizing the criminal probe of other individuals and entities and could ""kill this case,"" an attorney told a judge Thursday in urging fast action.

""It isn't just about the president,"" attorney Carey Dunne said of an investigation by Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. a week after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Vance's favour. ""There are other individuals and entities who ... could end up above the law as a result of this delay.""

Trump's attorney, William S. Consovoy, said the president believed there were strong arguments to be made that the subpoena was not ""properly tailored"" and instead copied verbatim portions of Congressional subpoenas.

""We continue to be deeply skeptical that a subpoena from New York County fortuitously is exactly the same scope and nature as two different Congressional investigations focused on federal issues,"" he said.

And he said Trump can still assert claims that the subpoena reflected ""bad faith and harassment"" a year after U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero rejected those arguments. Consovoy said claims last year related to the initiation of the investigation but now would focus solely on the subpoena.

At the conclusion of Thursday's hearing, Marrero said he would follow a schedule agreed to by both sides that calls for written submissions to be completed by mid-August.

He also expressed interest in resolving Trump's claims quickly, noting that lawyers submitted their arguments last year within six days.

Part of Vance's probe involves payments that Trump's then-personal lawyer arranged during the 2016 presidential race to keep the porn actress Stormy Daniels and model Karen McDougal from airing claims of extramarital affairs with Trump. Trump has denied the affairs.

Vance, a Democrat, has requested eight years of the Republican president's personal and corporate tax records.

Last week, t he Supreme Court rejected arguments by Trump's lawyers and the Justice Department that the president cannot be investigated while he holds office or that a prosecutor must show a greater need than normal to obtain the tax records.

The top court returned the fight over the subpoena to Marrero, saying Trump's lawyers may still challenge it in the same manner as anyone served with a subpoena.

Consovoy suggested that the president believes the new lower-court review cannot be quickly resolved.

He said ""further investigation and review will certainly be necessary"" before Trump decides on exactly what grounds the subpoena should be challenged.

He said, for instance, it must yet be decided whether to challenge the subpoena on grounds that it is retaliatory or that the president was targeted for political reasons.

Dunne, though, said delay was unnecessary because there was nothing new from a year ago.

""What the president's lawyers are seeking here is delay. I think that's the entire strategy here. Every day that goes by the president wins the type of absolute temporary immunity he has been seeking in this case, even though he has lost on that claim before every court that's heard it, including now the Supreme Court,"" he added.

With deadlines for statutes of limitation looming, he asked the judge to ""not let delay kill this case.""

""Prevent the possibility here that justice delayed becomes justice denied,"" Dunne added.",[]

""Chuck's son is fine and asymptomatic,"" Mark Young, with Jekyll and Hyde Advertising, told CNN.

Woolery made news late Sunday when U.S. President Donald Trump retweeted Woolery saying everyone is lying about COVID-19.

""The most outrageous lies are the ones about Covid 19. Everyone is lying,"" Woolery said in that tweet.

""The CDC, Media, Democrats, our Doctors, not all but most, that we are told to trust. I think it's all about the election and keeping the economy from coming back, which is about the election. I'm sick of it,"" his tweet said.

Woolery deactivated his Twitter account Wednesday, Young said.

In his last-posted tweet, Woolery said, ""Covid-19 is real and it is here.""

""My son tested positive for the virus, and I feel for those suffering and especially for those who have lost loved ones,"" Woolery said in a tweet on Monday morning, which still lives in the cache of digital archive sites.

Speaking on ""Blunt Force Truth,"" the right-wing political podcast he cohosts, Woolery said he ""never said COVID was a hoax, but it was the only way"" his critics ""could really twist and use it against me.""

""There's nowhere I used 'hoax' or 'it's not real' or anything like that. I just said we've been lied to,"" Woolery said.

""My son has it, so hopefully he's fine,"" he said.

The podcast was released Thursday. It's not clear when it was recorded.

Woolery said it was ""an honor to have your president retweet what your thoughts are and think it's important enough to do that.""

Woolery wanted a break from social media, so he deactivated his Twitter account, Young said.

Woolery's account ""is not gone. He is just taking a break from the abuse he has received from thousands of intolerant people who purposefully mislead people on his statement, including the media,"" Young said.",[]

Bridger Walker's aunt, Nikki Walker, shared details of the attack on Instagram. She wrote on July 9 that Bridger saw the dog approach his sister and deliberately stood in front of her. The dog attacked Bridger instead, biting the side of the boy’s face and head, the aunt said.

""My nephew is a hero who saved his little sister from an attacking dog. He, himself, took on the attack so that the dog wouldn't get his sister,"" the Instagram caption read.

Despite being injured, Nikki said Bridger grabbed his sister's hand and ran with her ""to keep her safe.""

Nikki's Instagram post included photos of the siblings and Bridger following the attack, with bruises and multiple stitches across his face.

Nikki said that when she asked Bridger why he stepped in front of the dog, he told her that ""If someone was going to die, I thought it should be me.""

""We love our brave boy,"" she wrote. As of Wednesday afternoon, the post has received more than half a million likes.

Nikki said Bridger was treated by a ""skilled plastic surgeon"" following the attack and is now recovering at home.

""His wounds are looking so much better! He’s in great spirits, and his awesome personality is intact,"" Nikki said in an update to her post. ""He can’t smile too widely yet but he was grinning as I read some of your comments to him.""

Nikki also updated concerned users with information regarding the dog involved in the attack.

""The dog's owners are really great people who have been nothing but kind to Bridger and his family. We feel no resentment toward them at all, and -- if anything -- there's only been an increase of love between our families as a result of this incident,"" she wrote.

While some social media users have been calling for Nikki to start a GoFundMe page to help with the boy's recovery, she said those interested can instead direct donations to Mission 22, a non-profit geared towards preventing suicides among former service members, or the Wounded Warrior Project, a group dedicated to helping injured American military veterans.

Nikki added that those wanting to support Bridger can send him photos of ""cool rocks"" as he is ""a huge fan of science, especially geology.""

""Let's go on a rock hunt! As you're out and about, be sure to take pictures of any cool rocks that you see. Be sure to tell him what state or country the rocks are in. Thank you again for all the love. #BridgerStrong,"" Nikki wrote in another post.

Nikki is asking social media users to share Bridger's story in hopes of receiving a shout out from a Marvel superhero actor so they can hear about ""this latest hero who joined their ranks.""

Hulk actor Mark Ruffalo responded in a comment saying, ""People who put the well beings of others in front of themselves are the most heroic and thoughtful people I know. I truly respect and admire your courage and your heart.""

""Real courage isn't dominating people or fighting against people or walking around like a tough guy. Real courage is knowing what is right to do and doing it even when it might end up hurting you somehow,"" he added.

Despite being part of the DC Comics universe, Anne Hathaway, who played Catwoman in ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" dedicated an Instagram post to Bridger.

""I'm not an Avenger, but I know a superhero when I see one. I can only hope I’m half as brave in my life as you are in yours, Bridger,"" Hathaway wrote in the caption.",[]

In a Facebook post, Bronwen Goouch-Alsop shared her childhood experience with her mother who was later diagnosed with a severe personality disorder, schizophrenia and a hoarding disorder. Goouch-Alsop said her mother also struggled with substance abuse.

""I grew up in this from 7 years of age until 12 years old. My daily haven away from this disaster intertwined with emotional and verbal abuse was 5 full days of school away from my mother’s home. Every morning when she dropped me off to school I knew I was safe away from the smells of rotting garbage and stumbling over garbage at every corner,"" Goouch-Alsop wrote in the post shared on Tuesday.

Goouch-Alsop, who now works in early childhood education, told CTVNews.ca that going to school ""saved"" her. She added that if she was a child trapped in her mother's home amid the COVID-19 pandemic, she doesn’t know if she would have survived.

""For me, getting out to school where I had a normal life for a short period of time every day was my haven, because I could be away from it,"" Goouch-Alsop said Thursday in a phone interview. ""The school was my safe haven where I could be with people that seemed normal, that seemed to have happy lives, I could be with my friends, I could be with teachers that didn't abuse me verbally… School saved me.""

Goouch-Alsop included pictures in her Facebook post of what her mother's home looked like, showing garbage, dirty dishes and other items piled on the counter tops and hallway floors. She explained that no one knew what was going on because her mother wouldn't let people into the home.

""I'd wake up and there'd be rotting food all over the kitchen, I never saw the counter because there was no room, there was just garbage everywhere… I would trip all over things to get into the living room to have breakfast, the garbage was never put out, everything was just sort of sprawled all over our house,"" Goouch-Alsop said.

When she was 12 years old, Goouch-Alsop said she was able to talk to her teacher and her school's vice-principal about what was going on at home. Her father -- who had joint custody of Goouch-Alsop at the time -- intervened with the help of her aunt and was able to remove Goouch-Alsop from her mother’s care.

""If I hadn't been at school that day… I might not have ever gotten out of there,"" Goouch-Alsop said.

SCHOOL PROVIDES KIDS WITH 'CONSISTENCY'

Her experience growing up is one of the main reasons why Goouch-Alsop is advocating for children to return to school full-time in the fall, despite the COVID-19 pandemic.

""Children right now are being abused in homes that might look picture perfect. I grew up in a wealthy neighborhood, I went to a private school, but it wasn't perfect on the inside it was a nightmare and I was being abused, but no one knew,"" she said.

""I am extremely concerned that this may be the case for many other kids if they don’t have school every day.""

Ontario Premier Doug Ford said Monday that he wants to see students back in the classroom this fall, as the number of new COVID-19 cases reported daily in the province continues to decrease.

Ford acknowledges that the plan is not without risk and says his government will ""continue planning for every possible scenario"" to keep kids safe as they get back to school.

However, Goouch-Alsop said children should have been more of a priority in the early stages of Ontario’s reopening, adding that a plan for schools should have been in place ""months ago.""

""We know this isn’t going to be like what it was before, but we need to create a new way of life in schools for the sake of children and for the sake of the educators' safety. The Ontario government needs to step up and financially support the schools or else it needs to go to a federal level,"" Goouch-Alsop said.

In June, the Ontario government released three potential plans for how schools will operate in September.

These include students returning to in-person instruction while adhering to public health measures, continue using remote learning strengthened by live instruction, or taking part in a mix of the first two options that will see students attend school on alternative days or weeks.

Despite there being potential plans in place, Goouch-Alsop said children need consistency in their lives and not knowing what is going to happen in a few months can create extra stress for them, their parents and the teachers.

""Doing things inconsistently like that -- having a hybrid plan where they're going to school one day and then they're off, it would be so hard for them to develop a new normal life,"" Goouch-Alsop said.

""Kids learn better consistently through daily Monday to Friday learning, so to have them in and out all the time, the children would really struggle and it would create more work for the teachers.""

Goouch-Alsop -- who's three-year-old son is deaf and hard of hearing and who's daughter, 5, has ADHD and sensory processing disorder -- said not returning to school will be especially hard on parents of children with special needs.

""[My daughter] was doing really, really well in school, watching all of her friends playing, role modeling what they were doing, and sort of stepping out of that fear of things that she had with her sensory processing disorder, but… as soon as the pandemic hit, she regressed,"" Goouch-Alsop explained.

Goouch-Alsop said children with special needs don't get the same experience from their parents as they do being around other children in a classroom setting. She said remote learning also has not worked for her daughter, adding that even getting her to engage in her therapy via online sessions has been difficult.

""She refused to go out at all, or walk around the block to get some fresh air, because when you have a lot of sensory issues, the wind or even just temperature changes can really effect you,"" Goouch-Alsop said. ""But when she was in school, her teacher said she had no problem going outside for recess, she would just follow all the other kids.""

HEALTH RISKS VS. CONCERNS OF ABUSE

While Goouch-Alsop understands the health and safety concerns with children being in school full-time, she said being in the classroom only part-time may actually increase their exposure to COVID-19.

Goouch-Alsop explained that, while those children aren’t in school, they may be attending child care or stay in different family members homes while their parents continue to work, increases their risk of contracting and spreading the virus.

There have been 7,888 cases of COVID-19 in patients under the age of 20 in Canada, according to Public Health Agency of Canada data last updated Monday night. Of those thousands of young infected patients, only one has died.

Studies have shown that kids are less likely to die of the novel coronavirus, however infectious disease specialists have warned that not enough is known about how the virus affects children to decide whether returning to school is safe.

Despite the potential health risks, Goouch-Alsop said school authorities don’t know what’s going on in students’ lives when they’re at home.

She said, for some, staying at home amid the pandemic may cause more harm than good.

""Not all children are safe and you don’t know what’s happening behind those doors that look safe or normal. Younger children during this time don't have a voice to speak out when they are abused because they are terrified. I was one of those children,"" Goouch-Alsop wrote in her post.

""We need to give families all options but remember that children aren't able to have their say here to vocalize what they want or need when abuse is involved. I personally would [have] taken the risks of COVID over living daily in this home.""",[]

The incident started at a Valu-mart on Highway 35 in the township of Minden, and ended around 40 kilometres away near a residence on Indian Point Road, east of the Village of Haliburton.

Ontario Provincial Police said that officers were called to the grocery store at around 8 a.m. following a report that there was a man who was refusing to wear a mask and had assaulted several people at the store.

""He refused to wear a mask at the store. He was refused service and the assault happened thereafter. So our people became involved with that initial assault investigation and follow-up,"" OPP Sgt. Jason Folz said.

According to the Special Investigations Unit (SIU), which has invoked its mandate, the man left the store and was followed for a short period of time by an officer.

Using the vehicle’s licence plate, officers tracked the man to a home on Indian Point Road.

""Officers attended there, where shots were fired. Additional OPP resources were brought in and ultimately a 73-year-old male was transported to hospital, where he died,"" Folz said.

According to the SIU, two officers fired their guns.

The man was rushed to hospital where he was pronounced dead at 11:47 a.m., the SIU said. His identity has not been released by officials who say they are continuing to make attempts to locate his next-of-kin.

Folz said the man who died was from the Haliburton area.

A post-mortem is scheduled to be conducted on Friday morning.

Images from the scene on Wednesday in Minden show the grocery store surrounded by yellow police tape.

On Thursday morning, the SIU said a semi-automatic rifle and a pistol were collected as officers searched the scene the day prior. As well, the firearms of two police officers were also secured.

The OPP said that there is no concern for public safety and investigators are not currently looking for anyone else in connection with the incident.

Four investigators and three forensic investigators from the SIU have now been assigned to look into the case. Four OPP officers have been designated as witness officers and arrangements for interviews are underway, the SIU said.

The SIU is an arm's length provincial agency called in to investigate whenever police are involved in a death, serious injury, or allegations of sexual assault.

Anyone with information about the incident is being asked to contact the SIU.",[]

John Konstantinidis spent eight weeks building the structure in the backyard of his Scarborough home so that his children, aged nine and seven, would have somewhere to play while many activities are off limits in the city due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

""They love it more than anything in the world,"" Konstantinidis told CTV News Toronto on Thursday.

But about a week after the structure, which is part deck and part swimming pool, was finally complete, Konstantinidis was contacted by the City of Toronto notifying him that the structure was in violation of city bylaws.

In a statement to CTV News Toronto, the city said they received a ""complaint regarding a large structure with a pool, close to the property line.""

""A pool such as this one requires a pool permit which ensures the pool is properly fenced in,"" the city said, adding that ""in addition, the structure itself is larger than 10 x 10, and therefore requires a building permit.""

The city said Konstantinidis has been advised to move the pirate ship five feet away from the fence to comply with ""zoning setback requirements for pools.""

He said he has now begun the lengthy process of dismantling the structure so he can move it further away from his fence.

He says he's willing to comply with any rules necessary so that he doesn’t have to remove it completely.

""We are not above the law,"" Konstantinidis said. ""But don't make me take it down.""

Konstantinidis and his wife, Voula, said they wish the person who filed the complaint had spoken to them first because dismantling the structure has ""really hurt"" their children.

""They don't understand why our neighbours are being like that,"" Voula said. ""What do you say to them as a parent?""

""You try to put their mind at ease. We told them no matter what they will have some sort of pool.""",[]

The Russian Defence Ministry said that the manoeuvres will last until Tuesday and involve about 150,000 troops, nearly 27,000 military vehicles, 414 aircraft and 106 navy ships.

It noted that the exercise is intended to train the troops for fending off ""terrorist threats"" in the country's southwest and prepare for the even bigger ""Caucasus-2020"" drills later this year. The ministry said the troops will train at 35 shooting ranges.

The manoeuvrs will mostly involve land forces based in Russia's southwest, but airborne units and some other forces across Russia will also take part.

The navy drills will span the Black Sea and the Caspian and will also involve some marine units from the Far North and the Pacific.

Russia has expanded the scope of its military drills in recent years amid bitter tensions with the West. Relations plummeted to post-Cold War lows after Russia's 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula, and the Kremlin described NATO's drills near Russian borders as a demonstration of the alliance's hostile intentions.",[]
42,42,42,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/iowa-drug-kingpin-who-killed-5-set-for-execution-friday-1.5027989,Iowa drug kingpin who killed 5 set for execution Friday,'Michael Tarm',2020-07-17,"TERRE HAUTE, IND. -- A meth kingpin from Iowa who was convicted of killing two young girls and three adults is scheduled Friday to become the third federal inmate to be executed this week, following a 17-year pause in federal executions.

Dustin Honken, 52, was sentenced to death for killing government informants and children in his effort to thwart his drug trafficking prosecution in 1993.

Honken is set to die by a lethal injection of the powerful sedative pentobarbital at the federal prison in Terre Haute, Indiana, where he's been on death row since 2005. His lawyers are making last-minute pleas for a reprieve, but their chances of success seem remote after the Supreme Court reversed lower-court orders that sought to block the executions of two other men this week.

Over recent days, prison authorities permitted Honken to make his last calls to family and friends, according to Sister Betty Donoghue, a Catholic nun whom he called Wednesday.

On death row, Honken befriended Daniel Lewis Lee -- the first man executed this week -- and knew Lee's execution was called off one hour, then was back on another hour, Donoghue said.

""He was very upset with the way Danny died,"" said Donoghue, who visited Honken regularly over the past decade.

Yet Donoghue, of the Sisters of Providence just outside Terre Haute, said she was startled at how calm Honken sounded over the phone.

""He was at peace. I was totally amazed,"" she said. ""He believed he would go to heaven. He is ready to meet his maker.""

At his sentencing in 2005, Honken denied killing anybody. Donoghue said all she ever heard him say is that he was innocent.

Honken's mother, brother and college-aged daughter visited him in prison in recent days, she said.

Lee was executed Tuesday morning and Wesley Ira Purkey was put to death two days later, each after hours of legal wrangling that the high court ended with 5-4 votes to allow the executions to take place.

Lee was convicted of murdering an Arkansas family in a 1990s plot to build a whites-only nation in the Pacific Northwest. He maintained his innocence to the end, saying just before he died, ""I've made a lot of mistakes in my life, but I'm not a murderer. You're killing an innocent man.""

Purkey was executed for kidnapping and killing 6-year-old Jennifer Long in Kansas City, Missouri, before dismembering, burning and dumping her body in a septic pond. In his final words, the inmate expressed regret for killing Long and said of his execution: ""This sanitized murder really does not serve no purpose whatsoever. Thank you.""

A federal judge had ordered an 11th-hour delay in both executions, citing the prospect that the inmates would suffer severe pain from the execution drug. The judge also would have allowed Purkey's lawyers to pursue claims that he was suffering from dementia and was unable to understand why he was being executed.

The Supreme Court removed those obstacles, noting Tuesday that Texas and other states have used pentobarbital ""without incident"" in more than 100 executions. The court didn't comment in rejecting the delay relating to claims of Purkey's dementia.

Honken's execution would be the 10th carried out in the U.S. in 2020, including three in Texas, which executes more inmates than any other state. Last year, 22 prisoners were executed, the fifth straight year that fewer than 30 people were put to death in the U.S. -- far lower than the 65 executions that were carried out in 2003, the last time an federal inmate was executed.

Honken grew up in Iowa, but moved with a friend to Arizona to try to get rich by cooking meth, which he learned to do after studying chemistry in college. They distributed their product through two dealers based in Iowa.

One of those dealers was Greg Nicholson, who began co-operating with investigators in 1993 after coming under suspicion. Honken was arrested and indicted for conspiring to manufacture meth after Nicholson secretly recorded Honken and testified before a grand jury.

Honken informed the court that he would plead guilty. But days before his July 1993 plea hearing, he and his girlfriend, Angela Johnson, went searching for Nicholson.

They found him at the home where he lived with his girlfriend, Lori Duncan, and her daughters, 10-year-old Kandi and 6-year-old Amber. The four were kidnapped, shot to death and buried. Their bodies weren't found for seven years. Honken also killed his other dealer, 32-year-old Terry DeGeus, whose body was found a few miles away from Honken's other victims.

Honken was convicted of the Iowa killings in 2004 in a trial that featured extraordinary security measures, including an anonymous jury. Honken was bolted to the floor of the courtroom and wore a stun belt under his clothing to prevent escape attempts.

The jury recommended a death sentence and U.S. District Judge Mark Bennett, who said he generally opposes the death penalty, agreed.

""I am not going to lose any sleep if he is executed,"" said Bennett, who has since retired from the bench. ""Normally I would, but the evidence was so overwhelming.""

Depp is suing News Group Newspapers, publisher of The Sun, and the paper's executive editor, Dan Wootton, at the High Court in London over the April 2018 article, which called him a ""wife-beater."" He strongly denies abusing Heard.

The article claimed there was a backlash by #MeToo activists against author J.K. Rowling because she was defending her ""famous pal"" Depp, a star of the movie adaptation of her book ""Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them.""

It quoted Katherine Kendall, an actress and activist who says she was assaulted by jailed film mogul Harvey Weinstein, as saying ""it seems that Amber got hurt"" and condemning violence.

In a written witness statement, Kendall said she spoke in April 2018 to a woman she later learned was a Sun reporter. She said she had been ""completely misquoted and misused by The Sun to accomplish their goal.""

""Although it was true that I was a victim of Harvey Weinstein, the rest was a lie,"" Kendall said. ""I was not `going public' on behalf of #MeToo or myself, to criticize J.K. Rowling's decision to cast Mr. Depp, nor did I accuse Mr. Depp of hurting Amber Heard, about which I have no first-hand knowledge.""

Kendall also said she had heard ""several times"" that Heard was abusive to Depp.

Depp, 57, and Heard, 34, met on the set of the 2011 comedy ""The Rum Diary"" and married in Los Angeles in February 2015. Heard filed for divorce the following year, and the divorce was finalized in 2017.

The Sun's defence relies on 14 allegations made by Heard of violence by Depp between 2013 and 2016, in settings including his private island in the Bahamas, a rented house in Australia and the couple's downtown Los Angeles penthouse.

He denies them all and claims Heard was the aggressor during their volatile relationship, which he has likened to ""a crime scene waiting to happen.""

In nine days of testimony at the High Court in London, judge Andrew Nicol has heard from Depp and from several current or former employees who have backed his version of events.

One of Depp's security guards, Travis McGivern, said Friday that Heard spat at Depp and threw a can of energy drink Red Bull at him during an altercation at the couple's Los Angeles penthouse in March 2015.

Heard claims that Depp hit her and pulled her hair, but McGivern said ""this did not happen and at no point did Mr. Depp hit Ms. Heard.""

Two of Depp's former romantic partners, Winona Ryder and Vanessa Paradis, have submitted witness statements saying they could not reconcile Heard's accusations of violence with the kind and loving man they knew.

Heard is due to give her side of the story when she enters the witness box on Monday.

On Friday Alejandro Romero, a concierge at the Los Angeles building where Depp and Heard lived, testified that tech billionaire Elon Musk visited Heard ""regularly late at night"" from March 2015, while she was married to Depp.

Heard and the Tesla founder had a relationship after she and Depp separated.

The Sun's lawyer suggested Romero had got the date wrong, but he said he remembered well because it was just after Depp had hurt his finger.

Depp's fingertip was cut off while he and Heard were in Australia, where he was filming a ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movie, in March 2015. Depp alleges that Heard severed it by throwing a vodka bottle at him, a claim she denies.

Romero said a friend of his was ""a big fan of Mr Depp and he was concerned about him not being able to play the guitar. That's how I remember, and then the same day I saw Mr. Musk.""",[]

""I'm going to track down your address and I'm going to send you an authentic Captain America shield because pal, you deserve it.""

45,45,45,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/study-links-good-health-care-in-canada-to-higher-covid-19-death-rate-1.5026480,Study links good health care in Canada to higher COVID-19 death rate,'Cassandra Szklarski',2020-07-16,"TORONTO -- Heart researchers say there's a surprising reason Canada has seen higher COVID-19 deaths than many countries with fewer health-care resources -- more Canadians live longer with chronic disease, putting them at greater risk of dying from COVID-19.

Research led by Heart & Stroke also found the pandemic has likely postponed thousands of cardiovascular procedures.

Lead author Cindy Yip said the findings underscore the devastating consequences of poor heart health, even if excellent medical care and technology is available.

""Quality of care is good to have, but it's not enough,"" said Yip, principal investigator and director of data knowledge management at Heart & Stroke, formerly known as the Heart and Stroke Foundation.

She said Canadians are somewhat vulnerable to pandemics such as COVID-19 because so many have survived other health crises.

""Because people are living longer with chronic disease like heart conditions and stroke we need to take actions, and we need them to take care of their health in order to avoid the poor outcome from COVID-19.""

The study notes 11.7 per cent of Canadians suffer from cardiovascular disease, including strokes. That puts us in the top third among 63 countries studied -- worse than the 11.6 per cent found in the United States, 10 per cent in Russia, 7.6 per cent in South Korea, 4.3 per cent in India and 3.8 per cent in Pakistan.

When it came to reported death rates from COVID-19, Canada ranked higher than all but 14 of the 65 countries studied (two additional countries had sufficient data). That included places with poorer health-care resources such as Russia, India, Pakistan, and China.

The study looked at COVID-19 cases reported between Jan. 21 and April 30, when Canada listed 54,457 confirmed cases and a case fatality rate of 6.1 per cent.

Lower foreign death rates included 1 per cent in Russia, 5.5 per cent in China and 3.3 per cent in India.

Yip acknowledged that countries vary in how they report deaths, but said researchers strove to use comparable numbers.

She said the analysis accounted for the wide range in access to health-care services among countries. But a strong relationship between COVID-19 deaths and the prevalence of heart conditions and stroke was still there.

For every 1 per cent increase in the number of people with heart problems, the COVID-19 death rate was 19 per cent higher.

Age was also a factor.

For every 1 per cent increase in the number of people aged 65 years and older, the COVID-19 death rate was 9 per cent higher. Nearly 9 per cent of the Canadian population is 65 or older.

The study also tried to number the heart-related medical procedures that have been postponed by the pandemic, but Yip said data here is limited, forcing researchers to extrapolate.

She noted data provided by 20 cardiac centres in Ontario indicate fewer heart procedures were performed between March 16 and May 3 and the same period last year: 42 per cent fewer bypass surgeries, 37 per cent fewer angioplasty procedures and 45 per cent fewer valve surgeries.

The report estimates that province-wide, 1,252 procedures are being postponed each month by COVID-19 precautions.

Yip said that could easily translate to thousands of patients across the country. And that means health-care providers need ""a very strategic plan"" to provide care for people whose conditions may be worsening.

Yip said the study lends increased force to public health directives to socially distance and wash hands often.

But she said it also underscores the need for heart-healthy habits -- regular exercise, healthy eating and no smoking or vaping.

""Take care of your heart and brain health because if you don't have good heart and brain health, if you get COVID-19 your outcome is not good.""

Trials for Ad5-nCoV, developed by biopharmaceutical company CanSino Biologics along with Chinese government scientists, was supposed to be underway after Health Canada approved it for human testing in May, but progress came to a standstill after Canadian authorities said the Chinese government had yet to sign-off on shipping the drug to Canada.

“We're obviously continuing to work with the Chinese government to ensure that this work can continue in an uninterrupted fashion,"" Trudeau told reporters at a press conference on Thursday.

""This particular approach is one that has worked well in the past. This partnership actually created significant measures against Ebola a number of years ago. And as we're looking at developing a vaccine, we're investing in many different approaches to try and figure out where that vaccine will come from.”

Trudeau said some of the world’s top researchers were working in Canada and in collaboration with partners around the world to develop a vaccine that can end the global pandemic.

“We're trying to follow all the different paths we can to ensure that when a vaccine is developed, Canada will be part of it, or will have access to it,” he said, adding that the need for global co-operation would be balanced with ensuring Canadian intellectual property is protected.

Cyber security agencies in Canada, the United States and the U.K. alleged on Thursday that Russia has tried to steal information and intellectual property from researchers working on a vaccine for COVID-19.

Human trials of the Ad5-nCoV vaccine candidate are already underway in China, with results promising enough that the Chinese government has approved it for use in its military. Normally, testing can take five to seven years, but the anticipated Canadian clinical trials, which would be carried out by the Canadian Center for Vaccinology (CCV) at Dalhousie University in Halifax, was expected to move along much faster due to the urgency of the pandemic.

Chagger doubled down on the federal government’s assertion that it was the public service that suggested WE Charity run the summer student volunteer grant program, naming the senior assistant deputy minister in the Employment and Social Development department Rachel Wernick as the official who advanced the suggestion.

“I was not directed by the Prime Minister's Office,” Chagger said. “It’s something we turned over to the public service as to how can we deliver this program… They made it a recommendation that WE Charity would be the organization able to deliver this program within the timeline needed, with the scope and scale and magnitude that we were desiring,” Chagger said.

Chagger was the first to testify on the controversial sole-sourced contract—which she disputes it was a contract at all, calling it instead a “contribution agreement”—during the first meeting of the House Finance Committee study into the Liberal government’s connections to the charitable organization.

In the first round of questioning the minister told MPs she personally did not have conversations with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau or Finance Minister Bill Morneau’s offices about the plans to outsource the administration of the program to WE Charity, which both Trudeau and Morneau have close personal connections to.

“I was given a recommendation by the public service, I accepted the recommendation… and I brought it forward to cabinet,” Chagger said.

She also emphasized that the COVID-19 pandemic played a role in shaping the way federal programs were being developed and executed.

Trudeau unveiled the program as part of a $9-billion student-focused COVID-19 aid package on April 22. It took two months for the details of the grant aspect of the package to be articulated.

Chagger told MPs that of the $912-million program, $19.5 million was the operating budget for the program—all of which has been returned to the government after WE Charity backed away from running the volunteer program.

She also said that the program was intended to be enhanced, meaning an additional $13.5 million could have been given to WE Charity for an additional 20,000 placements if the demand was there.

“The maximum amount WE Charity could have received was $43.53 million out of the total budget… The vast majority of the money was for grants that would have been issued by one-time payments for students to pay for their post-secondary education costs,” Chagger said.

PROGRAM EVOLVED FROM WE PROPOSAL

On Thursday MPs began hearing from the first group of witnesses on the program rollout, how it came about, and who was involved.

A slate of senior public servants from the Canadian Heritage and Employment and Social Development departments—who the Liberals say were the ones to suggest WE Charity take on administering the $912-million Canada Student Service Grant—testified, including Wernick.

During her testimony the senior public servant said that when her team was asked in mid-April to provide options for some form of a student service program, other charity groups were considered early on, but there was no formal open bid for pitches, and other than WE Charity none of the options met all the criteria needed to take on the program.

She cited experience delivering similar programs and a direct connection to Canadian youth as two benefits of going with WE Charity.

Wernick called WE Charity an “obvious option,” noting that WE Charity—which is co-founded by Craig Kielburger and Marc Kielburger—had already reached out to unspecified members of cabinet and government officials proposing they work with the government on a program “related to social entrepreneurship for youth.”

According to Wernick, WE Charity indicated their program proposal could be adapted as needed.

She said she called WE Charity on April 19 to discuss their prospective involvement, and then on April 22, the day Trudeau announced the program Wernick said that the organization sent her “a detailed proposal to quickly develop tens of thousands of volunteer placements for youth within a few weeks.”

“Given the need for speed and scale, I determined with my team and colleagues that their draft proposal was the best available option in the time we had to work,"" she said, noting that after April 22 no other groups reached out to indicate they’d be interested in delivering the Canada Student Service Grant.

WE Charity and the government then entered into talks about the ""contribution agreement"" in mid-May and Wernick said that any activity the organization did to recruit or set up volunteer placements prior to the late June launch of the program were taken ""completely"" at the charity's risk.

The aid program, meant to offer students $1,000 for every 100 hours of volunteer time they spent helping out on COVID-19-related efforts, was put on pause after WE Charity backed out after coming under fire for its own internal issues as well as what critics say is a clear conflict of interest within the Liberal government.

Both Morneau and Trudeau have apologized for their part in the controversy and vowed to recuse themselves from any WE Charity discussions in the future, though federal Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion is now conducting separate probes into both Trudeau and Morneau’s dealings in relation to the WE Charity contract.

While the government has vowed to rework the program as quickly as possible, and is looking internally to government departments and agencies as possible venues for running the program, thousands of students have been left in limbo midway through the summer.

One of the key intentions with this committee study, according to the opposition parties who used their majority on House of Commons committees to launch the investigation, is to dig up as much detail on who knew what and when, in relation to how the WE Charity student grant deal came about. It’s also likely officials will be questioned about other past contracts with WE and the extent of the Liberals’ connections to the organization.

“Federal government proactive disclosures show that the Canada Student Service Grant is not the beginning of WE Charity’s dealings with the federal government. Government records confirm that, since 2017, WE Charity has received seven grants or contributions totalling about $5.2 million, plus another five contracts,” wrote Conservative MP and ethics critic Michael Barrett in a letter sent to the RCMP suggesting a criminal probe into the matter.

TRUDEAU TO TESTIFY?

Another key intent of the opposition parties is to have Trudeau testify before the committee. While MPs have invited him to appear, he is not compelled to do so. When asked if he would appear at the request of MPs, Trudeau has said he’d consider it.

Facing new questions about the affair on Thursday during an unexpected press conference just minutes before the committee got underway, Trudeau said his government would be “transparent” about the deal, but wouldn’t commit to testifying.

The purpose of bringing the prime minister before the panel of MPs would be to extract more details around his family’s connections to the charity group.

Trudeau's mother, Margaret Trudeau, spoke at approximately 28 WE events and was paid $250,000 in speaking honorariums between 2016 and 2020. His brother, Alexandre Trudeau, also spoke at eight events from 2017 to 2018 and was paid a total of approximately $32,000.

Over $60,000 of that money, which is typically doled out by corporate sponsors, was paid directly to Margaret Trudeau by the charity as the result of what WE Charity referred to as an ""error"" in billing and payment.

In addition to this, Trudeau's wife, Sophie Gregoire Trudeau, received a ""one-time speaking honorarium"" of $1,400 for participating in a youth event in 2012 before Trudeau became leader of the Liberal Party. She is an ambassador with the organization and continues to host a mental health podcast under its name.

In making his apology earlier this week, Trudeau said he was aware his family members worked with WE but he didn’t know the details of how much they were getting paid.

“I should have and I deeply regret that,” Trudeau said on Monday.

Late Wednesday We Charity announced its plans to undertake ""governance and structural changes"" and a ""formal organizational review.”

Asked Thursday about how much she knew about the prime minister’s connections, Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said everyone in cabinet “bears responsibility for the situation.”

“I'd like to say, speaking for myself, that I accept that responsibility, and I very much regret what has happened. And I want to say to Canadians: I'm really sorry. We have so many huge issues facing our country, clearly, our government made a mistake, and I want to say to people: we're going to learn from it.”

The Long March-5 carrier rocket is China's heaviest-lift launch vehicle and has been used experimentally three times, but never with a payload. Dubbed Tianwen-1, China's mission to Mars aims to land a rover to gather scientific data.

The rocket is due to blast off from the Wenchang Space Launch Center in the southern island province of Hainan in late July or early August, according to state media reports Friday that quoted the China National Space Administration.

The mission is one of the most ambitious yet for China's space program, which has advanced rapidly since launching its first crewed mission in 2003. Since then, it has sent astronauts to an experimental space station, begun work on a larger, more permanent facility and landed a probe on the less-explored far side of the moon.

This summer's trio of missions in the most sweeping effort yet to seek signs of ancient microscopic life while scouting out Mars for future astronauts.

The timelines for such missions are daunting and the countries involved are striving to take best advantage of a one-month window in which Mars and Earth are in ideal alignment on the same side of the sun, minimizing travel time and fuel use. Such a window opens only once every 26 months.

Preparations have continued amid the coronavirus outbreak, which in part prompted Europe and Russia to drop their plans to send a life-seeking rover to Mars this summer.

Each spacecraft will travel more than 480 million kilometres (300 million miles) before reaching Mars next February. In the process, they will loop out beyond Earth's orbit and sync up with Mars' more distant orbit around the sun.

The U.S. is sending over a car-sized six-wheeled rover named Perseverance to collect rock samples to be returned to Earth for analysis in about a decade. It's launch date has been set for between July 30 and Aug. 15.

The UAE spacecraft, named Amal, or ""Hope"" in Arabic, is an orbiter built in partnership with the University of Colorado Boulder and is now scheduled to launch from Japan on Monday. It will be the Arab world's first interplanetary mission.

Scientists want to know what Mars was like billions of years ago, back when it had water sources that may have supported tiny life forms before turning into the frozen world it is today.

So far, the U.S. has been the only country to successfully put a spacecraft on Mars, doing it eight times. Two NASA landers are operating there, InSight and Curiosity. Six other spacecraft are exploring the planet from orbit: three U.S., two European and one from India.

China's last attempt at a Mars mission in collaboration with Russia ended in failure in 2011. The Chinese space program's close military connections and the relative secrecy within it operates has limited its opportunities for co-operation with those of the U.S. and other countries.",[]

Mars mission liftoff on Japan rocket reset for Monday,'Mari Yamaguchi',2020-07-17,"TOKYO -- The liftoff of a United Arab Emirates' Mars orbiter, postponed due to bad weather at the launch site in southern Japan, is now set for Monday.

The orbiter named Amal, or Hope, is the Arab world's first interplanetary mission. The launch, initially scheduled for Wednesday from the Tanegashima Space Center, has been reset for 6:58 a.m. Monday (2158 GMT Sunday), Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, the provider of the H-IIA rocket, said Friday.

Mitsubishi, however, said there is a slight chance of further postponement depending on the weather. The company has set a launch window through Aug. 13. A final decision is expected Sunday.

Hope is to reach Mars in February 2021, the year the U.A.E. celebrates 50 years since its formation. A successful Hope mission would be a major step for the oil-dependent economy seeking a future in space.

Two other Mars missions are planned in coming days by the U.S. and China. Japan has its own Martian moon mission planned in 2024.

Hope carries three instruments to study the upper atmosphere and monitor climate change and is scheduled to circle the red planet for at least two years. The U.A.E. says it will provide a complete view of the Martian atmosphere during different seasons for the first time.

""I'm looking forward to a successful launch,"" Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi said. He said the scheduled launch of a Japanese rocket carrying U.A.E.'s Hope probe ""is a symbol of our firm relations between Japan and U.A.E.""

Resource-poor Japan has traditionally kept friendly ties with Middle Eastern countries. In recent years, Japan has increasingly stepped up trade and defence ties with the U.A.E, and now seeks to expand its space business. Motegi said Japan hopes to further promote comprehensive and strategic partnership with U.A.E.",[]

The European Space Agency's Solar Orbiter blasted off from Florida's Cape Canaveral in February and completed its first fly by of our star last month, sending back unprecedented images of phenomena close to its surface.

""The first images are exceeding our expectations,"" said Daniel Muller, Solar Orbiter project scientist at ESA.

""We can already see hints of very interesting phenomena that we have not been able to observe in detail before.

""This makes us confident that Solar Orbiter will help us answer profound open questions about the Sun.""

In particular, the team observed dozens of miniature solar flares, known as ""campfires"", which until now had never been captured on film.

David Berghmans, from Belgium's Royal Observatory, said the campfires were several million times smaller than solar flares, which can be observed from Earth.

""The Sun seems relatively calm on first viewing but when you look at it in detail you can see miniature eruptions everywhere,"" he said.

Solar winds and flares emit billions of highly charged particles that impact planets, including Earth. But the phenomena remain poorly understood despite decades of research.

The largest solar storm on record hit North America in September 1859, knocking out much of the continent's telegraph network and bathing the skies in an aurora viewable as far away as the Caribbean.

Solar ejections can also disrupt radar systems, radio networks and can even render satellites useless, though such extremes are rare.

During its first orbit, the craft -- developed in conjunction with NASA -- travelled around 77 million kilometres (48 million miles) from the surface, about half the distance between the Sun and Earth.

Equipped to withstand temperatures as high as 500 degrees Celsius (930 Fahrenheit), it will eventually travel as close as 40 million kilometres from the surface, protecting its instruments with a heat-resistant structure that will be exposed to sunlight 13 times stronger than on Earth.

Its operators plan to gradually tilt the craft's orbit, enabling scientists to obtain the first ever images of the Sun's poles.

The Solar Orbiter mission and is set to last up to nine years at a cost of some 1.5 billion euros (US$1.7 billion).",[]

The airline, which was the world's biggest operator of the 747-400 model, had already planned to ground its fleet of 31 of the iconic wide-bodied jets in 2024.

But the pandemic, which has seen most of the world's planes grounded for the best part of three months, has hastened its journey into retirement, especially as forecasters predict that passenger numbers will remain lower than normal, potentially for years to come.

BA's predecessor, BOAC, first used the 747 in 1971 and as with many airlines, the plane -- affectionately referred to as either the ""jumbo jet"" or the ""queen of the skies"" -- became a symbol of the new age of mass travel to all corners of the planet. Its days have been numbered, though, in light of new, modern, fuel-efficient aircraft such as Airbus' A350 and Boeing's 787.

""It is with great sadness that we can confirm we are proposing to retire our entire 747 fleet with immediate effect,"" BA said in a statement.

""It is unlikely our magnificent `queen of the skies' will ever operate commercial services for British Airways again due to the downturn in travel caused by the COVID-19 global pandemic.""

More than 1,500 jumbos were produced by Boeing, and it has historically been a commercial success for the manufacturer and the airlines. But its heyday is long in the past and any sight of the jet, with its distinctive hump at the top, is now a rarity.

Just 30 of the planes were in service as of Tuesday, with a further 132 in storage, according to aviation data firm Cirium.

British Airways' 747-400s have a capacity of 345 passengers and can reach a top speed of 614 mph (988 kph).

""While the aircraft will always have a special place in our heart, as we head into the future we will be operating more flights on modern, fuel-efficient aircraft,"" BA said.

Airlines around the world have struggled to cope with the collapse in demand caused by the pandemic. In the U.K., British Airways, easyJet and Virgin Atlantic have all announced job cuts and reduced operations.

Unite, a union that represents many workers in the aviation industry, urged the government to use the retirement of the 747 to bring forward an aircraft scrappage scheme to boost investments in greener aircraft as well as aerospace manufacturing.

Earlier this week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he would examine the idea of a scrappage scheme for old and highly polluting aircraft.

""British Airways' retirement of the 747 should be the impetus he needs to put such a scheme into action,"" Unite national officer Rhys McCarthy said.",[]

The government agency said wholesale sales rose 5.7 per cent to $52.6 billion in May following the 21.4 per cent drop in April.

Economists on average had expected an increase of 8.5 per cent for May, according to financial markets data firm Refinitiv.

CIBC economist Katherine Judge said wholesaling wasn't hit quite as hard as either retailing or manufacturing in March and April.

""As the economy continues to reopen and demand picks up, while at the same time more inventory becomes available, a further increase in wholesaling should be expected,"" Judge wrote in a note to clients.

""That said, since it didn't fall as hard, it will likely continue to recover at a slower pace than (other) industries.""

Statistics Canada said as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the railway shutdowns that came before it due to blockades, wholesale sales fell $15.3 billion from February through April.

It said that after the $2.8 billion increase in May, wholesale sales were still down 19.2 per cent compared with January.

The overall increase in May came as six of seven subsectors recorded higher sales.

Statistics Canada said that the building material and supplies and the motor vehicle and motor vehicle parts and accessories subsectors contributed the most to the gain, in dollar terms.

The building material and supplies wholesale subsector rose 16.1 per cent to $7.8 billion, while the motor vehicle and motor vehicle parts and accessories subsector gained 33.4 per cent to $4.2 billion in May.

Machinery equipment and supply wholesalers reported sales fell 4.7 per cent to $11.5 billion.

Overall wholesale sales volumes increased 5.2 per cent for the month.

Raised in the South Bronx, Johnson considered himself ""a closet NASCAR fan,"" without a friend or family member who truly shared his interest in catching the latest race.

""As you can imagine,"" Johnson said, ""there just simply weren't a lot of people receptive to the sport given its history.""

Johnson recalled staying in his Temple University dorm during the massive blizzard that wreaked havoc on the East Coast in 1979 to watch the Daytona 500, broadcast live in its entirety for the first time. His roommate was stuck elsewhere because of the weather, leaving Johnson alone with the TV.

""Nobody knew,"" Johnson said, laughing. ""As a Black person in an urban area, it wasn't acceptable. I wasn't really out there. But that love continued to this day.""

The 61-year-old Johnson, who has retired to Miami, shares his passion for the sport with a Black NASCAR Fans group on Facebook. The group's bio says: ""Yes we exist.""

The fans share favourite race memories, photos of their collectibles and, yes, stories of the historically uneasy relationship NASCAR has had with the Black community. Johnson has been called racist slurs at the track, felt queasy at the sight of the Confederate flag and often wondered if the good-ol'-boy Southern attitudes seeped in the sport would ever fade.

The catalyst for change has come for the U.S. with the death of George Floyd in the custody of Minneapolis police. Not long after that, driver Bubba Wallace shoved NASCAR toward the overdue step of banning the Confederate flag, for decades a waving, nylon symbol to Blacks that they were not welcome in NASCAR Nation.

The thought of facing the flag and the potential of alcohol-fueled anger from its staunchest defenders has kept many Black fans away and made the ones who did come watch their step. Johnson said banning the flag will make NASCAR ""more inviting.""

""We need to get more people, encourage more people of colour to come and enjoy what goes on around race weekend,"" added Brad Daugherty, the lone Black team owner in NASCAR.

According to NASCAR, the latest demographics show an overwhelmingly white fan base -- 75% -- but the multicultural slice of 25% has climbed from 20% in 2011. Black fans make up 9% of the total.

The sight of Black fans lined against the Talladega fence to cheer for Wallace a day after a noose was found in his stall was a heartening moment for NASCAR. But earning the trust of a new generation of fans extends beyond ""if you ban it, they will come."" NASCAR and its tracks need bolder attempts at ticket and community outreach programs, much in the way baseball, the NHL and the NBA celebrate pride or ethnic-themed nights.

Minorities may not necessarily become the dominant demographic for the stock car series, but they can certainly grab a larger share of the marketplace.

Could Wallace, who f inished second in the 2018 Daytona 500, engage new fans if he won a checkered flag or two driving for an underfunded team? Would a diversity program that places more drivers in the Cup Series -- where Wallace is the only Black driver -- broaden exposure and create fans of all genders, ethnicities and backgrounds?

NASCAR has worked on building awareness among multicultural audiences for years. The Drive for Diversity program dates to 2004 and a separate effort to work with key minority business and community leaders started three years later.

""If people look at the sport and see the stars of the sport are representative of different groups, I think it's just another step toward making the sport feel more open to a larger audience of folks,"" Drive for Diversity director Jusan Hamilton said. ""If people look at the sport and feel that it's open, that in turn will help make more folks be interested in coming to the sport.""

The few Black drivers who came before Wallace have heard that hopefulness before only to often end up discouraged at the frayed bond between NASCAR and minorities.

""It's time to realize it's a new day,"" said Bill Lester, who made 145 career NASCAR starts from 1999-2006. ""Not all the race car drivers happen to be white. There are people of colour. There are women out there who want to race.""

Lester said he believes NASCAR President Steve Phelps, who tearfully told Wallace about the noose in the garage, and veteran executive Brandon Thompson can provoke tangible culture change within the sport.

Still, Wallace is one of just a handful of non-white drivers. Daniel Suarez is Mexican and Aric Almirola is of Cuban descent. Kyle Larson, who is half Asian, was fired in April for using a racial slur.

NASCAR met this month with the Rev. Greg Drumwright, who organized members of his ministry to make the trip to Talladega to support Wallace. Drumwright said he and his group planned to attend other races, too, and he posted a series of encouraging interactions on his Twitter feed from the All-Star race at Bristol on Wednesday.

""We don't want window dressing,"" Drumwright said. ""This is a national dialogue.""

Toni Addison, her husband and three children of Newark, Delaware, have never attended a NASCAR race. They drive by Dover International Speedway on race weekends and wondered if they'd feel welcomed.

""It sounds like something we'd be interested in,"" Addison said. ""But guess I couldn't wear my Black Live Matter shirt or my Barack Obama shirt to that. I'm a (Dallas) Cowboys fan. It's kind of like a Cowboys fan doesn't go into the Eagles stadium, at least not with all the Cowboys gear on.""",[]

One Adelaide Airport worker said that staff believe the grey BMW has been in the employee car park since “February or even earlier.” It had been covered with a protective sheet until a windy day in April revealed its licence plate.

It was still there on Monday, after Steven Spry, an operations supervisor with Qantas, clocked out for the night, he told CTVNews.ca over Instagram messaging.

“We guess it may be a long haul pilot or hostess caught overseas,” he wrote.

The novel coronavirus wasn’t officially dubbed COVID-19 until February 11, when Spry said some colleagues believe the car might have already been parked at the airport. Since the World Health Organization deemed the global outbreaks a pandemic in March, international travel has been widely restricted and countries were forced to charter jets to bring citizens home.

Australia, which has close to 10,000 known cases of the virus and 108 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 dashboard, has recently renewed lockdowns after flareups of the virus in major cities.

Amid lockdowns, the airline industry was hit particularly hard as planes were grounded and flights cancelled, leading companies to lay off thousands of staff. Spry said that most workers with Qantas and Virgin Australia Airlines are out of work, which could be part of the reason the car is still at the airport. Typically, staff can only leave their vehicles there for 48 hours.

But it’s a mystery as to when the owner of the car would have had the licence plate approved by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, and why. The BMW in question is registered until late September, but there are no licence plates registered as “COVID19,” according to ABC Radio Adelaide, who first reported the story.",[]

The recall covers certain 2011 and 2012 Elantra compacts and Sonata midsize cars, and the 2012 Accent subcompact and Veloster hatchback.

Hyundai says the problem happens when an air compressor used to inflate tires is plugged into the socket for a long time. In some vehicles, the outlets were overly tightened at the factory. That can disable a fuse designed to guard against overheating.

Hyundai has nine reports of fires but no injuries. Owners were using compressors that came with the cars in seven fires while two fires began while aftermarket compressors were in use.

Hyundai is still working on a repair. Owners will get letters notifying them of the recall starting in late August.",[]

Bach seems certain to get four more years in 2021 after almost half of the 100 International Olympic Committee members from around the world praised him in an online version of their annual meeting.

""As you can imagine, I could hear this forever,"" Bach quipped during nearly a full hour of tributes to his leadership since his eight-year first term started in 2013, and from members welcoming his candidacy for the second term.

Bach's first term was marred by the Russian doping scandal but it has been a financially stable period for the IOC. American broadcaster NBC signed a long-term rights deal and new top-tier sponsors were added, including Chinese retail giant Alibaba.

The Beijing Winter Olympics, currently scheduled for February 2022, will be an early highlight and a potential test of Bach's second and, according to current IOC rules, final term in office.

Although serious talk of a boycott has not begun, China's human rights record is an expected target ahead of the Olympics. Some lawmakers and diplomats have criticized China for its detention and treatment of its Muslim minority Uighur people and pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong.

""Boycotts and discrimination because of political background or nationality are once again a real danger,"" Bach warned in his keynote speech in Lausanne, Switzerland. ""A sporting boycott only punishes the athletes of the boycotting country and deprives their people of sharing in the success, pride and joy of their Olympic team.""

The issue is personal for Bach, who won a gold medal in team fencing at the 1976 Montreal Olympics but could not defend the title when West Germany joined the United States and others in refusing to send teams to the 1980 Moscow Games.

""The Soviet army stayed nine long more years in Afghanistan after the boycott,"" said Bach, who as an athlete spokesman in 1980 failed to change the minds of German political leaders. ""It appears that today, some just do not want to learn anything from history.

""The only political effect the boycott of 1980 had, was to trigger the revenge boycott of the following (Los Angeles) Olympic Games,"" he said.

If Bach is re-elected unopposed as expected, a big challenge of his next term is likely to be the economic and social recovery of sports from the global health crisis.

In March, the IOC postponed this year's Tokyo Olympics for one year. Organizers confirmed Friday they had secured all the venues and the Athletes Village for next year. IOC members on Friday also ratified postponing the 2022 Dakar Youth Olympics in Senegal to 2026.

""Unfortunately, we are already seeing clear signs in some parts of the world that ΓÇª society and nations are driven by even more egoism and self-interest,"" Bach said. ""This leads to more confrontation and to the politicization of all aspects of life: culture, economy, health, science, humanitarian aid. Even the fight against doping is already being targeted.""

That comment appeared to criticize the United States after a government-funded study last month raised the possibility of withholding money from the World Anti-Doping Agency.

The IOC said its presidential election will be in ""spring 2021"" as members agreed to have two full meetings next year. The second is due to be in Tokyo on the sidelines of the Olympics.

Also Friday, the IOC elected five new members, including two-time Olympic champion Sebastian Coe of Britain, the president of World Athletics. The others are: former Olympic champion Maria Colon of Cuba; Princess Reema Bandar Al-Saud, Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United States; Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic, the former president of Croatia; and Battushig Batbold of Mongolia.

Two members, John Coates of Australia and Ser Miang Ng of Singapore, were elevated to IOC vice-president status, with seats on the executive board.

Two vacant seats on the 15-member board were won in elections by Mikaela Cojuangco Jaworski of the Philippines and Gerardo Werthein of Argentina, one of Bach's main allies.",[]

Liron Gertsman, a photographer and self-described “astronomy enthusiast” based in Vancouver, recently captured the speeding ball of ice and dust on two separate occasions.

The first night on July 12, Gertsman photographed the comet over English Bay in Vancouver for what he described as a “very ‘Vancouver’ landscape” image featuring the spectacle.

The next night, the 19-year-old photographer captured Comet NEOWISE again over Harrison Lake, located a short distance from Vancouver, but this time there was an extra special backdrop.

“I was treated to what might be a once in a lifetime event; the Aurora Borealis (Northern Lights) showed up, ‘photobombing’ my comet shot,” Gertsman said in an email to CTVNews.ca on Wednesday. “For about 30 minutes, the Aurora was visible to the naked eye, a very rare event at this latitude of just 49 degrees north.”

While the colours were hard to see, Gertsman said, the pillars of the Aurora Borealis were “clearly visible dancing across the northern sky.”

In order to enhance the photos’ vividness, Gertsman explained that he did some basic colour correction and adjusted the exposure, brightness, and contrast. He said the photos were taken using long exposures and star tracking, which he was able to do with a special tracking mount that compensates for the motion of the Earth and prevents “star trails” in these types of photos of the night sky.

“The result is more detail and colours than the naked eye can see, but all the data is captured in-camera,” he said. “This is a pretty standard workflow for much of the night sky pictures seen online (including most images you’ll see organizations like NASA post), especially those used for scientific purposes, as they help to show more detail.”

Speaking of NASA, the agency also shared a photo of the comet – also known as C/2020 F3 – as it soared above western Manitoba on Tuesday.

In that photo, taken by Donna Lach, the comet can be seen speeding across the night-filled sky with ribbons of colour from the Aurora Borealis just beneath it.

“I fought off mosquitoes as I waited for the never-ending dusk to show me what was in the sky. Finally, at about 11:30 p.m. CDT, the aurora and comet were both appearing, and I could see it was going to be epic,” she told NASA. “The large, thick band of aurora soon started to dance, showing brilliant blues and purples looking to the west.”

For anyone hoping to catch a glimpse of the comet for themselves, NASA has provided some tips on how to spot it in the night sky before it disappears in the coming weeks for another 6,800 years.",[]

Saturday morning, the couple took a closer look and realized the liquid was actually fresh honey.

""We've never heard any buzzing or anything,"" Andrea said. ""When we saw the stream coming down the wall, we just kind of worked our way up.""

Andrea said she made it to her bedroom window and looked outside where she found honeybees entering and exiting an opening along her roof.

""And I thought there we go, there's their front door,"" she said.

In a video posted on Facebook, Justin offered a comical homeowner's tutorial called ""How to tell if you have a bee issue.""

""We noticed these streaks coming down our wall and we could not figure out what it was,"" he said. ""So, with a very careful lick ...yup that's honey!""

The honey streams have traveled from the attic, through the second story, the main floor and now down to the basement, according to Andrea.

Allan Lattanzi, a general contractor and beekeeper for eight years, looked at the home Saturday and estimated the colony has anywhere from 20,000 to 30,000 bees.

""I think water got into the colony and washed the nectar out of the comb and made it more liquified and that's what was running down the wall,"" Lattanzi told CNN.

Andrea cleaned the honey from the floor to a midway point on the wall and said it doesn't seem to be a continuous stream.

She said her children think the stream is crazy and the family's dog certainly didn't seem to mind the fresh honey.

On Monday, Lattanzi will extract the colony from the Isabells' home and take it to the bee yard on his property.

""We know bees are endangered. We want to be able to save the colony and rehome them appropriately and carefully, but the damage done to the house to extract it was concerning,"" Andrea said.

During the assessment on Saturday, Andrea said Lattanzi estimates the repairs will cost about US$3,000 -- something she said her homeowner's insurance most likely won't cover.

""Right now, I feel mostly safe because the bees haven't gained access inside so they're just doing their thing and they're high up on the roof,"" Andrea said. ""No one has been stung, so I guess that's why I feel confident and calm.""",[]
62,62,62,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/lifestyle/are-sea-vegetables-the-future-of-produce-1.5027909,Are sea vegetables the future of produce?,,2020-07-16,"TORONTO -- As global warming transforms our planet and farmers search for sustainable ways to grow food, the answer may lie in the ocean.

Sea vegetables grow rapidly and require zero fresh water, and a team of researchers at Florida Atlantic University who studied the salt-loving plants are optimistic that they could be a game-changer in the way we shop for groceries.

“The wonderful thing about these is that you just need salt water,” Megan Davis, a professor of aquaculture at Florida Atlantic University, told CTV News Channel in an interview on Thursday.

Her team spent 10 weeks studying the optimal growing conditions for sea asparagus, sea purslane and saltwort. All three species are traditionally foraged in coastal countries in Europe and Asia but have yet to reach mainstream produce aisles in North America.

The researchers were able to grow more than 100 pounds of the plants in six tanks, a result they say proves the veggies are efficient growers. The plants, also known as halophytes, are also relatively low waste, with the average edible portion ranging from 55 per cent for the sea purslane to 72 per cent for the sea asparagus and 75 per cent for the saltwort.

Based on this, Davis says her team sees “quite a trend” for sea vegetables in the future.

“There are quite a number of people and restaurants who are very excited to include them as part of their menu,” she said.

Better yet, Davis says, the vegetables are tasty. She described sea asparagus as a saltier version of its terrestrial cousin. Plus, it’s loaded with nutrients.

“So what’s amazing about these sea vegetables is they have a lot of different minerals, because they’re taking the minerals from the sea, and sometimes terrestrial plants don’t have all of these same types of minerals. One thing that sea vegetables do have is a lot of iodine, which is very healthy for us.”

Mariculture — the cultivation of food from the sea — has long been touted as a major player in the search for sustainable food. Research suggests that the world will need to produce 50 to 70 per cent more food by 2050, and global warming has worsened drought conditions in many countries, making traditional farming approaches that rely on fresh water more challenging.

The World Bank Group has said seaweed production could represent “a transformational change in the global food security equation” and could also become a greater source of food for livestock.

Sea vegetables have been on foodies’ radars for years. In 2018, Dutch global insights platform Innova Market Insights predicted the “ocean garden” would become a major food trend.

Speciality grocery stores like Whole Foods and Thrive Market already stock a variety of sea vegetables, including seaweed, kelp and dulse, a chewy, red-leafed plant that can be added to salads and soups or eaten as a healthy snack.

In Japan, seaweed has long been a dietary staple and is traditionally used in sushi and salads. According to the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization, the seaweed industry was valued at about US$6 billion ($8.1 billion) in 2012.",[]

It wasn't your typical discharge, but Al Poirier isn't your typical patient.

Poirier was released 101 days after being taken by ambulance to the hospital.

""I was one of the lucky ones,"" said Poirier.

Al Poirier and his wife Deborah Poirier both tested positive for COVID-19 after returning from a cruise earlier this year.

While Deborah recovered from the virus at home, Al spent nearly seven weeks in a coma.

""It was really, it was the hardest time of my life,"" said Deborah Poirier. ""I was quarantined for 14 days when we got back and then we tested positive and I had to go in for another 14 days and he's in the hospital and they didn't think he was going to live.""

Doctors, too, were concerned about his outcome.

""He was very severe,"" said Dr. Marion Cornish. ""He was on a ventilator for almost seven weeks. He required tracheostomy quite early on and a very high level of care for many, many weeks. So he's probably the most severe of what we call, respiratory illness that we've seen here for sure.""

While Al was leaving the hospital, family and friends were waiting to surprise him.

Community members stood outside their own homes, along the road with signs, hoping to catch a glimpse.

""It's a very big day. I haven't seen him since Dec. 31, when I dropped him off at the airport, so it's gonna be exciting,"" said Jenifer Poirier, Al and Deborah's daughter.

He has lost 27 pounds since his family and friends last saw him. It's been a long and difficult few months, but the Poiriers are grateful for Al's recovery.

""It was a huge roller-coaster because there was one point where he didn't have any hope. The doctors didn't have any hope for him, so it's unbelievable that he has made his way home to us,"" said Jenifer Poirier.

""We're blessed,"" added Deborah Poirier. ""We had hundreds of people praying for him and we're just very blessed.""

""What Deb and everybody set up for me is just amazing and, the nurses at the hospital and all the doctors, they were lined up right from hall to hall. I couldn't believe it,"" said Al Poirier.

Now that Al's back at home, the couple is already looking forward to the future.

""I'm planning our next trip. When everything calms down, you know. We're going,"" said Deborah Poirier.",[]

But if you keep your eyes and ears open, you just might stumble upon something – or someone – memorable.

On the corner of Vancouver’s busy Granville Street for example, you’ll find Marcel Greer playing his electric guitar for anyone and everyone.

Greer is a 42-year-old street performer who came to British Columbia from Manitoba’s Chemawawin Cree Nation.

He’s also a self-taught musician.

Greer – whose stage-name is Maverick Rayne– can now play almost any musical genre. “I studied bits of pieces from classical music. I studied bits and pieces from jazz,” he told CTV News. “I just try to work all sorts of different techniques into my playing.”

With a personal style that includes fast moving fingers that travel up and down the neck of his guitar, his performance is a captivating sight for those who stop and listen.

Tonight on @CTVNationalNews , we take you to the corner of #Robson and #Granville in #Vancouver where a street performer is making music for no other reason than to put a smile on people’s faces.@BigMaddMav the story is on tonight !

From time to time people will give him a couple of coins for his efforts. But even on days when not a whole lot is left in Greer’s guitar case, he finds comfort knowing his music will lift people’s spirits.

“I enjoy doing it. I enjoy playing,” Greer said. “For people who are out and about that might be having a bad day.”",[]

Holland America Line made the announcement after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Thursday extended a ban on cruises in U.S. waters until the end of September to limit the spread of COVID-19, KING-TV reported.

Holland America is selling the Amsterdam, Maasdam, Rotterdam and Veendam, which reduces its fleet to 10, the company said. All cruises booked on the ships will be cancelled or changed.

Seattle anticipated a record 1.2 million visitors this year, but the pandemic left countries questioning the safety of allowing potentially contagious passengers to disembark.

“Compared to last summer, it was crowds of people walking through shoulder to shoulder, now it's not that at all,” said Ngozi Archbold, working at the Pappardelle's pasta stand in Pike Place Market. “Just like two to three people walking in groups.”

Shops and restaurants, like Pappardelle's pasta stand, have struggled since businesses have relied on tourists for income.

“Back in March, our city and industry could not have imagined how long the COVID pandemic would affect travel globally,” Visit Seattle CEO Tom Norwalk said.

“It is now apparent that recovery will take years. For Seattle, losing the cruise industry for this year adds to the anxiety of our industry and the many small businesses that were hoping for at least a partial cruise season,” he said.

The cruise industry brings in $900 million annually and each vessel brings with it $4.2 million in regional economic activity, the Port of Seattle said.

The Toronto-based theatre chain says workers in Canada and the U.S. are impacted by the cuts, which includes senior executives due to retire.

Cineplex says it is confident its business will recover from the COVID-19 closures but in the short- and medium-term it will focus on a smaller number of projects and priorities.

It is in the process of reopening many of its theatres that closed as the pandemic began to spread and is implementing distanced seating, reservations and additional cleanings.

Cineplex is also suing U.K.-based Cineworld Group PLC, which was due to purchase Cineplex for $2.8 billion, but walked away from the deal because of alleged material adverse effects and breaches of contract.

Cineplex has denied the claims and says Cineworld is backing away from the deal because of buyer's remorse.

67,67,67,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/business/women-s-participation-in-labour-force-reaches-lowest-level-in-three-decades-rbc-1.5026910,Women's participation in labour force reaches lowest level in three decades: RBC,'Tara Deschamps',2020-07-16,"TORONTO -- The COVID-19 pandemic has pushed women's participation in the labour force down to its lowest level in three decades and rebounding won't be easy, says a new study from the Royal Bank of Canada.

The report Thursday shows 1.5 million Canadian women lost their jobs in the first two months of the pandemic and says women accounted for about 45 per cent of the decline in hours worked over the downturn, but will only make up 35 per cent of the recovery.

RBC deputy chief economist Dawn Desjardins said women are being hardest hit because they tend to work in industries -- hospitality and food services, retail trade, educational services, health care and social assistance -- most affected by closures, earnings losses and layoffs.

""In March in April, it was kind of evenly split between men and women with both having about 1.5 million (job losses), but it's in the reopening where we have started to see a divergence,"" Desjardins said.

""Men are already being rehired as certain industries get back on their feet, whereas women have been rehired, but that gap is bigger because there is still one million fewer women working.""

Women are also impacted because they shoulder more childcare responsibilities than their male counterparts and may have to refuse work or seek a reduction in hours if students don't go back to school in the fall or go back part-time, Desjardins said.

Employment among women with toddlers or school-aged children fell seven per cent between February and May, compared with a four per cent decrease for fathers of children the same age.

Single mothers with a toddler or school-aged child saw their employment drop 12 per cent between February and June, compared with a seven per cent decrease for single fathers.

It's a stark contrast to prior recessions, when men were significantly more likely than women to be laid off.

RBC said in prior recessions, from the early 80s to the 2008 financial crisis, men were significantly more likely than women to be laid off.

In the downturn due to the financial crisis, the unemployment rate for men was more than 2.5 per cent higher than that of women and when the recovery came women's participation in the labour force rebounded to its highest level as the participation of men was declining.

Desjardins said prior recessions hit the male-dominated goods market more than the female-dominated service market, which has faced the brunt of COVID-19.

During this recession, RBC said one-third of women who lost jobs between February and June did not seek work, putting them at higher risk of long term job-separation and future wage penalties.

Jennifer Hargreaves has heard about these struggles constantly since COVID-19 started spreading across Canada.

""The things I've been hearing in the community are things like 'I might have to quit my job. How am I supposed to look for work right now when we don't even know who's got flexible workplaces and we don't know what childcare is going to look like?"" said Hargreaves, who runs Tellent, an organization that helps professional women find flexible work opportunities.

Many women have reduced their hours because their partner earns more and they need a way to look after their kids -- a situation Hargreaves faces in her own home.

Others, she said, have been laid off and haven't begun the job hunt because of the uncertainty the pandemic has fostered.

She worries about these women because, she says, ""any time you take more of an extended break in your job search, you can lose your network, your connections and your confidence.""

For Hargreaves, one of the most scary parts of women's drop in participation in the labour force is that ""there's no end in sight.""

""Not a lot of employers are talking about what flexibility is gonna look like. We don't know what school is gonna look like,"" she said.

""It's just that uncertainty of not knowing and not having clarity or communication that makes it exhausting and really hard to plan.""

But it was investor disappointment in the outlook for new subscribers that helped drive down the stock 9% to $480.70 in after-hours trading.

Sarandos, who joined Netflix over 20 years ago, will also join the Netflix board of directors. ""Ted has been my partner for decades. This change makes formal what was already informal -- that Ted and I share the leadership of Netflix,"" said Hastings in a statement.

In a post-earnings video conference, Hastings nonetheless said he plans to stay with the company for the next decade and added the setup means the pair will serve as ""full-time"" executives, rather than two part-time CEOs splitting the role.

The company picked up 10.1 million worldwide subscribers during the April-June period, more than triple what it usually adds in that period.

The increase announced Thursday with Netflix's second-quarter earnings eclipsed the gain of 8.3 million subscribers projected among analysts polled by FactSet. Netflix ended June with 193 million worldwide subscribers, including 70 million in the U.S. and Canada, its largest geographic market.

Nearly 26 million of those subscribers have joined Netflix during the first six months of this year -- more than double the number compared with last year -- as the pandemic curtailed travel and even nights out on the town. The restrictions have turned out to be a boon for Netflix, which also faces a slew of new streaming competitors such as Disney Plus and HBO Max.

Netflix Inc., however, said its subscriber growth has begun to slow following the ""initial shock of Covid and social restrictions"" after it added just 2 million fewer customers in the past six months as it did for all of 2019. It forecasts just 2.5 million new additions for the current quarter.

The pandemic has shut down Hollywood, limiting the ability of TV and movie studios to produce more entertainment to feed Netflix and other video streaming services. That could limit their appeal if viewers run out of new things to watch. Netflix said Thursday that it is slowly resuming production, mostly in Asia and Europe, and its 2020 lineup remains intact. Shooting delays mean big shows and movies slated for next year will come out more in the second half of 2021.

People spending more time at home due to the pandemic has ""massively accelerated the shift"" from traditional TV to streaming video,"" said eMarketer analyst Eric Haggstrom in an email. That bodes well for Netflix, the streaming pioneer. ""Even as lockdowns are relaxed and new competitors begin to scale their services, Netflix will extend its lead as the first stop for entertainment."" He predicts that Netflix will get one-third of streaming subscribers globally in 2020.

The Los Gatos, California, company's extraordinary expansion helped Netflix earn $720 million on revenue of $6.15 billion during the second quarter.

Investors have been betting the pandemic will make Netflix more popular than ever. Since public health experts officially declared the pandemic on March 11, Netflix's stock has soared by 50%.

But the new rules, contained in the government's final strategic assessment on climate change released Thursday, are not the all-encompassing climate test environment groups had been hoping to see.

Environment Minister Jonathan Wilkinson said the plan will ensure Canada's goal to exceed its Paris climate agreement targets by 2030 and then hit net zero by 2050.

""Net zero"" means any greenhouse gases emitted are absorbed by natural or mechanical means, rather than left to amass in the atmosphere where they contribute to global warming.

""We made a commitment in 2015, and implemented in the last mandate, of better rules for assessing large projects,"" Wilkinson said. ""Today what we're doing is providing clarity to project proponents.""

The Impact Assessment Act was passed before the last election to overhaul how federal environmental assessments are done. A long list of projects, from mines and power lines to wind farms, airports, and pipelines, automatically require those assessments. The environment minister can also insist a federal assessment be done even on some projects not on that list.

In addition to putting time constraints on the review periods, including Indigenous expertise and consultation in the process, and adding a pre-review consultation process, the Impact Assessment Act for the first time will include a project's effect on climate change as one of the considerations.

The report released Thursday outlines how that will happen. It requires project proposals to include the greenhouse-gas emissions to be produced from construction and operations and what efforts are being made to minimize emissions.

For any project that will still be operating in 2050, a plan to get to net zero is also required.

""It is important that the assessment of projects is consistent with Canada's commitment to achieving a net-zero future by 2050,"" said Wilkinson.

""Which, as I say, reinforces the message that the government has been saying that climate change is real, it's important, we need to address it.""

A net-zero plan will be one of the enforceable conditions put on a project if it is approved, but there are no details about how such a plan would be measured or enforced.

Julia Levin, the climate and energy program manager at Environmental Defence, said she is disappointed with the rules. Not only do they fail to put any specific requirements for projects to be in line with Canada's 2030 climate goals, the new rules only require projects that will operate after 2050 to have those net-zero plans.

""This is not a climate test,"" she said.

Levin said under these rules a coal mine that wants to operate for the next 25 years could contribute emissions to the atmosphere for a quarter-century and not have to show a plan for reducing emissions.

She also noted that there is nothing requiring an assessment of the emissions that will be produced downstream -- like when oil in a new oilsands mine is refined and burned to drive cars, or when coal is burned to make electricity.

Wilkinson is in the midst of reconsidering whether to order a federal assessment of the proposed Vista coal mine expansion in Alberta, which is producing coal entirely for export.

He said Thursday there is some merit to considering the global impacts of exporting coal from Canada and an assessment of thermal coal as a whole is underway to determine if Canada should adjust how it assesses new coal projects.

""There is a legitimate question about the future of thermal coal in this country,"" said Wilkinson.

But he said the climate-change assessment is not requiring reports on what emissions Canadian-made products may create in other countries because those emissions are the responsibility of the nation where they are produced.

The new assessment rules apply to new projects beginning the review process.

It is happening albeit slower then we would have liked but provinces across the country are gradually getting the green light to return to work.

However for some small business owners it isn't as easy as putting the sign in the window, ""open for business."" According to the Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB) more than a quarter are reporting some of the laid-off workers have refused to come back to work, and many say the reason is that workers prefer to stay on the Canada Emergency Response Benefit.

Staffing is a challenge. Some of the findings from the recent survey found 62% would prefer to stay on the CERB then work. While 47% still remain concerned about their health and what is a problem for many – child-care obligations are creating a barrier for 27% who might otherwise be back in the office, according to the results. The survey was opened on July 3 and the results were pulled on July 6 with 3,816 people taking the survey in that time period.

The CERB was an emergency relief benefit for workers who lost their job due to the pandemic and never intended to be a cash windfall for a summer season. The CERB may well come to an end this fall with the hope we shift Canadians safely from the CERB to employers who embrace the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) to eventually unsubsidized employment. We aren't there yet but in order for Canada to get back to any sense of normal we need Canadians to go back to work.

There will be no recovery if Canadians aren't working.

It is one thing to simply want to collect a benefit it is another thing for those wanting to return yet who are unable to due to lack of childcare.

As the government looks to ways to support Canadians, child-care requirements and school reopenings need, in my opinion, to move closer to the top of the agenda. Children, caregivers and teachers need to be safe while getting back a sense of structure, socialization and orientation to their day. Only then are parents going to feel comfortable returning to work. We need those parents back in the workforce and those I spoken to have been torn between conflicting demands of home schooling and care and workplace challenges.

For those who have valid reasons for not returning to work, changes to the current programs will be necessary as the economy reopens. For those without valid reasons. it is time to come back to work.",[]

Jerome Nycz, the executive vice-president at Montreal-based BDC Capital, says in a statement that the money will help companies enable commercialization, increase competitiveness and expand globally.

He says the goal of the entrepreneur-focused bank is to lead by example and inspire like-minded stakeholders to support more companies and make Canada a leader in IP.

BDC's new coffers will provide financing in the form of a sub-debt, convertible debt and equity to accelerate commercialization.

The fund will target scaling companies in knowledge-based industries with rich IP portfolios including patents, design, and trade secrets and at least $1 million in annual revenue.

According to a 2017 study from U.S. intellectual property merchant bank Ocean Tomo, 83 per cent of the value of S&P 500 companies came from tangible assets in 1975, but in 2015, it shifted to 84 per cent of value coming from intangible assets like IP.

In a statement to CTV News Toronto, Nissan Canada said its dealership in Newmarket used the ""publicly available stock advertising image"" for a flyer but it has since been removed.

Shaking hands has been discouraged by health officials since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic because it can easily help spread the virus.

""We have contacted the dealership and they are removing it from their store immediately given the conflicting message and inappropriateness of the image,"" Nissan Canada said. ""This was not intentional and the dealer has apologized for their actions.""

The ad wasn't pulled from the dealership before it caught the attention of some people, who dubbed it a ""marketing fail.""

Nissan Canada said all COVID-19 precautions like physical distancing and sanitation processes are in place in their showroom and service areas.

Growing pharmaceutical sales, also in the U.S., helped the world's biggest health products maker counter damage from the pandemic, which forced patients to delay surgeries.

Worldwide medical device sales fell 34% in the quarter to $4.29 billion, but company leaders told analysts on Thursday morning that the segment's performance got better each month in the quarter.

""We are seeing signs of recovery and while the next few months and quarters contain uncertainty, the long-term underlying fundamentals remain solid,"" Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk said.

J&J's medical device segment is vulnerable to economic downturns because many of its products are for elective surgeries like hip and knee replacements that can be postponed. Plus the virus forced hospitals to halt scheduled surgeries, and fear of catching COVID-19 kept many patients away from hospitals.

Customers also bought fewer skin health and beauty products, and that hurt J&J's consumer health business, which saw worldwide revenue fall 7% to $3.3 billion in the quarter.

But the company's pharmaceutical sales grew nearly 6% in the U.S. and 2% globally. The immune disorder drug Stelara and cancer drugs Darzalex and Imbruvica helped that segment.

Overall net income fell 35% to $3.63 billion for the New Brunswick, New Jersey, based maker of baby shampoo and biologic drugs. Adjusted earnings totalled $1.67 per share. Total revenue also fell 11% to $18.34 billion.

Industry analysts expected J&J to take a bigger hit from the pandemic, having projected per-share earnings of $1.49, and $17.61 billion in revenue.

J&J on Thursday said it expects 2020 earnings of $7.75 to $7.95 per share. That comes a few months after the company surprised investors by cutting its profit forecast for the year by about 15% and slashing its sales forecast because of the pandemic.

The new forecast tops Wall Street expectations on the top end. But it still falls short of the earnings of $9 per share or more that J&J predicted at the start of the year.

Analyst surveyed by FactSet are projecting per-share earnings of $7.75 per share.

Company leaders said Thursday that they expect to start human testing next week on a potential COVID-19 vaccine. They plan to start a study July 22 in Belgium and then expand to the U.S. the next week.

They hope to start a late-stage clinical trial, the final phase before a drugmaker seeks regulatory approval, in late September.

There are nearly two dozen possible COVID-19 vaccines in various stages of testing around the world.

75,75,75,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/who-s-hiring-a-look-at-the-canadian-job-market-1.5022260,Where the jobs are: Some sectors rebounding faster as Canada emerges from lockdown,'Ryan Flanagan',2020-07-13,"TORONTO -- Jobs lost during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic are coming back – but not all at once, and not in the same order they disappeared.

Statistics Canada reported July 10 that more than 950,000 jobs were added in the country in June. While only a small fraction of the three million or so positions that were lost as lockdowns were imposed in March and April, the number represents a record increase as those measures are lifted.

""There's a lot of places that are still hiring amidst all the doom and gloom that we've been experiencing over the past few months,"" Carolyn Levy, president of the technologies division of staffing and recruitment agency Randstad Canada, told CTVNews.ca on Monday via telephone from Calgary.

Breaking down the numbers by industry yields clues into where the first wave of rebound hiring is taking place. More than 20 per cent of the added jobs were classified as wholesale and retail trade – with 16 per cent in accommodation and food services, 12 per cent in health care and social assistance, and eight per cent apiece in construction and manufacturing.

This suggests that the retail and restaurant workers who were among the first to be let go when their establishments were ordered to close were also among the first to be hired back when limited activity was allowed to resume.

There is still a long way to go before those sectors can be back to normal, though. In food services alone, it is believed that 400,000 Canadian jobs eliminated during the pandemic have yet to return. Many businesses in the broader service sector say they do not expect to ever return to pre-pandemic staffing levels.

Also notable, StatCan found, is that there were more wholesale jobs in Canada in June than there were in February, before the pandemic hit. Levy chalked this increase up to the surge in online shopping, which has left companies needing extra staff in warehouses and other parts of the supply chain.

On manufacturing, Levy said the increase could be due to companies retooling their lines to produce personal protective equipment or other items suddenly in demand due to the pandemic.

EMPLOYERS RETHINKING OLD ROLES

For the nearly 2.5 million Canadians who remain unemployed, though, knowing where hiring has recently happened only paints part of the picture. More helpful is information about where hiring is happening now.

According to the federal government's job bank, the most in-demand jobs right now are sales associates, administrative assistants and customer service representatives, followed by truck drivers, general farm workers and light-duty cleaners.

A popular website used by job-seekers to connect with employers is seeing similar patterns. Brendon Bernard, an economist with the Indeed Hiring Lab, wrote July 7 that retail and customer service jobs are among those that saw the biggest drop in new postings on Indeed earlier in the pandemic, and have since seen some of the biggest rebounds.

""Sectors narrowing the gap relatively quickly in recent weeks include ones featuring lower-paying positions, like retail, and customer service,"" he wrote.

""Areas posting roles with many mid-wage jobs have also seen noticeable bounce-backs, like construction, as well as education and instruction.""

Levy said that some employers are also creating new roles as they look to respond to their customers' needs during and after the pandemic. Opportunities created by this include more positions for financial advisers, she said, as well as an even greater demand for tech workers.

Postings on Indeed for higher-paying jobs have been slower to bounce back, Bernard said. Indeed has tracked two categories where new job postings have fallen off since early May – security and public safety, and aviation.

Bernard reported that the number of new job postings on Indeed as of July 3 was 21 per cent lower than it had been one year earlier. That gap had been as large as 70 per cent in mid-April. Smaller provinces, which have generally been less affected by COVID-19, have kept job posting levels closer to where they were in 2019 than larger provinces.

Levy said she is seeing employers increasingly show interest in hiring for temporary contract positions. This benefits them because it allows them to avoid making long-term commitments in an uncertain environment, she said, but can also be good for those looking for jobs because it gives them a chance to find work that they might not otherwise have.

""Companies have had to take a step back and start to reimagine how they have to work in this new normal,"" she said.

""Businesses have to look at what do we need to do to reskill, what do we need to do to retrain, given the way we operated our business four months ago is not the way it's going to be … from now on.""",[]

This marks the second extension of the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS). On May 15, the government added an additional 12 weeks to the program, extending eligibility to August 29.

""For the last three months, you’ve seen me come out to talk with Canadians about what we’re doing to help you and your family, your employer, your local businesses deal with this pandemic. We’re going to continue to do that vital work,"" said Trudeau during a press briefing outside Rideau Cottage in Ottawa.

Announced on March 27, the CEWS provides qualifying businesses and non-profits funding for 75 per cent of employee wages, retroactive from March 15.

The objective of the program is to keep employees on the payroll so businesses can rebound more quickly when restrictions are lifted and the economy restarts. The CEWS had a slow uptake, but has increased in popularity as more Canadians transition off of the Canada Emergency Response Benefit.

In an interview on CTV’s Question Period in May, Employment Minister Carla Qualtrough attributed the program’s rocky start to barriers in the application process.

""It’s been slower than expected. I think businesses are having to put a lot of time and effort into their applications because you have to dig into your payroll – who earned what and when,"" she said.

Since then, the government has been consulting with the business community and promoting its benefit amid calls from opposition that the Liberal’s are disincentivizing Canadians from returning to work as CERB application numbers balloon.

As of July 5, just under 19 million Canadians had applied for the benefit and more than $54 billion had been paid out.

The new $82. 3 billion CEWS projection, outlined in last Wednesday’s fiscal snapshot, is a stark increase from the original $45 billion estimate.

As of July 6, 581,800 out of a total of 587, 060 submissions had been approved. This equates to slightly more than $18 billion.",[]

For many families the thought of discussing money can make them uneasy and is often a taboo subject. In fact, this conversation doesn't discriminate -- wealthy, poor, young or old no one likes to open themselves up and share their financial situation, especially if it is challenging.

Money is deeply personal and can influence our lives in so many ways.

Families are finding this out first-hand as the pandemic has hit the bottom line and parents are struggling. One or both parents may find themselves laid off permanently or temporarily and while the government aid can help pay the bills and keep a roof over their head today these same parents who may have in the past been able to afford to say ""yes"" to their children are now finding themselves having to say ""no"" financially. And that is ok.

There are going to be opportunities during this pandemic that are going to force us to change and this may be one of them.

Here are a few ideas that may help.

Begin a honest conversation with your children about how you are feeling and where you stand financially. They may not appreciate the numbers but I have found the more you respect their ability to grasp a situation the quicker they embrace it. Include your children in big purchases. I recall having a conversation with our children about a family vacation. With four teenagers in high school and one computer they responded,""we don't really need a vacation but we do need a second computer."" The vacation didn't happen. It is ok to say no to your children even if you can afford to say yes financially. To the extent you can replicate real life the better your children will be when they embark on their own journey. We clearly don't always get want we when we want all the time and neither should they. I know this sounds a little like tough love but it is a great lesson in living below your means that will stick with them. Encourage your children to set financial goals that excite them. They absolutely will not save money for something that excites you. I learned this first-hand when when our daughter got her first part-time job and I thought great you can tuck a little money away for university. Trust me that wasn't on her agenda. Also try to resist the temptation of telling them how to spend their money. It is their money. Yes they will make mistakes but that is ok it is all part of the process. Talk about the difference between investing in your children - helping to fund their education and bailing them out when they run up a credit card bill they can't afford to pay. I'm not suggesting you don't help them out. I would however, ensure they pay you back. Owning the problem can be a game changer. Our son received a notification from CRA highlighting a tax bill he wasn't expecting. He said to me, ""How did you let this happen?"" My response,"" I didn't get you into this situation - you did."" He paid the bill and has never been in that position again. These are difficult times and families are coming together. Just like your salary maybe a moratorium on allowances has to be put into place. That's ok. It can be a temporary situation. However, this doesn't mean everyone should still pitch in. It means maybe we all have to do a little more for less.

When children contribute something to the household regardless of your financial situation it can be a great accomplishment for them as well as you. Now more than ever we need to pull together.",[]
78,78,78,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/the-challenge-of-our-lifetime-federal-deficit-to-hit-343-billion-this-year-1.5015467,'The challenge of our lifetime': Federal deficit to hit $343 billion this year,'Rachel Aiello',2020-07-08,"OTTAWA -- The federal deficit is projected to hit $343.2 billion this fiscal year, due in large part to massive economic aid and stimulus plans—that are on-par with Second World War level spending— that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government has rolled out in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

The deficit projection released Wednesday is up dramatically from the latest pre-pandemic economic update in December 2019, which pegged the deficit at $28.1 billion in 2020-21.

In addition to direct government spending, the new figures in the government’s fiscal snapshot show the negative impact the global pandemic has had on the economy.

Citing the “extraordinary borrowing” the federal government is currently engaged in, the government says the federal debt will exceed $1.2 trillion by the end of the fiscal year, up from $765 billion in the previous fiscal year.

With unemployment rates set to remain high into next year, the government is also projecting a $71.1-billion decline in tax revenue, including a $40.8-billion loss in income taxes.

“This spending level is on par with, but lower than the peak deficit (as a per cent of GDP) experienced by Canada during the Second World War. This is truly the challenge of our lifetime. As temporary investment measures come to an end and GDP recovers over time, deficits are expected to retreat,” reads the snapshot, in part.

In total, the federal government has spent more than $231 billion in health and safety measures as well as on direct aid to Canadians and businesses over the course of the pandemic so far.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau unveiled the revised economic picture inside the House of Commons, which is gathered for a special sitting. He spoke about how this current fiscal situation is an opportunity for Canada to rebuild and reshape the economy.

“We need to invest in an economy that is greener and more diverse,” Morneau said. “This pandemic has identified clear gaps and it’s giving us a chance to reset. We witnessed the ways in which people were falling through the cracks… In the coming months, we will need to come to these problems with dedication, compassion, and ingenuity.”

During a press conference with reporters during a largely virtual “lockup,” ahead of tabling the 168-page snapshot, Morneau called the pandemic “an enormous shock to our system.”

“We faced an enormous shock to our system,” Morneau told reporters. “It’s hard to know where we will be in a month, two months, or six months. What we know for sure, is that if Canadians work together, we can continue on what we've seen as a month-by-month improvement of our situation, and our economic outcomes will be related to our success working together on our on our health challenges.”

He also suggested a silver lining in regards to Canada’s increased debt-to-GDP ratio. With current public debt charges at around one per cent of GDP, the cost to service the now ballooning debt is actually $4 billion lower this year than expected, given the historically low borrowing rates.

Due to the COVID-19 spending, the federal government now projects its debt-to-GDP ratio will rise to 49.1 per cent in 2020-21. In the pre-pandemic December economic update, Canada’s debt-to-GDP ratio was at 30.9 per cent and was projected to remain on track to reduce incrementally over the next few years.

“Even after our historic investments, Canada will continue to hold its low-debt advantage. This, combined with historically low interest rates, gave us the balance sheet to deploy our fiscal firepower to support Canadians through this,” Morneau said, though noted that his and likely future governments will have to face up to the deficit.

SHARPEST DROP SINCE GREAT DEPRESSION

The government is emphasizing the “challenge of a generation” that the COVID-19 pandemic is posing, and noted the serious and ongoing impacts. Over the last few months, federal job numbers have already showed 5.5 million Canadians are either out of work, or have lost wages; and a growing list of businesses are set to shutter their doors permanently.

Citing economists, in the snapshot the government says the overall economy is expected to contract by 6.8 per cent in 2020, which is its sharpest drop since the Great Depression, before rebounding by 5.5 per cent in 2021.

Based on forecasts by more than a dozen private sector economists, the government is projecting an unemployment rate of 9.8 per cent in 2020 and 7.8 per cent in 2021.

All of this is contingent on how the ongoing health crisis is managed, the government notes throughout the snapshot, emphasizing the economy’s health is largely in the hands of Canadians’ efforts to stave off a second wave of the novel coronavirus.

The snapshot also includes several scenarios for future economic outlooks, depending on what happens with the pandemic, from a gradual but uneven recovery to a virus resurgence scenario which would result in a “deeper and longer-lasting negative impact on the economy.”

While the government optimistically believes the worst of the economic impact is behind us, it will be a long time before a rebound, even under the most positive pandemic scenario that would see a vaccine discovered within the year.

Speaking to reporters in advance of the revised economic picture being made public, Trudeau said that the situation would have been much worse had the federal government not brought in massive aid measures.

“When the pandemic first hit, a lot of people lost their jobs overnight. They didn't know how they were going to feed their families, or pay their bills. Faced with this unprecedented challenge our government had two options: We could sit back and let Canadians fend for themselves... or we could swiftly and substantially choose to support Canadians. We chose to support Canadians,” Trudeau said.

MORE THAN $230 BILLION SPENT

The report — which is not a federal budget or a fiscal update — shows that, since March, the federal government has spent more than $231 billion on health and safety measures as well as direct aid to Canadians and businesses.

Though, the government cautioned in the document that the cost estimates for many of the aid programs have been “difficult to establish, given that they are brand new programs, launched in a highly volatile economic environment,” and said further updates will come as the data comes in.

Of that figure, $19.8 billion is considered spending for health and safety measures, and includes the $14 billion earmarked to go to the provinces and territories for their “safe restart” plans. The direct support totals $212.2 billion and includes the suite of emergency response aid programs, as well as the support for local community organizations on the front lines of delivering key services to Canadians.

It also details the cost of a range of non-COVID-19 policy actions taken by the federal government since the 2019 economic update, which in total for the 2020-21 fiscal year amounts to just over $9 billion.

The government says the pandemic aid spending — on everything from support for seniors and farmers, to stocking up on personal protective equipment and vaccine development — is “the most comprehensive and substantial peacetime investment in Canada’s history.”

The biggest-ticket items to date, which the government said could still evolve over time, include:

The $2,000-a-month Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB), which nearly 8.2 million Canadians have applied for, totalling $53.5 in aid payments but an overall estimated budget of $80 billion;

The 75-per-cent emergency wage subsidy, which has seen 252,370 unique applicants and $18.1 billion spent. Though, the program is expected to be reworked in some way soon, as the CERB nears end of its course, and as a result the government is projecting in the end it will end up costing $82.3 billion to pay employers to keep staff on;

The Canada Emergency Student Benefit, which provides $1,250 a month to most eligible students, more to those with dependents. To date $1.4 billion has been paid out to more than 600,000 applicants; and

The Canada Emergency Business Account, which offers businesses loans of up to $40,000. According to the new figures, 688,000 applicants have received these loans, totaling $27.4 billion.

As well, in an effort to buoy businesses big and small, in addition to the direct spending offered, the federal government has made available $600 billion in liquidity and government-guaranteed loans which Morneau has said he hopes will bridge key job creators in this country to better times. This included $85 billion in tax and customs duty payment deferrals, to help companies free up some of their funding for other expenses.

In his Commons remarks, he notes that nearly nine out of every 10 dollars in COVID-19 aid delivered to Canadians and businesses is financed by the federal government.

The snapshot also looks at how Canada’s economic response compares to that of other countries, and outlines the plummet that consumer confidence and mobility trends have taken over the last four months.

PBO 'SCARED AND DISAPPOINTED'

In an interview on CTV News Channel reacting to the news, Parliamentary Budget Officer Yves Giroux said he was “scared and disappointed,” after seeing the snapshot.

The deficit is almost $100 billion larger than his office estimated the deficit was on track to hit $256 billion this fiscal year.

“We still don't have any sense of what is the government's game plan to get the Canadian economy back on track again,” Giroux said. “It's a much bigger deficit than even I expected, and that's why it's really scary to see these big numbers.”

He is calling on the federal government to look at ways to rework the Employment Insurance program to help those who have maxed out their benefits but remain out of work due to no fault of their own, as several industries are set to take months longer than others to rebound.

The snapshot includes information from the Canadian Federation of Independent Business that shows that while the construction, agriculture, manufacturing and personal services sectors are closer to being considered fully open, large portions of the hospitality, arts and recreation, social services, retail, and real estate sectors will take a lot longer before the majority of businesses are fully open for business.

Today’s snapshot comes after opposition parties and economists called for a look at the federal books, and after resisting a more robust update, the government now says it is planning to release a larger fiscal outlook in the fall.

The overall economic numbers are the first offered by the federal government since the December 2019 update, which was the only one since the Liberal formed a minority government in the last election.

They are limited to the current picture within this fiscal year, ending March 31, 2021, given further predictions could be inaccurate given the ongoing volatility, according to the government.

The 2020 federal budget date was scheduled to be March 30, but that was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic surging at the time.

OPPOSITION REACT TO 'DIRE' PICTURE

Reacting to the figures in the House of Commons, outgoing Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer called the snapshot “an extremely dire picture,” and criticized the government for lacking a plan to get Canada’s economy back on stable footing.

“Coming out of the pandemic, every single country on the planet will be desperately competing for the same opportunities and the same investments, so where is the prime minister’s plan to set us apart?” Scheer said.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh is now calling on the federal government to look to offshore tax havens to drum up revenue to try to offset the ballooning debt and deficit, as well as imposing a “wealth tax” to raise revenue.

“Let’s ask the wealthiest to bear the brunt of the pandemic, not the families and the working people who are struggling to get by,” Singh said.

Green Party Parliamentary Leader Elizabeth May called on the government to move on the promised aid for people with disabilities that has been caught up in procedural limbo and has yet to be implemented, despite being promised several weeks ago.

It’s likely to now be a years-long endeavour to navigate Canada out of the red. While the fiscal snapshot includes a chapter on the government’s debt-management strategy, given the limited time frame the document covers, there is no plan to return to balance included.",[]

According to new figures sent to CTVNews.ca by the CBSA, 10,329 U.S. citizens have been turned away from our shared border between March 22 and July 12. More than a quarter of them were barred from entering after revealing they were coming to Canada to sightsee, despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

While half of the U.S. citizens were turned back for “other” reasons, which the CBSA did not expand on, a little over 2,700 citizens had to turn back when they said they were hoping to cross the border for ""tourism"" or ""sightseeing."" More than 1,200 were rejected after revealing their trip was recreational in nature.

More than 500 Americans were sent back home after they said they were coming to Canada to shop, despite physical distancing measures that have prevented Canadians themselves from frequenting their own retail stores.

Canada shut its borders to foreigners in mid-March, initially exempting U.S. residents from the new rules. But within days the Canada-U.S. border had also shuttered to all non-essential travel, an agreement that sources told CTV News on Tuesday would be extended to August 21.

The current agreement has exemptions in place for the flow of trade and commerce, as well as temporary foreign workers and vital health-care workers such as nurses who live and work on opposite sides of the border. However, tourists and cross-border visits remain prohibited.

It’s not just Americans who have been turned away.

From March 22 to July 12, more than 800 non-U.S. foreign nationals were turned away at various ports of entry because they were hoping to do some shopping in Canada. More than 500 were turned away because their visit to Canada was for tourism, sightseeing or recreational purposes.

""All persons arriving in Canada at an air, land, marine or rail border will be asked about the purpose of their visit and whether they are feeling ill or unwell,"" CBSA spokesperson Rebecca Purdy said in a statement emailed to CTVNews.ca.

However, despite these efforts, some U.S. citizens have made their way across the border and been fined in Canada after failing to follow public health rules. A Florida couple was issued provincial offence notices and each received a $1,000 fine after they entered Canada in Fort Erie to attend a seasonal property on July 3. The two did not comply with the 14-day period of self-isolation after entering the country.

Another American couple, who entered Canada on June 24 near Thunder Bay, Ont., were also fined for breaking quarantine rules. They were spotted multiple times in an Ontario town, despite being told to isolate for 14 days upon their arrival.

While there is an exemption allowing Americans to travel through Canada to reach Alaska, some U.S. citizens have been caught using this loophole to break Canadian rules. The Alberta RCMP issued six tickets to American travellers who decided to stop near Lake Louise for long hikes in the park in mid-June.

According to Deputy Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Howard Njoo, most travellers arriving in Canada have been willing to play by the rules. However, he had a message during his Tuesday press conference for those who are considering breaking COVID-19 precautions.

""If you are coming from outside of Canada, please understand all of the efforts that Canadians have done inside of Canada to flatten the curve and to make sure that the transmission of the virus is as low as possible,"" Njoo said.

""Please do your part.""

A massive rainstorm hit Edmonton Thursday night and caused water damage to a number of public and private buildings, Mayor Don Iveson said Friday.

Videos circulating social media during the storm showed water pouring into Rogers Place and pooling on the floor of the 104 Avenue entrance.

Oilers Entertainment Group determined ""the damage experienced from last evening's rainstorm was due to significant water flow, mixed with hail, which led to excess pressure on the facility's storm drainage system causing two pipe couplings to fail.""

One of the pipe couplings that failed is located above the terminus of Ford Hall, OEG said. That area, which the videos show, suffered the most damage.

Iveson called the images ""very concerning"" but assured Edmontonians the situation is well in hand.

""They've said publicly and also to us that it shouldn’t imperil the hub city activity that is pending… it won't jeopardize the ability to host NHL activity in our city in the coming weeks.""

OEG said: ""We do not foresee any significant delays or barriers to either the Edmonton Oilers Training Camp or preparations and activities related to our hosting as the NHL Hub City for the 2020 NHL Playoffs.""

Crews are working to clean and repair the affected areas, OEG said.

On Thursday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced the federal government would give a total of $19 billion to the 13 provinces and territories as part of the Safe Restart Agreement.

Municipalities across Canada are slated to receive approximately $2 billion to offset the losses caused by COVID-19.

""The City of Edmonton, like many big cities across the country, has faced immediate, significant and non-recoverable losses related to delivering essential services during this pandemic, such as transit, waste, emergency services, enforcement and other frontline services that Canadians depend on,"" Iveson said Friday. ""We've seen rising costs, plummeting revenue, and no responsible ability for us to run deficits.""

Iveson, along with the Federation of Canadian Municipalities, has been vocal about the need to receive federal funding to attempt to get the books in order.

""This agreement is a promising start at addressing the financial crisis municipalities face in this pandemic, as we work to protect frontline services for Canadians and prepare to help lead Canada's much-needed recovery,"" said FCM president Bill Karsten.

Iveson said the Alberta capital's financial gap is estimated to be $172 million by the end of 2020, with the pandemic especially pumping the brakes on transit revenue.

ETS shortfall revenue is expected to surpass $60 million by the end of the year, Iveson said, and nearly reach $50 million next year as Edmonton expects low ridership to continue.

The mayor is unsure how much money Edmonton will receive as part of the Safe Restart Agreement — he estimates it will be in the low nine figures — but specified transit funds will be included.

""A robust transit system is critical for Edmonton's economic restart, and in turn, Alberta's economic recovery,"" Iveson said.

TSN and Postmedia are reporting the Edmonton club will make the change, following the Washington NFL team's decision to do the same earlier this week.

A spokeswoman for the Edmonton club said the team had no update Friday morning.

Pressure has mounted in recent weeks for sports teams to eliminate racist or stereotypical names.

Critics say the Edmonton team's name is a derogatory, colonial-era term for Inuit.

Aaron Paquette, a city councillor in Edmonton, tweeted that he met with the CFL club on Thursday and, while he didn't confirm the name will be changed, he was “very impressed with the potential coming out of our conversation.”

“I had an extremely productive meeting with (Edmonton's) own football team today after they accepted my invitation to share ideas & perspectives,” Paquette wrote.

“I can't say any more but we'll see what develops.”

In February, the Edmonton club announced it was keeping the name following year-long research that involved Inuit leaders and community members across Canada. The club said it received “no consensus” during that review.

On July 8, the Edmonton club promised to speed up another review of its name and provide an update by the end of the month. In that statement, the club noted “a lot has happened” since it made the decision in February.

One of the team's sponsors, national car-and-home insurance provider Belairdirect, had announced a day earlier that it was rethinking its relationship with the team because of the name.

Other sponsors also said they would welcome a review of the name.

Boston Pizza said “as part of a larger shift in our overall marketing strategy, Boston Pizza recently ended its sponsorship of Edmonton's CFL team.” It tweeted the statement as a response to someone asking about whether it planned to follow the lead of Belairdirect.

All this happened as NFL's Washington team said it would undergo a thorough review of its name. A similar announcement was made by Major League Baseball's Cleveland Indians.

It is unclear when Edmonton would play its first game with a new name, if the change goes through. The CFL in June postponed the start of its 2020 season because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and there is no guarantee the league will play this year.

There have been repeated calls in the past for the Edmonton team to change its name.

Canada's national Inuit organization in 2015 said it was time for a change.

“It isn't right for any team to be named after an ethnic group,” said Natan Obed, president of Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, which represents Canada's 60,000 Inuit. Obed has said that Inuit people are not mascots.

Edmonton Mayor Don Iveson, citing Obed's statement, said in 2017 that the team should take steps toward a name change.

Although American Inuit continue to use the word Eskimo, Canada's northern people left that name behind about the same time they began negotiating their land claim in the 1970s.

Many historians believe the origin of Eskimo comes from an Algonquin term meaning “eaters of raw meat.” Others believe it comes from another Aboriginal term that refers to people wearing snowshoes.

The people themselves have used the word Inuit for centuries. It means “the people” in Inuktut.

Founded in 1949, the Edmonton team has won the Grey Cup 14 times, second only to the Toronto Argonauts at 17. The community-owned club's impressive history on the field includes a record five consecutive Grey Cups from 1978 to 1982.

Edmonton set a North American pro sports record by qualifying for the playoffs in 34 straight seasons from 1972 to 2005.

Other sports teams in Edmonton used the Eskimos name before the CFL club was founded.

There is no indication whether Edmonton has considered any possible new names.

The team applied for the trademark “Edmonton Empire” in 2018 for use on souvenir items.

The worker arrived in B.C. from Alberta on July 13 and self-isolated after receiving their test results from Alberta Health Services on July 15, BC Hydro says.

Northern Health conducted a second test, which also confirmed the worker was positive for COVID, on July 16.

The worker had not left camp or had any interaction with the local community, according to BC Hydro.

Northern Health is doing contact tracing, and the worker is being cared for by the on-site health clinic. BC Hydro says the worker will continue to isolate in their room, which is in a separate dorm and away from other workers, until they are cleared by medical professionals to leave.

Defence lawyer Dino Bottos continued his sentencing arguments on the fifth day of the sentencing hearing.

In its submission last week, the Crown told the court it is seeking a 22 1/2 year prison sentence.

""I've never been involved in a case where Crown and defence have been so far apart,"" Bottos said.

He argued Friday that the Crown had ""lost perspective in this case.""

""Their submissions seem to be calling for a vengeful sentence,"" he said.

""Something that may make some people in this public feel good. It may quench their thirst for blood, however that's not how we sentence offenders in Canada.""

Bottos noted McKnight was a first-time offender with ""excellent"" prospects for rehabilitation.

Friday is the fifth day of the sentencing hearing. It was initially scheduled for three days last week but is now expected to continue into later this month.

A schedule for the remainder of the hearing is expected to be determined later today.

McKnight, 33, was accused of sexually assaulting 13 women ranging in age from 17 to 22 from 2010 until 2016, when he worked at Knoxville's Tavern.​

In January, a jury convicted him on five of 13 counts after he had pleaded not guilty. Court has heard McKnight met most of the women in bars and assaulted them at his apartment.

SENTENCING SUBMISSION

In his sentencing argument last week, Crown prosecutor Mark Huyser-Wierenga said McKnight's moral responsibility is huge in what he described as drug-facilitated sex assaults.

He said the judge must “denounce and deter” the vile abuse of the five women, and called the sentencing a ""unique opportunity to denounce and deter.""

“These are gravely serious offences and Mr. McKnight's degree of moral responsibility is high,” said Huyser-Wierenga during in his opening submission.

“He's a man who has had a privileged upbringing in many ways.”

Huyser-Wierenga has also asserted the sex assaults were ""drug-facilitated"" noting one of the woman only had one drink, which she testified was given to her by McKnight before she blacked out.

""She's come to and she's in Mr. McKnight's bed,"" the prosecutor said.

Bottos pushed back on that assertion Friday saying there was limited evidence of drug use beyond alcohol.

ONGOING HEARING

Bottos has also focused his sentencing argument on a video of McKnight being assaulted by his cellmate while awaiting bail in the Edmonton Remand Centre on Aug. 14, 2016.

“He was agitated and called me 'skinner' and a rapist,” McKnight said of his attacker.

McKnight required stitches and staples following the attack where he was punched to the ground and kicked multiple times in the head.

Both Bottos and Huyser-Wierenga questioned one of the guards who rushed to the scene of the beating shortly after it happened.

Bottos has argued the beating should serve as a mitigating factor in his sentence.

Last week, McKnight told the court he's worried for his safety when he goes to prison.

“It's going to be a very dangerous time and I am just hoping to survive it,” said McKnight.

Huyser-Wierenga argued the assault should have no effect McKnight's sentencing.

Kaysen Martin turns two years old on Friday.

A fundraiser by his family to afford Zolgensma – a one-time gene replacement therapy proven to halt and in some cases reverse the effects of spinal muscular atrophy – has nearly reached $1 million.

While $1 million appears remarkable, the family is still $2 million short – and feels they're running out of time. Zolgensma is most effective before a patient turns two years old.

The fundraising push has meant Kaysen’s birthday is as much a deadline as it is a celebration.

""Being his mom, I need to be able to tell him I did everything I possibly could for him,"" Lana Bernardin, said.

She has been told there’s a ""little bit of wiggle room"" on the timing, but that doesn’t make Zolgensma any easier to access in Canada.

The drug is not approved for use in the country and costs $2.8 million south of the border.

As rare as the disease is, at least three families in the capital region are dealing with a spinal muscular atrophy diagnosis.

Harper Hanki is one year old.

""She’s fought tooth and nail through everything, from all the appointments, the physio three times a week, to the lumbar punctures every four months,"" her dad, John Haki, told CTV News Edmonton.

""Seeing that there is a treatment that could potentially stop it in its tracks, and not being able to afford it... It was heartbreaking,"" mother Amanda Hanki said.

Zolgensma’s manufacturer, Novartis, says in the U.S., the drug is ""priced according to the value it provides to the patients, caregivers, healthcare system and to society as a whole.""

Novartis has offered up to 100 free doses of the drug in 2020 throughout the world through a program families apply for and are selected via random lottery.

Of the three families, only Harper is eligible for the program.

Reign, a 16-month-old boy whose condition now requires round-the-clock breathing assistance and a feeding tube, does not qualify.

His parents, like Kaysen’s and Harper’s, hope the government will step in to speed up the approval process.

""This is a no-brainer,"" Reign’s dad, Ryan Johnston, said.

The only treatment currently allowed in Canada requires three yearly spinal injections for a patient’s life.

""(Zolgensma) is not only going to heal these children, it’s going to save us millions and millions of dollars, over the course of a lifetime.""

Health Canada has placed the drug under priority review, cutting the nine-month process in half.

""We’re just a regular family wanting the best for our child,"" Harper’s mom, Amanda, said.

Regardless, Kaysen will be celebrating his second birthday on Friday with a drive-thru party.

Sources tell TSN an internal decision has been made, the Edmonton Eskimos will be changing their name. An announcement could come as early as next week. — Ryan Rishaug (@TSNRyanRishaug) July 16, 2020

The decision comes after major team sponsors including Belairdirect and Sports Interaction put pressure on Edmonton to change its name.

CTV News Edmonton reached out to the team which said it has no updates at this time.

SPONSORS PUSH BACK

Two of the team's 12 ""premier sponsors"" have publicly stated they want the team to change its name.

On July 7, CTV News was the first to reveal Belairdirect, a national home and auto insurer, had said it would end its relationship with the team if the name wasn't changed.

""At Belairdirect one of our core values is respect, which is founded on seeing diversity as a strength, being inclusive and collaborative,"" reads a statement from the company.

""In order for us to move forward and continue on with our partnership with the Edmonton Eskimos, we will need to see concrete action in the near future including a name change. We have shared our position with the team.""

Belairdirect is a longtime sponsor of the team's 50/50 draw at Commonwealth Stadium.

Earlier Thursday, Sports Interaction, an online sportsbook operated out of Quebec by the Mohawk Council of Kahnawake, told CTV News it also wanted a name change.

""Sports Interaction will be asking the Edmonton Eskimos to change its name so that we can continue supporting the club and its fans,” spokesman Ryan Stetson wrote in an email to CTV News.

Jiffy Lube told the Canadian Press it supports the further engagement.

""We look forward to hearing feedback from their ongoing discussions,” spokeswoman Kelly McClung said.

A spokesman for TFB & Associates, the Canadian brand owners of lozenge manufacturer Fisherman's Friend, said the issue is ""something we have been following closely.""

""We support Edmonton’s CFL team’s re-engagement in discussions with the Inuit communities and are looking forward to the timely and respectful progression of those conversations along with a positive outcome for all.""

Although it is listed as a premier sponsor, Boston Pizza said its relationship with the team came to an end due to a shift in corporate marketing strategy, and not necessarily due to the team's name.

""Our decision to end the sponsorship was made prior to recent events in society, and as part of a larger shift in our marketing strategy away from legacy sponsorships of professional sports teams,"" a company spokesperson told CTV News.

Remaining premier sponsors The Brick, Molson Coors, Discount Car and Truck Rental, James H. Brown and Associates, Save on Foods, Servus Credit Union, Telus and Tim Hortons all have not responded to multiple media requests filed by CTV News over more than week.

The team has said it is accelerating its review of its team name and will report back by the end of July.

In a statement, the team says ""we acknowledge and appreciate the feedback and input regarding our name"" and that it takes the naming issue seriously.""

""We will be seeking further input from the Inuit, our partners and other stakeholders to inform our decisions moving forward. We’ll continue to listen carefully and with an open mind.""",[]

The highway, also known as Highway 11, begins east of Red Deer and extends into the Rocky Mountains.

The $120-million upgrade is expected to improve traffic flow between Sylvan Lake and Rocky Mountain House, a 66-kilometre span.

""It will mean a safer commute for our youth, who will be able to stay in their home community and travel to Red Deer College for their studies,"" Rocky Mountain House Mayor Tammy Burke said. ""It will mean safer, more efficient travel for energy and transportation services, it will make for a more direct, enjoyable drive for tourists and visitors alike.""

An estimated 5,800 vehicles use Highway 11 every day, according to the province.

Premier Jason Kenney called the project an important upgrade for an often under-appreciated area of the province, known for its resource development and tourism sectors.

""There is enormous potential to expand all these economic drivers and the David Thompson Highway is the backbone to support that investment, to create those future jobs and to generate that growth that will come along with it,"" Kenney said.

Dr. Deena Hinshaw reported 120 new cases of the coronavirus after Alberta Health Services conducted more than 8,200 tests.

Active cases spiked to 807 with 69 patients in hospital, including eight in ICUs.

Two more Albertans have died as a result of COVID-19, bringing the total number of deaths to 165.

Calgary surpassed 300 active infections with a total of 312, while Edmonton has 184 current cases.

""I absolutely am concerned about the recent numbers and the increase in numbers that we've had,"" Hinshaw said. ""I'm particularly concerned about the number of cases where we don’t know the source.

""I'm very concerned about reports of people not following physical distancing, for example on beaches as we saw this last weekend. I'm concerned about reports of people who are feeling that public health measures are no longer important.""

The province currently has five regions to its watch category: Mackenzie County, County of Stettler No. 6, Wheatland County, Municipal District of Willow Creek No. 26 and Cardston County.

Alberta has tallied 9,114 cases of the coronavirus since March.

CONTINUING CARE FACILITIES

Alberta is making changes to visiting rules at continuing care facilities.

As the pandemic began to unfold, the chief medical officer of health restricted visitors to protect residents at these homes.

Out of the 165 Albertans the virus has killed, 119 lived at continuing care facilities.

Previously, indoor visits were limited to one designated family member, and outdoor visits could only include that person plus one more.

""Protecting residents from COVID-19 has required placing severe restrictions on visits, which helped limit and prevent outbreaks, but also took a toll on those living inside these facilities.""

Starting July 23, that restrictive access is shifting to what Hinshaw calls a safe-access approach, where residents can welcome two people indoor without having to make an appointment, and up to four visitors outside.

""We believe this will help people remain socially and emotionally connected while still protecting those who are most at risk of severe outcomes,"" Hinshaw said. ""We heard clearly from residents and family that these restrictions were causing great stress, and in some cases, profound decline in health status in residents who grew depressed, isolated and lonely.""

The province is letting each facility develop a visitor policy based on consultation with residents, family and staff that weighs the level of risk each home is willing to assume.

However, Hinshaw warns that the virus is still here and that senior residents remain at risk.",[]

""These regions are all being monitored closely and no additional measures are being taken at this time.""

The three new areas of concern are:

Calgary-Centre (38 active cases, population 66,198, 58 cases per 100,000)

Cardston County (11 active cases, population 16,459, 67 cases per 100,000)

The new watches have joined those that have already been reported on the province's website, which includes a watch in Wheatland County that was briefly called off this week before being put back in place.

Officials say the watches are largely linked to outbreaks reported in those areas, including one involving a southern Alberta Hutterite colony, but there is no further information that can be shared.

""We cannot comment on specific cases due to patient confidentiality,"" said Tom McMillan, assistant director of communications with Alberta Health in an email to CTV News. ""The map reflects the patient’s address, not the location of the exposure.""

McMillan adds Alberta Health Services has taken action in all the affected regions.

""Health officials conduct contact tracing and anyone at risk of exposure is contacted, isolated and tested. Anyone at risk is contacted directly.""

This is the second time Calgary-Centre has been under a COVID-19 watch this pandemic. The first time was back in June, after 45 cases of coronavirus were attributed to Verve, a condo building in East Village.

The COVID-19 cases connected to the outbreak (56) have remained unchanged for the past few days. There are only two active cases connected to Verve, with one of those patients still in hospital.

ALBERTA ADDS MORE THAN 100 CASES

During the update, Hinshaw announced 120 new COVID-19 cases over the past 24 hours, bringing the province's total number of people sick with the illness to 807.

She said the increase in case numbers caused her great concern and emphasized the importance of why all Albertans need to follow all public health rules.

""It may seem odd that staying two metres apart is still important as we reopen so much of our society, but it still is. Combined with other public health measures, this is one of the most effective ways to control the spread of COVID-19,"" she said.

The ESO played outside the Shamrock Curling Club last month as part of their summer concert series.

“I do believe that is the first time the ESO played at a curling rink,” says Konstantine Kurelias who is the symphony’s media relations officer.

Since COVID-19 restrictions kept the orchestra out of the Winspear, they’ve taken the show on the road — literally. ESO members have performed on streets, cul-de-sacs, frontyards, and backyards.

“That’s the silver lining of a pandemic; the ESO will come to you and play”, says Kurelias.

Stephanie Morin, has played flute onstage with the ESO for years, performing indoors in the Winspear Centre, considered one of the best concert halls in the world for acoustics. But she says playing music for a small group of people in their own yard creates a special connection.

“We know that having a fancy concert hall and dressing up and the whole thing that goes around with orchestral symphony concerts, it kind of creates this barrier sometimes so it’s nice we have this opportunity to show people it’s not really like that.”

You can book members of the ESO by going to the Winspear’s website, and not only will they play in locations that are safe, they’ll also create a custom show.

“These are world-class musicians so they will arrange some music that is perfect for the event outdoors, people can physically distance around the music, and have a good time,” says Kurelias.

People are asked to make a donation to the symphony to show their appreciation. And Morin appreciates that these neighbourhood shows lets her play music for people again, something she hadn’t done until performing in someone’s backyard recently

“It just felt so good and so right to have a real audience there and it just reminded me that’s why I do this.""

In addition to the neighbourhood concerts, the ESO will also be playing Thursdays and Saturdays at the Art Gallery of Alberta.",[]

Stephanie Fodchuk says she came home to a strange vehicle in her driveway. At first she thought it was a package delivery, but quickly discovered she was being robbed.

""It was broad daylight. It wasn’t like it was 1 o'clock in the morning and pitch black, it was Father's Day at 3 in the afternoon,"" said Fodchuk.

Fodchuk's security footage appears to show four people stealing the family's truck, then returning to break into the garage.

Fodchuk says when she confronted them, one of the robbers pulled a gun on her.

""At first I was super angry and it turned to pure horror,"" said Fodchuk.

She said her husband, who was hours away from home, watched helplessly as the whole encounter unfolded on their security camera app.

""My husband's watching the whole thing happen in Grande Prairie and then obviously running to his truck and driving home. Cause I had sent a text to my family just saying like, 'We're being robbed, they have a gun,'"" said Fodchuk.

Fodchuk says she ducked down in her truck and called 911, but says the gunman held the gun on her for ""some time.""

Police arrived within minutes of the 911 call, but the suspects got away.

The family's truck was later found near her home, said police.

""Everything in my life is now different than it was three weeks ago,"" said Fodchuk.

""I just had no clue, I normally look at the cameras, but the cameras go off when there's a bird or so, you just get complacent and you don't always look, well apparently I should have looked that day.""

She said she felt fine the first few nights after the robbery, but then she began getting anxious and having panic attacks.

""Every time the camera goes off, it feels like somebody kicked me in the stomach,"" said Fodchuk. ""It's absolute terror and I can't pull into my driveway without checking the cameras and I'm afraid to open the garage door, you know even in broad daylight, because they did it in broad daylight.""

She says since the robbery they've begun adding more cameras, 16-foot gates, and a chain-link fence around their property.

""This is not a shady area by any means, right? So, it makes you feel even less secure,"" said Fodchuk.

Locals wanting to get to know or rediscover their city have plenty of options in and around the river valley and downtown for the whole family.

""It’s one thing to be able to showcase our amazing city to visitors and guests, and it is even more special when we get to rediscover our own backyard again,"" said Explore Edmonton Director of Communications Tammy Forbes. ""And even if we have to adapt to the current health restrictions and remain safe, the tourism industry is going to be vital as Edmontonians look for fun ways to rediscover their own city. Our greatest ambassadors are the people who choose to make this place their home.""

Here are 10 unique spots to check out during your summer staycation.

BOB AND DOUG MCKENZIE SCULPTURE

From your television screen to a bench in Ice District, Bob and Doug McKenzie are now in Edmonton for good.

The sculpture of Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas pays tribute to the sketch comedy duo's Great White North segment that had a memorable run on Second City Television in the 70s and 80s.

Edmonton sculptor Ritchie Velthuis made the piece that appeared in Ice District, in 103 Street and 103 Avenue, in late March.

SPIRIT OF STANLEY

Edmonton has had a lot of Stanley Cups over the year, and while this one wasn't won on the ice, it's by far the biggest and most prominent.

Located in front of the United Cycle on Gateway Boulevard, the Spirit of Stanley is the world's largest Stanley Cup replica at four metres and 850 pounds.

Fun fact: Each team took 45 minutes to engrave, according to its maker, IMARK.

NEON SIGN MUSEUM

An Edmonton classic, the Neon Sign Museum tells parts of the city's history in an artistic and bright way.

The City of Edmonton has collected 20 signs, restored and installed them on the Telus building and Mercer Warehouse on 104 Street.

Neon signs include the Canadian National Railway, the Princess Theatre, and with the goal of collecting 30 signs, there is a petition to save and move the Western Cycle sign there.

HIGH LEVEL BRIDGE AND WALTERDALE BRIDGE

These two are just nice to look at, especially at night. The City of Edmonton often changes the High Level Bridge's lights in the morning and night to celebrate certain occasions, or to send a message of solidarity as it did recently with Nova Scotia.

The Walterdale Bridge has only been around for three years but it's already arguably Edmonton's No. 1 spot for photos, featuring the breathtaking architecture, the river valley, and downtown Edmonton's growing skyline.

Gallery: Walterdale Bridge

KEILLOR POINT

Keillor Point was known as the End of the World before the City of Edmonton overhauled the North Saskatchewan River viewpoint in 2019.

The End of the World, located in the Belgravia neighbourhood, had become a safety hazard due to slumping in the embankment and deterioration of the pillars, the city said.

Still, it was a popular place to hang out and take pictures of the river, so the city spent $1.5 million to make it safer and more accessible, with stairs and a pathway.

BELGRAVIA BENCHES

Near Keillor Point, these benches in the Belgravia Dog Park are a cool spot to catch a sunset with views that include Fox Drive, the Whitemud Equine Learning Centre Association, Quesnell Bridge, the river — and your dog.

TALUS DOME

Explore Edmonton calls the Talus Dome Edmonton's ""most provocative piece of public art"" that ""always has people talking.""

You've probably driven by the 1,000 steel balls while crossing the Quesnell Bridge and raised an eyebrow, but the city encourages Edmontonians to take a closer look.

""Think fun house meets the compound eye of a fly,"" Explore Edmonton said. ""You can capture some pretty warped and funny reflections that will have you busting a gut laughing.""

Just don’t throw paint on it.

FORT EDMONTON FOOTBRIDGE

A footbridge on what feels like the middle of nowhere connects neighbourhoods in southwest Edmonton divided by the North Saskatchewan River.

Sit on the benches on and surrounding the bridge for up-close views of the river, or exercise on the trails on either side or the Wolf Willow Stairs just steps away.

""If you choose the latter, be prepared to sweat it out and hike up 200 stairs to get to this vantage point,"" Explore Edmonton said.

RIVER VALLEY SWING

As if it wasn't clear Edmonton's river valley was full of fun and surprises: a wooden swing overlooking downtown Edmonton.

It's been called a hidden gem and picturesque, but not many people know where it is. It's not clear who built it and put it there — the mystery adding to the charm.

It's tucked under somewhere around Dawson Park.

Tell your friends…unless you want it all to yourself.

WHITEMUD CREEK UNDERPASS

This is another gem not a lot of people have known about until now.

Underneath the Whitemud Creek on Anthony Henday Drive is an archway that wraps around a footbridge.

And since it doesn’t get a lot of foot traffic, it's turned into a lot more than that.

The little underpass has turned into a colourful retreat covered in graffiti and photographers admiring the rugged beauty.

It may looked abandoned on the outside, but it's getting a lot of attention on social media.",[]

Cochrane RCMP were called to the scene, in the eastbound lanes on Highway 1 near Highway 22, at about 9:40 a.m. Friday.

Initial reports indicated a car with four occupants sideswiped a tractor trailer unit while heading towards the city of Calgary. The smaller vehicle then lost control, crashed into the ditch and rolled over.

Two occupants of the vehicle were seriously injured while two others were taken to hospital for minor injuries.

The driver of the tractor-trailer did not stop at the scene, but police believe they may not have known they were involved in a collision and continued on without stopping.

Cochrane RCMP are asking all drivers in the area around the time of the crash to thoroughly examine their vehicles to see if they have damage consistent with being sideswiped. Any witnesses to the crash are also asked to contact police at 403-851-8000.

The cause of the crash is also under investigation, but police believe alcohol and drug use may have been a factor.

Saskatchewan has reported 42 new COVID-19 cases, bringing the provincial total to 923.

In a release, the province said of the new cases, 31 are in the south region, six are in the central region, four are in the Saskatoon area and one is in the north.

HUTTERITE COLONIES WON’T BE LOCKED DOWN, FOR NOW

Saskatchewan has no plans yet to impose stricter measures on some Hutterite colonies after cases of COVID-19 further surged in their communities.

Speaking with reporters Thursday, Rural and Remote Health Minister Warren Kaeding said even though it’s possible there might be more enforcement if the situation worsens, it’s currently not necessary.

“If we were not getting the co-operation, the tremendous co-operation we have been with Hutterites in particular, we would maybe have to consider something like that,” he said.

PROVINCE NOT READY TO IMPLEMENT MANDATORY MASK POLICY

The Government of Saskatchewan is not currently considering implementing a mandatory mask policy for the province, after seeing the biggest single-day rise in COVID-19 cases on Thursday.

“Mask usage is just one of the tools that right now are available in the tool box,” said Warren Kaeding, the Minister of Rural and Remote Health.

“Our Chief Medical Health Officer has been fairly explicit as to where he sees a mask would be the best benefit.”

The province will continue to adhere to the advice of Dr. Saqib Shahab, the province’s Chief Medial Health Officer, when it comes to mask use.

Hundreds of dead carp could be seen washing up on the shores of Lake Winnipeg in June, prompting the province’s wildlife and fisheries branch to conduct tests on the tissue of the fish to determine if a virus caused the mass die-off.

The province was looking to see if it was caused by the Koi Herpes virus, which has been found in Manitoba before, or the Spring Viraemia of Carp virus, which affects different species of carp.

A spokesperson for the province said they did not find evidence of either virus with the tests.

“Based on the evidence collected to date, Manitoba Agriculture and Resource Development (ARD) is unable to determine what caused this die-off,” the spokesperson wrote in an email to CTV News. “At this time there will be no further investigation.”

The province said if residents start noticing large numbers of dying or freshly dead fish, they’re asked to notify the wildlife and fisheries branch as soon as possible by phone at 204-793-1154 or by emailing fish@gov.mb.ca.

Dr. Lori Brotto of the Faculty of Medicine said preliminary findings from her surveys show the opposite of a pandemic baby boom: people aren’t have as much sex, due to the amount of stress they are under.

“I think one of the assumptions was, well ... what are you possibly going to do with all of this time?” Brotto explained.

What is actually happening behind closed doors is that people are under incredible amounts of stress, whether it’s due to finances, childcare or homeschooling, taking care of elders, or fear of contracting COVID-19.

“We know that stress is a powerful deterrent to sexual interest and sexual activity,” Brotto said, calling the stereotype that people are having more sex during the pandemic “unhealthy,” because it can make people feel worse than they already are if they believe the myth.

The study is also tracking gender-based violence during the pandemic. Brotto said it’s too early to quantify, but the surveys are indicating that spending more time at home for some means spending more time with an abusive partner.

“This is unfortunate and it’s not surprising because we have seen this in past pandemics,” Brotto observed.

Earlier in the pandemic, local shelters and crisis lines saw alarming increases in calls for help.

The study is based on online surveys of more than 900 Canadians. Participants answer a confidential questionnaire every four weeks for a duration of six months. Topics include sexual behaviour, relationship status, anxiety and depression levels.

Brotto’s research will also track how sexual behaviour changes as physical distancing guidelines are relaxed, in hopes of learning more about the role stress plays in overall health and sexuality.

“It’s important that people seek out accurate evidence-based information when it comes to sexuality and not to believe the stereotypes that pervade our society,” she added.

Comet NEOWISE had been visible to the naked eye over the past several days, making a once-in-a-lifetime appearance before disappearing for thousands of years.

Stargazers around the world have shared their sightings of the comet online and astronomer Rachel Wang from Vancouver's H.R. MacMillan Space Centre says locals might still be able to catch a glimpse before the comet fades.

""You want to go sooner rather than later because it is dimming in brightness,"" Wang said on CTV Morning Live Thursday, adding that the best time to see the comet is about an hour after sunset.

The ""sweet spot,"" she said, is about 10:15 p.m.

""You want to look in the north-northwestern direction,"" she said. ""If you can bring binoculars I would highly recommend doing so.""

Getting away from light pollution is also key, Wang said.

Wang said it's believed the comet came from the Oort Cloud, which is a huge cloud surrounding the solar system.

""It's very rare that we have a comet pass so close to Earth, so close that we're able to see it and also that it maintains its brightness,"" she said.

Wang said there was another comet that was expected to pass close to Earth last December, but it disintegrated before it could be seen.

Anyone eager to see Comet NEOWISE shouldn't wait too long.

""You really want to go as soon as possible because it's dimming in brightness every single day,"" Wang said.

BC Housing worked with the PHS Community Services Society and GSL Properties, the developer and operator of the arena, to establish the temporary shelter.

A listing for the North Island Princess appeared on Vancouver Craigslist just over three weeks ago from Pacific Boat Brokers, a B.C.-based pre-owned vessel brokerage.

The ferry, first constructed in 1958 in Vancouver, measures 61.04 metres in length and has a passenger and crew capacity of 150. It can also carry up to 38 vehicles.

According to the BC Ferries profile of the ship, it can travel at a top speed of 13 knots, with a horsepower of 1,609 and can handle a maximum displacement of 804 tonnes. The Craigslist listing says the vessel is powered by twin MTU V12 2000 engines with twin disc gears.

The 62-year-old ferry was retired from its Powell River-to-Texada Island route just this June when it was replaced by a new BC Ferries hybrid-electric ferry, the Island Discovery.

A little over one month after entering service, the Island Discovery suffered a maintenance accident that required the hybrid ferry to be pulled from service.

The accident occurred Wednesday, and BC Ferries is attempting to make repairs, which require the ferry service to wait for a replacement part for its switchboard.

""What I'm told is the actual fix or the switching out of the switchboard isn't a big deal, it's actually getting our hands on the part,"" said BC Ferries spokesperson Deborah Marshall Thursday.

The listing for the North Island Princess, which is available for $159,000 or “any reasonable offer” can be found online here.

Meanwhile, Pacific Boat Brokers is also listing the luxury V2V Empress catamaran for sale, a vessel which was used for the recently shut down V2V Vacations.

V2V Vacations ran a luxury Victoria-to-Vancouver ferry service for roughly three years before shutting down in January.

The V2V Empress underwent a full interior retrofit in 2016 and had new engines installed in 2018.

The catamaran can carry up to 242 passengers across two decks and includes amenities like luxury seating with folding tables and full ovens and refrigeration systems on both decks.

The V2V Empress is listed at $6 million. Further information can be found here.",[]

On Friday morning, Victoria resident and retired Olympic rower Adam Kreek tweeted a warning about a cougar sighting on Mt. Doug.

Kreek says he spotted the cougar at roughly 4:40 a.m. about 100 metres from where the Norn Trail meets the Whittaker Trail on the mountain.

On Wednesday, the nearby University of Victoria also posted a warning of a potential cougar sighting near campus.

Meanwhile, a Mill Bay man was shocked Friday when he received a notification from his home security camera showed that a prowler outside his house.

The visitor wasn’t human, but that didn’t calm Jason Taron’s alarm.

The video showed a sizable Vancouver Island black bear saunter past the front of his home late Thursday night.

“This big guy came for a visit last night,” Taron said in a Twitter post. “Heads up to everyone in the Deer Park Mill Springs area of Mill Bay.”

Taron says the black bear has been spotted around the Mill Bay region for roughly one month.

He told CTV News that a neighbour has even had a frightening face-to-face encounter with the bear.

Bear and cougar sightings have been on the rise on Vancouver Island this year.

In May and June, several up-close cougar sightings were recorded on video or photographed.

Around the same time, police were releasing multiple warnings of bear and cougar sightings in Saanich, Langford, Colwood and View Royal.

In May, four black bear sightings were recorded over a short period of time, three of which occurred in three consecutive days.

After those sightings, the B.C. Conservation Officers Service urged residents to keep their garbage and other animal attractants secure and indoors if possible.

Bears that become habituated to foraging in urban areas may have to be euthanized for public safety, warns the conservation service, something that occurred in Langford in June.

The Liberal government has said that it will provide provinces and territories with $19 billion in funding to help them restart their economies in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic with at least some of that money earmarked for municipalities and transit providers facing large operational deficits.

Speaking with reporters during a press conference in Kitchener on Friday afternoon, Ford said that his government is in the process of “crossing the Ts and dotting the Is” on the allocation of the money right now and expects to be “rolling it over the next week.”

He did not directly answer a question about whether Toronto would receive enough money to cover the entire $1.35 billion shortfall it expects to face by the end of 2020 but did say that his government will do everything it can to “cover as much” of the operational deficits faced by Ontario’s 444 cities and towns as possible.

“I want to work with the City of Toronto. They are the big white elephant in the room of the 444 (cities and towns) and I understand that,” he said, noting that the losses faced by the TTC alone make Toronto’s challenges particularly acute. “But everyone needs money. We are going to split it up equally and make sure that the people that need it get the money.”

Ford has previously indicated that Ontario will receive about $7 billion in funding from the feds but that money also has to go towards a number of other areas, including expanding testing and contact tracing and acquiring personal protective equipment.

For his part, Tory has said that he is “cautiously optimistic” that the city will get enough money to stave off major cuts but he has also said that it would be “premature to declare victory” without “reading the fine print.”

On Friday, Ford credited city officials for finding more than $500 million in savings in Toronto’s budget and reducing the expected deficit from $1.9 billion to $1.35 billion.

He said that while it would be “hogwash” for any municipality to suggest that it can’t find savings in its budget, the financial challenges faced by the municipal level of government as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic are very real.

In Toronto, the TTC alone faces a $700 million budgetary pressure, mostly due to reduced ridership during the COVID-19 pandemic. The city also expects to lose out on $249.2 million in budgeted Municipal Land Transfer Tax revenue in 2020 as a result of real-estate slowdown that accompanied the pandemic.

“We have to work together,” Ford said. “We are going to do everything we can to cover as much as we can in all areas and I just want to thank the municipalities that have been prudent fiscal managers.”",[]

The decision was announced by Metrolinx in a news release issued on Friday.

The announcement comes as more regions across the Greater Toronto Area implement the mandatory use of a facial covering for those attending indoor public spaces.

“As the GTA starts to prepare itself for Stage 3 of the recovery, we are seeing many more customers return to our GO and UP services,” Metrolinx CEO Phil Verster said. “With that in mind and your safety in mind, we are making face coverings mandatory on all our services.”

Verster said drivers of their transit vehicles have been wearing face masks for the last several months.

“In terms of our enforcement, of our requirement of people to wear face coverings, we will focus on education rather than enforcement,” he added. “Our employees will help customers on buses and trains if they haven’t got face coverings and we will ensure that no one will be left behind.”

Earlier this month, the transit agency announced that it had started installing clear plastic dividers between seats on some of its buses and trains.

So far, the dividers have been installed on 30 GO buses and six GO trains.

The use of face masks and the plastic dividers are two of the 40 measures Metrolinx says they are implementing to help limit the spread of COVID-19.

Beginning July 21, riders will be required to wear a face covering when traveling on GO Transit and UP Express. GO and UP staff are already required to wear face coverings.

On July 10, at 10:55 p.m., an RCMP officer monitoring traffic on Highway 102 near Brookfield spotted a VW Jetta travelling at a high rate of speed and activated the RADAR. The vehicle’s speed was measured at 196 km/hr in a 110 km/hr zone.

On Wednesday, at 10:30 p.m., an RCMP officer monitoring traffic on Highway 104 near Exit 5, Springhill, spotted an Audi A4 travelling at a high rate of speed and activated the RADAR. The vehicle’s speed was initially measured at 162 km/hr by the officer, who wasn’t able to catch up with the vehicle. The officer radioed another officer, who measured the vehicle’s speed at 195 km/hr in a 100 km/hr zone.

Middlesex-London Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Chris Mackie, issued instructions on Friday to all local businesses and organizations to ensure masks are worn in enclosed public spaces at all times while on their premises.

The mandatory wearing of face coverings takes effect at 12:01 a.m. Saturday.

It comes as the City of London plans to introduce a bylaw on Monday that would require masks in all indoor publicly-accessible spaces. Mackie is recommending London and all municipal councils in Middlesex issue a bylaw.

Mackie's instruction will be enforceable by public health staff, municipal by-law officers and law enforcement officials.

The instruction comes under Ontario’s Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act.

“We know that physical distancing is very effective in preventing the spread of COVID-19, but as the pandemic has evolved, new evidence supporting the use of face coverings in enclosed public spaces has continued to emerge,” says Mackie.

“Our community has done an amazing job to slow the pandemic to a crawl. We need to do all we can to prevent a spike in cases that could occur as most of our businesses and establishments move to Stage 3 of reopening.”

While the instruction applies to most people, the following individuals are exempt from having to wear face coverings:

• Children under the age of 12;

• People who have a medical condition or disability which inhibits their ability to wear a face covering;

• Those unable to apply or remove a face covering without help;

• People with accommodations under the Ontario Human Rights Code or the Accessibility for Ontarians with a Disabilities Act;

• Staff or agents of an enclosed public space who are in an area of the premises that is designated for them and not accessible to the public, or in an area separated by a physical barrier, such as plexiglass.

Mackie says if a customer isn't wearing a mask the business can ask the person to wear a mask, but not to create conflict.

""The primary enforcement mechanism will be education here for this instruction. Education is the most important part. If businesses make a reasonable attempt to ask a customer to wear a mask they will not be charged.""

Meanwhile, there are no details on when the city's temporary bylaw would take effect, or how long it would apply.

It would also require all businesses to post signage about mandatory masks.

According to city officials, the bylaw has been developed on the recommendation of Mackie.

The primacy goal is ""to reduce the risk of further COVID-19 infections within the City of London.""

The proposed minimum fine for failing to wear a mask is $500.

Council will discuss the bylaw at a special Strategic Priorities and Planning Committee meeting on Monday afternoon, with the bylaw expected to be introduced on Tuesday.

The samples, taken July 14, were tested by the Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks, who advised the health unit of the presence cyanobacteria, the technical term for the bloom.

""The samples contained a species of cyanobacteria that can produce toxins,"" Public Health said in a news release.

Blue-green algal blooms could also appear in other parts of the lake because blooms are not anchored. That means they can move from one location to another through wind and water action.

""New blooms can also form,"" the release said. ""All residents on lakes should look for blooms in their area.""

Pea soup appearance

Blue-green algal blooms have an unsightly pea soup appearance and foul smell, and can produce toxins. Residents should avoid using or drinking water from areas where blooms are visible.

The highest concentrations of toxins are usually found in blooms and scum on the shoreline. These dense accumulations pose the greatest potential risks to people and pets. The algae toxins can irritate a person’s skin and, if ingested, cause diarrhea and vomiting. If a person ingests high levels of toxin, they could suffer liver and nervous system damage.

If you see a bloom near your property or water intake line:

- Avoid using the water for drinking, bathing, or showering, and do not allow children, pets, or livestock to drink or swim in the bloom.

- Be aware that shallow drinking water intake pipes can pump in blue-green algae.

- Do not boil the water or treat it with a disinfectant, like bleach, because it breaks open the algae cells, which releases more toxins into the water.

- Do not rely on water jug filtration systems as they may not protect against the toxins.

- Avoid cooking with the water because food may absorb toxins from the water during cooking.

- Follow the Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Park Guide to Eating Ontario Fish. Exercise caution with respect to eating fish caught in water where blue-green algal blooms occur. Residents should not eat the liver, kidneys, and other organs of fish.

""On lakes and rivers where blue-green algal blooms are confirmed, people who use the surface water for their private drinking water supply may wish to consider an alternate, protected source of water,"" the release said.

For more information on blue-green algae, including a list and map of water bodies with confirmed blooms, visit the health unit's website or call 1-705-522-9200, ext. 464, or toll-free 1-866-522-9200.",[]

An SUV and a transport truck reportedly collided with a minivan there.

The occupants of the first two vehicles were not injured, a news release explains.

The driver of the minivan, however, a 46-year-old Kitchener woman, was airlifted to an out-of-region hospital with serious injuries.

The kids, all under the age of 16, were taken to a local hospital to be assessed.

Arthur Street was shut down for a short time between Whippoorwill Drive and Oriole Parkway.

Three cast members from ""The Office"" joined together to offer a message of congratulations to this year's graduating class.

""Congrats on all your hard work, and most importantly, on your perseverance, and you're graduating during an unprecedented time,"" said Kate Flannery, who played Meredith Palmer in the show.

She was joined by Leslie David Baker, who played Stanley Hudson, and Brian Baumgartner, who played Kevin Malone.

The three encouraged grads to celebrate, but warned that they wouldn't exactly be able to rest now that their schooling is done.

""We need your newly-acquired knowledge. You've seen the news, you've seen what's going on in the world,"" Baker said.

""Trust me, if you thought you were just going to graduate and then kick back and relax, uh-uh, you've got work to do, and plenty of it. Did I stutter?""

They encouraged grads to strive for more and not to end up at Dunder Mifflin, the fictional paper company where the show took place.

Near the end of the two-minute video, though, Baumgartner pokes some fun at the message.

""I'm not sure the folks there at the university understand that Dunder Mifflin is a fictional paper company, but in any case, good luck in your futures,"" he says.",[]

Trudeau said the funds will help communities prepare for a potential second wave and will go towards boosting testing capabilities, stockpiling personal protective equipment, and advancing municipal transportation.

The funds are a revisal to a pre-announced ""safe-restart agreement"" that had an initial price tag of $14 billion. Talks have been ongoing over the last several weeks between the federal government and the provinces and territories over the scale of support needed.

""We’ve been working with our provincial and territorial partners to outline what needs to be done over the next six to eight months to safely restart our economy,"" said the prime minister during a press briefing in Ottawa.

""As part of this agreement we’ve outlined seven priority areas on which to focus our efforts.""

He said this includes more testing and contact tracing, enhanced support for vulnerable communities – including seniors in long-term care facilities – and ensuring adequate childcare capacity.

""Our towns and cities have been at the forefront of responding to COVID-19. Cities must remain up and running if our economy is to eventually get back up and running. If cities aren’t equipped for a safe restart, people will not be safe.""

Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland joined the prime minister on Thursday as she has during the 15 first ministers’ calls throughout the pandemic.

She touted the federal and provincial governments’ ""team Canada"" approach to navigating the COVID-19 pandemic.

""Our shared public health goal has been to save the lives of Canadians, to protect the health of Canadians, and to prevent our health-care system from being overwhelmed. Our shared economic goal has been to ensure that no Canadian goes hungry or is made homeless because of the economic shutdown,"" she said.

She too underscored the need to support cities in their pandemic fight.

""We know that if our cities are not equipped for a safe restart, including when it comes to transit, Canada won’t be either.""

Freeland also reflected on COVID-19’s disproportionate impact on women and families. She said beyond mandating mandatory 10-day paid sick leave, the agreement will address mechanisms to support women returning to work.

As detailed in last week’s fiscal snapshot, women have faced a much steeper decline in job loss since the pandemic took hold across the country and recent statistics show men are rebounding at a rate twice as fast as women as economies reopen.

There’s been a mounting call by activists for governments to address childcare needs across the country given the uncertainty around sending kids back to school in the fall. Many have criticized reopening plans that have prioritized the reopening of bars and malls instead of these facilities.

Asked whether the deal could be extended beyond six to eight months, Trudeau said the government would remain committed to supporting his provincial counterparts.

PROVINCES & CITIES RESPOND

Ontario Premier Doug Ford has since weighed in on the $19-billion agreement, of which Ontario will collect $7 billion, saying he applauds the federal government’s efforts to help rebuild local communities at the front lines of the pandemic.

""This historic agreement proves what we can do as a nation when we stand united,"" Ford said during a news conference on Thursday.

""My friends, make no mistake, by standing united, by standing together as a province, Ontario was in a strong position to get a deal from the federal government.""

The Federation of Canadian Municipalities’ (FCM) President Bill Karsten also issued a statement reflecting on the unexpected hardships cities have faced trying to keep their communities safe, and the need for a ""non-traditional"" stimulus approach to enable recovery.

""FCM has been clear: there’s no full recovery without strong municipalities, and we are pleased to see the prime minister acknowledge this,"" said Karsten.

""We thank the federal government for its leadership on this crucial way forward. We are calling on all orders of government — including provincial and territorial — to do their part to ensure municipalities get this financial support efficiently.""",[]

Among the items hanging on the government's agenda is a promise to provide one-time payments to some Canadians with disabilities to help cover additional costs incurred during the pandemic.

The Liberals tried to pass a bill last month that would set up the payment but the opposition refused to support the legislation as it contained other measures they found objectionable.

The ban on discretionary travel was first introduced in March and has been extended each month since. The latest extension was set to expire on July 21.

""Once again, Canada and the United States have agreed to extend the current border measures by one month until August 21, and we're going to keep working closely with our American neighbours to keep people safe on both sides of the border,” Trudeau said on Thursday.

The extension was expected, with sources telling CTV News earlier this week that it was coming.

The agreement, as it stands, exempts the flow of trade and commerce, as well as temporary foreign workers and vital health-care workers such as nurses who live and work on opposite sides of the border. Tourists and cross-border visits remain prohibited.

This is the fourth renewal of the border restrictions since the coronavirus pandemic was declared, and comes as cases of COVID-19 continue to surge in the United States. Canada’s epidemic curve has flattened and most of the country is reopening under ongoing precautions in what’s been described as the new normal for the foreseeable future.

As of June 9, foreign nationals who are immediate family members of either Canadian citizens or permanent residents can enter Canada to be reunited, under a limited exemption to the current border restrictions. This has allowed both foreign and cross-border Canada-U.S. families to reunite under certain stipulations.

While the restrictions have now been in place for months, it hasn’t stopped some Americans from trying to cross into Canada, and there have been some instances of U.S. travellers entering into Canada improperly.",[]

The major national security and intelligence threat was identified by the three countries as the result of “Russian cyber threat activity” directed at organizations that are doing research into and development of COVID-19 vaccines and treatment.

“These malicious cyber activities were very likely undertaken to steal information and intellectual property relating to the development and testing of COVID-19 vaccines, and serve to hinder response efforts at a time when healthcare experts and medical researchers need every available resource to help fight the pandemic,” said the Communications Security Establishment (CSE) in a statement.

The top cyber and national security agencies—including the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) and the Department of Homeland Security—jointly allege that APT29, also known as “the Dukes” or “Cozy Bear” which the agency says “almost certainly operates as part of Russian intelligence services,” was responsible for the malicious activity.

In a technical advisory released Thursday, the agencies spell out how the Russian actors used malware known as “WellMess” and “WellMail” to target global organizations by scanning computer IP addresses for potential vulnerabilities to access information like login credentials.

“This broad targeting potentially gives the group access to a large number of systems globally, many of which are unlikely to be of immediate intelligence value. The group may maintain a store of stolen credentials in order to access these systems in the event that they become more relevant to their requirements in the future,” reads the advisory.

“The group uses a variety of tools and techniques to predominantly target governmental, diplomatic, think-tank, healthcare and energy targets for intelligence gain,” according to the U.K.’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC).

As The Canadian Press has reported, a spokesperson for Russian President Vladimir Putin has denied the accusations, saying Russia does not have any information about who may have hacked these organizations, stating plainly “Russia has nothing to do with those attempts.""

In a late afternoon press conference, Public Safety Minister Bill Blair hinted that while Russia has been named in this instance, there are other foreign actors who have their sights set on Canadian COVID-19 intellectual property.

MINISTERS CONDEMN 'RECKLESS ACTIONS'

Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan praised the agencies for calling out the “bad behavior,” and deterring other malicious foreign actors from targeting Canadian intelligence.

NCSC Director of Operations Paul Chichester condemned the “despicable attacks,” against those working to combat the ongoing novel coronavirus pandemic.

British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said that the U.K. stands with Canada and the U.S. “against the reckless actions of Russia’s intelligence services, who we have exposed today for committing cyberattacks against those working on a #Covid19 vaccine.” He said the hackers sought to undermine the international work underway to defeat the pandemic that to date has killed nearly 585,000 people worldwide.

It remains unclear whether the attempts were successful in stealing any information. In a statement to CTV News, CSE said that in regards to these hacking attempts the agency is offering support and mitigation services, “to limit impacts to targeted organizations.”

“On any given day, CSE's dynamic defence capabilities block up to two billion reconnaissance scans on these systems,” CSE spokesperson Evan Koronewski said in the statement, referring to the Government of Canada's systems.

The three countries are now imploring all research facilities and other agencies involved in coronavirus research to take further actions to protect their information and contact CSE’s Cyber Centre if they suspect they have been targeted.

As The Associated Press has reported, “Cozy Bear” was identified by U.S. security officials as one of the two Russian-linked groups responsible for the hack into the Democratic National Committee computer network that resulted in the leak of Hillary Clinton campaign emails ahead of the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

RESEARCHERS WARNED OF RISK

This comes after CSE and the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) issued a warning in May that Canadian intellectual property related to COVID-19 research and testing was at an elevated risk for foreign-backed hacking or other malicious activity.

At the time the agencies said that during the pandemic they had already seen an increased risk of foreign interference and espionage related to the work being done by Canadian researchers, though they would not comment on specific operations, or which foreign actors posed a concern.

The federal government has committed more than $1 billion towards a national medical and research strategy to combat the novel coronavirus that is seeing labs across the country expand their capacity to study the virus, possible treatments or vaccines, and its spread among the population.

The funding includes millions of dollars for developing and producing vaccines and treatments in Canada, supporting similar work in other nations, as well as studying immunity and serology testing.

On Wednesday Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and several other world leaders put out a call to global leaders to “commit to an equitable distribution of an eventual COVID-19 vaccine.”

“We will ensure every step of the way… to protect Canadian intellectual property and to protect the hard work of our researchers and ensure that we're doing everything right. But at the same time, we recognize the need for global collaboration in order to get through this global pandemic and we will get that balance right,” Trudeau told reporters on Thursday.",[]

Mario Dion said concerns raised by opposition MPs about Morneau’s participation in the decision to award the organization a multi-million dollar government contract, given his close family ties to WE, satisfies the need for an investigation.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is also under investigation after revelations that his brother and mother were paid nearly $300,000 for speaking engagements since 2016.

Morneau’s daughter Clare has spoken at WE events and his daughter Grace is currently a contractual employee.

""Given the fact that my daughter works for the WE organization in an unrelated branch, I should have recused myself in order to avoid any perception of conflict. I will fully cooperate with the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner, and moving forward will fully recuse myself from discussions related to the WE organization,"" Morneau said in a statement to CTV News, responding to the commissioner’s notice.

On July 3, the government announced that WE Charity would no longer administer the $912 million student grant program, a decision they said was mutually agreed upon.

""The decision taken by WE this morning to withdraw from this work with the government is one that we support. Obviously, the way this situation has unfolded has been unfortunate,"" said Trudeau during a press conference that day.

Since then, both the prime minister and finance minister have issued apologies for not recusing themselves from cabinet discussions about WE.

NDP MP Charlie Angus, along with three other members of Parliament, wrote to the ethics commissioner requesting a formal query. Dion responded Thursday.

""In your letter, you allege that, given Mr. Morneau’s family ties with WE Charity and his participation in discussions relating to the decision to have the organization administer the Canada Student Service Grant, Mr. Morneau furthered the private interests of WE Charity in contravention of subsection 6(1) of the Conflict of Interest Act (Act),"" reads the letter from Dion.

""I have considered your request and am of the view that it satisfies the requirements set out in subsection 44(2) of the Act. I am therefore commencing an examination under subsection 44(3) of the Act into a possible contravention of subsection 6(1), along with another provision.""

Conservative MPs Michael Cooper and Pierre Poilievre also requested an investigation.

The ethics committee will meet on Friday, to decide whether to also move forward with a review.

""Once again, the Ethics Commissioner has opened an investigation into a Trudeau Liberal Minister. Bill Morneau is now under investigation for his involvement in Justin Trudeau’s $900 million scandal. It’s also clear that a criminal investigation is warranted.

What PM Trudeau's COVID-19 messaging reveals,'Rachel Aiello',2020-07-13,"OTTAWA -- It became a scene most Canadians could recognize: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau emerges from Rideau Cottage and descends six steps to a podium, notes in hand. This was how the prime minister chose to speak to the country, day in and day out between March and July. In his morning updates, COVID-19 aid packages amounting to hundreds of billions of dollars were unveiled and public health advisories were driven home, but what else did Trudeau have to say?

CTVNews.ca has analyzed the 81 national addresses and following media availabilities that Trudeau held during the 110 days between entering a 14-day self-isolation, on March 12, to his June 29 announcement that, going forward, he would only convene the Rideau Cottage updates when he had big news to share.

The day after Trudeau entered quarantine on account of his wife Sophie having symptoms that were soon confirmed to be from COVID-19, the prime minister began what quickly became a daily routine: addressing the nation from Rideau Cottage, his family’s temporary home on the grounds of Rideau Hall.

Those morning addresses, mostly from the grounds of Rideau Hall, became a seven-day-a-week ritual, with few days off in the first two months. Then, as the public health crisis entered into the initial phase of reopenings, the routine was eased, with no press conferences on weekends and eventually only a few times a week.

Analyzing the transcripts of his English-language remarks from all those Rideau Cottage updates, as well as the few offsite, CTVNews.ca identified his commonly used phrases and terms, as well as his go-to nouns and adjectives, before asking political communication experts and a linguist to assess the words he was using to deliver his messages, and whether they were effective.

WHAT WORDS DID HE USE?

CTVNews.ca’s analysis found that the most repeated phrase was “right across the country,” followed by variations of “keep Canadians safe.” Others that topped the list included “make sure,” and “move forward.”

Speaking to the use of “keep Canadians safe,” former lead speechwriter for Trudeau, Jeni Armstrong, said she thinks it was a great choice.

“It's simple, it's direct, it appeals to the kind of worries that we all have about our families… It’s memorable and like I said, it is the kind of reassurance that I think people were seeking especially in the early days,” said Armstrong, who is now an instructor with the Clayton H. Riddell Graduate Program in Political Management at Carleton University after working as the director of communications for Finance Minister Bill Morneau and helping to author the Liberal Party’s 2019 and 2015 federal election platforms.

Other phrases that appeared often included: “long-term care”; “continue to work”; “public health”; “social distancing”; “people need”; “staying home”; and “coming weeks.”

CTVNews.ca also searched for the frequency of other key words, which may not necessarily be the words said the most. The word “recognize” came up 183 times over the 81 addresses, “virus” was said 127 times, “parliament” got named 108 times and “unprecedented” was said 63 times. Further, “racism” was said 53 times, “China” was found in the transcripts 45 times, and “budget” just nine times.

Armstrong said Trudeau has a personal verbal habit where he builds formulas for responding to questions, which could explain the frequency of the word “recognize”—which often was how he started an answer to reporters’ questions: “we recognize…”

“He'll often say—and this has been true for a number of years… ‘Canadians expect us to ABC, and we are doing just that.’ It's kind of a formula that he has,” she said.

Trudeau’s go-to verbs, in order of frequency: “need”; “get”; “make”; “continue”’ “know”; “keep”; “ensure”; “want”; “think”; and “help.”

As for adjectives, he most often said: “many”; “sure”; “safe”; “able”; “right”; “important”; “different”; “new”; “Canadian”; and “possible.”

Linguist Shana Poplack told CTVNews.ca that Trudeau’s word choices show he wants to evoke he is in charge and has things under control.

“If this is the message he's trying to relay, those words are consistent,” said Poplack, who is the director of the Sociolinguistics Laboratory at the University of Ottawa and Canada Research Chair in Linguistics.

Poplack also said what stood out to her were the phrases that didn’t crack the top of the list of things Trudeau said, despite them being so frequently said in society writ large these days, including “in these uncertain times,” and “the new normal.”

“That does not tie in with the message that he's trying to get across,” she said, suggesting it’s possible he didn’t want to highlight the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic.

“That's why we see “ensure,” we see the word “safe,” reappearing... He also has to convince us that he's on top of it,” she said.

BUILT UP LEXICON OF PHRASES

What the frequent repetition of these and other phrases indicates, experts said, is that Trudeau and his relatively small team of speechwriters had developed a dictionary of key phrases to reinforce and repeat in his prepared remarks. The messaging was first built into his speeches, but after their near-daily repeating, they became a reflexive part of his vocabulary when responding to questions, too.

Poplack said these are referred to as “fixed expressions,” some of which are commonly used by all, others are created, as seen with terms for aid programs to establish a clear message. The use of such phrases can be seen across political lines and in past prime ministers’ speaking habits as well.

“For Paul Martin it was ‘let me be clear,’ for Stephen Harper it was ‘obviously’,” said Garry Keller, vice president at StrategyCorp and a past adviser to former prime minister Stephen Harper.

Armstrong said the repetition of the COVID-19 benefit-specific phrases also helped to build up familiarity with new programs. “Emergency Response Benefit” — referring to the Canada Emergency Response Benefit of $2,000 a month to out of wok Canadians — was in the top-five most said three-word phrases, and “wage subsidy” was in the top five two-word phrases spoken.

“What he's attempting to do there is to get people familiar with the name of any program… When you're working on that, repetition is your friend,” she said.

STRUCTURE SUITS THE PM

Strategic communication professional and political commentator Scott Reid said that the formula of “political communication by dint of news conference” has become a go-to form of communicating COVID-19 crisis updates around the world and across Canada, where provincial premiers have all taken a similar approach.

The format plays to Trudeau’s strengths, Reid said, contrasting the PM’s comfort and skill delivering on-message remarks without relying on rote responses to the communication approach of other world leaders including U.S. President Donald Trump, who Reid said failed at being consistent in his messaging and shut down his routine of regular press conferences long before Trudeau did.

“A crisis such as this, which has created a made-for-television daily news conference, it's almost perfectly built for his [Trudeau’s] talent set and instincts because he has a preternatural sense of self… He's extraordinarily conscious of his presentation and of his representation to the public, and that serves him extremely well in this situation,” said Reid, who also worked as an adviser to former prime minister Paul Martin.

Keller noted that opting to keep Trudeau’s addresses to the high-level details and letting a cadre of ministers follow after him to take reporters’ more detailed questions also meant that Trudeau was usually out of the spotlight by midday, rather than facing reporters and opposition MPs multiple throughout the entire day.

“It quite frankly has worked for them,” said Keller, adding that all of the opposition parties found it challenging to compete with.

BOOST TO APPROVAL RATING

The more frequent prime ministerial appearances also had positive returns on his approval ratings, according to CTV News’ pollster and Chair of Nanos Research, Nik Nanos.

“What I'll call the ‘relentless chain of press conferences’ … they've effectively done a bit of a reset on his brand,” Nanos said. “There's been a complete reset on Justin Trudeau’s personal brand. His brand is now strong again— it's not as strong as the honeymoon [phase]— but it's strong and the Liberal numbers are strong.”

Nanos Research asks Canadians weekly whether they feel the various federal party leaders have the qualities of a good political leader, and Trudeau’s trend line shows that Canadians surveyed are viewing him more positively since March than they have in the entirety of the last four years.

KEY MOMENTS LIKE 'SPEAKING MOISTLY'

These routine speeches also provided several key moments over the initial four months of the COVID-19 pandemic, from Trudeau’s infamous “speaking moistly” slip-up when describing how the coronavirus can transmit through droplets, to his conspicuously long pause when asked about Trump's handling of anti-racism protesters in the United States.

While the combination of “speaking” and “moistly” was swiftly removed from Trudeau’s lexicon, Armstrong said even when such moments inspire mockery, they are generally well-received.

“That ended up being really funny at a time when people needed to laugh right? And he's, he's very much able to laugh at himself in moments like that,” she said of Trudeau. She cited the first time that he spoke directly to children as another notable moment.

“Kids are an overlooked constituency… They're not even spoken to directly by people in power very often. But they are feeling and experiencing this moment, in a very, very profound way, and I as a mom, and as a citizen, and as a communicator, I really love that he acknowledged that,” she said.

WHY THE ADDRESSES ENDED

By the time Trudeau said he’d be cutting down his regular press conferences, the announcements he was making had already become incremental and small, while the questions he faced were predominately about non-COVID-19 news.

The political communication experts CTVNews.ca spoke with largely agreed that, while the near-daily addresses were key in reassuring Canadians that the federal government was on top of the rapidly unfolding crisis early on, continuing to come out and face reporters was having diminishing positive returns for the prime minister as other big news stories began to bubble up, notably the ongoing WE Charity controversy.

Another reason some suggest could explain why Trudeau’s team opted to wind down what some critics call “the morning show”? Canadians had begun tuning them out.

“I think that they've rightly recognized that should there be a second wave, should there be a need to start communicating again on a daily basis in a way that was happening in March for example, they don't want to kind of burn the goodwill and the listening potential of the audience by continuing to speak every day if there's not something new to share,” said Kate Harrison, vice president at Summa Strategies Canada and Conservative political commentator.

WILL SEE THIS FORMAT AGAIN

Going forward, the experts interviewed said to expect the format to resume should there be a new resurgence in the virus’ spread.

Reid said that if there is a second wave of COVID-19 infections, the public and the media has come to expect the prime minister will be front-and-centre.

“This is now how it is done. It has quietly become a matter of consensus among political leaders, media, public audiences, that this is how this gets prosecuted, and so it will recur, and it will overwhelmingly benefit political leaders who are capable of commanding the podium and follow those very simple rules of being thematic, being consistent, demonstrating empathy,” Reid said.

Methodology: For this project we used the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) in Python to run a word frequency and N-gram analysis on the transcripts. An N-gram analysis counts the occurrences of two or more words together. The code stripped the transcripts to leave only those words spoken by Trudeau in English.

The book, ""Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World's Most Dangerous Man,"" went on sale Tuesday and portrays President Trump in an unflattering light.

Just two weeks ago, Simon & Schuster celebrated the success of another Trump tell-all book, that one by former National Security Adviser John Bolton. The book, ""The Room Where It Happened,"" sold more than 780,000 copies in its first week of sales.

It is rare for books to sell hundreds of thousands of copies in a single week of sales -- and most books will never sell that many.

""Too Much and Never Enough"" will join other books about Trump that became sensational best-sellers.

""Fear"" by legendary journalist Bob Woodward had sold 900,000 copies by the end of its first day of official sales.

And ""Fire & Fury,"" the hit book by Michael Wolff, sold more than 1.7 million copies by the time it had been out for a month.

The sales reflect a significant appetite for books that offer inside accounts of the Trump administration.

In some cases, Trump or his allies have sought to block unflattering books about him, which can backfire and provide an additional publicity boost to the books.

It may be possible to gauge your interest in “Dirt Music,” a new film on VOD starring Garrett Hedlund and Kelly Macdonald, by its advertising tagline. “Lose Yourself… Find Yourself… In Love.” That inspirational, Nicholas Sparks-style slogan tells you all you need to know about this movie. Much like the story itself, it’s vague, involves love but what does it really mean?

Stretched over two hours the film sees Macdonald play Georgie Jutland, a former nurse now playing step mother to the two sons of her new boyfriend, crayfish magnate, Jim Buckridge (David Wenham). Life in the tiny Australian fishing port of White Point is uneventful and unhappy until Georgie slips out for a midnight swim. While splashing around in the cleansing waters she meets Luther Fox (Garret Hedlund), a fish poacher plying his illegal trade. It is love at first sight and soon the two begin a passionate affair.

Luther is an enigma, a man with a tragic past. His family gone, he drifts though the world, mourning their loss. He’s a damaged guy who abruptly leaves White Point when it appears Buckridge has discovered the affair with Georgie. He heads north to the remote Coronation Island, looking for solitude and safety. Unable and unwilling to let him go, Georgie, with Buckridge‘s unlikely assistance, embarks on an epic search to find her love.

“Dirt Music” is a story of longing that turns out to be just too long. At a hair over two hours it is a feast for the eyes—the Australian landscape is breathtaking—but the story is as under developed as the film’s terse tagline. Considering the epic nature of Georgie’s search for Luther, these star-crossed lovers spend very little on-screen time together. Certainly not enough for the depth of the connection to be made clear. The result is a bit of a head-scratching exercise in lust and longing. Despite the soaring Australian temperature the pair barely have time to generate the heat needed to make us care when they are torn apart.

The story telling in “Dirt Music” trades in melodrama while Macdonald and Hedlund are playing it straight. She’s an open book, he’s broody whose hobby seems to be staring blankly into the ether. Both are bound by grief but the very thing that connects them feels at odds with the film’s over-dramatic edge.

FROM THE VINE: 3 STARS

“From the Vine” breathes the same fragrant air as “Under the Tuscan Sun,” “A Good Year” and any number of other movies that offer up beautiful scenery and a stripped-down way of life as a tonic for the soul.

In a rare leading role Joe Pantoliano stars as Marco Gentile, an Italian born CEO of a Canadian automobile company. He’s at a crossroads in his life. Tired of the grind and troubled by an unkept promise he made years ago, he throws it all away. Without consulting his wife Marina (Wendy Crewson) he quits his high-paying job and makes a plan to hightail it to the tiny town of Acerenza, site of his grandfather’s old vineyard in Italy. There he hopes to reconnect to a way of life that will help him find his centre and regain his moral compass. But will his new beginning spell an end to old relationships?

There is a sense of déjà vu that comes along with watching “From the Vine.” Like the movies I mentioned above, it’s a beautifully shot travelogue with that follows a familiar path. Adding some spark are engaging performances from the cast.

Pantoliano plays Marco as a man having an extreme mid-life crisis, but it’s not about buying a Maserati or trading in his starter wife for someone younger. He’s having an actual existential crisis brought on by the realization that the life he leads isn’t the life he wants. To illustrate his dilemma director Sean Cisterna adds in a few surreal Felliniesque flourishes, but the heart of the character comes from Pantoliano’s rough-hewn charm.

As Marco’s long-suffering wife, Crewson brings warmth and a considerable amount of heart.

“From the Vine” doesn’t add anything new to the soul-searching travelogue genre but the point of these movies is not to reinvent the wheel. Like rom coms, the most formulaic variety of mass entertainment there is, it’s about the journey not the individual stops along the way. Sure, the story is predictable but it exudes good vibes and tries to appeal to our better natures and these days maybe that’s enough.

TARGET NUMBER ONE: 3 ½ STARS

“Target Number One” is a Canadian true crime story, but no, it’s not a retelling of Bill Miner’s railway robbery or the great Canadian Maple Syrup Heist of 2012. It’s a gritty look at investigative reporter Victor Malarek’s fight to uncover the truth behind a heroin bust orchestrated the Canadian Security Intelligence Service put an innocent man in jail.

A the-names-have-been-changed-to-protect-the-innocent retelling of the case of Alain Olivier, called Daniel Léger (Antoine Olivier Pilon) in the film, the movie stars Josh Hartnett as Malarek, a Globe and Mail reporter whose dogged determination reveals how the CSIS framed Léger, sending him to a Thai jail for eight years.

“I’d be very careful before you print anything about this case,” a high-level cop tells Malarek.

Telling the tale on a broken timeline, director Daniel Roby skip through the details, building both sides of the story simultaneously until the two threads meld, but “Target Number One” isn’t an action movie. There is tension as Léger‘s situation worsens but the compelling part is Malarek’s search for the truth. It’s a procedural the takes its time putting the puzzle pieces in place.

Hartnett does a good impression of the driven reporter and Steven McHattie turns in another of his trademark edgy roles as Frank Cooper, a crooked RCMP officer, but it’s the work of Jim Gaffigan and Pilon that are memorable.

Gaffigan ditches his affable stand-up comic persona to create a medicine portrayal of Glen Picker, a drug dealer and police confidant.

As Léger, Pilon as an arc. From lowlife criminal, whose big score is ripping off a gas station for a full tank, to someone who can navigate survival in a squalid Thai prison, he’s simultaneously vulnerable and edgy and that makes him the film’s most memorable character.

“Target Number One” is a low-key thriller, short on action but long on intrigue.

BLOODY NOSE, EMPTY POCKETS: 4 STARS

A truly great bar doesn’t just dispense drinks. Forget about bottle service and VIP booths, a great bar specializes in good will, community and acceptance for all who enter their doors. That’s the case with the Roaring ’20s, the dive bar that serves as the backdrop for “Bloody Nose, Empty Pockets,” a new hybrid documentary that comes to virtual cinemas this week.

It’s last call at Roaring Twenties, a threadbare bar way off the strip in Las Vegas. It’s the kind of place where the bartender says, “The best part of waking up is bourbon in your cup,” as he spikes a customer’s coffee with a shot.

Set to close forever on the eve of the 2016 election, it’s populated by regulars like former actor Michael, who declares, “I prised myself on not having become an alcoholic until after I was already a failure. Alcoholic failures are the worst.” He’s joined by a loud drunk who occasionally flashes her breasts at the bar, a veteran with a thousand-yard stare and Lowell, a good-natured free spirit. Others come and go, like John, the Australian who brings a box of donuts for everyone and downs beer after beer before dropping acid and heading out for a night of tripping.

Others come and go, fights brew, tears are spilled and Michael philosophizes about a life spent staring at the bottom of a shot glass.

“There is nothing more boring than a guy who used to do stuff,” he says, “but doesn’t do stuff anymore because he’s in a bar.”

He emerges as the central character, someone who essentially lives at the bar—he often sleeps on the overstuffed couch in the back, and will become homeless when they put the lock on the door for the final time.

“Blood Nose, Empty Pockets” isn’t story driven as much as it is a portrait of a time and place. But it’s also not a documentary in the strictest sense. Directors Bill and Turner Ross shoot cinéma verité (""truthful cinema"") style but the story is a bit of a fib. The bar is actually located in New Orleans and is still open. The regulars are folks recruited from local bars brought together to participate in a preplanned story arc. That’s not to say here weren’t surprises. John’s acid trip was impromptu as was a scene featuring a pair of veterans who shed tears remembering fallen friends.

Like a Cassavetes film, “Bloody Nose, Empty Pockets” is an experimental combination of documentary and fiction that favors characters and a sense of place over traditional story-telling. It’s rough and tumble, like the people it portrays. The rough-hewn sound and the hand held camera work creates the feel of having been sitting at the bar from morning to night. Conversations overlap, the images blur as a growing sense of melancholy settles over the film in its closing minutes.

Real or not, what “Bloody Nose, Empty Pockets” does best is show the community that exists at the Roaring 20s bar. The regulars have a bond, brought together by booze and friendship, that allows them to overlook one another’s personality peccadillos. It’s a community that looks after one another, where support means stopping a fight or having a too-close conversation with someone you just met. No bottle service, just barstool prophets and some plain, unvarnished truth. Even if the story is a set-up.

THE SUNLIT NIGHT: 2 ½ STARS

“The Sunlit Night,” a new Jenny Slate comedy now on VOD, feels like a throwback to the oddball indie films of recent decades. No detail is too twee, no setting too obscure. The viewer is reminded of a flood of titles like “Everything Is Illuminated” and “Amelie” come to mind, movies where the quirk factor is set to the max.

Jenny Slate plays Frances, a young woman following in the footsteps of her parents. All three are frustrated artists.

“Maybe I’m not an artist,” she says. “Maybe I’m just the daughter of two other artists.”

After one spectacularly bad day that sees her break up with her rich boyfriend, get critically savaged by her art professors, find out her lawyer sister is engaged, and her parents (David Paymer and Jessica Hecht) are splitting up. As if that wasn’t enough, she gets denied an apprenticeship in Tokyo. Rather than live with her father in his tiny studio she accepts another, less than desirable offer—“He fired his last assistant and now he needs someone to paint a barn, using only the colour yellow.”—with reclusive artist Nils (Fridtjov Såheim) in the far, far north of Norway.

“This is where you go when you are exiled,” she says.

Her new life in Lofoten takes some getting used to. She is a fish out of water, the sun never sets, small goats invade her trailer, and the job is a slog, essentially a large paint by numbers project that leaves her little or no time to work on her own paintings. Still, she finds time to explore the nearby Viking Museum run by ex-pat American (Zach Galifianakis) and, despite telling her mother that she is “closed for business,"" a potential love interest in Yasha (Alex Sharp), a Brooklyn baker who has travelled to the top of the world to give his late father, and not just the ashes, but the whole corpse, a traditional Viking funeral.

“The Sunlit Night” has something to offer after a radical rethink following brutal reviews at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival. It’s still a bit sloppy and a little too whimsically weird for its own sake, but Slate and a fun cameo from Gillian Anderson as Yasha’s mother do much of the heavy lifting. Most of the other characters seem to exist simply to add flavour to Frances’ rather colourless journey to find herself.

No amount of re-editing could get “The Sunlit Night” past the basic premise of outsiders navigating the strange Arctic Circle surroundings, but Slate brings charm to a story that otherwise may have been devoid of any realistic or interesting human behaviour.",[]

The actress spoke to Seth Meyers on his late night show Tuesday night about the attention she has received and who is responsible for the wall-to-wall brown carpet.

""That originally was a Bruce Willis choice, not to put it off on him,"" Moore said of her ex-husband's decision to carpet the bathroom of their Idaho home.

She went on to say that it's not actually that odd considering the home is in the mountains and it gets ""very cold.""

The fascination into Moore's loo began after she tweeted a few images of her recording her new podcast, ""Dirty Diana"" sitting in there on a mini couch. Almost immediately, fans began commenting on the carpet and the Joan of Arc statue.

She says she opted to record the podcast in her bathroom because the acoustics were better. The six-episode series, created by director Shana Feste, launched Monday. It stars Moore as Diana, who is helping women record their fantasies -- which she then sells on the internet.

But confusion remains over whether he's actually running.

A representative for West filed the necessary paperwork and paid the US$35,000 filing Wednesday afternoon, which was the deadline for a spot on the state's Nov. 3 presidential ballot, said Oklahoma Board of Elections spokeswoman Misha Mohr. He was one of three independent presidential candidates to pay the filing fee prior to the deadline, she added. The others were concert pianist Jade Simmons and cryptocurrency entrepreneur Brock Pierce.

The filing came a day after New York Magazine's ""Intelligencer"" quoted West adviser Steve Kramer saying ""he's out"" and noting that the staff he had hired were disappointed.

However, TMZ reported that the West campaign had filed a ""Statement of Organization"" Wednesday with the Federal Election Commission, stating that a Kanye 2020 committee would serve as principal campaign committee for a West candidacy.

West has already missed the deadline to qualify for the ballot in several states, and it's unclear if he is willing or able to collect enough signatures required to qualify in others.

West, who is married to reality television star Kim Kardashian West, initially announced his candidacy on July 4. Days later, he told Forbes magazine that he, who once praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said the two share ""dragon energy,"" was ""taking the red hat off"" -- a reference to Trump's trademark red ""Make America Great Again"" cap.

West, who said that he had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, told the magazine that he planned to model his White House on the fictional land in ""Black Panther"" if he won the presidency, adding ""Let's get back to Wakanda.""",[]

In a video conference call with parties in the case, Judge Curtis Farber ordered the Oscar-winning ""Jerry Maguire"" actor to appear in person on Aug. 11 for a hearing on pretrial matters. Farber said he's looking to get the case back on track after months of pandemic-related delays. Gooding said he's been hunkered down at home.

Gooding, 52, has pleaded not guilty to charges alleging he violated three different women at three different Manhattan night spots in 2018 and 2019. One of the women alleged Gooding pinched her buttocks. Another said he squeezed her breast.

He had been scheduled to go on trial in April, but that was scuttled as virus cases surged in New York and the state shut down most court matters. Now that the number of new positive cases and hospitalizations are down in New York, courts are starting to reopen.

No new trial date for Gooding has been set.

Gooding's lawyers have until July 31 to give prosecutors the names of witnesses and other evidence they plan to present, Farber said.

Gooding's lawyer, Mark Heller, has called the case a waste of ""taxpayers' money, resources and time.""

Farber previously ruled that prosecutors can call two additional women to testify about their allegations that Gooding also violated them. Those women, whose claims did not result in criminal charges, were among 19 other accusers whom prosecutors were seeking to call as witnesses.",[]

Scholastic announced that Cole, a resident of Sioux City, Iowa, died Sunday. The cause was idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

""Joanna Cole had the perfect touch for blending science and story,"" Scholastic Chairman and CEO Dick Robinson said in a statement Wednesday. ""Joanna's books, packed with equal parts humour and information, made science both easy to understand and fun for the hundreds of millions of children around the world who read her books and watched the award-winning television series.""

The idea for ""The Magic School Bus"" came in the mid-1980s. Scholastic senior editorial director Craig Walker was receiving frequent requests from teachers for books about science and thought a combination of storytelling and science would catch on. He brought in Cole, whose humorous work such as the children's book ""Cockroaches"" he had admired, and illustrator Bruce Degen. With the ever maddening but inspired Ms. Frizzle leading her students on journeys that explored everything from the solar system to underwater, ""Magic School Bus"" books have sold tens of millions of copies and were the basis for a popular animated TV series and a Netflix series. Plans for a live-action movie, with Elizabeth Banks as Ms. Frizzle, were announced last month. Ms. Frizzle was based in part on a fifth-grade teacher of Cole's.

""I think for Joanna the excitement was always in the idea. What? Why? How?"" Degen said in a statement. ""And with ""The Magic School Bus"" it was how to explain it so that it is accurate and in a form that a kid can understand and use. And you can actually joke around while you are learning. She had a rare sense of what could be humorous.""

Cole and Degen recently completed ""The Magic School Bus Explores Human Evolution,"" scheduled to come out next spring.

“I suffered gunshot wounds, as a result of a crime that was committed against me and done with the intention to physically harm me,” the 25-year-old Texan whose legal name is Megan Pete wrote in an Instagram post, without saying who shot her or why. “I'm incredibly grateful to be alive and that I'm expected to make a full recovery.”

Los Angeles police had no immediate comment on the incident in the Hollywood Hills early Sunday. But Officer Jeff Lee confirmed that rapper Tory Lanez, who was with Pete that evening, was arrested on a concealed weapons charge.

Lee said the Instagram post has been pointed out to the detectives in the case, who are looking into it.

Lanez was released after posting bail later Sunday, Los Angeles County jail records showed.

Messages left with representatives for the two rappers seeking more details were not immediately returned.

Pete said she wanted to correct an inaccurate narrative about what happened that evening, apparently referring to a TMZ story on Lanez's arrest that said she was treated only for broken glass in her foot, and did not mention gunfire.

Pete said on Instagram that “the police officers drove me to the hospital where I underwent surgery to remove the bullets,” adding that “it was important for me to clarify the details about this traumatic night.”

Megan Thee Stallion has seen a serious recent rise on the rap and pop music scene, topping the all-genre Billboard Hot 100 chart this year with her Beyonce-assisted remix of “Savage,” which had a viral moment on the video-sharing platform TikTok. The song is from her nine-track album “Suga,” which was released in March and helped the performer win best female hip-hop artist at last month's BET Awards, besting Cardi B, Nicki Minaj and Lizzo.

She's also scored Top 40 pop hits with “Hot Girl Summer,” “Cash Shit” and the recent single “Girls in the Hood.”

“Suga” comes after the release of the projects “Fever” and “Tina Snow” that helped establish Stallion's name in music. Last year she made the 2019 TIME 100 Next List, was named one of the AP's Breakthrough Entertainers of the Year, won prizes at the MTV Video Music Awards and BET Hip-Hop Awards, and was honoured by Variety and Billboard magazines.

The agreement will be presented Friday to the Superior Court of Quebec for approval to become the new so-called stalking horse bid for any rival offers that may be presented next month.

A lawyer representing Quebecor suggested last week that the media conglomerate intended to make a bid.

The shareholders -- the Texan fund TPG Capital, the Chinese firm Fosun and the Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec -- presented a US$420-million bid June 29 when Cirque filed for creditor protection. They were counting on a US$200-million loan from the Quebec government.

The shareholders and Cirque agreed to terminate the agreement, said a Cirque statement Thursday.

""The shareholder's proposed agreement, which had set the bar for other bids, assured a path to survival following the forced closure of all of the shows resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic by providing the company funding, support, and a clear road map to relaunch,"" said the statement.

The lenders, who hold about $1 billion of the Cirque's secured debt, would inject up to $375 million, create a fund to retain employees and pay ex-workers and artisans, and maintain the company's head office in Montreal, according to a source familiar with the matter, but who is not allowed to speak publicly.

""The co-operation of the group of creditors has been extraordinary in order to achieve our objective of recapitalizing the Cirque,"" Gabriel de Alba, the managing director and partner of Catalyst Capital Group, the main creditor, said in a statement.

Deprived of income since mid-March due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Cirque cancelled its 44 shows and cut nearly 3,500 people.

The examination, performed the day after the 33-year-old's body was found in a Southern California lake, showed no signs of traumatic injury or disease that might have contributed to the drowning, and gave no initial indication that drugs or alcohol may have played a role in her death, the Ventura County Medical Examiner said in a statement.

Dental records were used to confirm Rivera's identity, and routine toxicology tests will be performed for the presence of drugs and alcohol, the statement said.

Rivera was found in Lake Piru on Monday, five days after she disappeared while boating with her 4-year-old son, who was found asleep and alone on the boat hours later. The autopsy's findings were all consistent with the expectations of the Sheriff's Office, which conducted the search and investigation.

While we grieve the loss of our beautiful legend, we are blessed to honour her everlasting legacy and magnetic spirit.""

The statement said Rivera was ""an amazing talent, but was an even greater person, mother, daughter and sister ... Heaven gained our sassy angel.""

The family thanked the search teams for their ""commitment and unwavering effort to find Naya.""

The creators of ""Glee"" also released a statement in tribute to Rivera Tuesday, announcing that they would be creating a college fund for her son and remembering her as a joyful and immensely talented performer.

159,159,159,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/entertainment/movie-reviews-greyhound-a-naval-thriller-propelled-by-action-1.5015264,Movie reviews: 'Greyhound' a naval thriller propelled by action,,2020-07-10,"GREYHOUND: 4 ½ STARS

Tom Hanks is the above the title star of “Greyhound,” a new naval thriller now streaming on Apple TV+, but the star of the film is the tension that takes hold in the first ten minutes and does not let go.

Set during the onset of the United States' involvement in the Second World War, Hanks plays Commander Ernest Krause, a stoic sailor on his first command. His mission is to lead an international convoy of 37 Allied ships across the North Atlantic with a wolfpack of German U-boats in hot pursuit. Running out of depth charges and fuel, the convoy needs air cover, which is hours away.

That’s it. “Greyhound” isn’t so much story driven as it is propelled by the action. In a breathless ninety minutes director Aaron Schneider, working from a script written by Hanks, adapted from C. S. Forester’s 1955 book “The Good Shepherd,” ratchets up tension, creating an old-fashioned action movie that mines a life and death situation for real cinematic thrills. That being said, there’s no fight scenes, you never see the face of the enemy and the only dead bodies are wrapped in linen, getting a proper burial at sea.

Inspired by the Battle of the Atlantic, the movie takes place completely on board the USS Keeling (Call sign ""Greyhound""). Krause is in the ship’s claustrophobic helm for ninety percent of the running time, barking orders, peering through binoculars, making hard decisions with consequences that will affect the lives of hundreds of people.

Hanks plays Krause as a man with nerves of steel who hides his concern behind his furrowed brow. In the heat of battle every second counts and both Hanks and Schneider understand that the mental gymnastics required to do the job must be front and centre. This is a movie where the fiercest action is verbal. Sure, there’s gunfire, torpedoes and explosions, but the exciting stuff comes from Krause’s mental perspective. Never have coordinated turn equations and rudder work been this exciting.

“Greyhound” was originally set for a theatrical release. The more sweeping shots, those of the ships as specks in the vast ocean, feel like they would have benefited from the big screen treatment, but the story, driven by intellect, the effectiveness of team effort, and old-fashioned thrills, works well in any format.

THE OLD GUARD: 2 ½ STARS

“The Old Guard,” a new superhero flick starring Charlize Theron on Netflix, has the earmarks of an action flick, but brings the genre kicking and screaming into the twenty-first century by focusing the story on not just one, but two female characters.

Theron channels the dark side that made her characters in “Mad Max: Fury Road” and “Atomic Blonde” so compelling. She’s Andy, a tough-as-nails immortal mercenary with the power to heal herself, no matter how deep the wound.

“She has devised more ways to kill than entire armies will ever know,” says unkillable sidekick, and former soldier for Napoleon, Booker (Matthias Schoenaerts). For centuries they have fought the good fight—depending on which side you take—along with Joe (Marwan Kenzari) and Nicky (Luca Marinelli), sticking up for the maltreated and oppressed. “Through history, we’ve protected this world,” says Andy, “fighting in the shadows.”

In modern day they come across Nile (KiKi Layne), a Marine who shares their “extremely rare skillset.” “She stabbed me,” Andy says admiringly, “I think she has potential.”

Nile is the first of their kind they have come across since 1812 and soon they recruit her to join their ranks. “You haven’t figured this out yet?” Andy asks her. “You can’t die.” At the same time a mad-scientist big pharma type (Harry Melling) sets his sights on them as lab rats in his experiments to find a cure for death. “If we can unlock their genetic code, the entire world will be begging us for the key.”

“The Old Guard” is an action film, with carefully staged and exciting fight scenes, but first and foremost it’s a set-up for a franchise. Like an action-packed trailer for a movie it teases the possibility of the next film. The origin story is talky, illustrated by flashbacks, while the main plot is resolved quickly in a hail of bullets and a few swings of an axe. Then the set up begins, as they hint at further adventures. Trouble is, I’m not sure “The Old Guard’s” appeal is as immortal as its characters.

Theron and Layne are strong characters who deliver in the fist-to-the-face action department, but the movie doesn’t let them shine. As mentioned, the fight scenes are well staged but their relationship is never fully developed. Everyone, except for Melling who appears amped up on something he didn’t share with the rest of the cast, is on a slow simmer which gives the movie a laid-back vibe which doesn’t spark interest.

“The Old Guard” does a good thing by placing two women at the center of an action movie but the all-set-up all-the-time script doesn’t do the characters or the movie any favors.

FISHERMAN’S FRIENDS: 3 ½ STARS

Another entry in the Real-Life-Underdog-Brits-Overcoming-Adversity genre of movies—think “The Full Monty,” “Calendar Girls” and more recently “Military Wives”—“Fisherman’s Friends,” now on VOD, is a good-natured crowd pleaser with some deep laughs but no major surprises.

Daniel Mays is Danny, a “proper bigshot” London music biz executive, on a quick weekend get-a-way with some mates in Port Isaac in Cornwall. They are fish out of water in the village. The locals poke fun at their city-slicker ways, treating them like outsiders. “We have our ways down here,” Jim (James Purefoy) warns Danny, “and once you cross the River Tamar you’re not in England anymore. We’re a land apart. You get my drift, son?”

After hearing a local group of fishermen, led by Jim, Jago (David Hayman) and Leadville (Dave Johns), singing a cappella sea shanties Danny’s pals jokingly convince him that he should sign the band to a record contract. He’s skeptical at first, but there’s something about the music that speaks to his soul. But first, he has to persuade the fishermen who are suspicious of his motives. “We have no need to sell our souls for fifteen minutes of fame,” Jim tells him.

His friends can’t believe he fell for the joke. “Do you really think we’d sign a boy band with the combined age of 643?”

But, convinced the public will want to see real people with real talent communicating 500 years of naval history, Danny perseveres. “In a world saturated with manufactured pop bands,” he says, “the fishermen are a real catch.” Plus, he’s fallen for life in the village and Jim’s daughter Alwyn (Tuppence Middleton).

The story of the band’s success is almost stranger than fiction. In real life The Fisherman's Friends “buoy band” signed a contract with Island Records and their debut went on to become the biggest selling traditional folk album of all time.

“Fisherman’s Friends” keeps the bones of the real story but amps up the big emotional moments. The highs soar and the lows have a heartfelt sentimentality. None of it quite feels like reality but by the time the end credits roll it’s clear that Port Isaac in Cornwall is a nice place to visit for 115 minutes.

“Fisherman’s Friends” is formulaic, clearly manipulative, and any sense of subtlety was clearly cut adrift around the second draft of the script but the story’s feel-good underdog story mixed with innate messages of decency and loyalty make it as refreshing as a gust of sea air in our cynical times. “We stick together down here,” Says Jago. “One and all. That’s the difference between sinking or swimming in a place like this.” A good message, even when delivered with a heavy hand.

WHITE RIOT: 4 STARS

The cultural, moral and emotional impact that music has is undeniable. Songs like “Times They Are A-Changin’,” “Them Belly Full (But We Hungry),"" and “What’s Going On” or events like Live Aid or The Concert for Bangladesh brought with them societal change by mobilizing music fans to action. “White Riot,” new documentary from director Rubika Shah streaming on Virtual Cinema Screening sites (see below), details the fight between Rock Against Racism and Britain’s National Front.

In the macro the film’s story is set against the rise of xenophobic politician Enoch Powell and violent, far-right hate group the National Front. Language that would get anyone kicked off Twitter or cancelled today was casually tossed around in the papers and on television. In one inspired sequence Shah pieces together a montage of outrageous racist remarks pulled from mainstream sitcoms.

In August 1976 guitarist Eric Clapton, whose entire career was based on the elements of blues created by Black American musicians, added his voice to the rhetoric, endorsing Powell from a stage in a drunken rant.

“I think Enoch’s right,” he said. “I think we should send them all back. Stop Britain from becoming a Black colony. Get the foreigners out.""

His comments caught the attention of music photographer Red Saunders who wrote a letter to the music press, calling for rock to be a force against racism. Bigtime outlets like NME, Melody Maker and Sounds all published the letter. The resulting and overwhelming response from like-minded Brits inspired Saunders to create the grassroots movement, Rock Against Racism (RAR) and a fanzine, Temporary Hoarding geared toward reporting on the stories the mainstream press ignored.

“Our job,” Saunders says, “was to peel away the Union Jack to reveal the swastika.”

Their reports on immigration and the police’s racist “suspected persons” powers among other hot button topics appealed to a generation of young people who embraced new ideas politically and musically, in the form of rebel music, punk rock and reggae.

Despite violent resistance from the National Front RAR persevered and “White Riot” ends, not at the end of Rock Against Racism’s mandate—they remained a potent force until 1982—but with their first massive public outing, 1978’s Carnival Against the Nazis. Headlined by The Clash, Steel Pulse and Tom Robinson, it attracted 100,000 people who began marching a march at Trafalgar Square, before the concert at Victoria Park.

“White Riot” pieces together archival footage, like unsettling shots of National Front supporters parading through London, recent interviews with the main RAR players and piles of ephemera, like old gig posters, punk badges and photos, to define the film’s time and place. Shah weaves the elements together, punctuating the info with sonic blasts of music courtesy of live footage of The Clash, The Selecter, Sham 69, Steel Pulse and others.

It is compelling stuff and even though it details a time more than forty years ago it doesn’t feel dated. Racism and rise of neo-fascism are still with us but “White Riot” reminds the viewer that resistance not only comes in many forms but that fighting the good fight is never out of date.

VOLITION: 3 ½ STARS

James (Adrian Glynn McMorran) is a young man with extra sensory perception, but is it an ability or an affliction? That is the question asked in “Volition,” a new thriller now on VOD.

“They say when you die, your whole life flashes before your eyes,” James says in the opening minutes of the movie. “I wish it were that simple.” It’s a signal of sorts to the viewer that nothing in the next ninety minutes is going to be simple or follow the accepted rules.

James, a clairvoyant, makes his money using his insight into the future and doing odd jobs for local crime outfits. On one such job, involving a load of stolen diamonds and a gangster named

Ray (John Cassini), James intuits a bad end for the caper and himself. With the help of a stranger, Angela (Magda Apanowicz), he tries to find a path to alter the future and his fate.

“Volition” is a mix-and-match of speculative fiction and neo-noir crime drama. Driven by ideas rather than special effects, it favors intellect over action, philosophy over fisticuffs. There are tense scenes and gun play but, like movies such as “Looper” or “Next,” it uses time as an ever fluctuating, nonlinear construct.

The bending of the sequence of time makes for some heady filmmaking but the story never allows itself to get lost amid the twists and turns. Director Tony Dean Smith, who co-wrote the script with brother Ryan W. Smith, teases out the thrills and the head-scratching in equal measure, making for a film made up of fragments, to come together to form one fascinating mosaic.",[]

In the now-shuttered world of musical theatre, the name “Hamilton” is said in hushed reverential tones. The groundbreaking show, which mixes-and-matches hip hop, R&B, pop, soul and traditional show tunes to tell the story of American Founding Father Alexander Hamilton, was called “the phenomenon of the season, perhaps of a generation,” by Forbes.

Its appeal to a younger audience, who packed NYC’s Richard Rodgers Theater night after night, gave Broadway a desperately needed shot in the arm and at one point the show was responsible for more than 5% of the Broadway districts total gross.

A new, filmed version, headed by creator Lin-Manuel Miranda, offers up a chance for people who couldn’t afford to blow a mortgage payment on tickets to the original production to watch the show from the comfort of their Disney+ stream.

The movie, shot in June 2016 at the height of “Hamilton”-mania is anything but hushed or reverential. The show, which features a diverse cast including Black, LatinX and Asian actors to tell the story described as being about “America then, as told by America now,” is passionately political, raucously rebellious and emotionally deep.

“Just like my country, I’m young, scrappy and hungry,” Miranda sings in a phrase that could be about the musical as much as it is Hamilton’s personality.

A toe-tapping history lesson, the show details the American Dream life of Hamilton, from an outsider born to unwed parents on the Caribbean island of Nevis to war hero to George Washington's Revolutionary War aide, and, as first Secretary of Treasury under Washington's administration, the founder of America’s economic system. It’s a bootstrap story about legacy, reputation, honor and if that wasn’t enough, there’s an extra-marital affair and, of course, the fateful duel with Aaron Burr.

Director Thomas Kail, who also directed the show’s Off-Broadway and Broadway productions, keeps the camera work to a minimum, simply and effectively capturing the show from a front row center perspective. It’s handsome work that tries to preserve the integrity of the live presentation while still creating a kind of cinematic experience.

As far as the show goes, what the filmed “Hamilton” presents is a moment in time when the musical lived at the very center of pop culture. The original cast, including Miranda, Phillipa Soo, Leslie Odom Jr., Daveed Diggs and Jonathan Groff among many others, are working in peak form.

As a document of a special show the filmed version doesn’t add anything to the presentation, but perhaps that’s the point. Miranda’s daring, genre busting show speaks for itself, often with beautiful tongue-twisting wordplay, and doesn’t need flashy cinematic theatrics to bolster what is already a provocative and timely story of creating a union where none existed.

SHIRLEY: 3 ½ STARS

When reclusive author Shirley Jackson died in 1965 she left behind a body of work, including “The Haunting of Hill House,” a supernatural horror novel sometimes called one of the best ghost stories ever written.

An influence on two generations of speculative fiction writers like Neil Gaiman, Stephen King, Sarah Waters and Richard Matheson, she is brought to vivid life in a new fictionalized drama, now on VOD, starring Elisabeth Moss.

Set just after the publication of “The Lottery,” a controversial short story about the ritual sacrifice of a town citizen to ensure good crops, published in a 1948 issue of The New Yorker, the film sees Shirley (Moss) paralyzed by the expectations that hang heavy over “Hangsaman,” a novel she is struggling to complete. Prickly and quick with a line, she is less than pleased when Stanley (Michael Stuhlbarg), her college professor husband, arranges for his new assistant Fred Nemser (Logan Lerman) and his pregnant wife Rose (Odessa Young) to live in their house while the young couple searches for a place of their own.

As the days and weeks stretch into months the relationship between the two couples becomes a blend of art and reality, a claustrophobic rabbit hole where Rose becomes the model for Shirley’s new main character, a college student who went walking on Vermont's Long Trail hiking route and never returned.

“Shirley” uses elements of Jackson’s life but places them in context of one of her novels. The result is a psychological drama; a haunting look at a person driven to agoraphobia by the weight of her success and a domineering, philandering husband.

Moss is fascinating as the title character. Her take on Shirley is that of a woman who has lived under years of oppression by her bullying husband, a man whose misogyny has left her embittered, desperate and anxious.

“To our suffering,” Stanley says as a toast to his wife. “There’s not enough Scotch in the world for that,” Shirley snorts, in a line that could have been borrowed from “Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” She’s vulnerable and filled with rage, compassionate and spiteful, often in the same scene.

Shirley and Stanley, as compelling as they are as characters, do not comprise the film’s defining relationship. Director Josephine Decker feeds on the psychological aspects of Jackson’s work to tease out a story of Shirley and Rose, two women drawn together by frustration, talent and obsession over the missing woman at the heart of the new novel.

""Let's pray for a boy,” Shirley says to the pregnant Rose, “The world is too cruel for girls.” Their time on screen together is complicated, occasionally unsettling as reality and imagination meld. It’s fascinating work in a film that is a slow burn.

“Shirley” takes its time to get where it is going, building an atmosphere of oppression slowly and carefully. Decker’s distorted dream-like visual approach is often beautiful, as though we’re watching the film through a psychological prism. It creates atmosphere but doesn’t provide the thrills that Jackson herself might have been able to infuse into the telling of this tale.

AMERICAN WOMAN: 3 STARS

“American Woman,” the first feature directed by “Mad Men” producer and writer Semi Chellas, is a fictionalized version of real events. A series of title cards set the stage. The year is 1975. “After multiple investigations, the President of the United States has been forced to resign.” “America’s disastrous involvement in the war in Vietnam is finally coming to an end.” “Some radicals still believe a revolution is necessary.”

Amid this time of political turmoil is Jenny Shimada (Hong Chau), a bomb maker who once blew up a draft board office. On the run, she is hiding out in upstate New York, working as a house keeper for a rich, conservative woman (Ellen Burstyn). She comes out of her semi-retirement when a publisher and old colleague-in-the-cause contacts her with a new mission. He wants her to look after three fugitive Symbionese Liberation Army members, Juan (John Gallagher), his wife Yvonne (Lola Kirke), and Pauline (Sarah Gadon), the kidnapped daughter of a newspaper magnate, as they write a book about their experiences.

“You can’t just sit around waiting to die or be caught,” she tells them. “You have to start writing. Write the book, make the money. It’s the only way you’ll survive underground.” Jenny’s reward? Enough cash to leave the country.

The basics of the story are borrowed from the well documented kidnapping and radicalization, of American heiress Patty Hearst. Pauline is an obvious surrogate for Hearst while Jenny is a fictionalized version of Wendy Yoshimura, the woman who was with Patty Hearst when she was apprehended.

The names have been changed and some of the details, but this sharply written story isn’t a history lesson. It’s a study of people who have chosen a radical path in life. It showcases Jaun’s ideological rantings but also wonders aloud if Pauline truly converted to the cause or was simply trying to survive. “I don’t want to be an outlaw,” she says. “Outlaws always die at the end of the story.”

Add in themes on toxic masculinity—Juan may be a free thinker but his behavior toward women is anything but enlightened—sexuality, class, gender and race and you have film big on ideas while leaving the action scenes for other movies.

“American Woman” is a movie that values words. Some may find the storytelling a bit too low key for such an explosive subject, but the performances, particularly Chau, give the story layers. Chellas, who wrote the script in addition to directing, uses the main characters, Jenny and Pauline, as conduits to help us understand a complicated and slow-simmer story of survival.

STRANGE BUT TRUE: 3 ½ STARS

“Strange But True,” a neo-noir thriller on VOD starring Amy Ryan and Margaret Qualley, examines grief in the context of an ordinary family thrown into extraordinary situations.

The action takes place against the backdrop of loss. Five years ago Ronnie Chase (Connor Jessup) and Melissa’s (Margaret Qualley) prom night began as they all do, with a rented tux, a frilly dress and proud parents taking photos. It ended in tragedy, with Ronnie dead in a car crash, an event that sent shock waves through the family. Stricken, his folks Charlene (Amy Ryan) and Richard (Greg Kinnear), split under the weight of their grief. Younger brother Philip (Nick Robinson) hightails it to NYC to pursue his dream of being a photographer and girlfriend Melissa is wracked with guilt, left with only her dreams of her late boyfriend.

Cut to present day. Charlene’s life has fallen apart. Her husband and job are gone, so when Melissa shows up, five years after the fateful night, claiming she is pregnant with Ronnie’s baby, she is not met with hugs and congratulations.

“If you think about it,” says Phillip, home recuperating from a badly broken leg, “there’s a chance what she said is true. If, and it’s a big if, if Ronnie’s sperm was somehow frozen before he died there’s a chance Melissa could have used it and impregnated herself years later.”

“That’s ridiculous,” Charlene snarls. “He was a teenager with his whole life ahead of him. Why would he do that?”

She sets off to find a rational explanation while Phillip grasps at straws, consulting psychics and leaving no possibility off the table. “I might not believe that this is Ronnie’s baby,” he says to Melissa,” but I believe that you believe it and I believe that Ronnie would have too. If that makes me an uncle, so be it.”

That search is the bedrock for a story packed with secrets and intrigue. Adapted from John Searles’s 2004 novel, “Strange But True” is a bit of a nesting doll of mysteries. Everyone has a backstory and a different relationship with the intrigue that forms the plot and the action toggles between past and present. That means there’s a lot to wade through in the film’s tight ninety-minute running time but director Rowan Athale manages it. He weaves psychological drama, a hint of paranormal, suspense and even some gothic horror into the story.

In the end, the pregnancy is a McGuffin, simply a device to put all these elements into motion, but the result is a tightly wound thriller that leads to a gripping and satisfying conclusion.",[]
162,162,162,ctvnews,https://bc.ctvnews.ca/oregon-mental-health-response-saves-money-and-lives-without-police-1.5028544,Oregon mental health response saves money and lives - without police,'Jon Woodward',2020-07-17,"VANCOUVER -- As B.C. police are on the defensive over how they respond to mental health calls, a program in Oregon which takes police out of the equation is getting serious attention in Vancouver.

The unusual approach by CAHOOTS has worked for 30 years in Eugene, Ore., proponents say, has saved lives and saves millions of dollars a year by replacing police cars and sworn officers with trained civilians in a van.

“CAHOOTS is a great model for us to be looking at in Vancouver and exactly the conversation we should be learning from,” said Vancouver City Councillor Christine Boyle.

CAHOOTS stands for “Crisis Assistance Helping Out On The Streets,” and is getting national attention during a movement to defund the police, sparked by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May.

Fundamentally, CAHOOTS workers take a different approach in a variety of mental health calls including wellness checks, mental health crises, substance abuse and threats of suicide, the agency’s Kimber Hawes told ABC affiliate KEZI 9 News this month.

“Police are trained to perceive stuff as a threat, and we are trained exactly the opposite,” she said.

These are problems that, in the hands of police, have turned violent, such as the RCMP response to a wellness check on Mona Wang. A video that’s evidence in a lawsuit shows the responding Kelowna Mountie dragging Wang through the hallways of her apartment building, pushing her head to the ground, and stepping on her head.

After the video was reported on by CTV News, a top B.C. Mountie called for nurses to accompany officers on all wellness checks.

Another case in Nanaimo saw Mounties there respond to a call for help by apprehending former firefighter Shanna Blanchard. When she said she didn’t think they had the legal grounds, one of them punched her in the mouth, she said, causing her to lose a tooth. She said Mounties put a spit hood on and she worried she would drown in her own blood.

Today, the CAHOOTS program has three vans, some 40 staff, and is one service advocates point to when discussing what “defunding the police” might look like.

The Eugene and Springfield, Ore., police budgets are together $90 million a year, according to CAHOOTS materials. CAHOOTS handles 17 per cent of their calls for just $2.1 million a year.

And though in B.C., many mental health calls could be presumed violent and require the presence of an armed officer, CAHOOTS attended 24,000 calls last year, and only called for police backup 150 times.

A Vancouver police sergeant said she’s cautiously open to the model.

“It’s a smaller population, not exactly the same demographic as our city in Vancouver,” said Sgt. AJ Benefield during a police technical briefing on mental health response on Thursday. “Before us opting to have that approach we’d have to analyze how they’re doing things.”

However many mental health calls don’t present themselves as such up front, a VPD spokesperson said. They come in as calls requiring a police response, such as assault, or a disturbance, and then officers arrive, assess the situation, and determine if another resource is required.

The VPD face a rising tide of mental health calls: 4,836 in 2019, compared to just 2,276 in 2010. The agency is responding with a variety of approaches in conjunction with Vancouver Coastal Health, including Assertive Outreach Teams and and Assertive Community Treatment that is designed to proactively connect people in need with social workers and nurses.

The approach has resulted in mental health calls actually becoming a smaller component of what the VPD respond to, officers said.

“A lot of things we’ve been doing in the community, especially in regards to mental health for example, the VPD has really been the leader in a lot of initiatives” said Supt. Martin Bruce on Thursday.

Even if one department were to adopt a CAHOOTS-like model, there would be hurdles to having it be dispatched separately. Emergency dispatch in B.C. is done to police, fire and ambulance by E-Comm, which is a not-for-profit agency owned by shareholders that include police departments.

“If this type of response model is something the Province, our first responder partners or mental health service organizations would like us to explore further, we would be very open to discussing and re-imagining out important role under a new model,” said E-Comm spokesperson Jasmine Bradley.

The province has named a special committee of the B.C. legislature to examine and modernize the Police Act, which governs policing in the province. It will examine the extent of systemic racism and review the role of police with respect to complex social issues that include mental health.",[]

The police department said Friday police have identified 155 reports so far, compared to 69 for the same timeframe in 2019.

Members of the VPD issued similar statements earlier in the year, saying that many of the incidents target the city's Asian communities.

Const. Tania Visintin said previous statements were sent out to spread awareness, and to encourage other victims to come forward.

""We are seeing an uptick in reports coming into police, which gives us confidence that the public is hearing our plea,"" she said in Friday's news release.

The VPD said 35 files are currently being investigated as possible hate crimes. Sixteen of those have been sent to Crown counsel for possible charges, while the others are still active cases.

Police say they're using data to increase police presence in parts of the city that seem to be harder hit by hate crimes.

They've formed a hate crime project team to review files, and created new reporting forms in Chinese to remove potential language barriers.

""We recognize this continues to be a problem in our city,"" Visintin said.

Anyone who experiences a hate crime is asked to call 911. If it's not an emergency, police can be reached at 604-717-3321, and tips can also be left anonymously through Crime Stoppers.",[]

166,166,166,ctvnews,https://bc.ctvnews.ca/police-in-vancouver-push-back-against-defund-movement-1.5028218,Police in Vancouver push back against 'defund' movement,'Nick Wells',2020-07-17,"VANCOUVER -- Members of the Vancouver Police Department pushed back against the concept of defunding the police on Thursday, saying they offer valuable work and help in the community.

Superintendent Martin Bruce, who heads the force's personnel services department, acknowledged there might be a disconnect between how the community perceives the work the force offers and how the department views its work.

“A lot of things we've been doing in the community, especially in regards to mental health for example... the VPD has really been the leader in a lot of initiatives,” he said during a technical briefing on the department's outreach, training, mental health initiatives and oversight.

“If we're not getting that across properly, that's something we should fix.”

The briefing featured presentations from four officers about the force's mental health unit, its professional standards section and its force options training unit.

The call to defund police, spending more of the police budget on other health and safety issues, spread across North America as people protested the police in-custody death of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May.

The briefing also plays out during public discussion of high-profile deaths where police in Canada were first responders for mental health calls and wellness checks.

Sgt. A.J. Benefield, with the mental health unit, talked about the progress made in recent years in responding to incidents with a mental health component.

In 2008, 31 per cent of calls involved at least one person with mental health concerns, she said.

That dropped to 16.2 per cent of calls in 2019.

“Although some may say we shouldn't deal with mental health calls, 20 per cent of Canadians are living with mental illness,” said Benefield, who attributed the unit's success to its variety of approaches.

Harsha Walia, the executive director of the B.C. Civil Liberties Association, said in an interview Thursday that police should never be the first option to respond to situations involving mental health.

“It defies logic that an armed officer who ... represents authority and a level of fear and intimidation would be the first person to approach someone going through distress,” said Walia. “That's just simply not from any logical perspective an appropriate health care response.”

The police briefing also comes as the department and the city engage in a back-and-forth over budget cuts.

Vancouver council passed a motion in May calling for a one per cent cut to the police department's budget as the city struggled with the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The police board, which oversees the department, called for that cut to be rescinded in early June.

The force is open to changing its training as education on responding to mental health situations evolves, Bruce said.

But a reduction in its budget could affect its work, especially with figures showing mental health challenges in the community have increased, he said.

“So, reducing our budget when all these things are going on, I'm not sure who's filling that void.”

The woman spoke to CTV News about her experience, and we have agreed to conceal her identity.

She said she had gone to a friend’s house for dinner and then went to board a bus at the Newton Exchange in Surrey, B.C. at around 11 p.m. Tuesday.

“I usually take transit late all the time, and especially on that route,” she said, and added nothing like this has ever happened to her while riding transit before. “I sat down in my seat and within maybe like a minute or two, it was really quick…it just popped up on my screen.”

""I'm going to rape you,"" the message said in white lettering on a black background from a sender called ""Justins iPhone.”

“I thought maybe like it’s a sick joke, and I wasn’t sure,” she said. “And then I was thinking well, I’ve got to take it seriously anyway. It doesn’t matter if it is a joke, because I don’t know.”

She declined the photo transfer and took a screen grab of the message. She says it was sent to her twice more.

""I think they were looking for anybody who had their AirDrop available to receive items,"" she said. ""There were many other women on there, too. So I’m wondering whether anybody else also received those messages.""

Fearing for her safety, she contacted a friend and texted a transit police number set up to allow for discreet reporting.

Eventually all the passengers got off the bus, and the woman met a friend and a transit police officer at a bus stop.

The woman later posted about her experience on Facebook to make others aware.

""I tell the transit police that I'm too scared to stand up to look around and see who it might be. I'll admit that I should have done this. I should have stood up and asked 'Justin' to show his face,"" she wrote online.

""Not many people are able to do what they hoped they would when they're placed in an uncertain or vulnerable situation, but I wish I had the courage to do that.""

She says there were several people on the bus, including some in the front of the bus and a group of younger men near the back. Transit police confirm about 15 people were on board at the time.

Transit police said they are investigating the message, ""which contained extremely concerning sexual threats.""

""It’s extremely concerning. It’s absolutely disturbing,"" Const. Mike Yake with Metro Vancouver Transit Police told CTV News. ""We take situations like this extremely seriously.""

He calls the use of AirDrop to make the threats unusual, but says officers are now looking into the digital footprint the message would have left behind.

""Our investigators do have certain investigational avenues that they can follow up on,"" Yake added.

Police have already collected CCTV video from the bus.

In her online post, the woman wrote she was left both fearful and angry.

""When I got off that bus, I wanted to cry. Not because I was scared or upset, but because I was mad. I'm still mad. I'm mad that someone used an image to trigger fear in me. I'm mad that it worked,"" she wrote.

She told CTV some people who have responded to her post have tried to give advice, including carrying a weapon.

""I’m just like, I shouldn’t have to do those things because this situation shouldn’t have to come into play,"" she said. ""These things shouldn’t be happening.""

There have been reports from around the world of AirDrop being used to send inappropriate, threatening and lewd messages to strangers.

Yake says it isn’t the first time the use of AirDrop has been investigated by officers in Metro Vancouver, but adds it isn’t a tactic that’s been commonly seen on the transit system here.

The AirDrop receiving option on Apple devices can be disabled altogether, or the settings can be changed from allowing messages from everyone to contacts only.

The victim in the case is urging others to contact transit police, as she did, if they end up in a similar situation.

""Never assume it's a joke. Take appropriate steps by reaching out to a friend or family member to pick you up. Make sure you contact the transit police, or notify the police or a safety officer nearby. It's better to be safe than sorry,"" she wrote.

Transit police say anyone who comes across a situation on transit that makes them feel uncomfortable should text their SMS help line at 87-77-77.

Yake says investigators would like to speak with anyone that was on the same bus as the victim, or anyone that may have received any similar messages themselves on the Metro Vancouver transit system.",[]

Centre for Disease Control,'Carly Yoshida-Butryn',2020-07-16,"VANCOUVER -- Several more flights with passengers carrying COVID-19 have been identified by the B.C. Centre for Disease Control, including three between B.C. and Alberta.

The affected flights, all on WestJet, include flight 460 from Kelowna to Calgary on July 2, flight 186 from YVR to Edmonton on July 5 and flight 3312 from Kelowna to Edmonton on July 5.

A case of the virus was also identified on Korean Air 071 from Incheon to Vancouver on July 5.

Under the Quarantine Act, it is mandatory for anyone arriving into B.C. from outside of Canada to self-isolate and monitor for COVID-19 symptoms for 14 days upon arrival, and file a self-isolation plan.

Travellers are no longer notified directly if they were seated near someone with the virus. That information is now posted online at the BCCDC website.

The health agency will sometimes posted the ""affected seat numbers,"" which means only passengers who were seated in those areas need to self-isolate.

Otherwise, passengers are asked to self-isolate and monitor for symptoms for 14 days after their flight.

Health officials announced last week eight people who had spent time in several downtown Kelowna locations had tested positive for COVID-19. Six of those people live in the Lower Mainland, according to the health ministry.

On Tuesday, provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry called for improvements to screening, cancellation policies and information sharing after several flights that landed at YVR last week were found to have cases of the coronavirus.

She added that contact tracing cases linked to air travel has proved challenging.

""One of the most challenging things we do is trying to get flight manifests a couple of days later when we recognize somebody who might be ill. The type of information on those flight manifests is often not very helpful in trying to follow up with people,"" Henry said.

Earlier this week, the BCCDC identified four other flights into YVR with confirmed cases of the virus, which included Air Canada flights from Kelowna and Montreal.

In an emailed statement to CTV News responding to Henry's comments, Air Canada said it has screening protocols in place and offers ""flexible"" rebooking options if passengers are too sick to fly.

""If passengers do not appear well or if they present an elevated temperature at check-in (temperature checks are mandatory prior to boarding any flight), they will not be boarded, and will only be able to fly once cleared by a doctor and Air Canada’s medical desk. Flights are rebooked without additional change fees,"" Air Canada's statement reads.

Flight manifests are provided to any Canadian health authority upon request within 24 hours, the airline stated, but added it has not received any such requests recently.

The full list of affected flights can be found on the BCCDC's website.

Here's B.C.'s plan for tenants to pay back their landlords,'Kendra Mangione',2020-07-16,"VANCOUVER -- The province is providing a first look at what repayment plans may look like when B.C.'s temporary ban on rent-based evictions is lifted later this summer.

The repayment framework will require landlords to give tenants until next summer to pay the full amount of money owed.

However, renters will be required to pay monthly instalments during that time.

In a news release Thursday, the housing ministry said its plan is meant to help renters and landlords ""transition"" when the ban is lifted, a change scheduled to take effect on Sept. 1.

As of that date, renters will need to pay their monthly rent in full. However, they'll have 30 days to make that payment from the date they were given notice, so for most renters, the date will be Oct. 1, the province says.

This is assuming their landlord gives them a repayment plan before the end of August.

Landlords will be required to provide tenants with the amount they'll be expected to pay each month.

The example given by the ministry is that a renter who owes $2,000 might be expected to pay $200 a month, from Oct. 1 to July 2021.

""Recognizing that many renters and landlords worked together to make arrangements during this crisis, the framework will also leave some flexibility for landlords to work with renters to further adjust the payment amounts,"" the ministry's statement said.

So a landlord may choose to make those monthly payments lower at the beginning, and gradually increase them over the 10-month period.

The Vancouver Tenants Union described the plans announced by the government as ""outrageous,"" and said it will leave thousands of vulnerable renters at risk of eviction.

""Tenants have been under siege from multiple crises that have made their lives even more precarious, and today the B.C. government made the prospect of losing their homes very real,"" VTU member Mazdak Gharibnava said in a news release.

The group said a disproportionate number of the jobs lost during the pandemic have been low-paying positions, the kind often held by low-income individuals and families who rent their homes.

Asking them to pay off accumulated rent debt in the middle of the crisis isn't feasible, the VTU argued.

The province also announced Thursday its moratorium on rent increases will be extended for several months.

Landlords cannot raise tenants' rents until December.",[]

The notice of civil claim filed in B.C. Supreme Court in Kelowna on Wednesday names Cpl. Lacy Browning, the federal attorney general and B.C.'s public safety minister as defendants.

The claim alleges that Browning assaulted the plaintiff, Fiona Louise Read, while she was walking home after a New Year's Eve party on Jan. 1, 2016.

Read's claim states that she had planned to spend the night at the home of some friends who live next door to where the party was being held. Near the end of the party, she became uncomfortable and decided she would rather go home that evening.

According to court documents, Read went to her friends' house to gather her things, leaving her keys and car at their place and planning to walk home. Her friends tried to convince her not to leave, which made her more uncomfortable.

While she was on her way home, Read encountered an RCMP cruiser that stopped in the middle of the road, according to her claim. She approached the vehicle, believing she was ""in need of protection"" and that police should investigate why her friends didn't want her to leave.

The officer got out of the car and asked if Read's name was Fiona. When she confirmed that it was, the lawsuit alleges, the officer - who Read now knows was Browning - ""grabbed her by her hair and pounded her head into the ground multiple times.""

The claim goes on to state that Read ""suffered injuries and was unable to stand or be supported by her right knee."" The knee injury was so severe, the suit alleges, that it forced Read to permanently quit running and skiing.

According to the lawsuit, the RCMP did not allow Read to be treated by paramedics and detained her for more than six hours without explaining why.

Browning eventually recommended Read be charged with resisting arrest and assault, but the Crown did not approve any charges, according to the claim.

The claim also alleges that Browning's supervisor refused to accept a formal complaint from Read when she attempted to make one on the day after the alleged assault. The supervisor ""advised the plaintiff that the actions by Browning were justified,"" the lawsuit reads.

""As a direct, foreseeable and proximate result of the RCMP and Browning's unlawful actions, the plaintiff has suffered emotional distress, humiliation, shame and embarrassment,"" the claim reads.

As of Thursday, the defendants have not responded to Read's claim. B.C. RCMP spokesperson Staff Sgt. Janelle Shoihet told CTV News in an email that Mounties had not been formally served the claim as of Thursday evening.

""Typically what happens is that, once served, the civil matter will be reviewed and addressed by the Department of Justice through the normal civil processes,"" Shoihet said in her email. ""The allegations are also being reviewed to determine if there are any other actions that need to be taken.""

This is the second civil claim filed against Browning in the last two months.

Last month, nursing student Mona Wang filed a similar lawsuit against Browning, alleging the corporal assaulted her during a wellness check on Jan. 20 of this year. Surveillance video of that incident shows an RCMP officer pulling Wang, who is not wearing a shirt, down the hallway of her Kelowna apartment building.

At one point in the video, the officer is seen putting her boot on the nursing student's head. She's also seen pulling Wang's head up by the hair, then lowering it back to the ground.

In response to Wang's allegations, the RCMP began both a criminal investigation and a code of conduct investigation. Shoihet said Thursday that the criminal investigation has been completed and will now be reviewed by an outside agency - in this case, the Abbotsford Police Department.

""Once they have completed their review, and if there are no other investigative requirements, the materials will then be sent to the BC Prosecution Service for charge assessment,"" Shoihet said in her email.

""The internal Code of Conduct investigation is also continuing and a public complaint has been received,"" Shoihet continued. ""The police officer remains on administrative leave, and their duty status is subject to continual assessment.""

In their response to Wang's civil claim, the defendants say the officer's actions were ""reasonable, lawful and executed in good faith,"" and that the use of force was necessary.

None of the allegations in either of the lawsuits has been proven in court.

In a statement Wednesday, Cowichan Tribes Chief William Seymour said the community was coming together to remember and honour the loss of one of their own.

CTV News has learned the young teen's name was Fairlie Johnny.

“This opioid crisis seems unending and has claimed the life of a precious young girl only 14 years old, and continues to affect many more youth in our community,” said Seymour.

“Our most heartfelt condolences and thoughtful prayers go out to the parents of this beautiful young girl, and we offer our most intense commitment to do something about this terrible addiction in our community.”

The First Nation community says that it will now be creating a team to form a plan on how to manage the overdose epidemic in its jurisdiction.

The upcoming Cowichan Tribes Opioid Crisis Response Task Force will consist of team members from a variety of backgrounds and will offer support and counselling for people who are facing addiction challenges.

“There is no greater loss in life than that of a child, and even greater still is the need for all of us to rise to the challenge to honour her memory by coming together to end illicit drugs and addiction in our community,” said Seymour.

“We need to start talking about these issues and we need to start talking with each other in an effort to maintain our kinship to one another.”

The Cowichan Tribes community says that everyone should have honest and meaningful conversations about drug use, especially as Vancouver Island faces an increasingly toxic drug supply amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

The BC Coroners Service announced Thursday that the province saw a record-breaking number of overdose deaths in June, surpassing the previous record that was set one month earlier in May.

A total of 175 illicit drug overdose deaths were seen in June, or an average of 5.8 a day.

The federal government now says that it will be providing $2 million to launch a pilot program in the Cowichan Valley which will offer a safe supply of drugs and supports to people facing addictions.

""Today's report clearly shows us that the tragedy of overdose deaths from the toxic street drug supply in B.C. continues to escalate,"" said provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry in a statement Thursday.

""While much effort has been made to reduce harm, remove stigma and provide the care that people living with addiction need, the impacts of the pandemic have made the situation dire for too many.""",[]

The total includes 18 new positive tests for the coronavirus and three epidemiologically linked cases, and it marks the seventh day in the last eight during which the total number of cases in B.C. has grown by at least 20.

There are 192 active cases of the virus in B.C., including 15 people who are in hospital, three of whom are in critical care.

Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said there have been no additional deaths from COVID-19 in B.C. over the last 24 hours, leaving the province's death toll from the virus at 189.

Thursday's update from Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix comes just hours after the pair released the results of serology testing in the province, which suggested that fewer than one per cent of B.C. residents have antibodies for the virus.

Henry dedicated a significant portion of her remarks on Thursday to reviewing those results, saying that they reflect the success B.C. has had in limiting the transmission of the virus in its jurisdiction.

""The report shows that we have been very effective at flattening our curve here in British Columbia,"" she said.

Researchers remain uncertain whether having antibodies for the virus means a person will be immune to it in the future, Henry stressed, adding that the low rate of transmission in B.C. means the vast majority of residents remain susceptible to COVID-19.

""The thing that we need to remember is that most of us do not have antibodies to this virus,"" the provincial health officer said. ""We have not been infected. And we need to keep doing the things that we're doing to minimize the effects of this virus in our communities.""

Henry also addressed the record number of drug overdose deaths recorded in the province in the month of June, becoming emotional as she described the loss of 175 ""of our brothers and sisters"" to the province's toxic drug supply.

""This ongoing crisis reminds us that we need to put as much time and effort and kindness and compassion into caring for people who use drugs as we have been successful in doing in responding to the COVID-19 crisis,"" Henry said.

June is the third month in a row in which B.C. has seen a record number of overdoses, and Henry reiterated her calls for the provision of a safe drug supply and the decriminalization of small amounts of drugs for personal use.

""We know that safer supply - hydromorphone, diacetylmorphine - is not what is killing people in our streets right now and in their homes right now,"" she said. ""It is the toxic street drug supply.""

There have been no new outbreaks of COVID-19 in health-care facilities or in the broader community, Henry said Thursday.

Health officials continue to monitor two outbreaks at long-term care facilities and one at a hospital acute care unit. They are also monitoring the community outbreak at Krazy Cherry Farm in the province's Interior, which now has a total of four cases associated with it, according to Henry.

The provincial health officer said there have now been 27 cases confirmed associated with a pair of private parties that happened in Kelowna on Canada Day. Eighteen of those people reside in the Interior Health region, while the remaining nine reside in the Lower Mainland.

Henry reminded those who attended the parties to monitor themselves closely, avoid close contacts with others, and to call 811 if they have ""any symptoms at all"" to arrange for COVID-19 testing.

Most of B.C.'s confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been located in the Lower Mainland, with 1,667 located in the Fraser Health region and 1,028 in Vancouver Coastal Health.

Elsewhere in B.C., there have been 223 cases of COVID-19 in Interior Health, 136 in Island Health and 65 in Northern Health. Another 51 confirmed cases in the province have happened among people who reside outside Canada.

A total of 2,789 people who previously tested positive for the coronavirus in B.C. have now fully recovered.

These totals reflect confirmed cases, but Henry noted Thursday that serology testing suggests roughly eight times as many people in some parts of the province have actually had the virus. The provincial health officer specifically said more than 16,000 people in the province have likely been infected.

A joint study between the B.C. Centre for Disease Control, University of British Columbia, LifeLabs and public health scientists was released Wednesday and shows B.C.'s estimated overall infection rate is less than one per cent.

Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry and Dr. Danuta Skowronski, who was the lead researcher on the project, discussed some of the findings with media over the phone Thursday morning.

""Those conclusions (in the study) are a big bravo to British Columbians,"" Skowronksi said. ""They signify success in our containment of (COVID-19). We effectively suppressed the community transmission of this virus.""

The study, posted by health research website medRxiv, looked at anonymous blood samples that were collected in March and May for reasons unrelated to COVID-19.

The samples collected in March showed the virus was prevalent in 0.28 per cent of the samples. In the May samples, it appeared in 0.55 per cent.

Skowronski explained that using anonymous, non-voluntary samples was crucial.

""(Studies) that rely on people volunteering or being invited to participate, those will tend to have higher estimates because those were worried people for a reason in the first place that volunteered to be tested, whereas ours removed that element of self-selecting,"" she said.

But health officials cautioned there's concern with such low transmission rates: few people have immunity against the virus.

""We cannot rest on our laurels. We cannot assume that we are in the all-clear,"" Skowronski said.

""We do not have sufficient immunity in the population to prevent subsequent waves … we have a long way to go before we're there, which means it really comes down to the individual and collective measures of British Columbians to continue to keep this virus at bay.""

The study also revealed that, when the prevalence is applied to the whole B.C. population, about 28,000 people may have been infected COVID-19. To date, 3,149 cases have been confirmed by health officials.

However, Henry said that discrepancy, which is about eight times higher, isn't surprising or unique to B.C.

""We know there was a period of time when we were not testing everybody because we didn't have the capacity to test everybody, so this primarily reflects that,"" she said.

""It reflects the period in March when we had our increasing numbers of community transmission, we had a lot of people coming back from travel … and we made them stay home, even if they had mild symptoms, because we did not have access to testing everywhere in the province.""

Even so, Henry said it's not a reason to increase testing beyond what's now available.

""We do have an expanded access to testing right now,"" Henry said. ""We are focusing our testing on making sure that anybody who has any symptoms … has access to a test that can be done anywhere in the province.""

Both Skowronski and Henry said the study reinforced their understanding that testing asymptomatic people wouldn't be an effective use of resources.

""It would be very low yield at this point to test asymptomatic people without some other clear indication for it,"" Skowronski said.

There were 175 illicit drug toxicity deaths in B.C. in June, an average of 5.8 fatalities every day.

The latest numbers have pushed the province's total to 728 lives lost to illegal drugs in the first six months of 2020. Most of the 175 deaths in June – 124 in total – involved fentanyl, according to the BC Coroners Service.

The previous monthly record set in May saw 171 drug users die of suspected overdoses and poisonings, a rate of 5.5 drug fatalities per day.

Most of the deaths have occurred in Vancouver, Surrey and Victoria.

""For the second month in a row, this province has experienced the highest number of deaths ever as a result of illicit substances with 175 lives lost, leaving behind grief and frustration while this public health emergency carries on into its fifth year,"" said chief coroner Lisa Lapointe in a statement Thursday.

""We know the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted people who use drugs, as it has all British Columbians,"" Lapointe added. ""Access to key harm reduction services has been a challenge and our social networks are smaller.""

The chief coroner warned that the ""drug supply in our province is highly toxic"" as data from the coroners service published Thursday reveals an increasing number of drug users in April, May and June had ""extreme fentanyl concentrations"" in their blood during post-mortem tests.

The coroner's warning comes one week after B.C. Premier John Horgan gave his support to a group of Canadian police chiefs who are calling for the complete decriminalization of illicit drugs for personal use.

The Canadian Association of Police Chiefs announced on July 9 that it was endorsing the decriminalization of drug possession and calling for a national task force on drug policy reforms.

The premier noted that British Columbia is limited in what it can do with regard to drug enforcement policy – a federal Criminal Code matter – but said he has ""made it clear to the prime minister where British Columbia stands.""

Horgan responded to the report into B.C. drug deaths Thursday, saying the province plans to create more drug treatment spaces and put focus on addiction recovery rather than prosecution.

""The people who are addicted to opioids are not criminals, they're patients,"" the premier said.

He denied criticisms that his government is placing a greater emphasis on fighting the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed 189 British Columbians as of Thursday, than on the overdose crisis, which has killed nearly four times more since January.

""I want British Columbians to know that we are not abandoning them on this question,"" Horgan said.

Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry called Thursday's drug fatality numbers ""a tragedy,"" as province-wide measures to control the spread of COVID-19 have left many drug users less likely or unable to access harm-reduction services.

""Today's report clearly shows us that the tragedy of overdose deaths from the toxic street drug supply in B.C. continues to escalate,"" Henry said. ""While much effort has been made to reduce harm, remove stigma and provide the care that people living with addiction need, the impacts of the pandemic have made the situation dire for too many.""

Dr. Perry Kendall, an executive director with the BC Centre on Substance Use, says the recent spike in deaths among drug users is ""entirely preventable.""

The coroners service says that no deaths have been reported at any of B.C.'s supervised consumption sites in 2020.

""The number of lives lost over more than four years of a public health emergency is heartbreaking,"" Kendall said.

B.C. once again saw a record number of overdose deaths, due in part to the pandemic.

The latest statistics from the BC Coroners Service found 175 people died from drug overdoses in B.C. in June, while the first six months of the year saw 176 deaths due to COVID-19.

""About 80 per cent of people who died are men between the ages of 19 and two-thirds of people died in their own home,"" said Dr. Bonnie Henry. ""We know from the conversations we've had with family, with friends, that most of their family and friends did not know that they were using drugs and many of them died alone.""

Analysis by the coroners service concludes the COVID-19 pandemic is making the overdose crisis, which has claimed thousands of lives in the province in the past five years, even deadlier.

""The one thing we know from our data is the people who are dying, many of them are dying alone and so the complications with the dual health emergency, with the COVID-19 pandemic and the illicit drug crisis -- we know that people have been isolated and we know there's been unintended consequences, too, for people who use drugs during COVID,"" said spokesperson Andy Watson. “We continue to advocate for people to buddy up, don’t use without somebody there to help you if you come across a toxic dose.""

When asked about the billions of dollars being spent on the pandemic in the past few months, compared to millions on the fentanyl crisis declared a public health emergency years ago despite many more deaths, Premier John Horgan insisted it’s not constructive to compare the two crises.

""These are two separate things. We have an insidious virus that affects anyone at any time and we have an opioid crisis that involves people using drugs. Those are choices initially, and then they become dependencies,"" he said. ""My first meeting with Bonnie (Henry) when she was first hired was about safe drugs supply, so we've been working on bringing these numbers down. We've seen a spike in the past couple of months -- it's very disturbing, particularly for those families affected. I want British Columbians to know we're not abandoning them. We're going to redouble our efforts to bring more resources, to bring more actions across the country working with the federal government so we can wrestle this to the ground just the way we have all collectively wrestled COVID-19 to the ground.""

Horgan also reiterated his support for a call by the nation’s police chiefs to decriminalize the personal possession of drugs, and treat illicit substances as a public health concern rather than a criminal matter. He also emphasized his support for a safe, clean drug supply – which he called particularly important since closed borders are widely blamed for the increased presence of fentanyl in street drugs, making them even deadlier.

The Liberal critic for mental health and addictions called the NDP approach a failure for not providing enough resources for those looking for help.

“There's waiting lists they can't get in, so there’s a very disjointed system in British Columbia that does not help people get into recovery -- even when they're ready to get into recovery,” said Jane Thornthwaite. ""You'd think after three years they could've come up with a comprehensive mental health and addictions strategy that would help prevent these tragic deaths.""

The coroners service, meanwhile, is emphasizing the need to destigmatize drug use so that no one is using alone behind closed doors, as well as medical-grade drugs.

""We need to create more access to safe supply and remove the barriers for people that are looking for help,"" insisted Watson.

The soft hands, long-term approach to battling drug dependency was the focus of Henry’s comments on the new overdose numbers, comments she made while visibly moved by the death toll.

""It's not a drug problem, it's a pain problem…whether it's physical pain, whether it's emotional pain, psycho-social pain, the pain of family drama and trauma you’ve gone through, those are things that lead people to use drugs. Nobody grows up thinking I want to be addicted to substances, I want to have a substance use disorder, I want to have this controlling my life,"" said Henry.

""This ongoing crisis reminds us we need to put as much time and effort and kindness and compassion into caring for people who use drugs as we have been successful in responding to the COVID19 crises.""",[]

Pollsters found that 32 per cent of people across the country barely ever put on a mask when outside their home, and 13 per cent don't wear one at all.

That's despite 59 per cent of respondents in the same survey saying they're worried about contracting COVID-19.

In Vancouver, there are calls by transit users for TransLink to implement a mandatory mask rule onboard buses and SkyTrains.

""We should wear masks. It is our responsibility,” said rider Pintu Kumar.

According to an approximate count conducted by TransLink, only a third of its total ridership wears face coverings.

The company does recommend that riders wear masks but it has not made it a mandatory policy.

“Not everyone is able to wear a mask or face covering - some people with medical conditions, for instance - so we have to acknowledge that,"" said TransLink spokesperson Ben Murphy.

As of this month, it is mandatory to wear face coverings on public transit in Montreal, Toronto and Ottawa.

Murphy said it would also be difficult to enforce such a rule.

“In other jurisdictions where transit agencies have made policies mandatory there is no enforcement."" he said.

On Thursday, provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry also strongly recommended wearing mask in crowded public areas such as transit.

“If you are taking transit right now you should be wearing a face covering unless there is a valid reason why you can't,” Henry said.

The Angus Reid Institute survey was conducted online from July 10 to 11 among a representative randomized sample of 1,503 Canadian adults who are member of the Angus Reid Forum. A probability sample of that size would carry a margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.",[]

Surinderpal Gill, who bought his winning ticket at the Chevron Town Pantry on 58 Avenue in Surrey, said he didn't believe he'd won at first.

He went to check the ticket after the July 1 draw, using the self-check option. He called his son, but still not believing he'd won, he went to another gas station to check the ticket again.

""After I told my wife, they both thought I was joking and didn't believe me,"" Gill said in a news release issued by the B.C. Lottery Corporation Thursday.

He won $1 million off a Lotto 6/49 ticket.

Andrew James Seangio is facing 34 new counts of voyeurism and three counts of sexual assault involving three women he knew while living in Ottawa between 2011 and 2018, and investigators believe there may be more victims.

Ottawa police say Seangio turned himself in to Vancouver police Thursday morning. They are asking any other women who may have gone to his home in Ottawa’s south end between October 2015 and October 2017 to contact them directly, or to reach out anonymously via Crime Stoppers.

Seangio was charged with seven counts of indecent acts and three counts of exposing himself to children in addition to one count of voyeurism in March. He was arrested in the spring of 2019 as Vancouver police investigated a series of indecent acts near York House School in Vancouver’s upscale Shaughnessy neighbourhood.

Ottawa police say the Vancouver Police Department contacted them in the wake of that investigation and the Ottawa Police Service Sexual Assault and Child Abuse Unit initiated its investigation as a result.

On Thursday, CTV News asked the B.C. RCMP if the new charges and allegations had resulted in a change in Seangio’s employment status.

“Cst. Seangio remains suspended with pay, however his duty status is subject to continuous review and assessment,” said Staff Sgt. Janelle Shoihet in an email.

A few days after he’d been arrested in connection with the Vancouver allegations, Richmond RCMP notified staff that his access to detachment buildings had been revoked and a spokesperson emphasized the alleged incidents had taken place while Seangio was off duty.",[]

“We went off a cliff in April to be quite blunt,” said Blair Qualey, president and CEO of the New Car Dealers Association of BC. “COVID-19 came marching in and everything shut down very quickly.”

But buyers who have their hearts set on certain models may have to wait a long time to get behind the wheel. Pickups, SUVs and crossovers in particular are in short supply.

CTV News spoke to several salespeople who told us many popular models may not be available for several months.

“It’s not going to be as easy as perhaps just walking in and saying, ‘I want that one,' because there may not be a ‘that one’ on the lot, and they may have to actually order one,” warned Qualey.

Factories all over the world were shut-down due to COVID-19, and many are just up and running now.

How long it will take for inventory to get back to normal depends on the model and brand. It may also depend on how efficiently car-manufacturing countries can contain the spread of COVID-19

“You’re sort of digging yourself out of a hole,” said Qualey. “Add that to pent-up demand and it’s going to be a little while.”

“There are so many moving part to the construction of a vehicle. The supply chains are in many cases global, so you may be fine in North America, but you’re getting airbags from one place, and other parts from another place.”

Qualey admits lower supply could lead to higher prices, but dealers will want to move merchandise and will be keen to offer good deals and buying plans.",[]

John Horgan also announced a ""50-50"" partnership with the federal government to help support public transit in the province.

Horgan noted there has been a ""drastic decline"" in ridership during the pandemic, but numbers have improved as the province moved from Phase 2 to Phase 3 of its restart plan.

""But the fare box has been hit hard. Revenues from BC Transit, revenues for TransLink have fallen off a cliff,"" he said. ""Having the support of the federal government as 50-50 partners as we rebuild ridership and work with municipal partners is critically important.""

Every dollar the federal government sends to B.C., the provincial government will match, with funds going to TransLink in the Lower Mainland and BC Transit across the province.

""We anticipate we're going to be needing in the neighbourhood of $600 million to get back on track,"" he said, adding the province would work with transit agencies to ensure they ""get the dollars right.""

Speaking about the $19 billion deal reached between the federal government and the provinces and territories, Horgan said he's ""particularly proud"" of B.C.'s push for a nationally funded paid sick leave program.

""I'm grateful that a Canada-wide approach to a Canadian challenge has been met, not just with enthusiasm but with a commitment to go further if required,"" he said.

Horgan added through discussions with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, who were ""early adherents"" to the idea, they were able to get the idea ""across the line.""

""That's $1.1 billion to make sure that people don't go to work sick,"" he said, adding the program would be nationally funded and coordinated.

Horgan also did not rule out a tax holiday for businesses, saying the additional federal assistance makes it ""a consideration.""

""We're not closing any doors at this point, and we're (in the) early days of Phase 3,"" he said. ""We're looking at other initiatives to keep things going.""

An announcement from the federal government on the wage subsidy may also be forthcoming, Horgan added.

""We're going to continue to press the federal government to keep these programs going for as long as they possibly can so that we can get to a place where can stand on our own two feet,"" he said.

Trudeau announced the federal support plan Wednesday, and said the funds would help communities prepare for a possible second wave of COVID-19 and help in economic recovery from the pandemic.

The funds would also go towards boosting testing capabilities and stockpiling personal protective equipment.

The funding announcement comes days after Finance Minister Carole James revealed B.C. could face a $12.5 billion deficit due to significant revenue losses and increased spending during the pandemic.

The premier has seen high approval ratings during the pandemic, with a 17-point increase compared to last November, according to a recent survey conducted by Insights West.

""These approval ratings could translate into a landslide victory for Horgan when we go to the polls in May of 2021,"" Insights West's analysis of the results says.

The flights came from Dallas and San Francisco, as well as Kelowna and Montreal. It's recommended everyone on board those flights self-isolate for two weeks, but everyone should be monitoring their symptoms closely.

When asked about concerns around the virus and air travel on Tuesday, Henry outlined several areas that could be improved.

“All the airlines need to have processes in place to screen out people,” Henry said.

She also noted cancellation policies need to be flexible, so people who may be ill don’t end up getting on board a plane filled with other people.

“If we are not feeling well, we need to have the ability to postpone or change our flights,” Henry said. “From the airline perspective, making sure we have flexible policies.”

Henry also revealed that contact tracing has been a challenge when cases have been linked to air travel.

“One of the most challenging things we do is trying to get flight manifests a couple of days later when we recognize somebody who might be ill. The type of information on those flight manifests is often not very helpful in trying to follow up with people,” Henry explained.

She says she would like airlines to provide more complete information, including identifying people within rows of someone who may be ill.

B.C. isn’t alone in having cases tied to air travel. There have been at least 26 COVID-19 cases linked to flights across the country over the past two weeks.

Passengers arriving in Canada from international locations are required to self-isolate for two weeks upon arrival.

WestJet and Air Canada announced in June that as of July 1 the airlines would no longer be blocking out middle seats to allow for physical distancing between passengers and would once again be selling all seats on board.

Masks have been mandatory on flights in Canada since April, and all airline passengers are expected to be given a temperature check by airline staff before being allowed to board a flight.

While Henry pressures airlines for improvements, she says some of the onus is also on passengers.

“Making sure people are cleaning their hands, wearing a mask, and they stay home if they’re ill,” she said.",[]

Coquitlam officers say they were alerted to two lemons that had needles sticking out of them and were tied to trees with orange twine.

The first, found on June 22, was spotted on a branch in Gates Park. Police say a report was made to the city.

The second, found on July 14, was found on a trail near Coquitlam River at Whyte Avenue. That lemon was reported to a community police station.

But police say that's not how the incidents should have been reported.

""If you see something that could be a deliberate attempt at harm, you must call police on the phone rather than send an email,"" Cpl. Michael McLaughlin said in a news release.

""If you are leaving these lemons full of needles in public, we ask that you stop, and then talk to us to explain what you were doing,"" McLaughlin said.

The outbreak was declared on July 14, and a notice has been posted to the health authority's website.

Fraser Health has not confirmed how many patients are affected.

C. difficile, or Clostridium difficile, is a bacteria that can cause mild to severe diarrhea and inflammation of the colon. It's the most frequent cause of infectious diarrhea in hospitals and long-term care homes in Canada, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada.

The bacteria and its spores are found in feces, and people can get infected if they touch the spores and then touch their mouths.

Some symptoms of C. difficile include fever, diarrhea, nausea, loss of appetite and abdominal pain and tenderness.

For healthy people, C. difficile does not pose a risk, but people who are on antibiotics, undergoing chemo, have other illnesses or are elderly are at greater risk of infection.

Fraser Health is asking visitors to its health-care facilities to use hand hygiene stations upon entering and exiting, especially if there's been a reported outbreak. People who are sick, including those with rashes, fever, cough or flu-like symptoms are asked not to visit.

Visitors seeing patients in a unit with an outbreak may be limited to two people at a time. The health authority also recommends visitors not go to other patients' rooms or visit common areas like the lounge, cafeteria and gift shop.",[]

Padmapper shows the median monthly cost of a one-bedroom apartment in Vancouver at $2,070 in June, a decrease of 1.4 per cent from the previous month, and nearly 6 per cent from June 2019.

The decrease for two-bedroom apartments has been even larger, according to Padmapper, with listings on the site showing a median rent in June of $2,870, a decrease of 4.3 per cent from May and more than 10 per cent from last June.

Another recent report from Rentals.ca also shows decreases in the rent landlords in Vancouver are asking for in online listings. This report looked at the average cost of rent, rather than the median, with researchers discarding listings over $5,000 and under $500 as outliers.

The Rentals.ca data shows the average monthly asking price for a one-bedroom apartment in Vancouver as $1,987, a decrease of 1.8 per cent compared to the previous month and less than one per cent compared to last year.

For two-bedroom apartments, the average rent in Vancouver is $2,644, which represents an increase of 3.6 per cent from the previous month, according to Rentals.ca. This figure is still down 6.7 per cent from what the website found when looking at listings in June 2019, however.

Both platforms cite the COVID-19 pandemic as a driver of decreasing rents in recent months, though they disagree on whether prices are continuing to decline, beginning to rebound or remaining static.

Padmapper notes that nine of the 24 cities it studied saw median rents increase in June, while nine saw them decrease. The remaining six stayed the same.

The platform attributes this variation, in part, to changes in what tenants are looking for in a home during the pandemic.

""As the pandemic persists and working from home has become the new normal, it seems the demand for rentals has shifted away from the most pricey areas, like Toronto and Vancouver, and a significant amount of that demand is moving toward neighboring, less expensive areas,"" writes Crystal Chen, author of the Padmapper report. ""Renters are now prioritizing affordability and space over paying more for big city amenities, most of which they can’t use currently.""

Rentals.ca takes a different approach in its analysis of the data. Rather than looking for an overarching trend between cities, the platform looks at different types of listings and concludes that the decline in asking prices has been driven primarily by the most expensive types of housing to rent.

""When looking at all property types in Canada, the average rent declined for the third consecutive month in June,"" the Rentals.ca report reads. ""However, the bulk of the declines can be attributed to the most expensive units for rent, single family homes and condominium apartments. When focusing solely on rental apartments, the average monthly rent bounced back significantly in June, rising 6.7 per cent over May.""

That said, the platform notes several pandemic-related factors - including unemployment, reduced immigration and university classes moving online - that will continue to reduce rental demand.",[]

Authorities said 75-year-old Raymond Howard Gaglardi is facing four counts of sexual assault and two counts of sexual exploitation for alleged abuse that took place at his Coquitlam home between 1993 and 2007.

The allegations involve three teenage boys and one young man. Coquitlam RCMP is also continuing to search for potential victims and witnesses who have not yet spoken out.

""It takes tremendous courage for adult men to come forward about abuse that happened when they were young,"" Cpl. Michael McLaughlin said in a news release. ""In order to further this investigation, and protect any future victims, it’s important that we speak to others who may have been keeping this difficult secret.""

Authorities said the accused, who also goes by ""Dr. Ray Gaglardi,"" offered therapy sessions to young people he primarily met through their families at church. His credentials are unclear; a LinkedIn profile for Gaglardi does not specify any post-secondary education.

Gaglardi has been associated with a number of churches in Coquitlam and Port Coquitlam over the years, including Hillside Community Church, Austin Avenue Chapel and Evergreen Evangelical. McLaughlin said church leaders ""have done everything they can to help police and make sure their parishioners are safe.""

It's possible the investigation will expand to include a larger timeframe, other locations and different kinds of victims, McLaughlin suggested.

Police described Gaglardi as white and slim, standing 5'5"" tall and weighing about 154 lbs. He has grey hair that may have been dyed brown.

He has been arrested and released from custody on a number of conditions, including that he can't be alone with anyone under the age of 18 unless they're in public. He also can't be alone with anyone under 18 unless their parents are aware of the allegations against him.

The latest briefing from provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry and B.C. Health Minister Adrian Dix ended a stretch of five days in which the province recorded between 20 and 25 new cases per day.

That was a significant jump over the daily average of 11 cases that was recorded over the preceding 10 days.

""It was distressing to me,"" Henry said. ""It's way above my comfort zone.""

But the provincial health officer also noted the increase, which came following several separate COVID-19 exposures in Kelowna, particularly around Canada Day, was an anticipated consequence of the province's gradual reopening.

""With every increase in our activity, the potential for COVID-19 transmission increases as well,"" she said.

""We are getting out more, we're being more active and we are unfortunately transmitting this disease. But we're also monitoring closely and public health teams are actively working to mange every single case and make sure we find all of those close contacts who are at risk.""

British Columbia has passed the first incubation period since Canada Day, and since moving into Phase 3 of its restart plan. That means it's important for people to be extra aware of potential COVID-19 symptoms if they emerge.

""There may be other people out there right now who were at parties at Canada Day, who had been in contact with somebody who had this disease over the past couple weeks, and you may have mild symptoms,"" Henry said. ""If you have any concerns at all, you can be tested anywhere in B.C. and that's important right now. We need to continue to minimize our cases, manage them effectively with public health teams, and modify our activities as we need to do to make sure that we can continue to safely get out and about and open up.""

Officials did not have any additional virus fatalities to report on Tuesday, leaving the death toll at 189.

The latest update brings the total number of COVID-19 cases identified in B.C. since the start of the pandemic to 3,128. Another 12 people have also recovered from the virus since Monday, for a total of 2,730 recoveries in the province, leaving 209 active recoveries.

There remain 14 people in hospital, including five in critical care or intensive care units.

Henry said the Canadian Food Inspection Agency has reviewed processes at the farm and found them to be safe, stressing that ""food is not a source of COVID-19, for the most part.""

""We are confident there is no risk from cherries that have been processed at the Krazy Cherry farm,"" she said. ""I will remind people that we don't have any evidence of transmission from packaging or food, but that we should always wash things carefully and wash our hands.""

The 36-year-old former teacher is now living in a remote area near Cranbrook with her dog, Chester. Part of the reason for her isolation: severe environmental sensitivities that cause debilitating migraines. She also suffers from a number of other medical conditions, and for a time needed a PICC line, or catheter to the vein, inserted to be able to take regular intravenous medications.

""It’s a challenge for anybody who’s homeless to be in the elements,"" Hobson told CTV. ""And then for myself, with the added medical issues that I have, like the migraines and the allergies to everything, it just pushes homelessness to this whole new level of what feels like a complete impossibility.""

Hobson does not have heat, plumbing, or power. She is not able to stay at campsites or parks due to the odours that will trigger her migraines. In the winters, she’s driven down into the U.S. to avoid the cold.

""Last year, for example, in this area where I’m at, Chester and I made it till about middle of October, and then the temperatures dropped to minus 13,” Hobson said. ""It was just so cold.""

Hobson’s mother Ronda said prior to becoming homeless, her daughter had been renting a place in Sechelt which did not aggravate her allergies, but the house was sold.

""At that same time she got sepsis from her PICC line,"" Ronda said. ""Between those two things, she’s not been able to find a place to be able to tolerate and to live in, especially since the sepsis, because her sensitivities are even worse than they’ve been.”

Ronda said Hobson was an incredible teacher who specialized in high school English, but ultimately had to go on permanent disability after a year due to her allergies.

“That was very hard for her,” Ronda said. “Katie is just a really incredible woman. She really is very gifted. She writes music, she plays her guitar....I just would like to see her live out her special life with her condition, to be able to live it to the fullest that she can.”

Now an online fundraiser is collecting donations to help improve Hobson’s living situation, including finding her a more reliable vehicle and ordering a custom self-contained trailer.

Bud Stephenson with All Parts Trailers is helping coordinate the special order with an American manufacturer.

“It’s going to be almost all metal inside. Very, very little of anything else,” Stephenson said, and added they have to avoid using plastic due to Hobsons sensitivities. “This one she’ll be able to hook onto a regular smaller pickup truck and move it around at will.”

Stephenson said they’ve never ordered a trailer with those unique specifications before. He also said a surge in demand for trailers during the pandemic has slowed down the process.

“We’re way behind,” Stephenson said, and noted the maker of the trailer they’re ordering was also shut down for two months. “So they’re catching up.”

He’s hoping the order may be placed by this week, and then expects it will take about ten weeks to arrive.

Hobson’s mother said having the self-contained trailer where her daughter could comfortably live year-round would ""mean the world.""

""It would mean a lot,"" Ronda said, on the verge of tears. ""It just has never felt safe. Every time she left Canada to go south, my heart broke as a mom.""

Ronda said they’re also hoping to find a piece of land where she can set up her home long-term, and added Hobson also plans to prepare her home to be off-grid, in case there are no water or power hookups.",[]

Demand to book tickets online caused the Park Board website to crash for nearly an hour Sunday morning as people tried to reserve time at Kitsilano, Second Beach and New Brighton pools for a designated session on Monday, the first day they reopen to the public.

Registration opened at 9:30 a.m.

Shortly after 10 a.m., the Park Board issued an apology, citing a technical problem and thanking people for their patience.

Sincere apologies to anyone who is trying to book a swim online for the outdoor pool openings tomorrow. We are experiencing a technical challenge with our system and are working to bring it back up as soon as possible. We appreciate your patience as we remedy the issue. — Vancouver Park Board (@ParkBoard) July 12, 2020

By 10:30 a.m., the booking system was open for business.

The Park Board closed pools and recreation centres at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic when B.C. declared a public health emergency.

The three outdoor swimming pools are poised to open Monday, July 13 for the first time this year with new safety guidelines and health protocols. Maple Grove Pool will open July 20.

Swimmers must arrive ready to swim, meaning there will be no access to change rooms or lockers, and people must book their visit one day ahead, opting for 45 minutes for lane swimming or 90 minutes for leisure swimming.

The Park Board is enforcing the use of ""pods"" – painted rectangles on the pool deck – where family members or inter-connected groups can congregate at a distance from others.

Pods are limited to two people over the age of five and a maximum of three people.

""We encourage patrons to access the centre of the pod as much as possible, to allow for adequate distance between pods,"" the Park Board advises on its website.

Specific rules also govern swim lanes. Swimmers are asked to keep five metres apart and not congregate or socialize at the lane ends. To rest, swimmers are asked to leave the lane.

The pools will close for 30 minutes for thorough cleaning between sessions.",[]

Now the VSO has recorded a loving tribute to front-line health care workers that features Juno-award winning musician Dan Mangan, and some of the health care workers themselves.

“I actually had no idea that hospital front line workers would be performing as well,” Mangan told CTV News Vancouver. “I was brought to tears to see these professionals just laying it down from operating rooms.”

The song they picked to record sends a fitting message during this time of fear and anxiety: ‘All You Need Is Love’ by the Beatles.

The performance was organized by Michelle Goddard, who plays the clarinet for the VSO. She said 20 health care workers and 30 orchestra members took part, playing everything from piano to violin to trombone and even bagpipes.

Dr. Julia Reynolds provides primary obstetric care at Royal Columbian Hospital in News Westminster, and is one of the health care workers who took part with her violin, tapping into her previous musical training as a member of a symphony when she was in medical school.

“It was awesome,” said Reynolds. “I couldn't stop smiling when I watched it. It was such a joyful and creative project.”",[]

It's not that hard to turn it into a smoker, and Consumer Reports' dedicated grill-master suggests trying your hand at slow-smoking.

""Smoking imparts a really deep, rich flavour to foods that you won't find from grilling alone,"" he says. ""And foods that are smoked for many hours actually break down slowly and become really tender.""

Of course, some grills are better suited for smoking than others. For example, charcoal and kamado grills work well because you can just add wood chips or chunks into the charcoal at any point and get a nice smoky flavour.

Even a gas grill that’s great at indirect heating can handle the job. And consumer enthusiasm for slow-smoking has not gone unnoticed by grill-makers.

""A lot of manufacturers have noticed there’s been a big spike in the interest for smoking,"" Hope says. ""And what some have started to do is actually build in integrated smoker boxes that you can fill with wood chips to smoke on a gas grill.""

The Weber Summit S-470 has a built-in smoke tray and costs $2,900. But you don’t need to spend nearly that much for a top performer.

For a lot less money, the NexGrill 720-0882A from Home Depot for $500 outperforms the Weber when it comes to indirect cooking and temperature range. It doesn’t have a dedicated smoker box, but for about $10, you can get an aftermarket smoker box and just add wood chips directly to that.

If charcoal is more your fuel of choice, the barrel-style Dyna-Glo DGN576DNC-D grill makes smoking a cinch and also costs about $500.

According to PolicyMe, an online insurance platform, a recent survey found Canadians are overpaying for life insurance by as much as 36 per cent.

The start-up looked at how the industry calculates coverage and found the average customer with a policy had $200,000 more in coverage than they actually needed, and weren't looking for deals.

It also examined how much those with existing policies pay, and their habits while looking for coverage.

""When it comes to life insurance, it's not just a buy or do not buy decision. A lot of consumers are confused by that,"" says PolicyMe co-founder and CEO Andrew Ostro. ""You should be looking at different insurance companies to see for your particular policy, your unique needs, (and) who is offering you the best price. And we see, too often, customers are not doing that and that leads to about a nine per cent increase in price from not shopping around.""

Some insurance providers have also seen a bump in interest for life insurance policies since the pandemic began, Ostro says.

""Interestingly enough, (we found) it hasn't really been a fear of passing away as a result of COVID, it's more been just a general awareness around mortality,"" he says. ""The life insurance need has always been there. The pandemic hasn't caused people to need the product more.""

He advises those currently looking shop around, ask a lot of questions and try to understand exactly what the coverage entails. Ostro says PolicyMe finds in the end, many people don't even need it.

""Twenty-six per cent of the users that come through our platform and use our advice algorithms, the recommendation to them is do not buy life insurance,"" he says. ""Through our calculations we've determined that your family does not need that protection, and we're not going to sell you something that you don't need.""",[]

“Mask usage is just one of the tools that right now are available in the tool box,” said Warren Kaeding, the Minister of Rural and Remote Health.

“Our Chief Medical Health Officer has been fairly explicit as to where he sees a mask would be the best benefit.”

The province will continue to adhere to the advice of Dr. Saqib Shahab, the province’s Chief Medial Health Officer, when it comes to mask use.

“As we continue to see the evolving nature of this virus, and the understanding of the virus, if it comes to that point where the Chief Medical Health Officer believes that it needs to be taken to another level, then I would expect we would move to that,” said Kaeding.

Scott Livingstone, the CEO of the Saskatchewan Health Authority, said for now, the government will continue to educate the province about the benefits of using non-medical masks in certain situations.

“Having a little more of a voluntary policy but keeping people aware of what’s out there and how to protect themselves, I think is more important,” said Livingstone.

The SHA will continue to rely on Saskatchewan people to willingly follow public health restrictions and guidelines. A mandatory mask policy would likely only be considered if transmission of the virus was linked to a lack of mask use.

“I think we would consider what would happen with a mandatory masking policy if we started to see things that we could definitely identify were strictly related to that type of transmission,” Livingstone said.

The Government of Saskatchewan recommends masks be worn in situations where physical distancing is not possible. COVID-19 testing is now available to anyone who wants it, through referral by calling 811.",[]

Giuseppe Talerico, 67, was thankful to seeing over 60 of his friends and family lined up on his street with “welcome home” signs and balloons.

“It was the biggest surprise for me. I got a lot of friends, thank you everyone,” says Talerico.

Talerico’s battle against COVID-19 began on March 26, when he began having difficulty breathing, discoloration in his face, chest pressure and a loss of appetite.

An ambulance transported him to the Windsor Regional Hospital. Within 24 hours, he was rushed in to the ICU, intubated and put on life support.

“All we could do is pray and reach out to family and friends,” says his daughter, Eleonora Vitella. “As we could not come together physically, we virtually held masses and prayed the rosary with people from all over the world and rallied from all the support.”

The family’s faith was truly put to the test, as Talerico went from spending days, to over a month under intubation.

“Each passing day was taking a toll on his body, he had been intubated for a months' time, which normally max is 10-14 days. The ICU medical team needed to make a decision whether he could handle being extubated and survive,” says daughter Maria Calvaruso.

On April 24, the first glimmer of hope of appeared. Telerico opened his eyes as his loved ones watched on Facetime.

“It was a very emotional moment, we still had fears and because he was not out of the woods,” Vitella recalls.

On day 89, the family’s prayers were answered as Terlerico was released from Windsor Regional Hospital and sent to Hôtel-Dieu Grace Healthcare’s Rehabilitation Centre.

“We truly believe his love for his family and grandchildren kept him motivated to survive. Miracles are possible with love, prayers and faith from family and friends,” Calvaruso says.

After a total of 113 days, Talerico returned home, just in time to celebrate his grandson Leonardo’s 8 birthday on Saturday.

“A month ago he said Nonno you have to promise me you’d come one day before my birthday, and the wish came true,” says Talerico.",[]

“We are seeing a spike in the cases in the Windsor area,” says Ahmed. “Could be partly due to the reopening of the businesses as well and some of the contacts that we are seeing so it is very important that we don’t lose our guards.”

In the last seven days, 53 per cent of the cases are from the agri-farms and 47 per cent are in the other/unemployed/retired/missing category.

“I’ve seen the highs and the lows - 1971 was the worst. This is now equal,” says Grey.

He’s in the process of adding two and a half feet of soil to his land to prevent flooding in the future. “I want to eventually...re-grade that with grass,” he explains.

The region remains under a flood watch, as water levels for Lake St. Clair and Lake Erie remain near the all-time record highs set in 2019.

LaSalle Mayor Marc Bondy says there's not much that can be done besides residents elevating their homes.

“We can’t lower the water levels so at a great expense they would have to raise their homes. There’s no money available to do that, whether that’s through the municipality, province or federal government,” says Bondy.

Bondy says funding is needed, but the issue in LaSalle isn’t going to be an easy fix.

“Other municipalities have shoreline erosion. We don’t have that problem, it’s more that the water levels (are) too high.”

Ford stopped in the southwestern Ontario town Thursday for his long-awaited cut and meetings with local farmers and business owners.

The premier chose Mastronardi Barbering for his first haircut since the COVID-19 emergency orders were put in place in March, closing hair salons.

“Very exciting, it really fulfills my heart,” said shop owner Henry Matronardi, who added he felt no pressure.

When the region was excluded from advancing with the rest of the province last month, Ford promised he would visit the area to get clipped.

“I’m just so happy to be here with the people of Leamington and Kingsville they’re just down to earth people. I absolutely love them,” Ford said in a video he posted on Twitter.

Leamington and Kingsville were the last municipalities in the province to move to Stage 2 of reopening last week. The other five municipalities in Windsor-Essex advanced to Stage 2 on June 25.

Ford said it was due to the high number of COVID-19 cases in the local agri-farm sector. On Thursday the Windsor-Essex County Health Unit said there are still about 150 active cases in farm workers in the region.

The region has been excluded from Stage 3 plans so far.

Ford will also be making another COVID-19-related announcement at 3:30 p.m. on Thursday, as he continues an eight-week province-wide summer tour.

His news briefing will be at Craven Farms in Chatham with the Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs Ernie Hardeman. CTVNewsWindsor.ca will stream the announcement live.

Essex MPP Taras Natyshak said Ford should be taking more action to curb the spread of COVID-19 in the region.

He said Ford has held the region back from re-opening because the virus continues to sweep through, but has not tested the majority of farm workers, or managed the quarantine of workers arriving from other countries.

“Doug Ford is campaigning on a vanity tour of the province while our region is still crying out for help,” said Natyshak. “For months, we have been calling on Ford to take action, and make the necessary investment to get outbreaks under control. He still refuses to do that and it’s families and local businesses that are left to suffer the consequences of his failures.”

Ford said both farmers and workers are now cooperating with getting tested. On June 24, Ontario announced a three-point plan to stop COVID-19 outbreaks in Windsor-Essex.",[]

A sign that patients are starting to seek medical attention for issue they’ve put off, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

“We are seeing legitimate emergencies, these are patients who are coming to our emergency room who legitimately need to be in our emergency room,” says Chief of Staff Dr. Wassim Saad.

As a result, Saad says they are presenting late with symptoms of heart attack and stroke.

Due to a busier emergency room, Essex Windsor EMS experienced a backlog this week.

They tell CTV Windsor for a brief moment on Sunday, around 6:30 p.m., they entered into code black, meaning the number of available ambulances was zero.

Saad says handling the ER is always a struggle.

“Partly because we have some staff that work across the border in the U.S., and we’re having some issues of having them come over here and be safe in terms of their practice,” says Saad.

Some good news, however - operating rooms are being used more frequently, but the hospital is still playing catch up.

“As we started to open up, we went very quickly within a week to 30 per cent then another week to 40 per cent. Now we’re sitting at about 60 percent capacity.”

Visitor restrictions remain in place at Windsor Regional Hospital. According to the hospital, they are not looking at removing those restrictions any time soon, and are asking the public remain patient.",[]

WECHU launches strategy to help residents,'Melanie Borrelli',2020-07-16,"WINDSOR, ONT. -- The Windsor-Essex County Health Unit is encouraging residents to seek help to curb alcohol use to during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Health officials say boredom, isolation, or stress may lead people to consume more alcohol than normal, but there is help in the community for those who need help to reduce their drinking.

Health promotion specialist Melissa Valentik says a big concern is that the conditions of the pandemic may create a larger concern of alcohol dependence in the community.

“The pandemic has disrupted many of our social support networks and routines, and added challenges to our lives that may be overwhelming, leading individuals to drink more than before,” says Valentik. “Alcohol is a depressant and can also harm not only our health, but cause problems in our relationships and at work.”

The health unit is launching a new communication strategy to help get the message out to residents.

The strategy uses radio and social media advertisements to help residents understand when their own or their loved one’s drinking has become problematic, as well as linking residents to helplines and local organizations which support those struggling with alcohol use.

Before the pandemic, alcohol ranked as the number one contributor to substance-related emergency department visits and EMS calls in Windsor-Essex.

The conditions of social isolation, boredom, financial and job insecurity brought about by the pandemic have impacted the population in a significant way, putting stress on our mental health and leading to unhealthy coping strategies, such as alcohol use.

While the effects of COVID-19 and the measures being taken to reduce its spread are at the top of most peoples’ minds, the consequences of the pandemic extend beyond the direct effects of the virus.

Valentik says that while some people may use alcohol to cope with current challenges, alcohol negatively affects our mental health and makes it harder to handle our problems.

“We have a lot of great support right here in Windsor-Essex for anyone feeling overwhelmed and struggling with their alcohol use,” says Valentik. “You do not have to suffer and deal with this alone.”

The health unit has posted more information on where to get help in Windsor-Essex for alcohol or other substance use.",[]

With a mandatory face mask policy in place for Windsor-Essex, before leaving the house to go to the store having a face covering on hand is a new normal.

According to the Windsor-Essex County Health Unit, in order to safely wear a face mask a person should:

Wash their hands before putting it on and after taking it off

Make sure it fits to cover both the nose and mouth

Regularly wash the cloth mask in the laundry

Clean surfaces that a dirty mask has touched

The health unit states wearing a face mask can help protect others from your germs and when worn properly, can be effective in reducing the spread of COVID-19 from person to person.

It also helps to prevent people from touching their nose and mouth and can offer protection to others if two metres of physical distance cannot be maintained.

Face masks should be washed regularly and should not be used on children under two years old and should not be shared.

“A face mask, if worn properly, should cover the entire mouth and nose capturing and containing respiratory droplets that come out of an individual’s mouth when speaking or coughing,” Windsor-Essex medical officer of health Dr. Wajid Ahmed said during Wednesday’s daily COVID-19 briefing.

Ahmed said face shields should not be used as a substitute for a mask and is instead a piece of personal protection equipment.

“A shield does not hold and contain the respiratory droplets of the person wearing it, nor does it completely protect the wearer,” he said.

In addition to wearing a face mask, the health unit also recommends regular hand washing, practice physical distancing, avoid touching eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands and avoiding close contact with people who are ill, among other precautions.",[]

As Canadian COVID-19 trends continue to decline, cases in the United States propel upwards. The Canada-U.S. border remains closed until July 21 but reopening it to non-essential travel anytime soon would likely lead to a resurgence in cases, infectious disease specialist Dr. Abdu Sharkawy said.

""It absolutely terrifies me to think of the prospect of any sort of easing of restrictions that could allow greater travel between Canada and the United States,"" he said, adding that the United States could hit 100,000 new infections per day sometime in the next week.

""These numbers are just unfathomable and astronomical when you consider what we have dealt with here in Canada over the course of three or four months.""

He said that maps tracking COVID-19 infections worldwide, like the one pictured above from Johns Hopkins University, paints a picture of how a country can successfully or unsuccessfully manage a pandemic.

While the data on the map above is on a more localized level in the United States, which makes it appear more red, there are still an overwhemling number of cases south of the border compared to Canada.

For example, a single red dot in New York City or Los Angeles accounts for more cases than in all of Canada.

""I don't think we have seen any another part of the world where you have two neighbouring countries in polar opposite situations in terms of pandemic control,"" Sharkawy said. ""This is a very strange phenomena where you are seeing such an extreme range.""

To date, there have been 2,796 COVID-19 cases per million people in Canada, while in the United States that number is much higher at 9,051 per million.

The United States is leading the world in COVID-19 cases as it nears the three million mark, while Canada has just over 106,000.

""I think if you look around the world at other countries that have successfully flattened the curve, a lot of resurgent cases have been a direct result of travel restrictions being eased,"" Sharkawy said.

""Border control and travel restrictions are a very key element in keeping your particular geographical area safe.""

""It's the longest undefended border in the world and the last thing we want to do is turn it into the longest unprotected border when it comes to COVID-19 transmission.""

Please keep the border closed...

Ontario Premier Doug Ford said in June that he believes reopening the borders too early could spark a second wave of COVID-19.

""I know it's inevitable … I just don't think we are ready right now,"" Ford said. ""You see what's happening down in the states; you look at Florida, you look at Texas, Arizona, California. I don't want to be those states. I want to protect the people here in Ontario.""

""Believe me, I love the Americans, make no mistake about it, but not when their COVID cases are just spiking right now and I’m just not in favour.""

Since March, everyone entering Canada for non-essential reasons has been ordered to quarantine for two weeks. The order was extended until the end of August but could be pushed even further.

Travelling within Canada 'reasonable'

While Sharkawy said he wouldn't road trip across Canada right now, he said beginning to plan travel again within the country ""makes sense.""

""I think it's very reasonable to explore interprovincial travel,"" Sharkawy said.

""Again, I wouldn't do it for the sake of doing it but if someone wanted to visit friends or family and its likely to bring them a great deal of comfort and satisfaction then I think the benefit of that outweighs the theoretical risk of acquiring COVID-19.""",[]

Excitement was in the air and sweet treats were being cooked up in the kitchen as eight year old Noov Alabrach joked with London Mayor Ed Holder.

""What’s your job?"" asked the mayor.

""My job is to help my dad,"" replied the youngster with a grin as wide as his face, and his eyes beaming with pride.

Holder and several other dignitaries were on hand to help Rasool and Faekah Alabrach, and their five children cut the ribbon on Damascus House. The takeout restaurant serves authentic Shami tastes.

""I am very happy,"" said Rasool in broken English.

You see, fulfilling this dream was no ride on Easy Street. The family fled war torn Syria eight years ago, and landed in Canada with little knowledge of the country, and without speaking either of its official languages.

Four years later they ended up in what would become their home, London.

Rasool supported the family with restaurant jobs and by driving for Uber.

""So he was four years in Canada, and he was working so much, and he just decided to open a restaurant for his self,"" said his youngest daughter, 12 year old Ayah, helping her father with the translation.

London West MPP Peggy Sattler, on hand for the occasion, said opening a new business is tough at the best of times, but during a pandemic is something else.

""We know the hospitality industry is not an easy industry to crack. To open a restaurant when you’re new to Canada, when you don’t speak the language, and in the middle of a pandemic, it’s very, very impressive.""

Ward ten city councillor, Paul Van Meerbergen told the crowd of supporters that this family’s success story is what Canada is all about.

“It has been a challenge with the 50-person capacity. It really comes down to economic viability,” explains Paul Burns, CEO of the Canadian Gaming Association.

Burns says the province’s decision to limit occupancy in enclosed spaces to 50 people is too few to cover operating costs for most gaming sites.

In London, each day the 755 slots and e-table games at Western Fair sit idle costs city hall its share of gaming revenue.

“That’s dramatic. That’s has a dramatic impact on our budget,” says Mayor Ed Holder. “We generate about $4.5 million in terms of revenues as a result of the Gateway Casino (games).”

By the end of August, London city hall projects it will face a $13.5 million budget deficit caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Lost revenue from slots accounts for about $2.5 million of the shortfall. And the economic impacts extend beyond city hall.

When the province ordered gaming facilities to close on March 16, Gateway Casinos employed about 350 people at its Western Fair site.

Construction of a new casino complex on Wonderland Road has been paused until Gateway can reopen its other locations in Ontario.

On Monday, casino operators will make a pitch to public health officials in Ontario to permit more than 50 patrons if they follow new procedures established by the industry. But even if the industry is successful, gaming won’t return immediately.

“Adjacent municipalities within a 3.5-kilometre radius of the sited dump, if there is residential housing in there, will also have a say and a veto. And this will ensure that development companies take the precautions and the necessary due diligence to have the consultations with municipalities before citing their landfill.”

An emotional Comiskey mused that this could be the catalyst for environmental change in the province.

“Hopefully, this will trigger the old mother of invention, if I can’t bury it, what am I going to do with it? And maybe now, all of industry, all levels of government, will take a look at what we are producing in waste, and not stick it in the ground. But find uses for it, that are safe for all of us.”

President of Oxford People Against the Landfill (OPAL) Bryan Smith has led the community charge since day one and feels vindicated by the nearly completed law.

Manager Charlie Smith says it’s just a way to continue with the Joe Kool’s tradition.

“When we were spacing all the tables out for the customers, we thought, you know, what can we do to get creative and you know keep the Joe Kool's humour, “ said Smith.

“We thought having these cardboard cutouts of some characters around would kind of lighten the mood.”

The bear, who became known as London, was released in northern Ontario on Wednesday, says the Bear With Us Centre for Bears.

The story of London the black bear began on June 8.

After initially being spotted in the Oxford Street and Sanatorium Road area, London was tracked to the 1300 block of Commissioners Road West, eventually climbing a tree and settling in.

But when the bear began to climb down before Ministry of Natural Resources officials had arrived and prepared to contain him, he was shot in the leg by police in an attempt to protect the onlookers who had gathered to watch.

After more than 12 hours in the tree, and being shot with multiple tranquilizer darts, he was finally captured safely and transported to Bear With Us in the Sprucedale, Ont. area.

London underwent multiple surgeries to deal with the gunshot wound, which also became infected. His rescuers initially gave the three-year-old bear a poor prognosis.

Fortunately, his condition improved steadily over the last month under the watchful eye of Dr. Sherri Cox, a wildlife veterinarian and president of the National Wildlife Centre.

Last week, a final check ensured there was no more infection, and a few more stitches were put in as a final step to ensure the wound was completely closed.

Bear With Us added that there was plenty of food available in the wilds where London was released.",[]

For the past four decades, Londoner Keith Tapp, know as an “every-timer,” has participated in the Terry Fox Marathon of Hope. Never missing a run, he has the hardware to prove his dedication to the cause.

“Every year if you participate they give you another sticker, mine of course go back to year one,” said Tapp as he held a frame filled with stickers from his previous runs.

Tapp says he met Fox at the Argyle Mall the year before he began his ‘Marathon of Hope’ run across Canada.

“I got inspired by what he was doing, and hoped to do. I thought, I am going to get involved, it was just awe-inspiring to say, 'We’re going to help this kid live his dream.'”

But this year, Tapp’s run will be different. He won’t be joined by the hundreds who turn out in London to run together.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Terry Fox Foundation is celebrating this year’s big milestone online with a virtual run.

Dr. Peter Ferguson, who helps organize the local run says, “if anybody wants to participate in the Terry Fox run, they can do it anytime they’d like, by holding a virtual run or small gathering with friends, we’re hoping to get people to participate that way.""

If you are participating, Ferguson encourages you to take photos, and tag Terry Fox Run London on Facebook.

London has many connections to the Terry Fox run, including, the man who helped coin the term 'Marathon of Hope.' The late Ron Calhoun, a Londoner, was the run's national coordinator back in 1980.



Ron Calhoun, third from left, meets Terry Fox, second from left, for the first time in 1980 in this image provided by Lori Lee Calhoun, Ron's daughter.

Calhoun, and Bill Vigars, both played an important role in Terry’s journey.

“I saw him running toward the van, the giant transport trucks passing by, catching him in the headlights, and I was struck with awe,” said Vigars, who was Terry Fox’s public relations organizer and close friend.

Vigars recalled the last time he saw Fox, in his hospital room.

“I hugged him, and turned around and walked away, came back and hugged him again. And I said, 'I love you, and I will make you live forever.'""

Forty years later, and with over $800 million raised for cancer, it seems Terry Fox’s legacy will live on forever.

The province's move to Stage 3 of COVID-19 guidelines may have been a godsend for some businesses, but for others it means the restrictions imposed will keep their doors shut.

""It's heartbreaking, I was a kid when my parents first started it,"" says Nelson Vieira, who has owned the business with his wife Sandra for the past 18 years.

""Our major part is social events and unfortunately the opposite of social distancing is exactly what we do. We bring family and friends together for weddings or anniversaries that is basically something you can't do until this is over.""

The latest move by the province allows for gatherings of 50 people indoors, but they are not allowed buffet-style food service or dancing.

The Vieiras had been closed for 120 days when they received a massive property tax bill on July 1 from the City of London.

That bill is what ultimately forced the closure.

""We were waiting for the last three months and hoping for some kind of relief, or incentive that would say because you haven't been operational we'll help you this way,"" says Sandra.

""We didn't get any help, and because we are privately owned we needed other income to afford property taxes.""

They started 'Tasty Fresh Chef' takeout, but it is not enough to pay the bills.

Now they have started a liquidation sale.

""At one point, we knew would have to start some kind of cash flow to generate income to sustain the bills,"" says Nelson.

""We shut our down large freezers and coolers started a liquidation sale. Now that we are closing down, we continually add to it, which will be all our catering stuff.""

The next step is looking for ways to serve their four decades worth of customers, and for businesses to rent their four spaces on the property including their Playdate entertainment building.

Sandra says they are so appreciative of all the customers of the years.

""It's sad to see this go and we'll miss everyone, but rest assured we'll keep you in the back of our minds and we'll come back bigger and stronger. """,[]

That issue was in focus Wednesday at City Hall in a dispute between two north London neighbours.

Sam Trosow, a Western University law professor, says these days we're all on camera even if we don't want to be.

“These cameras, they're on persistently. It's not like it just scans every now and then, it's persistent, 24/7 or it can be.”

He says when we're out in the public it's one thing, but London may need to strengthen it's bylaws when it comes to home security cameras.

“In your backyard you should feel that you can go back there to relax or have friends or maybe sun a little bit without thinking that you're going to be surveilled.”

After a dispute over a fence line which was settled in court, David Johnstone noticed a camera go up on his neighbour's house in north London

A copy of a photo he received shows a fraction of his backyard in the upper left corner, and that's what started worrying him.



The area covered by a backyard security camera is seen before it was adjusted. David Johnstone's backyard is in the top left corner.

“The last stand I have is my backyard. I don't want to be on camera in the backyard and it has nothing to do with a disagreement with a neighbour. I have to be clear this affects every household in the City of London whether you own or rent.”

The city was called and so were police, but both have told Johnstone that the neighbour involved is doing nothing illegal.

When we reached out to the neighbour, he said he adjusted the camera months ago to exclude Johnstone's backyard.



The area covered by a backyard security camera is seen after it was adjusted. David Johnstone's backyard is in the top left corner.

He didn't want to appear on camera, but in a statement he added that he installed the cameras after vehicle break-ins and in doing so he aims to protect his family and property. He also says he will abide by any bylaw changes.

At the Community and Protective Services Committee the matter was sent back to staff to make further inquiries about whether the existing bylaw should be amended.

Johnstone says, “This is not a victimless crime, the victim is all the people that camera monitors all the time even if there's no criminal activity.”

He says he's not only worried for his own family, but he's concerned about the privacy of his neighbours as well.

Ontario Premier Doug Ford revealed the province’s plans for moving into Stage 3 of it’s reopening plan Monday.

Regions not included in the reopening are the Toronto area, as well as Sarnia-Lambton, Haldimand-Norfolk and Windsor-Essex, among a few others.

London was one of the first regions to enter Stage 2 when it was announced.

Over the past week the region served by the Middlesex London Health Unit (MLHU) has seen a decline in numbers, including a three-day stretch where no new cases were reported.

What kind of businesses can reopen in Stage 3?

According to government’s framework set out in April almost all businesses will be able to open in some capacity during Stage 3.

Movie theatres, gyms, casinos, indoor dining and bars can all open with some special measures in place:

Table games at casinos are banned.

Restaurants, bars, concession stands, etc. are allowed to reopen for indoor dining, but nightclubs are still banned except for serving food or drinks.

No dancing is allowed for patrons, but musical performances can resume.

Gyms and fitness studios can reopen with safety protocols in place.

Organized sports can resume, except for contact sports.

Playgrounds, community centres and libraries will also reopen, along with interactive museum and gallery exhibits.

CTV News has learned that work is already being done at London-area movie theatres to prepare for reopening.

Some high-risk businesses, including amusement parks, buffet restaurants and overnight camps, will not yet reopen. Concerts and sporting events are also still prohibited.

The full list of businesses that can reopen is here.

Other changes in Stage 3

Also in Stage 3, the maximum number of people allowed at an indoor gathering climbs to 50 from 10, while outdoor gatherings rise to 100 people.

Physical distancing must still be maintained with those outside someone's social circle, and those limitations have not changed, with only 10 people allowed to interact without physical distancing.

Whilt the total number of people allowed goes up, religious, wedding or funeral services must continue to fill only 30 percent of a venue's capacity.

In addition to organized gatherings, these caps also apply at casinos, bingo halls, performances, convention centres, theatres and sports facilities like gyms.

The government will monitor COVID-19 cases and has warned that restrictions could be tightened again if necessary.

There was no change in recoveries, which stand at 570, or in deaths, which has held at 57 since early June.

That leaves 14 active cases in the region.

The vast majority of the cases, 591 have been in the City of London, with 23 in Strathroy-Caradoc and 12 in Middlesex Centre, and the rest scattered in the region.

More than 32,000 people have been tested at the city’s two assessment centres since they opened over three months ago, and visits appear to steady.

The region enters Stage 3 of reopening on Friday, which will see most businesses open their doors to the public again.

Then on Monday, masks become mandatory in transit buses, taxis and ride share vehicles, and in high-risk personal service businesses.

City and health officials will also meet Monday to discuss whether masks should be mandatory in all indoor public and commercial spaces.

Here is how the totals stand as most recently reported by other local public health authorities:

Huron-Perth: One active, 59 cases, 53 resolved, five deaths (one new case)

Elgin-Oxford: Two active, 87 cases, 80 resolved, five deaths

Grey-Bruce: One active, 115 cases, 108 resolved, six referred, no deaths

Sarnia-Lambton: Two active, 287 cases, 260 resolved, 25 deaths

When Stage 3 of reopening begins on Friday, residents in Huron-Perth and Grey-Bruce will be required to wear masks in the vast majority of indoor commercial and public spaces. There is no similar requirement in Elgin-Oxford.

Lambton County is among the few regions in Ontario not moving to Stage 3 on Friday.

And while Lambton Public Health officials recommend the use of masks, they have said at this time that “evidence and local context does not support the mandatory public use of masks in a community setting.”

This announcement comes after a steady increase in ridership over the past few weeks, according to the city.

Starting on Aug. 2, transit will be returning to its regular summer schedule. Full weekday service will then resume on Aug. 4.

“We saw passenger levels drop to their lowest point during the month of April, when we saw an average of 70 per cent reduction in ridership over the same time frame last year,” said Jay Shaw, the city’s assistant chief of emergency management.

Shaw said transit levels stayed around that mark throughout May and June, with an approximate 66 to 68 per cent reduction in ridership.

“However, we have seen a steady increase in ridership through early parts of July with an approximate 52 to 56 per cent (reduction in ridership) over the last two weeks,” he said.

“With those numbers continuing on an upward trend, the decision was made to restore summer transit service beginning in August.”

The city recommends that Winnipeg Transit passengers wear non-medical face masks while riding the bus. It notes that transit drivers and inspectors won’t be enforcing the use of masks and asks people not to judge those who aren’t wearing one.

“Dr. (Brent )Roussin and the province of Manitoba have been pretty clear right now that if you can’t maintain social and physical distancing, then a non-medical face mask is definitely an option,” Shaw said.

Shaw noted the masks are recommended, not mandatory.

“We want to be able to maintain that safe service. Transit has been a safe service the whole time and we want to maintain that as we move into this new normal as we go forward,” he said.

Winnipeggers are also asked to maintain a reasonable distance from other passengers on the bus, use the back door when getting off the bus if they’re able, and avoid using transit if they have any flu-like symptoms.

At a news conference on Friday, Mayor Brian Bowman thanked the city’s transit operators.

“They do incredibly important work to keep our city moving and especially in these unprecedented times, I want to thank them, I want to thank their loved ones and their families for all that they’re doing to keep this city moving,” he said.",[]

Mason and Sierra Malmsten are 16-year-olds and currently at the Children's Hospital of Winnipeg battling cancer.

Mason was diagnosed with Stage 3 Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and Sierra was diagnosed with Stage 2 Hodgkin's lymphoma.

Their dad, Gordon said everything started back in May when Mason developed a cough.

""With everything going with COVID and everything, of course, we got him tested for COVID, it came back negative and so his doctor said it is probably his asthma,"" said Gordon.

He said Mason was given a puffer and the doctor said his cough would go away in a few weeks.

However, just before he was supposed to be done using his puffer, he started to cough up blood.

""We brought him into the Steinbach emerg to get him checked out. Spent most of the evening there. They did a bunch of tests and determined that they thought it was a very severe case of bronchitis.""

Again, Mason was given medication but he was still coughing up blood a few days later.

Gordon said they took Mason to the children's hospital, per his family doctor's request and after waiting there for several hours the doctors said there was a strong chance he had cancer.

""He has a large mass the size of a softball growing in his chest. It is left of his heart, right of his esophagus, right underneath the top of his left lung, and right above his carotid arteries,"" he said.

Gordon said Mason spent a few days in the ICU and the doctors were eventually able to confirm that it was cancer.

A SECOND DIAGNOSES, DAYS LATER

He said the family was obviously upset about the diagnoses, but a few days later Mason's twin sister Sierra said she had a bump on her neck.

Their family doctor said they should take Sierra in for tests just in case.

Gordon said they again went to the children's hospital at which point they ran into Mason's cancer doctor and he told him the situation.

""His comment was 'it's extremely unlikely that she has cancer',"" said Gordon, adding the doctor still advised she get checked out.

A week later the doctors then diagnosed her with cancer.

Sierra Malmsten

Gordon said their doctor, who has been in the field for 35-years, has never heard of fraternal twins both being diagnosed with cancer a week apart.

DEALING WITH CANCER IN A COVID-19 WORLD

Gordon said it has been difficult for the family and said learning of the diagnoses was extremely disappointing.

On top of everything, he said the situation hasn't been made any easier with COVID-19.

Gordon said only one parent was allowed to visit at a time and so he and his wife Sherri, would be ""passing each other in the hallways"" as they visited Mason.

He said it became more difficult once Sierra was diagnosed because they weren't allowed to bring their youngest daughter Brooklynn with them to the hospital.

Gordon added they relied on family to look after Brooklynn and it was only as of two weeks ago they were allowed to bring her to the Ronald McDonald House where they have been staying.

THE FINANCIAL TOLL OF DEALING WITH CANCER

He also said this has taken a financial toll on the family as both he and his wife had to take a leave from their jobs.

""We still have like our regular household stuff that is happening at the house and we still now have the expense of the Ronald McDonald House,"" said Gordon. ""The Ronald McDonald House is a great place, amazing place, but still you have your meals that you have to be thinking of and you have to buy your groceries for here and the little extra stuff that they need. The hospital food is not always the best, so then you are running out and grabbing little snacks for them. It's been a lot of driving back and forth and a lot of parking.""

THE FAMILY PLANS FOR THE NEXT STEPS

Gordon said at this moment in time both Mason and Sierra are close to finishing their second round of chemotherapy.

He added that the doctor said the best-case scenario, chemo could stop in September, worst case they would need to continue chemo until Christmas time.

""Once the chemo stops, then we need to start building up their immune system again, which is the next big challenge,"" he said. ""The doctor said it's going to probably be the New Year before their life goes back to normal.""

'IN IT TO WIN IT' FAMILY PULLS TOGETHER THROUGH DIFFICULTIES

Gordon said Mason and Sierra have been staying as positive as possible and he added that in a way it has been a blessing that they are going through this together and supporting each other through everything.

""They support each other, they cry with each other, they are each other's biggest cheerleaders.""

Sierra and Mason.

Gordon added that for him and his wife it has been difficult. He said they try to be positive when around the kids but it gets tough when they are by themselves. Gordon said they cry a lot, adding it is hard to be positive sometimes.

But he added that his wife has started using the saying ""We're in it to win it"" and that no matter what Mason, Sierra, and the entire family are going to get through this time.

FUNDRAISER STARTED FOR MALMSTEN FAMILY

Gordon said a family friend has started a GoFundMe for the family to help cover some of the financial issues.

As of Thursday, the page had raised more than $5,700 for the family.

He added that if people don't want to donate to the GoFundMe, he is urging people to register to become a blood donor as both Mason and Sierra have had to have blood transfusions. He also encouraged people to give support to the local Ronald McDonald Houses.

Gordon said he appreciates all the support his family has been receiving and they are hoping they will be able to get through this soon.",[]

Though the COVID-19 pandemic put a halt to the real estate industry back in the spring, things have started to pick up.

Kaya Wheeler, a first-time homebuyer, said even with the pandemic going on, she still wants to find a home of her own.

“When we do go see homes, we have been asked not to touch surfaces, like turning off and on lights, like maybe not to do that,” she said.

“There’s usually hand sanitizer as soon as you walk in the door.”

Glen Tosh, president of the Manitoba Real Estate Association, said when the province first shut down, houses weren’t selling -- now it’s a selling frenzy

“There’s definitely some pent-up demand because the real estate market kind of, in a sense, lost out on the latter half of March and most of the month of April, where there was very limited number of sales,” he said.

According to the Manitoba Real Estate Association, 2,015 residential properties sold in June, which is $616.1 million in total dollar volume. So far this year, there have been over 7,100 residential sales, which represents 97 per cent of the total unit sales over the same time period last year.

“Brandon and Winnipeg are our two major centres that we have the most data on, and they're both up in the month of June,” Tosh said.

“We also recently attained some data that cottage sales are up significantly in the month of June, plus in the year, they are up almost 50 per cent.”

Real estate agent Monica Manaigre said there’s actually a shortage of houses for sale.

“Twenty-nine per cent of houses sold in June sold for over list price, so we are seeing a lot more buyers and not quite enough inventory,” she said.

That’s something Wheeler knows first-hand.

“We were looking at a house and an offer was accepted while we were still in the house,” Wheeler said.

Wheeler said there are a few houses in her price range, but they are going fast. She said she has put offers out, but she wasn’t the only one.

“I think there were six or seven offers on the same house,” she said.

Wheeler’s advice for other first time homebuyers is to go slow and take their time to find their perfect first home.",[]

The proposed loitering bylaw will be voted on by city council on July 21. The proposal would give police and bylaw officers the authority to ticket people who stay around on public property.

Marlene Elder, who is a community activist, said this bylaw is designed to target homeless and Indigenous people.

""We know that, they (council) know that. But they are not prepared to admit to that. So that is why we are stepping out,"" said Elder.

The other concern that Elder has is she feels like the bylaw would impact the ability for people in that city to protest.

""So it will affect our ability to raise issues on public property. So that is a serious concern.""

Elder said that council tried to sneak this proposed bylaw under the ""COVID radar"" and that the public wasn't aware of it until Monday.

When she learned of the bylaw she said it was very scary and she thinks it has been proposed now that tourists are coming back to the area.

""There is a whole bunch of areas that they are saying it's for but really it is to just clean up the town in the summer for those tourists that are now being welcomed back.""

Elder said she and others are now reaching out to the councillors who are in favour of this bylaw to tell them about the human rights issues, the bad public relations, and the legal costs this bylaw will cause.

""This is not going to stand up to a Charter challenge at all. I don't know if they just thought nobody would notice,"" she said.

If this bylaw is passed, people would face a $100 ticket if they’re found to have broken the bylaw.

CTV News reached out to Kenora Mayor Dan Reynard for comment.

He declined an interview but he said in an email that council needs time to review additional information and to have a ""wholesome discussion in order to make the best decision.""

Hurren's lawyer, Michael Davies, said he had not yet received disclosure of the evidence against his client and asked to have the bail hearing postponed until July 31.

Assistant Crown attorney Sabrina Goldfarb said the RCMP only sent their disclosure documents Thursday and it was not in a usable format, and that it would take until early next week for the evidence to be passed on to the defence.

Justice of the Peace Andrew Seymour granted the adjournment.

Residents can now register for two-hour public swim, lap swim and fitness blocks at the Cindy Klassen Recreation Complex and the Pan Am Pool. These facilities will offer limited access to fitness equipment, walking tracks and pools.

Some of the changes at these facilities will include reduced capacity, physical distancing, hand-sanitizing stations, and increased cleaning.

The city also noted the pools and fitness areas will be closed to the public for 30 minutes between the blocks. Access to locker rooms and showers will be limited, and there will be a limited number of life jackets.

Winnipeggers are encouraged to book their swim and fitness blocks before arriving, because there’s no guarantee there will be spots available.

The swim and fitness blocks will be offered on a week-by-week basis, with new spots coming out on Thursdays. Reservations can be made up to 30 minutes before a time slot, as long as there’s space.

Residents can register for blocks online or by contacting 311 for help.

Manitoba RCMP said the incident happened on Wednesday shortly after 12 p.m. when officers were called to a 'disturbance' at the Liquor Mart on Mystery Lake Drive in Thompson.

Police said a woman had knocked over a display and was breaking bottles.

A 30-second video of the incident posted to Facebook Wednesday evening appears to show a woman sweeping bottles of alcohol off the shelves and yelling profanity at the employees.

The video then shows a woman pulling on a row of shelves that come crashing down. A security guard appears to be holding the woman by her neck as the two struggle amid the mess.

The video ends as the woman yells 'Get off of me.' It does not show what led up to the incident.

RCMP told CTV News when officers arrived, a woman was found outside the business.

A 22-year-old woman from Split Lake was arrested and is facing charges of mischief, causing a disturbance, and failure to comply.

The charges against her have not been proven in court.

RCMP said she has since been released and is scheduled to appear in court on Sept. 22, 2020.",[]

Since 2017, thousands of dollars have been charged for homes built in new suburbs, but last week a judge struck down the fee calling it invalid. Now Winnipeg Mayor Brian Bowman said he won't sign off on an appeal, which could potentially pave the way for refunds of the controversial fee.

The city could be paying out more than $32 million. As of March 31, the fee was charged to more than 3,200 permits in six areas of the city.

They include:

More than $11 million from Waverly West;

$7.3 million in Old Kildonan;

$6.6 million in South St. Boniface;

$4.3 million in Transcona West;

$2.9 million in Wilkes; and

$1,900 in North Henderson.

""Provided that there's no appeal initiated by the applicants, I'd like to see those refunds go in a timely way,"" said Bowman on Wednesday.

The Manitoba Home Builders' Association said it is encouraged by Bowman's words, but it isn't sure when refunds could happen. It said it needs clarification from the judge on portions of the ruling that could impact purchase agreements.

""We need to clarify that so we've covered those situations off,"" said Larry McInnes, president and CEO of the association.

The road ahead is also unclear as the mayor wants the city to work with the industry on how development costs can be shared.

The association said it is willing to review the development agreement to see if the industry is paying its fair share, but McInnes doesn't want to see the city come back with a new version of the impact fee bylaw.

""To just simply re-tweak the failed impact fee bylaw in our opinion is not the right starting point,"" said McInnes.

But that could be exactly what happens as the mayor said the court ruling concluded that the city could bring in a fee and that the judge just had concerns with the corresponding bylaw.

""We have confirmation that we have the ability to impose an impact fee. We can revisit the bylaw this year and make those adjustments,"" said Bowman on Wednesday.",[]

Premier Brian Pallister made the announcement at a news conference at the Manitoba Legislative Building on Wednesday.

“We are leading the country, but we are not out of the woods yet,” he said.

“And I wouldn’t want my statement today to be misconstrued as suggesting we should ease off in any way our efforts as we move forward. We have more Manitobans unemployed than in any time since the Great Depression, a high percentage of people are looking for work, higher than has ever been the case in the lifetime of most Manitobans.”

Statistics Canada said Manitoba’s unemployment rate was 10.1 per cent for June.

The new expanded program will reimburse up to $5,000 for up to 10 new workers for a maximum of $50,000per business, non-profit, or charity.

The province noted that any businesses that have already used the summer wage subsidies are still eligible to take part in this benefit and hire or bring back another 10 employees. It added that any employers that have received financial aid from other provincial or federal programs are still eligible as well.

The program will also reimburse half of all wages for those newly hired to Oct. 31.

“Our expansion and deepening of our programs will allow employers and employees to offer the services that Manitobans depend upon and rely upon and to help us to recover,” the premier said.

Businesses will be able to apply for the wage subsidy program starting on July 16 at noon. The application deadline is Oct. 1, and the deadline to submit proof of wages is Jan. 4, 2021.

“We’ve led in creating a safe environment for our people and that has enabled us to lead in terms of our economic recovery as well,” Pallister said.

“We understand that the safety of our people is paramount, but being safe and being unemployed is hardly a recipe for joy or success in life and so what we’re after here is being safe and employed instead.”

The province also announced it’s extending the deadline for applications for the Manitoba Gap Protection program to Aug. 31.",[]

The new tourism campaign from Travel Manitoba invites Manitobans to explore their province as the economy continues to reopen.

""This is a great opportunity to get out and explore your own backyard,"" Colin Ferguson, president and CEO of Travel Manitoba, said at a press conference.

The campaign also rolls out the welcome wagon for visitors from other provinces.

Travel Manitoba launched the $2 million campaign Monday, encouraging people in western Canada, northwestern Ontario and the Territories to see what Manitoba has to offer.

One day later, the province announced five new cases of COVID-19. At least one of the cases involves a person who recently travelled to and from Calgary.

While some people say it is not yet time to open Manitoba's borders to outside travellers, Premier Brian Pallister said now is the time.

“We have the benefit in western Canada of having some of the safest jurisdictions in the world,"" Pallister said. ""Promoting Manitoba is the right thing to do.""

Pallister said Manitoba can’t allow a continued shutdown of every aspect of the economy, calling the tourism strategy a 'balancing act'.

“We know that we can’t continue to live in fear – that being said we have to exercise responsible relaxing of the past rules,"" he said.

Pallister added while COVID-19 case numbers are increasing in parts of western Canada, such as Alberta and Saskatchewan, the important number is the percentage of positive tests and not the total number of positive cases.

He said we still need to adhere to the fundamentals, but that doesn't mean a continued shutdown of the economy.

""Manitoba offers the safest site for you to visit in the country and one of the safest in the world,"" he said. ""The reality is that we are diligent here and we know we can't continue to live in fear. That being said, we have to exercise responsible relaxing of the past rules.""

The Manitoba Hotel Association told CTV News the hotel sector has been hit hard by the pandemic, and the additional business from outside travellers would be welcome.

""If they think it’s safe, then we’re more than happy to accommodate that business that may come,"" said Scott Jocelyn, president and CEO of the Manitoba Hotel Association.

Pallister made the announcement Tuesday morning, saying the current program penalizes those who want to return to work.

The current program will give Canadians up to $2,000 as long as they earn less than $1,000.

""The program needs to be redesigned. It needs to be redesigned to make sure people aren't penalized for working and wanting to support their families without having to be dependent on the CERB,"" said Pallister.

The Manitoba government created the Job Restart Program as an alternative for Manitobans, which would provide payments of up to $2,000 in financial support for those who went off CERB and took a full-time job.

""We all succeed as Canada succeeds,"" said Pallister.

Pallister said he has written to other premiers in Canada, as he hopes they will also ask the federal government to make changes to the program.

Pallister added he wants to make it clear that he is not criticizing the federal government, saying he believes Ottawa has done a good job handling the pandemic.

NDP Leader Wab Kinew told CTV News he believes CERB should remain and be expanded, and says the premier does not understand the need for CERB.

“I don’t want to see a second lockdown happen, but as long as the experts are saying there is a possibility we might have to do more restrictions, we need to keep programs like the CERB and the wage subsidy in place to help people through this difficult economic time,” he said.

“In my own experience, I know really hard-working people who were put out of work due to the lockdown restrictions, and they had to turn to the CERB, and if Mr. Pallister doesn’t understand the importance that it played in allowing people to keep making their mortgage payments, to put food on the table, to pay their bills, it tells me he doesn’t understand the scope of the recession we’re in, and the importance of that program to help keep our economy moving.”

In a statement, Manitoba Liberal Leader Dougald Lamont said the province’s reopening strategy cannot be about going back to normal.

“Governments and businesses need to plan to handle that reckoning while building a much stronger and self-reliant economy, not more of the same,” Lamont wrote in a statement.

“Brian Pallister needs to look at the colossal failures of his own PC government before he points fingers at anyone else.”

MANITOBA RESTART

Pallister also touched on the importance of face-to-face meetings and he feels more can be done compared to electronic meetings.

With that, he said the plan is to head to Ottawa with a Restart Manitoba Taskforce, which would include several cabinet ministers to discuss a handful of topics.

""I think it is time for us to get back to some face-to-face on a number of fronts,"" said Pallister.

He added he can't talk on all the details right now, but the plan is to meet with those in the nation's capital in August.

PROMOTING TRAVEL IN MANITOBA

On Monday, Travel Manitoba released its newest campaign encouraging Manitobans to explore their own backyard, but the campaign also targeted those in Western Canada as well as northwestern Ontario.

Pallister was asked if this was the right approach considering there are still a higher number of cases in those provinces.

""Manitoba offers the safest site for you to visit in the country and one of the safest in the world,"" he said. ""The reality is that we are diligent here and we know we can't continue to live in fear. That being said we have to exercise responsible relaxing of the past rules.""

Pallister added while COVID-19 case numbers are increasing in parts of Western Canada, such as Alberta and Saskatchewan, the important number is the percentage of positive tests and not total positive cases.

On Tuesday, Shared Health said the province has a stabilizing PPE stockpile, which means more N95 respirators will be available for staff.

Lanette Siragusa, Shared Health’s chief nursing officer, said that making sure healthcare and front-line workers are safe has been a top priority for the province.

“Throughout this pandemic, personal protective equipment protocols have continually been adapted based on the evidence, leading practice and local expertise to ensure that our staff remain protected,” she said.

“And as we continue to plan and prepare, our current supply of PPE has improved steadily in all categories since the height of the pandemic.”

During the pandemic, healthcare workers have been using infection prevention and control measures, as well as known science, national and international guidance, to stop the spread of the virus between patients and staff. This includes point-of-care risk assessment, hand hygiene, and disinfecting all environments and equipment.

“These processes have been and will continue to be required in the care of all patients at all times in every healthcare setting,” Siragusa said.

Shared Health noted these measures, along with necessary precautions and PPE, have proven effective: 26 healthcare workers in the province have tested positive for COVID-19 since the pandemic started, though there has not been a confirmed case involving a healthcare worker since May 10.

There has also not been any confirmed cases among healthcare workers where the appropriate precautions were followed.

SHARED HEALTH, MNU REACH AGREEMENT

Shared Health and the Manitoba Nurses' Union (MNU) have also reached an agreement regarding increased access to PPE for nurses.

Siragusa said the policy change is the result of talks that began with the nurses' union, “but we are extending it to all healthcare workers to ensure that providers have consistency in application and protocols.”

In a statement, MNU president Darlene Jackson said nurses have been voicing their concerns about the PPE supply for months.

""Every nurse has a right to a safe workplace, and this agreement is a big step in the right direction following months of advocacy by nurses on this critical health and safety issue,"" she said.

Siragusa said Tuesday’s announcement should not be misinterpreted.

“COVID-19 is still a threat in Manitoba,” she said.

“We anticipate that PPE procurement will be an ongoing challenge that will require close scrutiny in the foreseeable months and while we continue to adapt the PPE guidelines based on evidence and based on circumstances, we still do encourage clinical providers to embrace these changes but also remain vigilant in their efforts to conserve PPE as much as possible.”

But for one Corydon Avenue business, there’s another issue hurting their bottom line, construction.

Jarrett Bargen, manager of Falafel Place on Corydon Avenue, said they shut down the restaurant for two-and-a-half months during the pandemic.

When they reopened, they went from twenty-two tables to seven.

“Maybe a drop in about 60 per cent of our regular business from previous years, so it’s affecting us a great deal,” said Bargen.

But space isn’t only limited inside, the street outside has been taken over by construction.

“Because [people] see the construction, they don’t even know if we’re open because we always used to have people park on the streets right in front of the restaurant,” said Bargen.

He said the impact of both construction and COVID-19 has been difficult for the restaurant to endure.

Down the street from Falafel Place, James Cassels, the owner of Mighty Comics, said he’s seen a minor drop in foot traffic due to construction.

“I have good supplementary access. I have parking in the back,” said Cassels. “It’s just a temporary inconvenience. It’s not like they’re ripping up the entire road in front of me and all the side streets as well.”

Cassel said road work needs to be done and thinks the city should have started construction earlier when the majority of businesses were shut down.

In a statement to CTV News, the City of Winnipeg said:

“The City makes every effort to coordinate construction projects and mitigate their impacts as much as possible and is committed to communicating directly with affected businesses and residents.”

“We appreciate Winnipeggers’ patience as we work to complete these important infrastructure projects.”

The city said it typically provides 1-month advance notice to residents and businesses about neighbourhood projects and a 1-week notice in advance of construction.

Bargen said Falafel Place has a loyal base of customers, and they’ve been a great help to the restaurant during this challenging summer.

But the construction isn’t going to be finished anytime soon.

“September or October of this year,” said Bargen. “So, we can expect many more months of this hurting the business.”",[]

Erin McKenzie is now recovering after the surprise encounter with the bear left her with a gash on her face and claw marks on her back.

The attack happened on Monday afternoon, on the Moon Lake Trail in the national park.

""All of a sudden at the top of the hill, a black bear just came running out of the bush to my side,"" McKenzie said.

""It just reacted out of fear and it struck me in the face with its paw, and then again in the back. I'm not really sure what happened first.""

McKenzie said she screamed out of fear and pain, and the bear ran off. She said the whole attack lasted only a matter of seconds.

""I knew right away that I was gushing blood because I could see all the blood coming down on my shirt and onto my legs and my shoes,"" she said.

""I did think I was going to die for a moment there because I was attacked by a bear.""

McKenzie said she spoke with her brother and mother on the phone as she walked more than five kilometres back to the mouth of the trail, where her boyfriend met her and took her to the hospital.

MOON LAKE TRAIL CLOSED DUE TO BEAR ATTACK

Parks Canada confirmed with CTV News that an individual was attacked by a bear on the Moon Lake Trail on July 13.

Parks Canada learned of the attack a day later. The trail has since been closed.

""Human and wildlife safety is of the utmost importance to Parks Canada,"" the government agency said in a written statement. ""The Agency takes action to promote coexistence between people and wildlife, to ensure the well-being and safety of both.""

Parks Canada said the Moon Lake Trail is a natural feeding corridor for wildlife during the summer months.

McKenzie said she had been running on the trail with her dogs all summer, and though she had seen many black bears in the area before, she never had any issue.

""Almost every time I go hiking I come across bears and all sorts of wildlife, and I've never had a problem with any of it. Usually, I see them before I get too close,"" she said. ""That was the first time on Monday that I've really come close to losing my life.""

RESTRICTIONS PUT IN PLACE ON TRAIL DAYS BEFORE ATTACK

In order to reduce 'potential human-wildlife encounters', Parks Canada said it placed restrictions on the trail on July 10.

These restrictions say no dogs or bicycles are allowed on the trail, and people on the trail are required to travel in groups.

""It is important for visitors to remember that they share the surrounding habitat with wildlife,"" Parks Canada said.

""Riding Mountain National Park is home to many black bears and visitors can encounter a bear at any time or any place, whether it be on a busy trail close to town or in the remote backcountry.""

McKenzie said she missed the restrictions about no dogs and travelling in groups, as there are a number of signs at the mouth of the trail.

ROAD TO RECOVERY WON'T KEEP MCKENZIE OFF THE TRAIL

McKenzie said the gash on her face was deep, but doctors did not put stitches in as a precaution, in case it becomes infected.

""I didn't even know that I got hit on the back by the bear until I was at the hospital and one of the nurses pointed it out to me. There is clearly five claw marks where it swiped me, but those are more superficial than anything,"" McKenzie said.

""Really what I'll be left with is just a scar on my face and maybe a little bit of nerve damage.""

She said she doesn't believe the bear was aggressive or wanted to hurt her.

""I think that we just both scared each other so badly that it was only acting instinctively at the shock of me suddenly being right next to it on the trail.""

Still, she said the incident has been a good wake-up call for her.

""It hasn't stopped me from continuing to hike up there and enjoy the trails. If anything, it is a little bit of an awakening to be a little bit more aware of my surroundings,"" she said.

PARKS CANADA WARNS HIKERS TO TAKE PRECAUTIONS

Parks Canada said, while black bears mostly try to avoid people, encounters between the bears and people do happen.

Parks Canada said people hiking in bear country should make noise while out hiking, to let bears know they’re in the area. Hikers should also carry bear spray, ensure it is accessible, and know how to use it before hitting the trails. Dogs should also remain on a leash, as Parks Canada says they can provoke defensive behaviours in bears.

On Wednesday morning, the province announced this year’s recipients of the Order of Manitoba, an honour given to residents who have shown excellence and achievement and enriched the social, cultural or economic well-being of Manitoba.

Normally, this announcement is made on May 12, which is Manitoba Day, but this year’s recipient reveal was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead, Wednesday’s announcement coincides with the 150th anniversary of The Manitoba Act coming into effect and the 100th anniversary of the opening of the Manitoba Legislative Building.

Appointments to the Order of Manitoba are made by the chancellor, Lt.-Gov. Janice C. Filmon, and are based of the recommendations of an advisory council.

“This year, as Manitobans have been tested and have responded with courage, creativity and hope, we are even more aware of the importance of commitment to community,” said Filmon.

“The community leaders to be invested into the Order of Manitoba in this, the 150th anniversary of the province, will continue to inspire their fellow Manitobans through their personal achievements and their dedication to our province, our country and our world.”

The following 12 people have been selected for the Order of Manitoba this year:

Chaise Corydon, known for its usually busy patio, got its first ticket for $2,542 in mid-June for not spacing its table and chairs enough. At the time, the owner thought a warning should have sufficed.

READ MORE: Winnipeg restaurant owner fined more than $2,500 for breaking health orders

On Friday, the restaurant received a second ticket for $2,542 because some patrons were dancing and not physical distancing.

""This is getting ridiculous these [inspectors] are out of control,"" said Shea Ritchie, the owner of Chaise Corydon. ""This is every authoritarians' dream situation.""

Ritchie believes both reasons for Friday's fine aren't worthy of the hefty price tag.

""Apparently everything we did was wrong, and we have to pay $5,100 in total now for two fines for not knowing these ever-changing, ambiguous rules,"" he said.

In an effort to bring people further into the restaurant and create more space on the patio, Ritchie hired a DJ. He said the inspector told him four people were dancing, hence the fine.

""We have a bathroom at the back of that room people were dancing,"" said Ritchie. ""If someone is waiting in line and moving to the beat, are we supposed to walk up and tell them to cut that out? Where does it end, and where does it start?""

As for the accusation of not properly social distancing, Ritchie claims there was a reservation of 40 people in a room with a capacity of 86.

When asked about the fine at the news conference, Dr. Brent Roussin stayed firm on the rules.

""We are not back to normal, and when we are enforcing the Public Health Act, there's often plenty of opportunities to fix things and warnings, but we will protect Manitobans,"" said Roussin.

Ritchie, however, said he never received warnings.

According to Ritchie, he asked the inspector which specific rules in the Public Health Act he broke. The inspector could then not specify the rules and then changed whether he thought the establishment was a restaurant or a licensed facility.

""I'm not trying to give the government any pushback,"" he said. ""There are too many situations. You can't control them all. In that case, go around giving people a lot of warnings.""

Ritchie said he's not mad he got fined, he's mad that the inspectors ""won't follow their own rules.""

Ritchie has since contacted the inspector and tried to get the fine reduced to a warning. With no luck, Ritchie said he'll fight it in court.

Like most players locked down during the COVID-19 pandemic, the always-blunt Winnipeg Jets sniper hadn't been on skates in more than two months. He also scoffed at the idea of strapping on rollerblades.

With training camps now in full swing eight weeks later, and the league's restart fast-approaching, that feeling of not being ready hasn't really changed.

""Still kind of far away,"" Laine said Wednesday when asked about the current state of his game. ""It's kind of hard to see myself playing playoff hockey in two weeks.

""But just trying to make the most out of it and trying to be as well-prepared as I and as we can ... just try to work hard these next couple of weeks so we'll be ready when the puck drops.""

Those games are coming quick for the 24 teams involved in the resumption of play, including the Jets, who are set to meet the Calgary Flames in the only all-Canadian matchup of the best-of-five qualifying round beginning Aug. 1 in the Edmonton hub for spot in the traditional post-season bracket.

In truth, the entire league is scrambling to get back up to speed. Certain players had access to home gyms and ice sooner than others. It's simply a reality of the times.

And all things considered, Winnipeg head coach Paul Maurice said Laine, who eventually got skating back home in Finland, isn't as far away as the winger made it sound.

""Kind of looks exactly like everybody else,"" Maurice said. ""I don't think anybody looks the way they're going to in about two weeks. We all expect that. It's part of building.""

Building is also what Laine did with his own game this season before the NHL was shuttered in mid-March by the novel coronavirus.

Coming off a disappointing 50-point campaign in 2018-19 -- he'd scored 80 goals and added 54 assists in his first two seasons after being picked second overall behind Auston Matthews at the 2016 draft -- Laine focused on becoming a more complete player.

""You always want to get better at everything you're doing, but I think just try to add some consistency,"" said the 22-year-old. ""The difference between a bad night and a good night -- that gap -- just try to get that a little bit smaller and try to get the better overall game in better shape.""

Laine missed training camp back in September while working on a two-year, US$13.5-million contract extension, but shot out of the starting blocks after rejoining the team, having put up 28 goals and 63 points in 68 games when the season was suspended.

""Development and growth,"" Maurice said of what Laine showed from October through March compared to his three previous campaigns. ""It's hard to explain when you get a young man that has such success in something specific like scoring goals. But in so many ways, he wouldn't be any different than any other 18-year-old, especially coming from Europe. (The NHL is) a different style of hockey.

""It's a far different level of the game. It happens so much faster.""

Maurice said Laine's biggest jump came at 5-on-5 and understanding the need to work as part of a unit.

""There's a big chunk of the game of hockey where nothing actually happens unless you don't do your job,"" said the coach. ""He's gotten to be quite a bit better at just doing the job, plays without the puck more.

""If he's the first guy on the forecheck, he needs to do something so the four players can move. Most skilled players or uniquely-skilled players that you get into the NHL, they've never really had an awareness of that -- that what they do changes what everybody else around them does.""

Laine made waves during his contract impasse when he told a Finnish reporter he deserved to play with the Jets' best players, namely Mark Scheifele and Blake Wheeler.

""I think I've been able to show everybody that I'm capable of playing top minutes and against top players,"" Laine said Wednesday. ""Hopefully I'm going to get more responsibilities in the future.""

Maurice, meanwhile, made it clear at no time did he have a problem with Laine's comments.

""Had I taken offence to that, I would've been greatly offended 20 years ago and every year since,"" said the veteran of exactly 1,600 regular-season NHL games. ""I wonder a lot of times if it's not requisite to greatness. These guys want more. They want to play more. They want to play more minutes.

""The great players have to have that belief in themselves that they deserve to be on the ice all the time.""

That belief is surely still there for Laine, even though it might be a little shaky at the moment.

When asked if he'd be concerned about letting CFL players from the harder-hit United States come to Winnipeg for a shortened 2020 season, Pallister said a good health and safety plan could be developed to make it work for the city.

""I'm concerned we'd be dismissive of the possibility of allowing people to come to our province because there are a lot of other people who have COVID when they don't. I'd be concerned about that,"" Pallister said Tuesday.

""I think as long as the precautionary measures and the self-isolation periods and the other recommendations of our health officer are respected and followed, then I think we're not in an unreasonable position to offer relative safety. And in offering relative safety, if we can then advance our economy and social lives, then that's a good thing.""

The league hasn't started its 2020 season, but has said a hub-city possibility is one option for a shortened campaign.

Winnipeg and Regina have been mentioned as hub-city possibilities.

The earliest an abbreviated '20 season will begin is September, but CFL commissioner Randy Ambrosie has stated a cancelled campaign also remains possible.

Pallister thinks football with no fans in Winnipeg could provide a boost for the province.

""Yes, I do miss my sports. But I don't think there's a day coming very soon where we're going to have the ability to get back in the stands and cheer on the Bombers to the next Grey Cup. I'm realistic about this,"" Pallister said

""Dr. (Brent) Roussin (Manitoba's chief public health officer) has said it repeatedly -- the day of big public gatherings isn't here yet. But that doesn't mean the day of a broadcast, simulcast possibility of watching football should never come. So I think we can draw the distinction here and realize we must maintain safety on the one hand, but we can't let our fears cause us to remove every aspect of our lives.""

When asked if his government has talked to the CFL, Pallister was vague.

""I'll say we'll have more to say on that in due course when there's something to say,"" he said.

Since the Washington NFL team's announcement, Brandon Burley, the mayor of Morden, has said he is setting up a Go Fund Me page to help cover the re-branding costs of two local sports teams.

Burley said the cost of rebranding will be in the thousands of dollars. As CTV News previously reported, the Morden Redskins and the Morden Mohawks have voluntarily decided to make the change.

Burley said the teams are ambassadors for the communities they represent.

""We want team names to reflect our values as they are right now,"" Burley told CTV News. ""I know the needle has changed on this and it's moved and I think as education changes and awareness of these issues change, our willingness to change needs to increase as well.""

In a written statement to CTV News, Jeff Hnatiuk, president and CEO of Sport Manitoba, said the organization encourages inclusive environments for the athletes, teams, coaches, volunteers, fans and families.

""We know our provincial sport organizations are working with their leagues and teams to incorporate policies to keep sport safe, fun and respectful for all involved,"" Hnatiuk said.

Chris Moffat, an executive for the Morden Mohawks, said the team is on board.

""Last night we flat out said 'Is anybody in objection to changing the name?' No words were spoken,"" Moffat said.

Not all teams in Manitoba are planning to change their names.

Ken Waddell is the Neepawa Natives team president. He said the team is owned by the community, which chose the team's name.

He said if a name change is considered, it will be a community-based decision.

Ian McArton, executive director of Hockey Winnipeg, said in a written statement to CTV News, it is focused on getting the teams back on the ice, before considering any name changes.

“When it comes to the names of teams within Hockey Winnipeg, this is a matter that Hockey Winnipeg’s executive will be reviewing in the near future,"" McArton said.

""Currently our focus is on a safe return to play amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Once we have our protocols and procedures finalized, and our member associations and facilities prepared, we can look into other matters like the naming of our teams.""",[]

In preparation, Copp said he's received five COVID-19 tests, which he now calls brain ticklers.

""You don't feel good during the test, but after that, you're fine,"" he said.

Several players from teams around the league have decided to opt-out of the playoffs, but for Copp, that was never even considered.

""I haven't even thought about opting out once to be honest,"" said the forward. ""I love to play hockey, and I've been missing it for the last three months.""

Copp said being young, healthy and observing the NHL's strict guidelines, he isn't worried about getting the virus. He hopes the other players feel the same way.

""We all feel safe here, I feel like that helps us feel normal in the room even with the protocols,"" said Copp. ""We're able to see each other on the ice in a practice situation, that's the feeling we all desire at this point.""

Skating in Michigan during the pause, Copp said he's ready to play hockey.

""We are all professionals at this point, and we know how to get ready, whether it's three weeks or you get the whole offseason,"" he said. ""It's our job, and you have to be ready to go.""

Before the NHL went on hiatus, the Jets were on a four-game winning streak.

""To replicate that feeling is going to be hard, but hopefully, by having a good training camp and being ready to go and having an exhibition game, hopefully, all those things start to come back to us,"" said Copp.

Copp said the most important thing will be regaining the team's confidence.

Taking place in the two hub cities, Edmonton and Toronto, 16 teams will be battling it out over ten days to complete the initial round. The Jets will be taking on the Calgary Flames in a best of five series.

""Having five or six games a day, especially if they're playoff games and intense, it's going to be really fun to watch and be a part of,"" said Copp

This is the highest single day rise in cases since the virus arrived in Saskatchewan.

In a release, the province said of the new cases, 31 are in the south region, six are in the central region, four are in the Saskatoon area and one is in the north.

NEW CASES IN SOUTH WEST, WEST CENTRAL SASK.

Speaking Thursday, Warren Kaeding, the Saskatchewan Minister of Rural and Remote Health, said the vast majority of new cases are related to a growing outbreak in a number of Hutterite communities in south west and west central Saskatchewan.

Kaeding asked Saskatchewan residents in these areas to continue following all health and safety guidelines.

“We’d all hoped that we were through the most difficult phase of COVID-19, and with everything reopening, no one wants to take a step back, but there is now increased risk in south west and west central Saskatchewan,” Kaeding said.

The Saskatchewan Health Authority said it is taking steps to mitigate risk in these areas, however it has not implemented as strict guidelines as were in place when outbreaks appeared in north west Saskatchewan.

Currently, the government is not planning on ramping up restrictions in the affected areas, but would consider it if cases and transmission continue to escalate.

“We’re going to monitor how this is unfolding,” said Scott Livingstone, the CEO of the SHA. ""[We’re] certainly hoping that with some of the limitations we put in place in the southwest that we can go with the current limitations, but we wont preclude that we would take more if we deem them to be necessary.”

The SHA has ramped up their contact tracing in these areas, which helped reveal many of the new cases in the at-risk areas.

“Its not just testing those folks with symptoms, it’s going door to door and doing assessment with aggressive contact tracing,” said Livingstone.

“We learned from our experience up in La Loche, going door to door is much more successful, it allows us to identify cases early on, do aggressive contact tracing, so within 48 hours we have 90 per cent of contacts traced.”

There are currently 114 active cases. Three additional people recovered from the virus for a total of 794.

A total of 11 people are currently in hospital. Nine are in inpatient care, including seven in Saskatoon, one in the south and one in the north. Another two people are in intensive care; one in Saskatoon and one in the south.

Regionally, there are 339 cases in the far north, 204 are from the Saskatoon area, 121 are from the north, 85 are from Regina and 59 are from the central region.

There have been 321 cases in the 20 to 39 age range, 285 in the 40 to 59 age range, 161 in the 60 to 79 age range and 26 in the 80-plus age range; while 130 cases involve people aged 19-years or younger.

A total of 15 people have died from the virus in the province.

INCREASED TRANSMISSION RISK

Risk of COVID-19 transmission has increased in the south west and west central regions of the province, according to the Saskatchewan Health Authority (SHA).

In a release, the SHA said it has identified additional people with COVID-19 in these areas, as a result of aggressive contact tracing.

While some of those who tested positive are linked to known trains of transmission, others have no known source of infection.

The SHA said this increased level of COVID-19 activity has increased risk of transmission to the public in these parts of Saskatchewan.

The following rural municipalities and areas have increased risk of transmission for the virus:

Maple Creek (No. 111)

Auvergne (No. 76)

Biggar (No. 347)

City of Swift Current

Eagle Creek (No. 376)

Grandview (No. 349)

The Saskatchewan Health Authority will be temporarily restricting visits to the Cypress Regional Hospital, as well as to long-term care homes located in areas where there is higher risk of getting COVID-19.

A report from administration says it’s expected more people will decide to vote by mail because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

“Due to COVID-19 and to facilitate greater utilization of the mail-in ballot voting opportunity, the application for mail-in ballot and voter registration process is being enhanced to allow for non-in-person application and verification of identity,” the report reads.

The mail-in ballot procedure for past elections included having the voter attend the election office at City Hall in person in order to register and apply for a mail-in ballot package. Administration wants to change the process to applications for mail-in vote packages so they can be made online.

There would be a requirement for a designated witness to sign a voter-and-witness declaration, much like the process for vouching for the identity of a voter at a polling station. The witness and voter would have to provide copies of identification bearing a signature, unless the witness is in one of a number of approved professions.

“For the 2016 election, 196 mail-in ballot packages were issued to voters. The election team is planning for higher demand in 2020. An in-person application process will be available at the election office (226 Cardinal Crescent,) with appropriate measures implemented to ensure staff and citizen safety; however online application is encouraged.”

City council approval is needed to change the mail-in ballot process where a voter needs to attend the election office in person. In-person application and registration would still remain an option.

Ruth Walter, a resident from Big Rose Hutterite colony, says increasing cases in colonies are difficult to manage because space is shared between families and separation is uncommon.

“If we were immune to it that would be amazing and it would be great however if one person gets the virus, you have to realize the way we live that's going to spread,” said Walter.

According to Walter, there have been no active cases of COVID-19 confirmed in her home colony of Big Rose. However three people have been sick with symptoms and isolated without being tested.

“My nephew was the first person to be sick, he's been well for some time and now his mom and another woman are sick,” said Walter.

“The SHA is working closely with the Hutterite Safety Council, local leadership to help control the spread of the virus,” said Warren Kaeding, the Saskatchewan minister of rural and remote health, at a press conference on Thursday.

Walter says most Hutterite residents are following physical distancing protocols and they are limiting visits to grocery stores.

“When we go out to town it is a bit of a shock, but before we go we get a mask and anti-bacterial wipes and we try not to touch anything, and frankly I don’t go unless I absolutely have to go,” said Walter.

Microbiologist Dr. Joseph Blondeau said he believes masks do have a place in the fight against COVID-19.

“These masks are catching these respiratory droplets and preventing the wearer from then putting this virus particle onto somebody else who might be susceptible,” he said.

But Cody Payant, the organizer of the March to Unmask protest taking place Sunday in Saskatoon, said people should have the right to choose what to wear on their bodies, adding that the government’s mixed messaging about the effectiveness of face masks is a red flag.

“It’s not actually making anyone safer. It’s just people are scared. The government’s using that fear and then people are scared and they think that they have to wear masks and think that anyone who is not wearing a mask is putting their health in danger and it’s just propaganda,” he told CTV News.

He said he doesn’t think masks are bad or that people shouldn’t wear them at all, but he believes that people should have a say as to whether or not they wear them.

Cities across Ontario, including Toronto and Ottawa, have started making non-medical face masks mandatory while at indoor public spaces like businesses and public transit.

A mandatory face mask law will be going into effect in Quebec this weekend — something that hasn’t happened in Saskatchewan.

“I think it’s totally within reason to say if you need to go out, wear a mask and if it’s too much of an issue, I guess stay home,” said Sarah Dorward, who was initially living in Ottawa before moving back home to Saskatoon.

Another local resident, James Kumaran, said “it would just make me feel better personally and I’m sure a lot people would feel the same.”

Angela Martens who was walking around downtown Saskatoon said, “I think by making it mandatory, it would just make it an easier decision for people.”

Blondeau said despite cases going up in the province, he doesn’t think we’re at a point where mandatory masks are required.

“But a mask is a useful tool in those situations where you cannot guarantee physical distancing.”

He said masks shouldn’t be treated as a replacement for hand washing and physical distancing, but as an additional tool.

Blondeau also recognizes that some people have concerns about masks causing other potential health issues and breathing problems and said it’s something he is researching.

“We know that some patients have exhibited some signs of an allergic type of reaction where they get a little bit of discomfort on and around their face where their mask is touching them. But I have not been able to find an abundance of data to say that by wearing the mask, it’s causing you additional respiratory problems.”

He adds that masks collect moisture the longer they are worn, so it is important for people to clean them regularly or discard them, depending on what material they are made of.",[]

Instead, they are pushing for him to receive education about racism, and missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls.

On Friday, Alex Johannesson posted a photo on Facebook of a lineup of vehicles on the Highway 16 overpass in Saskatoon during a walk to honour Ashley Morin, a missing North Battleford woman.

In the post, Johannesson said the walk was holding up traffic and for someone to “run through these jokers.”

On Friday, the Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations called the post “highly offensive and disturbing,” and urged the man’s employer and the Saskatchewan Hockey Association to cut ties with Johannesson, who is a minor hockey president in Waldheim.

Redhead Equipment, the company he works at, and the association both told CTV News they are looking into the incident.

Saskatoon police also confirmed they are investigating the post, but are respecting the Morin family’s wishes to focus on compassion and education.

Manuela Valle-Castro, coordinator of the Saskatoon Anti-Racism Network, said it’s important to address the root of the problem by educating people about systemic racism.

“It’s not about shaming individuals. It’s not about particular individuals, it’s really about how normalized anti-Indigenous racism is on the Prairies and how comfortable people feel making these kinds of dehumanizing comments just in passing,” she said.

Russell McAuley, a team member with the Saskatoon Anti-Racism Network, agrees and said education is a life-long process.

“It’s important to acknowledge that just because these incidents are being publicized doesn’t mean they didn’t happen before because historically this is how we’ve always been treated as Indigenous people but I think it’s important that now we’re able to share our stories,” he said.

McAuley adds that it shouldn’t only be on black, Indigenous and people of colour (BIPOC) to educate the public but for people of all backgrounds to come together and be allies, and stand up to racism.

The Morin family said their focus is not on this incident, but on bringing Ashley home.",[]

Staff Sgt. Darren Pringle says meth addiction is also keeping many of his officers in his platoon busy creating more difficulties when arrests are made.

“The normal things you would do in terms of applying force aren’t very effective. (Suspects who are on meth) have lots of energy, they may or may not be in a bit of a psychologically altered state and it takes a little more work to get these people into custody,” he said.

He also says meth is cheap, easy to come by and the effects of the drug last longer. When a person comes down from the drug, the person is hurting in multiple ways until they can get more of the drug, which ultimately leads to more property crimes like multiple vehicle break-ins.

“The crash from meth is particularly spectacular because when you come off the drug, there’s all these physiological factors that go along with it so on there is an incredible drive to replicate that high and make the hurt go away because the low is so very low and your body hurts.

“For $40 to $50 you can get a gram of meth, compared to $80 to $100 for a gram of (cocaine). You smash a couple car windows, you find some change and you can facilitate that high again for yourself very quickly. That’s what’s driving up the property crime,” Pringle said.

According to an SPS report, as of July 6 there were 57 meth possession and four meth trafficking occurrences, up from 35 possession and four trafficking arrests at the same time last year.

Overall for 2020 police said there have been a total of 290 possession and trafficking incidents compared to 201 over the same period in 2019. This follows the record number of 80 meth offences in May 2020.

The number of occurrences related to crystal meth have steadily increased month-to-month over the course of 2020.

In February, police reported 32 possession and trafficking offences. That number increased to 37 in March, 45 in April, up to 80 in May and 61 in June.

Since 2012 the number of meth possession and trafficking occurrences has increased more than 25 times from 19 occurrences in 2012 to 477 occurrences in 2019, according to SPS statistics.

Kayla Demong, the associate director with AIDS Saskatoon, says it has been dealing with a meth epidemic for the last five years, leading to a strain on its services.

“We’re seeing definitely an increase in people in drug-induced psychosis. Across all of our programs, we’re seeing people with far more complex mental health needs and a lack of resources for them to access. We need all sectors to come together and look at this from a community perspective. It’s not just enforcement, it’s not just treatment, and it’s not just harm reduction. We need initiatives that look at all aspects of what people are going through and are able to respond in a holistic way to support them,” said Demong.

AIDS Saskatoon says the hugest gap for people living with meth addiction in Saskatoon right now is access to mental health care and services that are equipped and can work with people who are in psychosis and experiencing a heightened state.

Colleen Christopherson-Cote with Safe Community Action Alliance recently helped release 27 core strategic actions to assist in the meth epidemic in Saskatoon. She agrees in having all levels of government to focus on creating a facility in Saskatoon - specifically for meth use.

“Many of the treatment facilities that are addressing substance use look at an-alcohol based treatment facility so looking at crystal meth and the things that are very specific to that drug addiction will be a critical piece moving forward,” said Christopherson-Cote.

Christopherson-Cote says in Saskatoon people who are more vulnerable and marginalized are more likely targeted in getting access to meth. She also points to Canada’s history in relation to the reasons why meth addiction is so high.

“In this province and Canada in general has a deep rooted history of colonization and trauma so those are the root factors that drive people towards substance use. Its mental health, addictions, trauma and colonial heritage. Indigenous people make up easily 80 to 90 per cent of the homelessness and meth addiction. We need to start talking about dismantling and disrupting colonial systems that are creating and perpetuating cycles of poverty, substance use and trauma,” said Christopherson-Cote.

Both Demong and Christopherson-Cote said COVID-19 and the provincial and federal government’s response to the virus has shown what people can do when they come together in a timely manner. They would like to see the same level of response and action with meth addiction.

“We need to treat this as a public health crisis. We need to treat poverty, substance use and trauma as a public health crisis. People are dying by many of those social determinants of health,” said Christopherson-Cote.

“We have an HIV epidemic, a crystal meth epidemic and now we’re seeing an overdose epidemic in our province and the response to those things is not getting the full support from the government as it should be. What we learned from COVID-19 is, if we can work efficiently and effectively and quickly, people can get help really fast and things can get put into place really fast and all the red tape isn’t really necessary,” said Demong.",[]

On May 15, RCMP were executing a search warrant on a property in the Rural Municipality of Glenside north of Biggar as part of a drug trafficking investigation.

Mounties said shots were fired in the direction of officers and one officer sustained a non-life threatening gunshot injury.

Mitch Hutchinson, 49, was arrested and charged with numerous drug-related offences and 18 firearm charges.

On July 15, Hutchinson pleaded guilty to possession and drug trafficking charges and firearm charges.

Hutchinson’s defence lawyer, Brian Pfefferle, said the Crown dropped an attempted murder charge.

He said that was appropriate as his client said he thought he was shooting at an animal.

“He took sole responsibility for everything,” Pfefferle said. “He ended up shooting and grazing an officer during the search warrant, he thought it was an animal.”

Hutchinson was sentenced to five years for trafficking and possession and two years for the firearm charges.

“A good deal and the right result for a guilty plea,” Pfefferle said.

During the search in May, RCMP said officers recovered a kilogram of methamphetamine, over 444 grams of fentanyl and 400 tabs of LSD.

Officers also recovered two money counters, over $16,000 and scales and packaging for drugs, according to RCMP.

Several weapons were also seized including a sawed-off double-barrel shotgun and a light anti-tank weapon.

RCMP said the anti-tank weapon was not in a functional state.",[]

“Fortunately for us, our technology helps businesses become ecommerce-enabled and operate remotely. We have seen a significant increase in demand, and are looking for more talented Vendastians to help us democratize technology for small businesses.”

Vendasta’s work to bring its total employee count to 650 by 2021 was briefly paused as businesses around the world assessed the damage of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Job postings are being added daily on the company’s website.

The Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations (FSIN) shared a screenshot of a post made by Alex Johannesson on Friday.

The post shows a photo of a lineup of vehicles on the highway 16 overpass in Saskatoon during a walk to honour missing North Battleford woman Ashley Morin.

The post reads: “the line of traffic is unreal!! Someone please run through these jokers.”

RCMP say Morin was a victim of homicide. The walk from Saskatoon to North Battleford marked the two-year anniversary of her disappearance.

In its initial posts, the FSIN called Johannesson’s comments “highly offensive and disturbing,” and urged the man’s employer and the Saskatchewan Hockey Association to cut ties with the man.

The FSIN posted an update Tuesday, claiming Johannesson was fired from his job at Redhead Equipment in Saskatoon and that he is no longer president of minor hockey in Waldheim.

“Threats of violence are unacceptable in any situation and we encourage everyone to do their part in reporting these types of social media posts,” the FSIN said on its Facebook page.





Redhead Equipment stated to CTV News that it has “dealt with the situation.”

“Please be assured these views DO NOT reflect the values of Redhead Equipment and we are taking this incident extremely seriously,” said Chelsea Jacobs, director of marketing for Redhead Equipment in an email.

The Saskatchewan Hockey Association told CTV News it is “assessing the situation” involving Johannesson, who is the president of the Waldheim Minor Hockey Association.

“We will have no further comment until a review into this matter is complete,” Joseph Laprairie, manager of marketing and communications for the Saskatchewan Hockey Association said.

The incident is being investigated, the Saskatoon Police Service says.

It will be using purified protein provided by its research collaborator, Canadian company ZYUS Life Sciences, according to a news release.

Preliminary research results from ZYUS show that plant-based antigens are reactive to anti-COVID-19 antibodies and potentially offer immunity from COVID-19, the company said.

The company, which specializes in medical cannabis research, says it was able to express a coronavirus protein in Nicotiana benthamiana, a variety of the tobacco plant, and showed that the plant-based SARS-CoV-2 protein is recognized by antibodies in the serum of recovered COVID-19 patients.

That suggests that plant-based protein, in this form of a vaccine, could potentially provide protection from COVID-19 infection.

“Rapid production of large quantities of an antigen with suitable purity and quality is a critical step in developing a vaccine for COVID-19,” said Brent Zettl, ZYUS CEO.

“These preliminary test results are an important step forward, offering scientists and researchers more options to scale vaccine production in the global fight against COVID-19.”",[]

BBB says it's a scam.,'Michael Franklin',2020-07-17,"CALGARY -- A new scheme used by criminals may seem like a good thing at first, but consumer groups say there is a dark side to the idea.

The Better Business Bureau (BBB) says fraudsters are using Amazon to deliver random products to customers throughout North America. The victims of the technique, called 'brushing', may not understand why they're being given products for free.

At face value, the reason for these strange deliveries may be innocuous, the BBB says. Most often, the companies are using your address and Amazon information to send you products and then using your name to write a glowing online review that would, in turn, prompt higher legitimate sales.

However, the BBB says the fact they've gotten hold of your personal information is bad news for you.

""Certainly, they have your name and address, and possibly, your phone number and a password. Once the information is out there, it could be used for numerous crooked enterprises,"" the agency says in a release. ""If your credit card is linked to your Amazon account, they could use it to purchase the products that are delivered to you.""

If you notice this happening, the BBB says the first thing to do would be to contact Amazon immediately through their customer service page. By going to the official Amazon webpage, you will be able to ensure they conduct a proper investigation and take action.

Second, you should change your passwords immediately and take additional steps such as checking your credit report and bills for strange payments.

""You may (also) want to consider a password manager service to improve account security,"" the BBB says.

There is a good side to the scam though. All those products that were sent to your address are yours to keep.

""In Alberta, the Consumer Protection Act says companies cannot require you to pay for unordered goods or services unless you agree in writing to pay.""

That means since you didn't agree to that humidifier, hand warmer or even a computer vacuum cleaner, you don't need to pay.",[]

Pence, drawing sharp contrasts between U.S. President Donald Trump's vision for the country and that of Biden and other Democrats, said the election will determine ""whether America remains America. ... or whether we leave for our children and grandchildren a country that's fundamentally transformed into something else.""

Pence's message in Wisconsin reflects a broader effort from Trump's reelection campaign and his allies to paint November in the starkest terms, and it highlights the core message the president appears to have settled on for the closing months of the campaign.

The speech delivered on the campus of Ripon College in battleground Wisconsin comes as polls show Trump trailing Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, in a state that Trump won by fewer than 23,000 votes in 2016. Winning Wisconsin is key to both Trump and Biden's plans for victory.

Biden, for his part, also frames November as a fundamental choice, with his campaign's paid advertising and daily arguments casting Trump as fundamentally unfit for the presidency. Biden points repeatedly to Trump downplaying the coronavirus pandemic and stoking racial tensions amid a national reckoning with police violence against Black Americans and centuries of systemic inequalities. Beyond Republicans' usual framing of Democrats as tax-and-spend liberals, Pence's attack on Biden Friday was pegged in part to the Democrat's sweeping economic proposals, from making a government health insurance plan available to all working-age Americans to a $2 trillion plan to overhaul the nation's energy grid and reduce the carbon pollution driving the climate crisis.

Pence said that if Biden wins the election, the country will spin into economic decline, be less safe and have open borders and taxpayer-funded abortions. He accused Biden of having a ""radical agenda"" that will ""transform this country into something utterly unrecognizable.""

Pence said Trump, not Biden, supports law enforcement and will ""stand with African American families and all minorities to improve our quality of life in our cities and towns."" He called a recent rise in shootings and murders in some major cities a ""frightening preview of Joe Biden's agenda in action.""

""The hard truth is you won't be safe in Joe Biden's America,"" Pence said.

Pence said Biden had aligned himself with ""socialist Bernie Sanders and the radical left wing of the Democrat Party.""

Pence referenced Ripon's place in history as the birthplace of the Republican Party, while invoking former Republican presidents Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan in attacking Biden as someone who supports socialist agendas like the one of former Cuban dictator Fidel Castro.

""Their agenda is based on government control, our agenda is based on freedom,"" Pence said of Democrats.

Ripon is home to the "" Little White Schoolhouse, "" a national historic landmark that was build in 1850 and is recognized as the birthplace of the Republican Party. It hosted the first meeting of three existing political parties that formed the Republican Party.

Pence cast Trump's record before the coronavirus pandemic crippled the economy as an ""extraordinary three years of progress and renewal."" He said Biden would crush the economy with new clean energy regulations, move toward socialized medicine, open the borders, have taxpayer-funded abortions and work against school choice.

Biden spokeswoman Kate Bedingfield countered that Trump's economic policies have ""harmed Wisconsin at every turn"" and that Pence glossed over Trump's economic record, both before the pandemic and since. As for casting Biden as a radical, Bedingfield was incredulous.

""That's a ludicrous argument, and I think they will have a very hard time getting that to stick to Joe Biden,"" she said, pointing to the candidate's long record of making deals as a senator and as vice-president. The Pence visit came as COVID-19 cases were spiking in Wisconsin. Only about 50 people were allowed into the room where he spoke, with chairs set up so they would be at a distance. They had temperature checks before entering and were given a squirt of hand sanitizer. Ripon College policies require everyone in a campus building to have on a mask, and those who attended the speech complied.

Pence wore a mask when he entered the room but removed it for his speech.

Pence was also scheduled later Friday to tour a dairy farm in western Wisconsin outside of La Crosse and participate in a round table discussion with farmers. Trump won that congressional district by 4.5 points in 2016.

The 87-year-old Ginsburg, who has had four earlier bouts with cancer including pancreatic cancer last year, said her treatment so far has succeeded in reducing lesions on her liver and she will continue chemotherapy sessions every two weeks ""to keep my cancer at bay.""

""I have often said I would remain a member of the Court as long as I can do the job full steam. I remain fully able to do that,"" Ginsburg said in a statement issued by the court.

Ginsburg, who was appointed by U.S. President Bill Clinton in 1993, is the senior liberal justice on a court that leans conservative by a 5-4 margin. Her departure before the election could give President Donald Trump the chance to shift the court further to the right.

Ginsburg's history with cancer goes back more than 20 years. In addition to being treated without surgery for a tumour on her pancreas last year, she also underwent surgery for colorectal cancer in 1999, pancreatic cancer in 2009 and lung cancer in December 2018.

Dr. Alan Venook, a pancreatic cancer specialist at the University of California, San Francisco, who is not involved in Ginsburg's care, said that ""clearly, she's got incurable disease now"" because of the spread to her liver.

On average, patients with advanced pancreatic cancer live about a year, but the fact that her disease took so long to recur from her initial pancreatic cancer surgery in 2009 and previous treatments ""suggests that it's not been growing rapidly,"" he said.

""She's above average in many ways."" and has done remarkably well with all her treatments so far, Venook said. ""There's no reason to think she would die imminently.""

Asked earlier this week about a possible opening on the court before the election, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said the president would act quickly if any opening were to arise. Meadows commented after news that Ginsburg had left the hospital after receiving treatment for an infection, which she said Friday was unrelated to the cancer.

""I can't imagine if he had a vacancy on the Supreme Court that he would not very quickly make the appointment and look for the Senate to take quick action,"" Meadows said, adding that he didn't want any comment to be seen as wishing Ginsburg ""anything but the very best.""

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has said that if there were to be a vacancy on the court during this year's election cycle, the Republican-controlled Senate would likely confirm a nominee selected by Trump.

Ginsburg said she was disclosing her cancer treatment now because she is satisfied ""that my treatment course is now clear.""

Venook said the chemotherapy drug Ginsburg said she is getting, gemcitabine, is one that's often used. Immunotherapy, which Ginsburg's statement said she tried unsuccessfully, has not worked well for pancreatic cancer, Venook said.

Ginsburg said a medical scan in February revealed growths on her liver and she began chemotherapy in May.

""My most recent scan on July 7 indicated significant reduction of the liver lesions and no new disease,"" she said. ""I am tolerating chemotherapy well and am encouraged by the success of my current treatment.""

Ginsburg noted that she is able to ""maintain an active daily routine"" and that throughout her treatment she has ""kept up with opinion writing and all other Court work.""

When the justices heard arguments via telephone in May because of the coronavirus pandemic, Ginsburg participated one day from a hospital room in Baltimore. She was being treated for gall stones, and said Friday that hospitalization also had nothing to do with the cancer.

Johnson said the government's advice to avoid non-essential use of public transit was being lifted immediately, and that from Aug. 1 workers would no longer be told to do their jobs from home, if possible. He said it will now be up to to businesses to determine whether they can bring employees back to workplaces in a ""COVID-secure"" way.

The U.K.'s official pandemic death toll, which stood at more than 45,000 as of Friday, has for several weeks been the highest in Europe and the third-highest in the world behind the United States and Brazil.

Johnson is trying to walk a tightrope, avoiding a resurgence of the virus while also encouraging a return to shops, restaurants and workplaces to kick-start a moribund economy that has shrunk by a quarter since March.

While some businesses have seen customers return in previous stages of lockdown easing, those that rely on office workers struggling, and Johnson is keen to see more people go back to city-centre workplaces.

But the prime minister's move to give employers ""more discretion"" about whether to ask their staffs to return to regular work locations appears at odds with the views of his chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance,, who said Thursday that there was ""absolutely no reason"" to change the work-from-home advice.

Johnson said he was not ordering people back to the office.

""Obviously it's not for government to decide how employers should run their companies and whether they want their workers in the office or not,"" he said.

The announcements apply only in England. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland all have their own public health systems and are reopening at slightly different speeds.

At a news conference, Johnson set out more details of the U.K.'s road out of a nationwide lockdown that was imposed in March but is gradually being eased. Shops, pubs, restaurants and hair salons have already reopened in England, and Johnson said they can be joined as of Aug. 1 by beauticians, casinos, bowling alleys and skating rinks. Nightclubs will remain closed.

He said indoor performances would be able to restart in August ""subject to the success of pilots"" and sports fans should be able to return to stadiums in October.

Johnson said the measures could be reversed if coronavirus infection rates begin to climb again.

A report commissioned by scientific adviser Vallance said this week that there could be 120,000 hospital deaths in a ""reasonable worst-case scenario"" if a virus outbreak coincided with a bad flu season over the winter, though it stressed that was not a prediction.

Johnson said the government was preparing for winter by expanding capacity to test people for the virus, even if they have no symptoms. Currently, some 200,000 tests are performed a day, and Johnson said capacity would hit 500,000 a day by the end of October.

He also said local authorities would be given new powers to impose restrictions in response to localized outbreaks.

Johnson also announced 3 billion pounds ($3.8 billion) to help the country's health service cope with a possible second wave of the virus.

The money will allow the state-funded National Health Service to buy up space in private hospitals and maintain a string of temporary hospitals that were built rapidly around the country as the outbreak accelerated in the spring.

The ""Nightingale hospitals"" ended up treating few patients, but the government wants to keep the spare capacity in case a new wave of COVID-19 cases coincides with the winter flu season.

""It's possible that the virus will be more virulent in the winter months, and it's certain that the NHS will face the usual annual winter pressures,"" Johnson said.

He said the government's strategy was to ""hope for the best but to plan for the worst.""",[]

Vivian, key civil rights leader, has died at 95",'Desiree Seals',2020-07-17,"ATLANTA -- The Rev. C.T. Vivian, an early and key adviser to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. who organized pivotal campaigns in the civil rights movement and spent decades advocating for justice and equality, died Friday at the age of 95.

Vivian began staging sit-ins against segregation in Peoria, Illinois, in the 1940s -- a dozen years before lunch-counter protests by college students made national news. He met King soon after the budding civil rights leader's leadership of the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott, and helped translate ideas into action by organizing the Freedom Rides that eventually forced federal intervention across the South.

Vivian boldly challenged a segregationist sheriff while trying to register Black voters in Selma, Alabama, where hundreds, then thousands, later marched across the Edmund Pettus Bridge.

""You can turn your back now and you can keep your club in your hand, but you cannot beat down justice. And we will register to vote because as citizens of these United States we have the right to do it,"" Vivian declared, wagging his index finger at Sheriff Jim Clark as the cameras rolled. The sheriff then punched him, and news coverage of the assault helped turned a local registration drive into a national phenomenon.

Former diplomat and congressman Andrew Young, another close King confidant, said Vivian was always ""one of the people who had the most insight, wisdom, integrity and dedication.""

President Barack Obama honoured Vivian with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2013, saying that ""time and again, Reverend Vivian was among the first to be in the action: in 1947, joining a sit-in to integrate an Illinois restaurant; one of the first Freedom Riders; in Selma, on the courthouse steps to register blacks to vote, for which he was beaten, bloodied and jailed.""

Obama continued: ""Rosa Parks said of him, `Even after things had supposedly been taken care of and we had our rights, he was still out there, inspiring the next generation, including me,' helping kids go to college with a program that would become Upward Bound."" He praised Vivian, then 89, for being ""still in the action, pushing us closer to our founding ideals.""

The King Center in Atlanta tweeted a tribute: ""Rev. C.T. Vivian. Courageous. Brilliant. Sacrificial. A powerfully well-lived life that lifted humanity. We will miss you."" The Rev. Al Sharpton, who heads the National Action Network, tweeted that Vivian ""made this nation and world a better place.""

""RIP, my friend,"" Sharpton's message ended.

Speaking with students in Tennessee 50 years after the Voting Rights Act was signed into law, Vivian urged them to act strategically as they advocated for justice and equality. The civil rights movement was effective not only because of its nonviolence, but because activists made sure their messages were amplified, he said.

""This is what made the movement: Our voice was really heard. But it didn't happen by accident; we made certain it was heard,"" Vivian said.

Cordy Tindell Vivian was born July 28, 1924, in Howard County, Missouri, but moved to Macomb, Illinois, with his mother as a young boy. He later studied theology alongside future civil rights leader and U.S. Congressman John Lewis at the American Baptist College in Nashville, Tennessee, where they trained waves of activists in nonviolent protest.

King made Vivian his national director of affiliates at the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and sent him around the South to register voters, an effort that brought Vivian to Selma in 1965. Standing on the Dallas County courthouse steps as a line of Black people stretched down the block behind him, he argued for their voting rights until Clark's punch knocked him flat.

Vivian stood back up and kept talking before he was stitched up and jailed, and his mistreatment helped draw thousands of protesters, whose determination to march from Selma to Montgomery pressured Congress to pass the Voting Rights Act later that year.

Vivian continued to serve in the SCLC after King's assassination in 1968, and became its interim president in 2012, lending renewed credibility and a tangible link to the civil rights era after the organization stagnated for years amid financial mismanagement and infighting.

""There must always be the understanding of what Martin had in mind for this organization,"" Vivian said in a 2012 interview. ""Nonviolent, direct action makes us successful. We learned how to solve social problems without violence. We cannot allow the nation or the world to ever forget that.""

Vivian died at home in Atlanta of natural causes Friday morning, his friend and business partner Don Rivers confirmed to The Associated Press.

Vivian had a stroke about two months ago but seemed to recover, Rivers said. Then, ""he just stopped eating,"" he said.

Rivers, 67, said he was 21 when he met Vivian at Shaw University in Raleigh, North Carolina. Back then, he worked as an audio director when Vivian was the dean of the university's divinity school. The two remained close over the years and Rivers said he handled the business side of Vivian's work.

""He's such a nice, gentle, courageous man,"" Rivers said, adding that the reverend wasn't in it for the money. ""He was always giving, giving, giving.""",[]

And she's determined to keep fighting until ""the end,"" she says: until someone is convicted for his death.

But recently, her goal has grown larger. She's now at the forefront of a new movement to wipe out what activists deem to be systemic racism in policing, fight for Black rights and to challenge France's official vision of itself as a colorblind society.

""We became soldiers in spite of ourselves,"" Assa Traore, whose family is of Malian origin, told The Associated Press this week. ""There's a movement today. We call it the Adama generation, these people who are not afraid anymore, and these youth who will not shut up.""

The 35-year-old, who gave up her job as a special education teacher in a small Paris suburb to lead a movement demanding justice for her brother, has renewed purpose since George Floyd died after being restrained by Minneapolis police.

""George Floyd is our brother here in France, too,"" Traore said in an interview ahead of a demonstration Saturday marking the anniversary of Adama's death -- her speech determined, her energy palpable. ""When you see George Floyd's death, you imagine the death of my brother Adama Traore.""

It is not the first time that France has reckoned with its colonial history and relationship with its Black and North African citizens. Deaths involving police often lead to protests, most memorably in the form of nationwide unrest in 2005 sparked by the deaths of two boys who were electrocuted while hiding in an electric substation after fleeing police.

But now France is seeing a growing pushback against police violence, and against racism that many activists say is exacerbated by the country's official doctrine of colorblindness, which encourages immigrants to integrate and bans the government from collecting census data on race.

While four officers involved in Floyd's arrest have been charged -- including one with murder who is behind bars -- no one has been charged in Adama Traore's death. It wasn't filmed, and the cause of death is still the subject of fierce debate.

On July 19, 2016, police approached Adama and his brother for an identity check in the town of Beaumont-sur-Oise north of Paris, where the large family grew up. Adama ran away because he didn't have his ID. Gendarmes caught up with him and arrested him. Within hours he was declared dead.

One gendarme initially said three officers jumped on Traore to pin him down, according to early police reports. The gendarme later denied any of them pinned him down.

The exact cause of death is not even clear. A dozen court-ordered medical reports found various cardiac diseases were responsible. The Traore family countered those with an independent autopsy and medical reports pointing to asphyxiation instead. Lawyers for the officers deny police were at fault.

The family's lawyer Yassine Bouzrou said Friday that since early June, investigators have made 17 new requests for information, including a new medical examination by independent doctors in Belgium. Speaking to broadcaster France-Info, Bouzrou called that a sign that the investigation is being taken more seriously than before Floyd's death thrust it back into the spotlight.

In her quest for justice for her brother, Assa Traore has met with families of those who died at the hands of police, toured struggling French suburbs where most of the population is immigrant or non-white, and organized activists across racial, geographical and economic lines.

In June, as France was reopening from virus lockdown and videos of Floyd's killing circulated around the world, she rallied tens of thousands of protesters to call attention to French racial minorities' own problems with police.

""We have to change everything, this systemic racism, we need to break it,"" Traore said. She called for banning dangerous techniques that police use to immobilize people that ""overwhelmingly kill Black, Arabs and non-whites.""

She also thinks France needs to scrap the police oversight agencies, which are currently composed of police themselves, in favour of independent bodies.

In 2016, France's top official for defending citizens' rights, Jacques Toubon, reported that Black and Arab French people were 20 times more likely to be stopped by police than others were. In 2020, Toubon published a study detailing systemic racism in the Paris police. The government has pledged to root out racism in police forces but blames the problem on a few bad apples.

Traore has built bridges with other social movements -- like the yellow vest one against economic injustice and the climate crisis movement.

""It's been four years of going to every poor neighbourhood in France,"" Traore said. ""We've been in the most remote places in France, in small villages, it's been four years of alliances with domestic workers, undocumented people, yellow vests, climate groups.""

This Saturday's march was organized with climate activists under the slogan: ""We want to breathe.""

""Today the fight for Adama Traore does not belong to the Traore family anymore,"" Traore said. ""It's representative of a big unease and dysfunction of the French state, so it's a struggle we take on together.""",[]

The heavy rains are putting renewed pressure on the massive Three Gorges Dam that straddles the river upstream of the city of Wuhan in Hubei province.

The official Xinhua News Agency said the rate of flow in the reservoir behind the dam would hit a record for the year on Friday night, at 55,000 square meters (almost 600,000 square feet) per second.

Rivers in the Yangtze system have broken their banks in places, and in Hubei, a helicopter was used to drop stones into the breach to block the inrushing waters.

Crews were dispatched with poles to probe waterlogged embankments for weakness and thousands of sandbags were being filled in preparation for more breaches that would need to be swiftly closed.

Water rose to the level of first-floor windows in exposed ancient towns and crops were completely inundated around vast Poyang Lake, a network of waterways that empty into the Yangtze below Wuhan.

On the lake's eastern edge in Jiangxi province, 45-year-old Xu Yongxiang said his village of Liufang had been without running water or electricity for almost a week. Although it was time for the rice harvest, that crop, along with cotton, corn and beans was now underwater.

""We do not have one inch of dry ground. It has all been flooded,"" Xu, who sells pork for a living, was quoted as saying on the official newspaper China Youth Daily's microblog.

Flooding since the beginning of the month has forced evacuations of around 1.8 million people in 24 provinces, mainly in southern China. Direct losses attributed to flooding are estimated at more than 49 billion yuan (US$7 billion), according to the Ministry of Emergency Management.

Floodwaters reached as high as 1.4 metres (almost 5 feet) in Linshui county in the southwestern province of Sichuan, the ministry's rescue department reported.

Torrential rain also caused three landslides Thursday in a town in mountainous Chongqing, upstream on the Yangtze, causing three deaths and leaving three more missing, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.

Seasonal flooding strikes large parts of China each year, especially in its central and southern regions, but conditions this year have been especially bad. Major cities have thus far been spared but concerns have risen over Wuhan and other downstream metropolises that are home to tens of millions of people.

China's worst floods in recent years were in 1998, when more than 2,000 people died and almost 3 million homes were destroyed, mostly along the Yangtze.

The Three Gorges Dam was built mainly to generate electricity, but the government also said it was expected to mitigate catastrophic flooding.",[]

Another day of storm potential,'Kevin Stanfield',2020-07-17,"CALGARY -- Calgary is once again in the developmental periphery for stormy weather.

Unstable activity will glide off the foothills this afternoon but likely won’t reach its maxima for potential energy until it’s beyond the city. That notwithstanding, severe storm watches are again possible for Calgary this afternoon.

The storm bands could potentially offer ping pong ball-sized hail at their peak, but conditions are expected to work against the likelihood of hail that size; yesterday’s wave of storms through Edmonton and down toward Red Deer were guided along by a cold front whereas today’s activity is guided by a westerly upper air pattern, which is far from the same degree of organization that yesterday saw. Generally that translates to ""less teeth"" in our storm outlook, though our isolated severe storms could still yield a measure of damaging hail, driving rain, and strong wind.

Funnel clouds could be a factor this afternoon and evening through central and northern Alberta. These are capable of producing landspout tornadoes, which are the weakest type of tornado but still demand respect for their ability to topple trees and fling debris. Speaking of, yesterday offered two tornado watches; one through the Leduc – Wetaskiwin – Camrose area around the dinner hour, and the other through Red Deer – Ponoka – Stettler just past 7 pm. I’ve seen no confirmed reports of a tornado as of yet.

The exact same formula for severe activity (golf ball-sized hail, tornado potential) that was patterned over central Alberta yesterday has repositioned through southern Manitoba today.

Here’s our forecast:

Today:

Partly cloudy, late-day showers and thundershowers possible

Daytime high: 21°

Evening: overnight showers, then clearing, low 10°

Tomorrow:

Partly cloudy, late-day thundershower potential

Daytime high: 21°

Evening: some cloud, low 11°

Sunday:

Partly cloudy, late-day thundershower potential

Daytime high: 22°

Evening: mainly clear, low 12°

Monday:

Mainly sunny

Daytime high: 22°

Evening: some cloud, low 13°

Tuesday:

Partly cloudy, late-day thundershower potential

Daytime high: 26°

Evening: some cloud, low 13°

As a quick recap to yesterday’s storm band, the cold front responsible for those storms didn’t swing far enough south to affect us, which is why we’re leading by thanking Marion in Vulcan and Karen from north of Hanna for these shots of yesterday’s storms!

""We've been doing everything we can locally, signage and patrols to encourage people to abide by provincial rules, but that’s just not happening,"" said Mayor Marshall Chalmers.

Chalmers met with Alberta Health and other government officials Wednesday, asking for better direction on acceptable crowd sizes and jurisdiction in enforcing spacing and limiting crowding.

With warmer temperatures and sunny weather Thursday, Anniversary Park was crowded with a few hundred people. While many appeared to try to keep distance, the sheer numbers made effective distancing impossible.

CTV News saw just two people wearing masks.

""I think it’s too many people, too close to each other. This is why I’m staying really far away from them,"" says Isabel Lara, who sat about 50 m away from the throng of beach goers.

""I don’t want to go that close. I don’t think it’s safe.""

The city of Chestermere’s website says the provincial guidelines limit beach crowds to 100 people, but the province’s COVID-19 page does not specify beaches.

Alberta's chief medical officer of health said Thursday that's expected to change in the coming days.

""We have met this week with Alberta Beach, with Chestermere and with Sylvan Lake who have all expressed concerns over significant crowds on beaches over the last week or two,"" said Dr. Deena Hinshaw. ""I want to say I sympathize with Albertans who want to spend our limited, lovely summer days at a beach but what we hear very clearly from all of those towns is that they need additional guidance.""

Hinshaw said the province is preparing a document that will give more specific details about what's expected from beach-goers.

""We talked about strategies and helping people plan in advance and come up with back-up plans. If they pack up the car, go to the beach and the beach is already crowded, what are the options that families can think about.""

Hinshaw says the province will be working together with municipalities on this and any other situation that may arise.

Earlier this week, Alberta Environment and Parks tweeted encouraging would-be beachgoers to move on to another location when they encounter crowds.",[]

Calaway Park is back up and running with a different look for its 2020 campaign that will see smaller crowds compared to years past and staggered entry for guests throughout the day.

The park, situated west of Calgary city limits, will reopen to season pass holders Friday and the general public the following day. All guests will be required to reserve an entry ahead of time and purchase all tickets online.

""We’ve been given ordinance to go ahead at this time, but with significant restrictions and we really want our guests to know that,"" said Calaway Park’s general manager, Bob Williams.

Williams adds that the park will be open to about one-third of its normal capacity of guests. Not every major attraction at the park will be open either as several rides are temporarily closed until at least Stage 3 of Alberta’s economic relaunch.

The Vortex, Chaos, Ocean Motion, Adrenaline Test Zone, Free Fallin’, and Wave Rider attractions will remain closed to guests.

""These rides are rides where somebody might be screaming or yelling out of joy and the droplets gets spread,"" Williams explained.

All rides will be wiped down by staff between each use. Staff members will also be screened with temperatures checks before entering the park and required to wear masks.

Guests are not required to wear a mask on the park grounds, but they will be mandated on some rides and encouraged in higher traffic areas including lineups.

The majority of food kiosks and retails stores will reopen with social distancing measures including limits on the number of customers allowed at a time. The park’s lone sit-down restaurant will remain closed.

Calaway Park is open daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. with plans to extend its hours to 7 p.m. once the province enters Stage 3.

Five cases of COVID-19 have been linked by Alberta Health Services to the Cactus Club in downtown Calgary — two staff members and three patrons — and two cases of the virus have been linked to RIDE CYCLE CLUB, including employees of other fitness centres. Several businesses made the decision to temporarily close as a result and urged recent guests to consider getting tested.

“While AHS has not mandated it, we have decided to voluntarily close this location out of an abundance of caution to ensure the health of everyone,” Cactus Club spokesperson said in a statement.

It added the restaurant would undergo a deep clean of the restaurant and would likely reopen early next week.

Anyone who visited the Cactus Club restaurant on Stephen Avenue between July 2 and 10 is asked to monitor symptoms and contact health authorities if needed.

YYC Cycle is asking anyone who visited its studios since July 2 to do the same.

“We got word of a potential outbreak of a soon-to-be-open studio in Calgary and once that happened, we understood that there may have been a couple of staff members of ours that attended those private classes,” said Andrew Obrecht, co-owner of YYC Cycle.

“After that we did find out two staff members did test positive for COVID.”

He said the businesses has chosen to close its doors until the weekend and has been busy contacting recent guests.

“We have heard from AHS that because of the protocols and procedures in our studios, those riders that would be in the classes that those staff were in would not have been considered high risk, but of course we can’t take any chances.”

Other fitness centres that have also chosen to close temporarily because of possible exposure of their staff include Rhythym Ride and Kult Fitness.

The latest clusters come as Alberta has seen the number of new cases in the province above 80 each of the past few days.

An infectious disease specialist said many have been wary of a ""second wave"" but in science numbers don’t always clearly indicate that.

“I’m not sure we’re ever going to see these classic waves where we have a level of infection that drops down to a level of zero and then another big uptick,” said Craig Jenne from the Cumming School of Medicine.

“Unfortunately it’s still in our community so we are going to continue to see outbreaks. The key right now is to keep them small.”

He said the difference about the daily number of cases now as opposed to in March is that positive measures such as masks, social distancing and testing are now in place.",[]

The HAWCS helicopter happened to be in the same area and was able to track a vehicle seen leaving the scene.

The 15-year-old cannot be named under the Youth Criminal Justice Act.

Police have identified the victim as Christian Navos, 32, of Edmonton.

""We believe this murder was targeted and was connected to a drug-related dispute,"" said Staff Sgt. Martin Schiavetta, adding police ""are strongly looking at the homicide in Legacy being connected to another homicide that occured in our city.""

He would not elaborate on which homicide police believe it is connected to but said it happened this year.

""We have a fantastic firearms lab right wthin our service that allows us to examine seized firearms, casing, other ballistic information and make those comparisons and linkages and that's helping us hold these people accountable."" he said.

""If you look at the 19 homicides that have occured this year, we have laid charges in 16, which I think is an 84 per cent clearance rate, which is extremely high for any metropolitan city in Canada, and we're very proud of that.""

The fact the shooting happened in the afternoon on a residential street and near a playground makes it ""extremly concerning for police,"" he added.

""Obviously we know that stray rounds don't discriminate,"" said Schiavetta. ""Anyone could have been hurt seriously, if not fatally in that community. There's houses, there's children, we're extremely concerned by the level of public violence.""

Neither the accused or the victim have ties to the community, said Schiavetta, and police believe they had agreed to meet there.

Officials say a financial audit of ARCHES (AIDS Reduction Community Harm Education & Support Society) was launched by Deloitte after possible irregularities were found in the organization.

The investigation concluded that a number of the allegations of mismanagement at the agency were substantiated, including:

Asset and funding misappropriation

Non-compliance with grant agreement

Inappropriate governance and organizational operations

Deloitte's report found a number of serious issues including $13,000 in interest from ARCHES bank accounts being used for parties, staff retreats, entertainment and gift cards, the annual salary of one senior executive exceeding $300,000 when it should have been capped at $80,000 and more than $1.6 million that is unaccounted for due to missing expense reports from 2017 to 2018.

""It is disturbing and extremely disappointing to me that taxpayer funds allocated to this organization in order to serve the most vulnerable in Lethbridge would be used for European conferences, expenses for retreats, entertainment and gift cards. Our government will not stand idly by while millions in taxpayer funds are missing or misappropriated,"" said Jason Luan, associate minister of mental health and addictions in a release.

The audit also found:

More than $4,000 was used to fund a trip for senior management to attend a conference in Portugal

More than $7,500 spent on management retreats including meals and mileage

Thousands in unverifiable travel expenses, including trips charged to company credit cards that were not recorded

Thousands of dollars' worth of gift cards to multiple businesses, including to a company owned by a senior executive's spouse

Other conflict of interest issues such as where a senior executive's family member was hired and earned a salary of $9,900

The number of staff members at ARCHES exceeded the 126 allowed as per the agreement; the actual number of employees could not be verified

""Proper personal conflict of interest declarations were not recorded when related individuals or vendors were hired or utilized,"" the province says. ""Vendors were repeatedly secured in secrecy with a lack of transparency and accountability. No petty cash reconciliations have been completed.""

Even with all the allegations that were proven against ARCHES, the government says the audit could not be fully completed due to the state of the agency's record-keeping.

It adds law enforcement has been notified about the situation.

""Due to missing funds and unverifiable transactions, as well as allegations, which could not be investigated in the scope of this audit, government will consult with law enforcement to determine whether further investigation is warranted.""

Even though ARCHES' site has been closed as a result, the government says a temporary overdose prevention site has been set up to help those with addictions.

Lethbridge officials say the closure of the supervised consumption site will leave a hole in the support for residents.

""(It's) disappointing to hear that money may have been spent inappropriately,"" said Lethbridge mayor Chris Spearman. ""There needs to be some form of support.""

ARCHES RESERVES COMMENT

In a press release issued Thursday, ARCHES says the audit was launched on March 4, 2020 and its staff and board of directors have cooperated fully with the government and independent auditor.

The board also began its own organizational review in May that has already resulted in changes at the facility.

When it comes to the forensic audit, the organization says it understands why there are concerns and adds it has concerns of its own.

However, it has decided not to comment further at this time.

""We woke up to this news just like the rest of our community and at this time the full report findings have not been given to the ARCHES’ Board of Directors. Please understand we are waiting to comment until we have all of the information.""

ARCHES expects to hold a press conference on the audit ""soon"" and will notify the media when it plans to do so.

Over the past two years, ARCHES has received more than $14.4 million in government funding.",[]

Mature trees are abundant, but so are infill homes.

Developers are taking down the older, smaller structures and replacing them with larger multi-storey ones.

""So the lot behind us was sold,” said Lennox. “There were a lot of mature trees on the lot and with the new developer, they have taken the trees down for the new house.”

The trees were decades old and planted metres apart along the perimeter of the backyard fence. A few were also planted in the front yard. Neighbours say they were teeming with wildlife.

""Many species of birds, squirrels, chipmunks and there was constant sound from those trees,"" said Lennox. ""You knew that they were full of animals.""

According to city bylaws, trees on public land can’t be touched by developers. But trees on private land are the responsibility of the owner and can be removed at their discretion.

The bylaws require the owner of new homes in new or existing neighbourhoods to plant and maintain two or three trees depending on lot size.

Lennox says the policy surrounding old growth trees and preservation of the urban canopy needs to be reviewed by the city.

""I think from the city of Calgary it would be great if we had more bylaws in place to preserve mature trees,"" said Lennox. ""And certainly more action in a quicker time frame.""

Byron Henry has lived in Westmount for 15 years. His family is in one of the newer infills. Henry says he made the tough decision to remove two mature trees from his small back yard because there wasn’t room to do anything.

""We had a young daughter and we wanted her to be able to play in the back yard,"" said Henry. ""We wanted to sit out there and barbecue, with the two big trees we couldn’t do that, there was always squirrels, acorns, and nothing could grow underneath them.""

Henry hired an arborist to remove the massive trees and learned that the 25 spruce trees two houses down could prove dangerous.

""The guy that took ours down he said those trees there, they don't have a very deep root system and none of them really looked healthy,"" said Henry. ""He said it's quite dangerous actually if you get a big storm a lot of them can just come down.""

Henry says he'll miss the trees but says there are benefits.

""It's a shame to see them go but there’s pluses as well cause now we’re going to get sun coming from the west that we didn’t get before because they were quite tall, past about three in the afternoon we were in the shadows for the rest of the day.""",[]

According to Calgary Police Service officials, Smith was murdered at a home in southeast Calgary.

He was last seen alive in the community of McKenzie Towne on June 6 and was reported missing the following day.

Smith's abandoned vehicle was located the following week along Deerfoot Trail, near the bridge atop the Bow River in the city's deep south. It's believed the vehicle was left there sometime between June 6 and June 9.

While Smith's body has not been found, 24-year-old Ian Abercrombie has been charged with second-degree murder and indignity to a body in connection with the disappearance.

Searches conducted in rural areas around Calgary have been fruitless.

On Thursday, Smith's mother and sister were brought to tears as they asked for help from the public.

""We are here to beg you, plead with you, please, please let us lay our son to rest,"" said Shirley Smith, Shane's mother. ""Shane deserved his life. He does not deserve to be out there all alone. Give him the dignity and the respect he deserves.

""My family and all of Shane's amazing friends need to say goodbye, as hard as that will be.""

Two vehicles, a burgundy Mercedes-Benz ML55 with aftermarket chrome rims and a 2010 Crown Victoria with black aftermarket rims, have been connected with Smith's death. The Mercedes had a license plate of SLPRSLD while the Crown Victoria's plate read CFM4615.

As urban legend goes, it's believed that in the spring of 2019, Turk was brought to the Calgary Stampede grounds and given to a rancher as a gift. Turk escaped the horse trailer he was in and took up residency in Ramsay. The community adopted the bird as its unofficial mascot and a Facebook group was created with over 6,300 members.

But now Turk has moved north across the Bow River and has been frequenting the courtyard at a seniors independent living facility called Willow Park on the Bow.

""I got interested in Turk the turkey, I’d heard about him, he has Facebook, he’s very famous,"" said resident Marianne Jaromi. ""And one morning instead of a rooster crow, I heard a turkey gobble.""

Jaromi says the majority of residents have embraced their new neighbour, especially when many have been challenged with isolation during the pandemic.

""It (Turk) changes my day from being negative to being very positive,"" said resident Laura Pearce. ""I put it (Turk) on Facebook and everybody in the world has seen it, it’s great entertainment.""

Turk likes to spend time in the courtyard during the day and stays close to the double glass doors where he can see his reflection. Residents believe the bird might be lonely or even looking for a mate.

""I think he thinks that’s a playmate in there and he starts pecking at the window,"" said Vicky Jones, who’s lived there for seven years. ""Pretty soon, he backs up and plumes out at the window and so I told him, 'You know Turk, if you think that’s that’s going to be a girlfriend it’s not, it’s you.'""

Eleven-year resident Frieda Hughes said the bird delights everyone at the building.

""Oh, he’s nice, he’s very tame and he likes people and we like him but he’s very messy.""

Facility management regularly wash down areas after Turk has been there to make sure no one slips on his large droppings.

""We like to have him here but we’re just worried that he’s going to get inside then the feathers will fly,"" said Jaromi. ""Because then we won’t be able to get him out but again we’re worried about the mess, he’s a nice good visitor but it’s time to go.""

Jaromi would like to see Turk go to a good home in the country but, for now, residents are enjoying his company while it lasts.

Many Canadian designers are putting their own spin on face coverings, creating masks that are both fashion forward and functional.

Some of the creations have even come from local designers like Paul Hardy. He says he opted for bold colours and patterns with his unique line of personal protective equipment (PPE).

""It's a lot of vibrant prints and I think, right now, people right now are eager to wear colour because the times are sort of depressing,"" Hardy told CTV News.

The masks are made from traditional, printed Kitenge cloth from Africa. Hardy's designs also have a charitable component. With each mask purchased, one will be donated to someone in Rwanda and the proceeds from sales will also go towards Hopethiopia/Rwanda.

""It’s been nice to create something that serves a purpose but also has a fashionable aspect to it. I felt a lot better about being able to sell a utilitarian product in the midst of a crisis in a way that benefited other people.""

House of Nonie designer Nina Kharey started out making masks for hospitals by retooling her factory and using leftover fabric. She adds the opportunity allowed her to keep her employees on the payroll.

""I needed some of my girls still working and the factory doors to stay open, so I decided I’ll join in on the fight against COVID-19 and start making masks,"" said Kharey.

She’s tweaked the design to now include three different sizes, prioritizing quality and the regular Nonie client’s 'simple' style.

""I really wanted to make sure they actually did their job and protected people. We got our hands on spunbond material that is actually used in operating rooms. When I was designing these masks I wanted them to be lightweight, comfortable and also make the wearer feel good wearing them.""",[]

The study will monitor cyclists' heart rate and stress levels while they bike to work. To become a 'citizen scientist', cyclists must use either a Garmin or Fitbit device, and sign up to allow researchers to collect data from the devices.

The study plans to add other devices in the future.

Researchers hope that information gathered will help them understand the layout and connectivity of Calgary's streets — information that will help urban planners and developers.

Jenna Dutton, a research coordinator of urban policy at the university, is passionate about bike safety after she was hit by a car while cycling in a bike lane in 2018.

""Instead of planning areas to accommodate vehicles and haphazardly retrofitting cycling infrastructure, there needs to be equal consideration for cycling as a mode of transportation within a broader interconnected network,"" said Dutton.

The integration of wearable technology into academic research has allowed researchers and citizens to collaborate in innovative ways.

""Wearable technology has become part of our daily lives with nearly all of us wearing technology on our wrists, and using a smartphone or other devices to track our activities,"" said Dr. Reed Ferber, primary investigator for the We-TRAC program.

Future studies within the program are set to include data collection on green spaces in the city to help promote physical activity.

The joint statement that indicated the colony was under quarantine has been removed and replaced with a version that does not specifically mention the colony**

In an effort to reduce the potential spread of the novel coronavirus, the Willow Creek Hutterite Colony has gone into quarantine.

The move was announced in a joint statement released Wednesday by the Town of Claresholm, the Municipal District of Willow Creek and Livingstone-Macleod MLA Roger Reid.

""(Alberta Health Services) is aware of the situation, and has been taking steps to ensure that those within the Hutterite Colonies and the Town of Claresholm are protected,"" said Reid in the statement. ""I will continue to work with the Minister of Health and the Town of Claresholm to ensure we have adequate access to testing and PPE in our area.

""We must work together to ensure All members of our community are kept safe and positioned for a quick recovery. Discrimination to anyone is unacceptable, and will not be tolerated.""

According to the municipal and provincial representatives, there have been reported incidents of discrimination against colony members by businesses and residents of Claresholm.

""I would like to offer the local colonies our best wishes for a speedy and safe conclusion to the COVID threat they are facing at this time,"" said Mayor Doug MacPherson. ""And for the residents of Claresholm I would like to put your concerns to rest. AHS has stepped in to help the affected colonies to address their outbreak through testing and quarantine. There are measures and safeguards put into place to protect Claresholm residents.

""These are unprecedented times, but we must all remember that everyone is doing their best, so please stay calm and take care to protect yourself and others.""

As of Thursday morning, CTV News has not confirmed the number of cases tied to the colony.

But on Tuesday, Alberta’s chief medical officer Dr. Deena Hinshaw said Alberta Health was looking into any links between outbreaks on Hutterite colonies across the prairies.

""We have been working with the Safety Council and with Saskatchewan, just like any other part of our community, the Hutterite community is not spared from exposure or transmission. And so some of our new cases have been linked to Saskatchewan,"" she said.

Hinshaw also said no one – or group – is immune to the virus.

""I'll repeat my earlier assertion that it is critical that we not single out any one particular segment of society but rather understand that we all need to be working together to follow the public health guidance to stop transmission.""",[]

The first of its kind in the city, Tim Hortons set up a mobile drive-thru trailer that was big enough for a city bus to drive up to.

Tim Hortons owner and operator Gordon Sinclair said it was a way of saying ""thank you"" for the essential work that transit has done during this pandemic.

""We wanted to do this approach because we thought, you know, they're on the bus and they'd like to come through the drive-thru. It's something different. Something exciting. Shows them how much we really appreciate them by going to this extent,"" said Sinclair.

The trailer was set up at the Larch Street yard giving drivers a chance to grab a free beverage and treat before heading out to start their day.

""It's important to let them know that they're appreciated and the sacrifices they're making to come out every day and transporting us around,"" said Sinclair. ""Just to acknowledge that we appreciate everything that's going on within the community and their part in it.""

Over 100 employees benefited from the gesture Thursday morning between drivers, fleet staff and administration.

GOVA'S Manager of operations, Bruno Lafortune, said: ""Tim Hortons, they're such a big part of our community, and for them to come to Sudbury transit and recognize transit operations and transit operators on the job that they do as essential and bringing people to their workplace or essential places, is pretty amazing.""

The drive-thru was available between 7 a.m. and 10 a.m. with two different options to get an order. Drivers could drive directly up to the window and experience the convenience of a drive-thru or employees could walk up and place an order on foot.

""Since the beginning of March, Tim Hortons owners and head office have been fuelling and feeding essential workers across the country,"" said Sinclair. ""We wanted to come [Thursday] and show our appreciation to Sudbury transit for getting our essential workers and the residents around Sudbury during this time of COVID-19.""

The transit manager is proud of the work the bus drivers have done throughout these uncertain times.

""When you look around and you look at Sudbury transit, I think the operators have done a great job. The pandemic has been unknown for a lot of people, scary for a lot of people, and you know what, the operators have shown up every day, come to work, protected themselves, kept bringing people to work - to essential places.

Christina Emond has been capturing nature and wildlife in northeastern Ontario for more than four years as a hobby.

This week, she set up her Canon Rebel T7 camera with an 18 mm lens and a tripod on Murray Lake in Hagar, a small rural community east of Sudbury, and took a time-lapse video of the northern lights and Comet NEOWISE.

Using a slow shutter speed over two hours, she was able to capture the two celestial events in a 24-second time-lapse video.

Comet NEOWISE, C/2020 F2, is named after the NASA mission that discovered it, Near-Earth Object Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer. It has caught the attention of stargazers around the world and is visible to the naked eye from dusk to dawn in the northern hemisphere. NASA says the comet will not be seen again for another 6,800 years.

Emond said the comet can be seen from about 10:45 p.m. to about 4 a.m. starting in the northwestern part of the sky as it moves east.

Her time-lapse also captured the aurora borealis, known as northern lights. In northeastern Ontario, the phenomenon is seen more as movement in the sky without the colour, however, the camera was able to pick up the various colours.

Northern Lights Centre describes the phenomenon as ""bright dancing lights of the aurora are actually collisions between electrically charged particles from the sun that enter the earth's atmosphere.""

On her way to the lake Monday night, Emond came across a curious moose calf that was walking along the dark rural road. She said she could hear the mother in the bush.

Watch the video of the adorable moose calf as it saunters around a dark, rural northern road. When Christina, a former hunter, makes a moose call, it catches the young animals attention.

In an interesting coincidence, the night she took the picture of a lifetime, it was her late husband's birthday.

""I know he was there helping me on this one,"" said Emond.

The amateur photographer said she has really grown connected to nature through her experiences and has gotten rid of her hunting firearm. Some of her photography is even being featured at a furniture store in Markstay.

Her favourite encounter is with a wolf she came across that caught her attention during one of her daily photoshoots. She said she saw the animal out of the corner of her eye as it was eating snow on a beautiful winter day. They observed each other calmly at a distance and she was able to capture several spontaneous images.

She said she is very careful around wildlife and if she notices any signs of aggression, she leaves them alone and gets away quickly and calmly.

Another memorable experience was she recalls is when she encountered a lynx on a local rural road and was able to walk behind it for a short period of time. For wildlife and nature images she uses a Sigma 150mm lens and tries to get out in nature every day.

The self-taught photographer said she takes 200–800 photos in a sitting and has learned a lot from local photographers Allison Currie Beaulieu, Ray Thoms, and Gerry Gooderham.

Emond said she brings her camera everywhere with her and is always ready to capture the moment in front of her.",[]

Nakina Sankar Gravier, who is originally from Winnipeg but now lives in Coral Springs, Fla., about 76 kilometres north of Miami, said she’s noticed most people are following the physical distancing guidelines and wearing masks, but the guidance they’re receiving from the government has been sub-par.

“I am growing restless,” she told CTV News Channel on Wednesday. “I have a six-year-old son at home that is also growing incredibly restless. It is not easy to manoeuvre through such a global pandemic. I am frustrated at the lack of direction from leadership as well as no end in sight in dealing with this.”

Florida set a new single-day high for COVID-19 deaths on Thursday with 156 and added another 13,965 cases of the virus. In total, there have been more than 3,5 million cases of COVID-19 in the U.S., including more than 137,000 deaths, according to a tally from Johns Hopkins University.

This week, U.S. President Donald Trump has been pressuring schools to reopen for the upcoming school year, despite the surge in coronavirus cases across the country. He has even gone so far as to suggest he would defund the schools that do not open on time.

“I am deeply concerned,” said Gravier. “As a mother, my number one priority is to keep (my son) safe. With the ever-growing numbers of positive cases, there’s no way I’m sending my son back to school in August.”

Gravier said she’s been keeping tabs on how Canada has been handling the virus, where new daily cases hover around 300 and provinces are slowly reopening businesses.

“I have many friends and a lot of family that are still all over Canada, primarily in Winnipeg, where the numbers have gone down tremendously, and they’re returning back to every-day life,” she said.

""Presenting a masterpiece as special as Colville's 'Dog and Bridge' was a highlight for Heffel, and we're thrilled that our excitement was matched by our bidders,"" said David Heffel, president of Heffel Fine Art Auction House, which held the sale.

Other works saw strong bidding.

Abstract Expressionist painter Joan Mitchell's oil on canvas triptych, ""Untitled,"" sold for nearly $1.2 million, well above its estimated price of about $500,000.

Quebec artist Jean Paul Riopelle's commanding, large-scale ""Le reveil"" sold for about $1.2 million.

Yvonne McKague Housser's ""Town of Cobalt"" sold for more than $200,000, four times its estimate.

Five works by Lawren Harris were also sold, two for well above their estimates. His ""North East Corner of Lake Superior (Lake Superior Sketch XXXVIII)"" fetched $481,250 and the abstraction ""LSH 89A"" went for $277,250.

Another Harris sketch on offer had been stowed away among a late Canadian-born painter's possessions for decades, but was uncovered by relatives earlier this year. The work, which was valued between $125,000 and $175,000, went unsold.

Heffel presented 112 lots at the livestreamed auction at Toronto's Design Exchange. Bidders placed offers online, by phone or before the sale.

The auction raked in a total of $15.3 million. All amounts include auction house fees on top of the hammer price.

Executive director Jennifer Clement said the clinic will be for those who don't have health insurance or transportation. With the office now located right downtown it will be more accessible for people who need the service.

""When we got the funding for opening our Larch Street office here, we were lucky enough to receive a donation of dental equipment from Centre de Santé, who had a dental room at the corner clinic,"" said Clement.

""The intention was also that when we moved over here, we would have a dental room, as well, and the room is being used by dental students who will offer assessments and screenings to those who don't have access to dental services.""

On top of providing free oral health care to those in need, it will also help dental hygiene and dental assistant students from Cambrian College. The idea is that students will work in the clinic as part of their curriculum.

""One of the things we try to do with all of our programs -- but especially those helping professions like dental hygiene and dental assisting -- is we don't just want them to be good professionals, we want them to be good citizens,"" said Dan Lessard, manager of communications at Cambrian College.

Good citizens

""A big part of that is actually working in those settings, helping out while also getting an education. You know that you're doing good in the community, so the students benefit both ways. And I think they're really excited to be part of something new.""

This week, the clinic received more than $18,000 from Cambrian College's annual Walk for a Smile fundraiser. Lessard said despite the COVID-19 pandemic, that's about the average amount the fundraiser brings in each year.

""It's always a great feeling when you can help the community, especially when it's something new,"" said Lessard.

Officials say it is going to be a team effort to get the clinic open, with help from the health unit and the dental community in the area. However, the clinic is ready to take on the next challenge, Clement said.

""We're the first nurse practitioners clinic … to be able to do this in the province, which is great,"" she said. ""We're working with the health unit to develop a dental strategy so we can look at what is this going to look like over the long term.""

Lessard said it's an amazing feeling to be part of the opening the clinic, and it's a fantastic opportunity for students.

""They're the first ones who are going to experience this kind of setting,"" he said. ""They're normally used to going to a dental office or a dental clinic. A nurse practitioner's office is something completely different. So for them, it's just going to give them that broad range of experience that's only going to make them more skillful and marketable when they go out in the field.""

Important part of overall health

The clinic will offer dental cleaning with the students from Cambrian, and hopefully X-rays and other procedures later on.

""Dental care is a very important part of overall health care and there's some people in the community who, through circumstances, it's a little harder for them to maintain good dental care,"" said Lessard.

"" So what we've done as a program, dental assisting and dental hygienists, is raise money for community initiatives so that people don't have costs as a barrier for getting good dental care.""

An opening date for the dental room is still to be determined, but Clement said it is a priority at the clinic.

""If people don't have health benefits, they can be reluctant to get dental care, and oral health is really important to your overall health and well-being in total,"" said Clement. ""So by doing this, by bringing in students and looking at if we're going to use money to offer per diems for dentists to come in - we're not quite sure yet, but it's something we think is really important to the community.""",[]

Alex McPhee is a landlord in Sudbury. He says one particular pair of tenants have not paid rent since October 2019.

""The most stressful part is we're paying for them to live,"" said McPhee. ""I could understand if this happened during COVID, and they lost their jobs. I would be more than willing to say let's work something out, let's decrease the rent. I would have more of an understanding for it. But this is pre-COVID.""

The province has had a moratorium on eviction notices in place for the last few months. It is expected to expire at the end of July.

While his problem pre-dates the pandemic, stalling from his tenants and delayed hearings by the Landlord and Tenant Board (LTB) pushed his hearing back until the end of March. By that time, the pandemic cancelled the hearing and it has been status quo ever since.

Too many tenants refuse to pay

""This has been stressful, stressful on my wife, stressful on myself,"" said McPhee. ""We feel stuck because we cannot even sell the unit because nobody is going to purchase it. We thought about let's just sell it and take a hit, whatever sort of hit.""

Ray Goulet, president of the Greater Sudbury Landlord Association, said McPhee is far from alone in his troubles.

""Too many tenants in town are deliberately doing this because they know they can get away with it,"" said Goulet. ""Landlords get desperate. They don’t know what to do. Their hands are tied and they are supporting these tenants who just don't want to pay.""

Goulet said that he is anxiously anticipating the passing of Bill 184, which would allow landlords to offer tenants behind on rent their own repayment plan, without involvement from the Landlord and Tenant Board.

""It's going to affect [landlords] in a positive way in that we will get evictions for those in arrears and we won't … be losing any more money,"" said Goulet. ""It will be a quick eviction.""

While landlords are happy about the changes, advocates for tenants worry it puts too much power in the hands of landlords.

Payment plans could be unfair

""When you look at the bill in combination with the affordable housing crisis and the pandemic, you really start seeing things that result in grave concerns for tenants,"" said Daina Majid, a staff lawyer for the Advocacy Centre for Tenants Ontario.

Majid, who said her centre has been seeing an increase in calls from concerned tenants throughout the pandemic, said she's concerned many of these payment plans she expects to be offered through Bill 184 will be deliberately unfair.

""Many tenants are fearful (it) will be a fast track for evictions because the repayment plans that happen outside the LTB do not come with the supports that you would normally find at the board, such as access to tenant duty counsel and a mediator that will explain the terms in the agreement and the consequences of those terms,"" said Majid.

Monique Woolnough, executive director of the Sudbury Legal Clinic, said she's hoping the moratorium on evictions is extended until either a vaccine is found, or the pandemic is more under control.

""A lot of tenants are scared of eviction,"" said Woolnough. ""They may agree to payment plans they actually can't afford and then if they breach those payment plans, the landlord can apply by paper -- without that tenant ever having had a chance to tell their side of the story -- to evict them. So we're very concerned about what's coming next.""

Woolnough, who said there have been a few illegal evictions in Sudbury since March, said there is often an inherent power discrepancy between landlords and tenants. She warns tenants to be careful of signing any documents.

""We would not recommend that people sign repayment agreements with their landlords,"" said Woolnough. ""That doesn’t mean you can't actually repay your landlord -- there's nothing stopping you from doing that -- but those agreements put you at risk of being evicted without the chance to explain.""

Representing all landlords under his association, Goulet said he expects the bill to help landlords in northeastern Ontario deal with problematic tenants in particular, such as the situation McPhee is facing.

Background checks are key

""We've got some cases in town where a tenant hasn't paid -- deliberately hasn't paid -- for 15 months,"" said Goulet. ""Their garbage is out in the back ... They can't even put their garbage out on the street for the city to pick up, that's how bad it is with this tenant. We have other tenants who are trashing another house. This landlord's going to lose his house if he's not careful, he's had to dip into his retirement funds.""

Goulet said he recommends all landlords do a thorough background check prior to having anything signed.

""What we're saying to tenants is be very careful,"" he said. ""Pay your rent. That's very important because if you don't, there's a policy now in place -- automatic eviction and it's going to catch up to you.

""Before you know it, with the landlord organization the way they talk amongst themselves, you're going to have a lot of difficulty in trying to find an apartment.""

With a solution still not in sight for his predicament, McPhee hopes other landlords to learn from his mistakes, and ensure a thorough background check of all applicants is done.

""If we can't find somebody that we're 100 per cent sure about, we're just not going to rent the place,"" he said. ""It's just not worth it because once you get somebody in there, the process to get somebody out is just way too long. You're looking at six months.""",[]

Restaurant owner Paul Chaput was working at the time of the theft and said a customer stole the box while waiting for his meal.

""When I realized it was gone, I first thought it was put somewhere else,"" said Chaput. ""Then I realized, I said 'It's not just disappeared.' … I served the young gentleman that took the box.""

There was more than $200 in the box and it was meant to go to Outloud North Bay, a local LGBTQ+ hub space for children and families, to help with the cost of upkeep.

It costs about $1,500 a month to run the space.

""I was upset,"" said owner Seth Compton. ""The staff here and the owner here have done good things for Outloud North Bay.""

The restaurant said it has been extremely difficult to get donations for Outloud North Bay because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

""It's been really tough to raise money,"" said restaurant manager Lucie St. John. ""Seth has been putting his own money into it.""

After hearing about the theft, several local businesses and customers left generous donations, which total more than $1,000.

""It's been one person after another bringing money and donations,"" said St. John. ""My heart is full of gratitude.""

A giving city

Compton arrived to pick up some of the donated money and said seeing the generosity assures him North Bay is a giving city.

""I got up this morning and shed a few tears,"" said Compton. ""It's heartwarming to see a community coming together.""

Every Tuesday, Between The Bun staff wear shirts supporting Outloud North Bay and the LGBTQ+ community.

All tips on Tuesdays are donated to Outloud. Due to the theft, the restaurant decided all tips accepted on Thursday are going directly to the hub space, as well.

The owners have a simple message for the thief.

""I hope you really have time to sit down and think about what you're doing with your life,"" said Chaput.

The restaurant and Outloud said they are thankful customers and the community as a whole stepped up to replace the stolen cash.

On Wednesday morning, OPP officers invited Trent and his grandfather, David Oley, for a boat ride and tour of the marine unit, in hopes that it will remind the eight year old that though it was a scary situation, what he did was brave.

Oley said he and Trent were on a fishing trip a few kilometres north of North Bay, and began heading back to shore.

""By the time we got back to shore, I was pretty exhausted, pretty worn out and we sat there for a while,"" he said.

Oley was so exhausted, he couldn't get out of the boat. That's when Trent sprung into action.

""He got my cellphone and called his mother, and eventually his mother called 911,"" Oley said.

Trent ran back and forth between the road and the boat – about 400 metres – occasionally splashing water on his grandfather to keep him alert.

""At our camp we do a lot of survival stuff almost, and a lot of that helped me with it,"" the young hero said.

""For an eight year old, it’s pretty incredible, you know, to do what he did,"" Oley said.

The OPP wanted to recognize him for his fast action and calm approach to the crisis while he was waiting for help to arrive. So on Wednesday, they took him and his grandfather on a tour of the marine unit and a ride out on Lake Nipissing.

""We wanted to recognize Trent and give him a little reward so he remembers this event as being a positive thing, as opposed to a traumatic thing,"" said Carlo Berardi of the OPP.

Oley said just a week before the incident, Trent was taught how to use a cellphone in case of an emergency. If that hadn’t happened, he said the outcome could have been much worse.",[]

As more businesses and public spaces reopen, the risk of rapid spread of the virus increases, she said.

“Ongoing dedication to the measures that have enabled us to open is critical to ensuring we stay open,"" Catton said. ""There is increasing evidence supporting the use of masks in enclosed spaces as an important added measure to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission.”

As of July 23, businesses in the Porcupine Health Unit area will require all members of the public and employees who enter or remain in an enclosed public space of the business or organization to wear a mask or face covering that covers their mouth, nose and chin without gaping.

And enclosed public space refers to indoor spaces of businesses and organizations that are accessed by the public.

There will be some exemptions to the policy, including children under two years, people with medical conditions such as difficulty breathing, or those who cannot remove their masks without assistance.

""People will not be expected to provide their reason nor any proof of exemptions,"" the release said.

No need to wait

While not coming into effect until next week, to give businesses time to prepare, the health unit urges the public to start wearing masks now.

""Get a mask, make a mask, use a scarf from your closet, and learn how to safely wear and remove them,"" the release said. ""There are instructional posters and videos available in French and English on the porcupine health unit website.""

“The Porcupine Health Unit is committed to helping local businesses reopen and remain open safely,"" she said. ""We will be working with all members of the business community throughout the area to support them and provide guidance during this period.”

The new face covering requirement adds to existing advice on preventing the spread of COVID, including washing your hands frequently and well; covering your coughs and sneezes; keeping physical distance between yourself and others outside and wearing a non-medical mask or face covering when that isn’t possible; not touching your face; keeping commonly touched surfaces clean; and staying home when you’re not well.

“I know many people feel their lives have been put on hold for too long,” Catton said. “If we proceed with caution and care into Stage 3, we can reduce the future impact of COVID-19 in all our communities.”

By awarding what's known as a single-source contract to the show, a staff report says the city can save as much as 25 per cent of the roughly $250,000 it will cost to tear down the structures.

The move follows direction from councillors last fall to take a more aggressive approach to dealing with derelict and vacant properties in the community.

""That approach resulted in a number of properties being brought into compliance with the property standards bylaw, as well as a three properties being demolished across the community,"" the report said.

One of the buildings is a home that is beyond repair, the second is one the city received in a tax sale, and the third is a city property that ""has reached the end of its useful life.""

Positive exposure

Single source contracts are permitted only under specific circumstances. In this case, the report said, it would be allowed because it's ""under circumstances which are exceptionally advantageous to the city.""

In addition to the cost savings, the report said the buildings contain dangerous substances such as asbestos and silica, which the Salvage Kings can deal with properly.

""They will have the ability to recognize and identify any potential hazard containing materials and then have the ability to deal with them accordingly,"" the report said.

A third factor is the positive exposure the city would receive by appearing on the broadcast.

""The exposure on the program will help promote the city,"" the report said. ""It will also show that the city continues to mean business and take action with derelict properties and property owners.

""Also, it shows that not only is the city taking these drastic measures with private owners but, is also taking this seriously and applying it to city-owned properties.""

Timmins council will decide on the contract at its meeting tonight at 6 p.m.",[]

The province announced in April that it would provide first responders with a database detailing the name, date of birth and address of all patients who tested positive for the virus.

The Canadian Civil Liberties Association (CCLA) and its partners have now served a notice of application to begin a legal challenge at the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in an effort to stop the provincial government from disclosing the information to police.

“Individual Ontarians’ health information is among the most sensitive personal information the government holds,” Abby Deshman, the director of the criminal justice program at CCLA, said in a statement.

Deshman said that given ""patchy nature of COVID testing and the risk of asymptomatic spread,"" police should not rely on test results to keep safe from the disease. Instead, she said, police should practice the same public health advice the rest of the province is following.

Deshman added that sharing COVID-19 test results with police is “not necessary, and in fact undermines an effective public health approach to this pandemic.”

A spokesperson for the Ontario Ministry of the Solicitor General confirmed with CTV News Toronto on Friday that the government was served with a notice.

“On July 7, 2020, Ontario was served with the Notice of Application for Judicial Review,” the spokesperson stated. “As this matter is subject to litigation, it would be inappropriate to comment further.”

In a previous statement, the province said that the measures were taken under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act to protect first responders by allowing access to the information of people they come into contact with amid the pandemic.

“Once the declaration of emergency is lifted, this data will be made inaccessible to first responders,” the province said in a statement in April.

But the groups involved in the legal action, including the Aboriginal Legal Services, the Black Legal Action Centre and the HIV and AIDS Legal Clinic Ontario, say the measure violates their constitutional rights to privacy and equality.

The groups, including the CCLA, argue that the measure also breaches provincial health privacy protections and is not authorized by Ontario’s emergency legislation.

“Police involvement in public health matters impedes effective public health responses,” said Khalid Janmohamed, a lawyer with the HIV and AIDS Legal Clinic Ontario.

“People are less likely to get tested or seek treatment because they are afraid of being targeted by police. We have seen this happen in relation to the criminalization of people living with HIV and people who use drugs.”

The groups say they wrote and sent a letter to Ontario’s Solicitor General on April 22 about their concerns, but have yet to receive a response.",[]

Councillors hope that this will be a positive new chapter for the township after experiencing a fair share of controversy over the past few weeks.

They're hoping that, by raising the Pride Flag, they'll be delivering a sign of acceptance and inclusion in a community that appears divided.

Council stood united at Castle Kilbride as they raised the flag at 11 a.m. Friday.

Coun. Jennifer Pfenning brought forward the motion on June 22, and it was unanimously approved by council on July 13.

Near the end of June, the statue of Sir John A. Macdonald, which is located just steps away from the new Pride Flag, was repeatedly vandalized amid calls for its removal.

Pfenning says she hopes this ceremony will continue to encourage respectful dialogue in the community.

""We are having very difficult conversations right now but they need to happen. Difficult conversations are not bad, they're necessary—without them, we can't ever moving anything forward,"" she explains.

""The key is to remain respectful and to understand where the other person is coming from.""

Grayson Curtis is currently undergoing chemotherapy for a malignant rhabdoid tumour, which affects young infants and children. The cancer started in his kidney and has now spread to his liver and lungs.

His parents, Shauna Payne and Joshua Curtis, say their little boy has been strong.

“It seem like the chemo is working,” Shauna says. “Only because he seems so much happier now.”

Their ordeal started on July 1, when they noticed Grayson had a bloated belly. They initially thought he had gas, but after doctors at Grand River Hospital examined Grayson, they rushed him to McMaster Children’s Hospital in Hamilton.

Joshua says the situation was difficult at first, mostly for Grayson’s 9-year-old sister McKenna.

“She wasn’t allowed in the hospital to see her brother,” he says. “It was pretty hard for us because we’re always together.”

Over the last few weeks, Joshua and Shauna have been off work and they’ve been struggling to pay their bills.

That’s when family and friends stepped in to help them out by organizing online fundraisers and raffles, as well as starting a GoFundMe page.

“Within 24 hours we already exceeded $10,000,” says cousin Lucinda Payne.

“Honestly, I’m just so grateful to have, like an army behind me,” says Joshua.

Carmen Cordova, who has been a friend for more than 20 years, is also hosting a Zumbathon fundraiser next month.

“They don’t need to be worried about the logistical stuff,” she says. “They just need to worry about their emotional wellbeing.”

The Curtis family appreciates the support, as they’ve already been through a lot in the last few years.

“We’ve had four miscarriages and also had a stillborn in 2017,” says Shauna.

“They deserve every bit of help they can get,” adds Payne.

As of Thursday, the fundraising total has increased to more than $25,000.",[]

Now that Waterloo Region has a mandatory face covering bylaw in effect, there may be questions regarding mask guidelines in these settings.

In some, you'll need to wear a mask in specific areas, while others will be exempt.

At a gym or fitness centre, for example, you should wear a mask when you enter the building, in the change room and when heading to workout areas.

When it comes to actually exercising, though, you don't have to wear a mask.

In indoor dining areas at restaurants, you need to wear a mask when you go in and while you're sitting at your table, but you can take it off while you're eating or drinking.

""The intent of the bylaw is to ensure that at any point in time when somebody may be in closer proximity to you that you will have your mask on,"" explains Kris Fletcher with the Region of Waterloo.

""So I would envisage you'd have a waiter who has a mask who would deliver a drink to your table, you could take off your mask while you're drinking that particular drink.""

The Region of Waterloo frequently asked questions page explains that those who are dining on a patio still need to wear their masks when they go inside to use the bathroom.

There are exceptions to who needs to wear a mask, including those who have a medical reason not to.

Someone who is exempt from a mask does not need to show proof, but businesses are able to refuse service to people who are not wearing them based on their own policies.

Face coverings are an extra tool to help slow the spread COVID-19 now that more people will be in places where physical distancing can be harder to maintain.

For the safest experience, masks should be worn and people should do their best to stay six feet away from each other.

Ideally, a mask will fit snugly without gaps over the nose, mouth and chin, and won't impair your vision.

Here are a couple of tips on how to properly wear a mask:

Don't wear a mask made out of plastic

A bandana or scarf can also serve as a face covering

Avoid readjusting the mask while it's on your face

Wash your hands with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds before and after putting on and taking off your mask

Wash your mask after every use

Ensure your mask is clean and dry before you put it back on

For more tips on proper mask wearing, you can visit the Region of Waterloo's face covering page.

If you still have questions, the region says you can call their Service First Call Centre at 519-575-4400.

There have been 1,349 positive cases of COVID-19 in Waterloo Region to date.

Of those, 48 that have been identified are still considered active. More than 80 per cent of cases have recovered, while 118 people have died.

St. Jacobs-based sculptor Timothy Schmalz, whose work has been featured in the Vatican and around the world, created the piece.

He says it took him a year to make the sculpture, which he calls ""playful and fun.""

The art piece, called ""Banana,"" depicts a number of monkeys dropping down to get to a gorilla, which is holding the latest piece of technology: the ""Banana"" cell phone.

Schmalz says the sculpture is a nod to Waterloo Region being the tech hub of Canada, and shows how much people rely on their cell phones, especially during the pandemic.

""Laughter and fun can be a great instigator of positive change – especially if we all laugh together,"" Schmalz is quoted in a news release.

At night, the phone will light up as thought it was charging.

The work was commissioned by HIP Developments, which built the condo behind the piece.

""It seems that with each passing day the world is becoming a more serious place. And, technology is continually hitting us with a barrage of pronouncements, demands, memes and worries,"" President Scott Higgins said in a statement.

""Maybe it’s evolution and progress. Or, maybe it’s turning life into a barrel of monkeys.""

The development, called Circa 1877, sold out in two days back in 2017. At the time, HIPP said that was faster than any other condo development in the region's history.

In anticipation of the reopening, the region hosted an online panel on Thursday morning, inviting restaurant owners to ask questions and learn from other businesses that have gone through the process of opening outdoor dining.

“One of my big concerns is complacency curve, where it becomes so kinesthetic, so we have to continually preach about it every single day and remind people,” said Jody Palubiski, CEO of the Charcoal Group of restaurants during the discussion.

Representatives from local restaurants also explained how they're introducing the changes to staff.

“I think one of the things we can do is lead by example, keep it current, keep talking about it every single day and share positive feedback we did receive about how we've been handling it,” said Palubiski.

He also expressed an interest in keeping some of the changes around after the pandemic, including the extended patio seating as well as the province’s more flexible liquor laws.

“Hopefully those things catch on and we don’t see a complete pull back of those opportunities that were afforded us,” he added.

The region has already released safety guidelines for restaurants, including servers keeping a two-metre distance from diners when taking orders and wearing a face covering while serving.

During the meeting, region officials clarified that kitchen staff do not have to wear masks under the bylaw, instead saying that decision is left up to each business.

Officials also say restaurants are not required to take contact information of patrons, but say it is recommended for contact tracing.

As of 12:01 a.m. Friday, dine-in restaurants will officially be allowed to reopen their doors however, certain things will still not be allowed for the time being, including dancing at restaurants and bars, buffet-style food, and private karaoke rooms.

In a bid to help attract residents back out to restaurants, the region has also introduced the Art Fresco Public Art Project, inviting local artists to paint picnic tables with their designs.

Those colourful picnic tables are expected to be distributed to local restaurants on July 27.

One store employee stationed at the entrance said he was punched repeatedly in the head by the man.

""I went behind and got a free one for him, and with that, he yelled, 'I refuse to wear a mask.' I put it back, and that's when he hit me,"" claimed Robert Baynton Smith.

Witnesses said the man narrowly missed hitting pedestrians and shopping carts with his vehicle as he left.

According to the SIU, the suspect was followed by officers from the store in a short pursuit before calling it off for public safety.

Hours later, officers met up with the man at a residence on Indian Point Road, east of Haliburton.

""There was an interaction with the man and two officers discharged their firearms,"" stated the SIU report.

The 73-year-old man was injured and taken to the hospital where he was pronounced dead.

There’s a big, welcoming porch, a cluster of brightly-coloured Muskoka chairs, and a friendly dog to greet you as you roll up the gravel driveway.

But there’s something unique drawing visitors from around the world: a restored, 80-year-old caboose.

Owner Dave Huskinson’s passion for trains is obvious. He’s dressed in blue-striped conductor coveralls with a tiny pocket watch dangling from the bib. His father worked as a fireman shovelling coal.

“It’s in the blood,” Huskinson said.

He always wanted to fix up a caboose, and 12 years ago, he lucked into a retired one from Ontario Northland in Orillia.

“It was a way to keep the hobby alive and have it kind of pay for itself and put an interest out for fellow people like ourselves,” Huskinson said.

He describes the old caboose as being in fairly good shape after an update in the 1970s. But its windows were broken, the body of car filled with snowdrifts and coated by lead paint.

While Huskinson said the transformation took about a year, he never got frustrated. “It’s a love and a passion you have for it, so it was fun along the way.”

Mandie Fields was drawn to Clearview Station while looking for an escape from London, Ont., where she and her husband could feel comfortable and safe during a pandemic.

“That it was separate, so not like a hotel, was a big attraction... that we weren’t going to be around other people, but we really wanted to get out of the city,” Fields said.

In its second life, the caboose is a cozy room for two, choc-full of nods to Canadian railroad history. There are CN hangers in the closet, Ontario Northland towels in the tiny bathroom. The arching ceiling of the old caboose has been maintained, covered in reclaimed hardwood.

Huskinson was especially keen to refinish the pair of elevated cupola seats from which crew members would have examined trains.

“The cupola seats up top were to me the...real jewel of the whole thing, Huskinson said. “Families with children, the kids love to be up there looking up at the view. The view with the stars at night and the lights, that’s really what draws people’s interest to it.”",[]

Many businesses along the main beachfront are ineligible to apply for Ontario's rent-relief programs because the properties are municipally-owned.

""They should not be penalized in terms of access to relief because the town owns their buildings,"" Mayor Nina Bifolchi said.

The mayor plans to write a letter to both the federal and provincial governments asking for changes to the program.

Meanwhile, the town's council agreed to waive the one per cent annual event fee that is typically applied to beachfront tenants since there won't be any events happening this summer.

Council also approved a temporary exemption to the sign bylaw so beachfront businesses could advertise on the fencing surrounding the new pods along Beach Drive.

But many restaurants have yet to turn on the open sign.

Market Buffet BBQ and Smokehouse in Barrie hasn't served a meal to anyone since March. Owner Jamie Martin closed the restaurant two days before the pandemic was declared.

""It's been rough,"" admitted Martin. ""I think everyone in the industry has taken a real hit.""

Over the past four months, Martin said they had lost more than $500,000 in sales alone.

Since buffets aren't part of Stage 3, the owners had to reinvent how it operates, including changing its name to Market BBQ and Smokehouse.

""We had to remove the buffet. We're going to transition into a menu that is more of a sit down a la carte restaurant,"" said Martin, who added there are plans in the works to open its patio with a smaller menu.

Before the pandemic, the self-serve restaurant offered more than 150 items, which has now been reduced to about 80, which, according to Martin, are mainly guest favourites.

The buffet has been family-owned since 2005 and underwent a $60,000 upgrade in 2015.

Martin said COVID has been an eye-opener but never thought their business model would ever change with the future of buffets unknown.

""I think there will be a shift in buffets,"" said Martin. ""Either they're going to get out of the buffet altogether like we did, or they'll change the way they serve.""

Both Wasaga and Sauble beaches have struggled to adhere to public health protocols with thousands of day-trippers flocking north.

Mayor Jackson recently held a Zoom meeting with the mayors of several beach communities, including Wasaga Beach, which will start testing the new pods this week.

""I'm really anxious to hear how that works out for them. They are going to have two staff members stationed at each entrance, and that's for the entire day,"" Jackson said the experiment is labour-intensive.

The widespread hack, which appears to be coordinated, somehow gained access to the verified Twitter accounts of Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Michael Bloomberg, Warren Buffet, Jeff Bezos, Kanye West and Kim Kardashian West.

Companies were also targeted, including tech giant Apple and multiple cryptocurrency sources, including Binance, Ripple and Gemini.

Collectively, more than 320 million users follow the accounts.

Messages posted to the hacked profiles Wednesday afternoon invited users to send bitcoins to a long, anonymized link and said the money would be doubled and returned to the sender.

“I am giving back to the community,” read a message posted on Biden’s account, which has since been deleted. “All Bitcoin sent to the address below will be sent back doubled! If you send $1,000, I will send back $2,000. Only doing this for 30 minutes.”

A similarly worded message was posted to the Twitter account belonging to Obama, who has the most followers on the platform at 120 million.

In some cases, the tweets garnered thousands of retweets and were widely shared. It’s unclear how many followers fell for the scam or how the hackers accessed the accounts.

Twitter said it is investigating the security incident and that users may be unable to send tweets or reset their passwords while the incident is being addressed.

Many verified users — public figures and organizations that Twitter deems “in the public interest” — reported being unable to post tweets for a period of time Wednesday afternoon.

Twitter users have been hacked before, but this hack appears to be one of the largest in the history of the social media platform. Last August, Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey had his account hacked, with racist tweets posted from his profile.

Dorsey addressed the situation in a tweet Wednesday evening.

“Tough day for us at Twitter. We all feel terrible this happened,” he wrote.

“We’re diagnosing and will share everything we can when we have a more complete understanding of exactly what happened.""",[]

It was the third spacewalk in as many weeks involving battery work by NASA's Bob Behnken and Chris Cassidy.

Running more than an hour ahead of schedule, they managed to complete the battery swaps in a single spacewalk rather than two. Their fourth spacewalk next week will now focus on other chores.

""Great job,"" Mission Control radioed.

Behnken and Cassidy swiftly removed six of the remaining old nickel-hydrogen batteries and plugged in three new lithium-ion units.

The lithium-ion batteries -- big, boxy units with a mass of more than 400 pounds (180 kilograms ) -- are so powerful that only half as many are needed. The batteries store power gathered by the station's solar panels for use on the nighttime side of Earth.

The effort to replace all of the space station's 48 aging batteries began in January 2017, requiring 11 spacewalks to date.

One new battery shorted out in 2019 and the old ones had to be re-installed. One more spacewalk remains, likely this fall. NASA is putting it off instead of tackling it next week because it would involve powering down that power channel.

Besides, the two remaining old batteries are working well with all the new ones, said Rob Navias, a spokesman at Johnson Space Center in Houston. ""We are fat with power and there is no rush,"" he said in an email.

NASA expects these new batteries to last the rest of the space station's operational life -- another four years from now at least.

Much of Thursday's six-hour spacewalk unfolded more than 260 miles (420 kilometres) up under the bright glare of daylight. ""Can't control the sun,"" Cassidy noted. ""Small price to pay for it not going away, I guess. It's nice to be in daylight the whole time.""

Behnken arrived at the space station at the end of May on a SpaceX capsule, the company's first astronaut flight. He and Doug Hurley are scheduled to return to Earth in the Dragon capsule in early August.

Cassidy, the space station's commander, is halfway through a six-month mission. A Russian Soyuz capsule is his ride to and from the orbiting outpost.

Both Behnken and Cassidy each now have nine spacewalks to their credit.",[]

It was the first birth at the zoo of the endangered creatures, which are native to Madagascar, in over a decade, Wildlife Reserves Singapore said.

The arrival of the yet-to-be-named twins was ""particularly special"" because the creatures breed only once a year, it said.

The fluffy lemurs are a distinctive rust colour, with black faces, hands, feet and tails, and a distinctive white patch on their heads.

The last of the species to be born at the zoo was the twins' father, Bosco, 11 years ago. The mother is eight-year-old Minnie, who arrived in Singapore from a Japanese zoo in 2016.

Although the twins were born earlier this year, they have only recently become an attraction as the zoo was closed for months as a result of a coronavirus lockdown.

Red-ruffed lemurs are classified as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature due to logging and hunting.

The FBI said Thursday it is investigating the hacks, and said the high-profile accounts ""appear to have been compromised in order to perpetuate cryptocurrency fraud.""

The ruse discovered Wednesday included bogus tweets from former President Barack Obama, Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden, Mike Bloomberg and a number of tech billionaires including Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Celebrities Kanye West and his wife, Kim Kardashian West, were also hacked.

Twitter said the hackers used ""social engineering"" to target some of the company's employees and then gained access to the accounts. The term refers to taking advantage of human nature via phishing attacks, tricking people into downloading malicious software or compromising them by offering something in return for information. Twitter did not say how its employees were compromised.

The attackers sent out tweets from the accounts of the public figures, offering to send $2,000 for every $1,000 sent to an anonymous Bitcoin address.

Cybersecurity experts say such a breach could have dire consequences since the attackers were tweeting from verified, globally influential accounts with millions of followers.

""If you receive a tweet from a verified account, belonging to a well-known and therefore trusted person, you can no longer assume it's really from them,"" said Michael Gazeley, managing director of cybersecurity firm Network Box.

Reacting to the breach, Twitter swiftly deleted the tweets and locked down the accounts to investigate. In the process it prevented verified users from sending out tweets for several hours.

The company said Thursday it has taken ""significant steps to limit access to internal systems and tools."" User passwords did not appear to have been compromised, Twitter said, so it's not necessary for users to reset them.

Many celebrities, politicians and business leaders often use Twitter as a public platform to make statements. U.S. President Donald Trump, for example, regularly uses Twitter to post about national and geopolitical matters, and his account is closely followed by media, analysts and governments around the world. The White House said Thursday his account was secure and wasn't jeopardized by the hacks.

Twitter faces an uphill battle in regaining people's confidence, Gazeley said. For a start, it needs to figure out exactly which accounts were hacked and show the vulnerabilities have been fixed, he said.

""If key employees at Twitter were tricked, that's actually a serious cybersecurity problem in itself,"" he said. ""How can one of the world's most used social media platforms have such weak security, from a human perspective?""

Rachel Tobac, CEO of Socialproof Security, said that the breach appeared to be largely financially motivated. But such an attack could cause more serious consequences.

""Can you imagine if they had taken over a world leader's account, and tweeted out a threat of violence to another country's leader?"" asked Tobac, a social engineering hacker who specializes in providing training for companies to protect themselves from such breaches.

Tobac said companies can guard themselves against such attacks by beefing up multi-factor authentication --- where users have to present multiple pieces of evidence as authentication before being allowed to log into a system.

Such a process could include having a physical token that an employee must have with them, on top of a password, before they can log into a corporate or other private system. Other methods include installing technical tools to monitor for suspicious insider activities and reducing the number of people who have access to sensitive data, Tobac said.

This week's case follows last year's federal investigation of two former Twitter employees charged with spying on users for the Saudi government.

Several U.S. lawmakers called on Twitter to co-operate with authorities including the Department of Justice and the FBI to secure the site after the latest breach.

""I am concerned that this event may represent not merely a co-ordinated set of separate hacking incidents but rather a successful attack on the security of Twitter itself,"" said Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican.

He added that millions of users relied on Twitter not just to send tweets but also communicate privately via direct messaging. Twitter hasn't said if hackers were able to access the private messages of their high-profile targets.

Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden said Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey told him in a private conversation in 2018 that the company was working on protecting direct messages, known as DMs, with end-to-end encryption.

But that promise never materialized, Wyden said Thursday, leaving everyone's private messages ""vulnerable to employees who abuse their internal access to the company's systems, and hackers who gain unauthorized access.""

""This is a vulnerability that has lasted for far too long, and one that is not present in other, competing platforms,"" Wyden said in an emailed statement. ""If hackers gained access to users' DMs, this breach could have a breathtaking impact, for years to come.""

An international team of researchers found that the record-breaking warm period was more than 2C hotter than it would have been if humans had not warmed the planet through decades of greenhouse gas emissions.

The five hottest years in history have occurred in the last five years and there's a better-than-even chance that 2020 will be the hottest ever recorded.

Earth's poles are warming faster than the rest of the planet, and temperatures in Siberia -- home to much of the world's carbon-rich permafrost -- were more than 5C hotter than average between January and June.

One town, Verkhoyansk, recorded a temperature of 38C (100.4 Fahrenheit) -- smashing previous records.

Andrew Ciavarella, senior detection and attribution scientist at Britain's Met Office, described the findings released Wednesday as ""staggering"".

""This is further evidence of the extreme temperatures we can expect to see more frequently around the world in a warming climate,"" he said.

The impact of climate change on extreme weather events such as super storms and droughts is now well established, but until fairly recently scientists have been unable to definitively link an individual event to global warming.

As part of a growing area of climate research known as attribution science, the team ran computer simulations of temperatures with the climate as it is today -- around 1C hotter than the pre-Industrial era baseline.

They then compared this to a model generating temperatures over Siberia this year without human influence -- that is, without the additional manmade 1C.

They found that the prolonged heat would happen less than once every 80,000 years without human induced climate change.

This makes the heatwave ""almost impossible in a climate that had not been warmed by greenhouse gas emissions"", the team said, adding that carbon pollution had made the extreme event at least 600 times more likely to occur.

'IMPORTANT FOR EVERYONE'

The team behind the calculations stressed that the Siberian heatwave was a problem for the entire globe.

Some 1.15 million hectares of forest going up in flames released millions of tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere. At the same time, the wildfires and sustained heatwaves accelerated the region's permafrost melt.

This caused an oil tank built on frozen soil to collapse in May, leading to one of the region's worst-ever oil spills.

Russia's aerial forest protection service, the agency that specialises in forest fires, said Wednesday that more than 5,000 people are working on 197 fires across Russia in an area of over 40,000 hectares, including eight in nature reserves.

""Such a prolonged heat wave is important, not only for its influence on people, but also from a scientific point of view,"" said Olga Zolina, from Russia's P.P. Shirshov Institute of Oceanography.

""The arctic is very, very important generally for forming of weather and circulation. So such high temperatures are really important for the whole globe.""

While the research was compiled rapidly and has not yet been subjected to peer-review, authors said it produced ""among the strongest results of any attribution study conducted to date.""

'NO CHANCE’

The 2015 Paris climate deal commits nations to capping temperature rises to ""well-below"" 2C (3.6 degrees Farenheit) above pre-industrial levels and to strive for a 1.5C limit if at all possible.

With just 1C of warming so far, Earth is already buffeted by record-breaking droughts, wild fires and super storms made more potent by rising sea levels.

To keep in line with the 1.5C target, the United Nations says global emissions must fall by 7.6 percent every year this decade.

Sonia Seneviratne, from ETH Zurich's Department of Environmental Systems Science, said the research showed the heatwave was an example of ""extreme events which would have almost no chance of happening"" without manmade emissions.

Climate models suggest that continued increases in methane levels could see global temperatures increase by 3-4 degrees Celsius by 2100, researchers from the Global Carbon Project said in a statement published Wednesday.

Researchers looked at methane emissions from 2000 to 2017, the last year for which complete global data are available, and warn that the current path leads toward a ""dangerous temperature threshold,"" according to the statement.

Both natural disasters, such as wildfires, floods and droughts, and social disruptions, including mass migrations and famines, would become ""almost commonplace,"" it said.

Methane is 28 times more effective than carbon dioxide at trapping heat over 100 years, the team said, and human activity accounts for more than half of methane emissions.

Annual emissions of the greenhouse gas have risen by 9% since 2000, which has the same effect on warming as adding 350 million cars to our roads.

The team, led by Rob Jackson, a professor of Earth system science in Stanford University's School of Earth, Energy & Environmental Sciences, published two papers in the journals Earth System Science Data and Environmental Research Letters on Wednesday.

The research showed that cattle ranching is the main reason for increased methane levels.

""Emissions from cattle and other ruminants are almost as large as those from the fossil fuel industry for methane,"" Jackson said. ""People joke about burping cows without realizing how big the source really is.""

Agriculture as a whole produces two-thirds of total emissions, with rice cultivation and biomass burning also significant contributors, according to the researchers.

Fossil fuels account for most of the remaining third, and the two sources have contributed almost equally to the recent increases.

While carbon emissions fell significantly during the coronavirus lockdown, as manufacturing and transport activity fell off a cliff, that's not the case for methane, according to Jackson.

""We're still heating our homes and buildings, and agriculture keeps growing,"" he said.

Africa and the Middle East, China, and South Asia and Oceania saw the sharpest rises in methane emissions, with the US close behind.

In the US, the increase has been driven by increasing use of natural gas. This reduces CO2 emissions by offsetting the use of coal, but it releases more methane.

Europe is the only region where methane emissions have fallen, thanks in part in greater efficiency in agriculture and reduced emissions from chemical manufacturing.

""Policies and better management have reduced emissions from landfills, manure and other sources here in Europe. People are also eating less beef and more poultry and fish,"" said Marielle Saunois of the Université de Versailles Saint-Quentin in France, lead author of the paper in Earth System Science Data.

The biggest rises in emissions were seen in tropical and temperate regions.

Researchers say it is hard to work out where natural methane emissions are coming from, compared with human-driven emissions.

In order to reduce methane emissions we need to cut the use of fossil fuels and control emissions from leaky pipelines and wells, the researchers said, with Jackson optimistic that drones, satellites and aircraft monitoring wells will lead to major progress in the field in the next five years.

We also need to implement new ways of growing and eating food, the team said, for example by supplementing cattle feed with algae that can reduce the amount of methane burped out by cows.

On Tuesday, fast food chain Burger King announced a plan to improve its cows' diet by adding lemongrass to their feed.

This change in diet will reduce the cows' methane emissions by 33% a day, the company said.",[]

As global plastic production continues to surge, the study is the first attempt at quantifying how much plastic from road vehicle tyres and brake pads is dispersed and deposited by air currents.

Microplastics -- tiny particles produced when larger plastic chunks break down as well as microfibres from clothes and other materials -- have been found atop some of Earth's highest glaciers and at the bottom of its deepest trenches.

Researchers in Norway and Austria took data on how much microplastic is produced by road transport and combined them with simulations of where they might be transported on wind currents.

They found that around a third of all road microplastic -- roughly 50,000 tonnes -- end up in the world's oceans every year.

The estimated range of 40,000-100,000 tonnes of aerial microplastic compares with the 65,000 tonnes deposited into the ocean from rivers annually.

""Atmospheric transport -- a source that is underestimated or not even considered -- has the same impact on microplastic pollution in the ocean as riverine transport,"" Nikolaos Evangeliou, from the Norwegian Institute for Air Research and lead study author, told AFP.

He said that microplastics were already having an impact on human and animal health as they are able to absorb organic compounds and toxic heavy metals, which are then ingested and enter the food chain.

Most road traffic plastic emissions are produced in vehicle-heavy regions such as North America, Northern Europe and South East Asia.

LONG-TERM MENACE

Evangeliou and his team found that when they simulated where these emissions were transported by global weather patterns, a significant amount was likely ending up in the Arctic.

Given the plastic particles' dark colour, which absorbs more of the Sun's heat, they said the pollution could affect the rate of ice melt there.

""Such small particles may act as light-absorbing impurities when deposited on snow and ice surfaces decreasing surface (heat reflection) and accelerating melting,"" Evangeliou said.

With several countries promising to end production of gas and diesel vehicles in the coming decades, the paper published in Nature Communications suggested that road plastic emissions would continue to pose a growing environmental threat as tires and brakes would likely be the same even on electric models.

""Road microplastics environmental impact as they are derived by materials made from fossil fuels such as ethylene and propylene,"" said Evangeliou.

""Thus, the larger need for plastics result in larger emissions of greenhouse gases.""",[]
374,374,374,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/demand-for-robot-cooks-rises-as-kitchens-combat-covid-19-1.5023490,Demand for robot cooks rises as kitchens combat COVID-19,'Dee-Ann Durbin',2020-07-14,"HAYWARD, CALIF. -- Robots that can cook - from flipping burgers to baking bread - are in growing demand as virus-wary kitchens try to put some distance between workers and customers.

Starting this fall, the White Castle burger chain will test a robot arm that can cook french fries and other foods. The robot, dubbed Flippy, is made by Pasadena, California-based Miso Robotics.

White Castle and Miso have been discussing a partnership for about a year. Those talks accelerated when COVID-19 struck, said White Castle Vice-President Jamie Richardson.

Richardson said the robot can free up employees for other tasks like disinfecting tables or handling the rising number of delivery orders. A touch-free environment that minimizes contact is also increasingly important to customers, he said.

""The world's just reshaped in terms of thoughts around food safety,"" Richardson said.

Flippy currently costs US$30,000, with a $1,500 monthly service fee. By the middle of next year, Miso hopes to offer the robot for free but charge a higher monthly fee.

Robot food service was a trend even before the coronavirus pandemic, as hospitals, campus cafeterias and others tried to meet demand for fresh, customized options 24 hours a day while keeping labour costs in check. Robot chefs appeared at places like Creator, a burger restaurant in San Francisco, and Dal.komm Coffee outlets in South Korea.

Now, some say, robots may shift from being a novelty to a necessity. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control says the risk of getting COVID-19 from handling or consuming food outside the home is low. Still, there have been numerous outbreaks among restaurant employees and patrons.

""I expect in the next two years you will see pretty significant robotic adoption in the food space because of COVID,"" said Vipin Jain, the co-founder and CEO of Blendid, a Silicon Valley startup.

Blendid sells a robot kiosk that makes a variety of fresh smoothies. Customers can order from a smartphone app and tweak the recipe if they want more kale or less ginger, for example. Once or twice a day, a Blendid employee refills the ingredients.

Only a handful are now operating around San Francisco, but since the pandemic began, Blendid has started contract discussions with hospitals, corporations, shopping malls and groceries.

""What used to be forward-thinking - last year, pre-COVID - has become current thinking,"" Jain said.

As salad bars shut down, Hayward, California-based Chowbotics started getting more inquiries about Sally, a robot about the size of a refrigerator that makes a variety of salads and bowls. Sally lets customers choose from 22 prepared ingredients stored inside the machine. It can make around 65 bowls a day before kitchen workers need to refill the ingredients.

Prior to this year, Chowbotics had sold around 125 of its $35,000 robots, primarily to hospitals and colleges. But since the coronavirus hit, sales have jumped more than 60%, CEO Rick Wilmer said, with growing interest from grocery stores, senior living communities and even the U.S. Department of Defence.

Wilkinson Baking Co., whose BreadBot mixes, forms and bakes loaves of bread, has also been getting more inquiries. Randall Wilkinson, the CEO of the Walla Walla, Washington-based company, said the BreadBot serves shifting needs. Grocery shoppers no longer want self-serve options like olive bars, but they still want fresh and local food. Seeing how that food is made also gives them more confidence, he said.

Robot cooks haven't always been successful. Spyce, a Boston restaurant with a robot-run kitchen, closed in November to retool its menu. Zume, a Silicon Valley startup that made pizzas with robots, shut down its pizza business in January. It's now making face masks and biodegradable takeout containers.

Max Elder, research director of the Food Futures Lab at the Palo Alto, California-based Institute for the Future, is skeptical about the future of food prep robots once the pandemic has eased.

""Food is so personal, and it needs to involve humans,"" he said.

Elder is also concerned that focusing on automating food preparation during the pandemic will shift attention from other problems in the food system, like outbreaks among meat industry workers or produce pickers.

""We can't automate our way out of the pandemic because the pandemic affects much more than what can be automated,"" Elder said.

Automated food companies insist they're not trying to replace human workers. At White Castle, Richardson says Flippy will allow managers to redeploy workers to drive-thru lanes or help them cover a shift if an employee calls in sick. Wilmer, of Chowbotics, says Sally may actually create jobs, since it keeps selling food at times of day when it wouldn't have been available before.

But robots can lower the demand for labour. At the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences in Little Rock, workers used to spend six hours per day prepping grab-and-go salads in the 24-hour cafe, said Tonya Johnson, the school's director of nutrition services. But two years ago, the campus installed a Sally, which now makes an average of 40 salads per day. Sally allowed the school to eliminate a vacancy in its cooking staff, Johnson said.

Johnson said the campus is buying another Sally for students to use when they return this August, which will save four hours per day of grab-and-go salad prep in the college deli.

""I think the pandemic has made us realize how much we need more equipment like Sally,"" Johnson said.

Miso Robotics co-founder and CEO Buck Jordan said fast food restaurants are already having trouble finding workers, due in part to a shrinking population of young workers.

""It's our contention that automation is not a choice,"" Jordan said. ""You must automate in order to survive the future.""

The population of Mars is on the verge of tripling as three new Mars missions from three different countries are set to launch within the next month, with two new rovers coming to the planet.

Curiosity is about to get some company.

Although Mars has been an object of fascination for years for humans millions of kilometres away on Earth, it is still a planet of vast mystery, and has been only marginally explored.

The Curiosity Rover, a NASA project, has called Mars home since 2012. Over the last few months, scientists have been commanding Curiosity from the comfort of their sofas at home instead of their offices at NASA.

The rover has been alone on the planet ever since Opportunity — which was sent to Mars with the Spirit rover in 2003 — stopped responding in 2018 following a massive dust storm that swept over the rover’s location on Mars. Opportunity’s mission was officially deemed complete in 2019 after months of NASA attempting to reconnect and revive the rover.

On July 30, NASA is sending Curiosity a new friend: their fifth Mars rover since the start of the program, called Perseverance.

Perseverance’s main mission is to look for signs of past life on Mars by studying the geology and taking rock and soil samples to be analyzed on Earth later. Previous explorations — including work done by Opportunity — have shown evidence that there was once water on Mars’ surface.

As water is one of the main building blocks of life as we know it, further evidence that Mars didn’t always used to be a dry, rocky wasteland could open up our understanding of how life could exist outside of our planet.

NASA has been sending rockets and landing craft to Mars for decades. But America’s martian monopoly is being challenged by China and the United Arab Emirates this summer, with both aiming to join the outer space elite.

Like the Americans, China is landing a rover on Mars this summer, called Tianwen-1, according to a press release from the China National Space Administration.

Although not many details of the mission have been released, the rover is set to launch sometime in July, and is China’s first Mars exploration mission.

The United Arab Emirates are not landing a rover on the planet, but are instead launching a mission to orbit Mars and observe from space.

The Hope Probe will circle the planet for two years studying weather and atmosphere, and will be the first of the three missions to launch this summer: a countdown on the UAE Space Agency website shows that the mission is launching next week, on July 15.

The mission is aiming to understand the climate dynamics of Mars, the structure of Mars’ atmosphere and why hydrogen and oxygen are escaping from the upper atmosphere into space.

So why are so many missions to Mars launching in the same month?

Because there is a unique window of opportunity right now. This is when Earth and Mars are closest together — something that only happens every two years.

Although these three missions are being operated by different countries, and have different goals, they all serve as important stepping stones towards the ultimate quest: achieving a human expedition to Mars by the end of the century.",[]

NASA’s Parker Solar Probe captured a view of the twin tails of the comet while on its mission to explore the sun’s atmosphere.

The comet was first discovered on March 25 by NASA’s Near-Earth Object Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer. It was named after the mission that found it, C/2020 F3 Neowise.

""NASA’s Parker Solar Probe was at the right place at the right time to capture a unique view of comet NEOWISE on July 5, 2020. Parker Solar Probe’s position in space gave the spacecraft an unmatched view of the comet’s twin tails when it was particularly active just after its closest approach to the sun, called perihelion,"" reads a statement on NASA’s website.

Since being identified, NASA’s Solar and Terrestrial Relations Observatory, the ESA/NASA Solar, Heliospheric Observatory, and astronauts aboard the International Space Station have spotted the icy rock.

There’s been a number of sightings from Earth as well, as people have risen at the crack of dawn to catch a glimpse of the space spectacle before the comet fades into space as it travels further away from the sun.

Messi blasted his team for being ""weak"" after Real Madrid wrested the league title away from Barcelona for the first time in three years on Thursday, and said it must quickly change course to have a chance at winning the Champions League.

Real Madrid clinched the title by beating Villarreal 2-1 but would have lifted the trophy regardless of that result after Barcelona slumped to a 2-1 loss to an Osasuna side that finished with 10 men.

""This game represents the entire year. We have been an erratic and weak team,"" Messi said in a rare TV interview just after the final whistle sounded at an empty Camp Nou. ""Madrid did its part by winning all its matches, which is impressive, but we also helped them to win this league. We have to be critical of how we have played, starting with the players, and the rest of the club.""

Barcelona led the league by two points over Madrid when the league was stopped in mid-March for three months while Spain's reined in its coronavirus outbreak.

Madrid returned to the competition motivated and in shape, reeling off 10 straight wins.

Barcelona looked flat, drew three matches to lose the lead, and on Thursday hit a new low when it lost its first home match since November 2018.

""The feeling on this team is that it tries, but that it cannot get the job done,"" Messi said. ""Today in the first half they were better than we were and it seems we have to fall behind to react like we tried to do in the second half.""

Messi scored his league-leading 23rd goal from a free kick in the second half to cancel out Jose Arnaiz's opener.

And Barcelona got a man advantage when the visitors lost substitute Enric Gallego to a straight red card for bloodying the mouth of Clement Lenglet with an elbow to the face in the 77th.

But Osasuna's Roberto Torres scored in stoppage time with Barcelona pushing forward searching for a late goal.

""I said it some time ago, that playing like this we had no chance of winning the Champions League, and it turns out we didn't even have enough to win la Liga,"" Messi said. ""We need to take a breather, let some air in, and clean out minds of all that has happened since December.""

Barcelona must regroup for the second leg of its Champions League round-of-16 match against Napoli on Aug. 8. The first leg finished 1-1 in Italy.

""Playing like this we will lose against Napoli,"" Messi said. ""We have to start from zero in the Champions League and blame ourselves for what went wrong.""",[]
378,378,378,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/sports/dethroned-in-spanish-league-barcelona-sets-sights-on-europe-1.5028002,"Dethroned in Spanish league, Barcelona sets sights on Europe",'Joseph Wilson',2020-07-17,"BARCELONA, SPAIN -- Barcelona now needs a perfect run in the Champions League to avoid ending a season without a major title for the first time in six years.

Real Madrid dethroned Barcelona as Spanish league champion on Thursday when it clinched its record 34th Liga trophy. Madrid secured the title with one round to go after it beat Villarreal 2-1 and Barcelona lost 2-1 to 10-man Osasuna.

The loss of the title marks the low point in a difficult season for Barcelona. Rocked by disputes inside its board and between its squad and sports director, the Catalan club was unable to surround Lionel Messi with a winning combination.

Messi wasted little time in voicing his frustration after the humiliating loss to Osasuna, his team's first loss at Camp Nou since November 2018.

""I said it some time ago, that playing like this we had no chance of winning the Champions League, and it turns out we didn't even have enough to win la Liga,"" Messi said.

Barcelona must regroup for its Champions League game against Napoli on Aug. 9 -- the round-of-16 contest delicately poised after a 1-1 draw in the first leg in Italy -- to advance to the ""bubble"" knockout tournament in Lisbon.

""Playing like this we will lose against Napoli,"" Messi said. ""We have to start from zero in the Champions League and blame ourselves for what went wrong"" in the domestic league.

Here are some reasons for Barcelona's defeat:

SUPPORT CAST

Messi, now 33, is still the best player in the league. He led both in scoring, with 23 goals, and in assists, with 20 passes for goal.

Barcelona scored a league-leading 81 goals-- with Luis Suarez, Antoine Griezmann, Ansu Fati, and Arturo Vidal combined for 36 goals-- but there was clearly a problem of team chemistry.

Griezmann did not meet expectations after transferring from Atletico Madrid, often seeming more concerned with playing for Messi than offering a scoring option for his team.

Bigger problems emerged in midfield.

Besides having world-class forwards, Barcelona's golden years were built on its midfield. It is still anchored by 32-year-old Sergio Busquets, but Ivan Rakitic lost his starting job to newcomer Frenkie de Jong, who despite flashes of talent showed he still needs to grow into the role. The club lost patience waiting for Arthur to blossom into its playmaker and he is bound for Juventus next season.

COACHING CHANGE

Barcelona president Josep Bartomeu initially said he wanted to stand by Ernesto Valverde until the end of the season, saying he was the best coach to lead the team into the future.

But he lost faith in Valverde, who had won back-back-league titles and had Barcelona in the league lead, after Barcelona lost 3-2 to Atletico Madrid in the Spanish Super Cup semifinals. The loss seemed to confirm a tendency that Barcelona has developed of collapsing in big matches, such as its 4-0 debacle at Liverpool in last year's Champions League.

So, out when Valverde and in came Quique Setien, a coach who had long declared his love for Barcelona's style.

Setien made changes to the starting lineup. He stopped Valverde's alternating between Sergi Roberto and Nelson Semedo in defence and shifted Roberto into his natural role in midfield, leaving Semedo to flourish as the full-time starting right back. Setien also gave another chance to 20-year-old midfielder Riqui Puig, the latest product of Barcelona's youth academy.

But overall, the performances were too dull for a club packed with stars.

A 1-0 loss to Athletic Bilbao in the Copa del Rey quarterfinals in February ended Barcelona's run of six consecutive finals appearances.

When asked Thursday if he thought he would keep his job long enough to at least finish the Champions League campaign, Setien replied: ""I hope so, but I don't know.""

BAD BREAK

Barcelona led the league by two points over Madrid when the competition was suspended in March while Spain locked down for the coronavirus pandemic. At the time, Setien said he hoped the extra time off would give his players more of a chance to assimilate to his tactics.

Instead, Barcelona appeared flat and seemed to wear down faster than many of its rivals because of the accelerated game schedule of matches every three days to squeeze in the final 11 rounds after the league resumed.

Barcelona lost the league lead after a 0-0 draw at Sevilla on June 19. Even though Barcelona was still level on points with Madrid, Gerard Pique accurately forecast that Madrid would not drop any points.

Zinedine Zidane's squad reeled off 10 straight wins.

""Madrid did its part by winning all its matches, which is impressive, but we also helped them to win this league,"" Messi said. ""The worst part is that the way we finished the league doesn't bode well for what lies ahead.""",[]

The award is given out annually to the player who best exemplifies the qualities of perseverance, sportsmanship and dedication to ice hockey.

Ryan entered the NHL/NHL Players' Assistance program on Nov. 20 to get help for alcohol addiction. After going public with his story in an effort to help others with addiction issues, an emotional Ryan returned to the ice Feb. 27 and scored three times in a 5-2 win over visiting Vancouver.

""My journey started in November, but the process of getting there began a long time before that,"" Ryan said Thursday on a videoconference. ""Wasn't healthy, wasn't doing the right things for myself and wasn't treating a lot of things that were left unchecked by myself, my group around me for a long period of time.

""Once I started to identify those things, the sobriety part of it was the easy part. It's about having conversations now and letting go of some things that have hindered me for a very, very long period of time that I put away and tried to get away from with alcohol with avoidance, with whatever it might have been.""

Ryan said he still has tough days, but that the down times are farther apart.

""I feel like I'm in a much better place than I've ever been in my life,"" he said. ""And that only comes with doing the work. I've been doing that and feel good.""

Johns missed all of last season and the first 47 games of this one with painful headaches due to post-concussion syndrome. He scored four games into his return on Feb. 3 against the Rangers, with his parents in attendance at Madison Square Garden.

""My journey was a long one. Throughout the first five or six months, I was doing anything I could possibly to get back on the ice as soon as possible,"" Johns said. ""I never in my wildest dreams (thought) it would take 22 months to fulfil that. But I think about a year in I started to lose a lot of hope because every doctor I was going to see or every specialist I was going to see they were telling me one thing and then the other was telling me a different thing. A handful of them told me that they would probably never tell me to play hockey again.

""I leaned on my support system a lot, probably too much at times. But that was probably the biggest thing that helped me get through.""

Lindblom was diagnosed in December with Ewing's sarcoma, a cancerous tumour that grows in the bones or in the tissue around bones. He completed radiation treatments on July 2.

The rising star had 11 goals and 18 points in 30 games this season. While he has recently skated at the Flyers' complex in Voorhees, New Jersey, he has been ruled out of playing when the NHL season resumes.

""It's incredible what he's been through,"" Johns said of Lindblom, who wasn't on the call because he underwent a procedure as part of his recovery.

""Very different from our situations. It was a story that we you know, everybody NHL was following. It's just incredible to see how well he's doing.""

The spectators at Bristol Motor Speedway surged to the fence, chanted ""USA! USA!"" and celebrated NASCAR's most popular driver.

Cue the siren at the Dawsonville Pool Room -- another Elliott is an All-Star winner.

Chase Elliott joined his father, Hall of Famer ""Awesome"" Bill Elliott, as winner of NASCAR's annual All-Star race, earning the US$1 million prize Wednesday in front of limited spectators at the Tennessee track.

""Tonight felt like an event again and I felt like we've been missing that piece for a couple months,"" said Elliott, who won races at Charlotte in the Cup Series and Truck Series with no fans. ""It felt good to have NASCAR back. NASCAR is about the fans. I felt like the vibe was back.""

Back in his Georgia hometown, the pool room marks every win by the father or son by blaring its horn no matter the time of day or night.

""I hope someone got a good video of it for me,"" Elliott said. ""That's such a special tradition.""

Over in victory lane, the normally reserved Elliott celebrated like never before. He accepted the track's gladiator sword trophy and waved it in the air, stabbed it toward his Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet -- he drives No. 9, just like his father did -- and pretended to vanquish his foes with it in his celebration.

""What a special race to win. It's extremely special to join Dad in winning this race,"" Elliott said. ""To me this is one of the prestigious events on the schedule. There's a lot of hype around it. It means a lot to me .... you are racing against the very best. To beat the best is always special.""

Elliott won the second and third stages of the event and earned the right to choose which lane he wanted to restart for the final 15-lap sprint to the finish. He picked the outside lane and pulled buddy Ryan Blaney with him on the restart but was never challenged and beat Kyle Busch to the finish line.

Bill Elliott won the race in 1986, the only year it was held at Atlanta Motor Speedway. The race began in 1985 at Charlotte Motor Speedway and was held at that North Carolina track every year but one until it was moved during this pandemic-altered year.

Tennessee officials allowed NASCAR and Speedway Motorsports to sell 30,000 tickets to the All-Star race, so it was moved from Charlotte because North Carolina would not authorize spectators for the race.

""There's nothing like Bristol,"" Chase Elliott said. ""There's no feeling like it. This speaks for itself, Bristol is an electric atmosphere. We'll take that million dollars back to Georgia.""

It was the most spectators at a sporting event in the United States since March. Because the speedway is privately owned, attendance numbers will not be released, but there appeared to be about 20,000 people in the grandstands. Tickets were on sale through Tuesday evening and still available on Bristol's website until the deadline.

Bristol, dubbed ""The Last Great Colosseum,"" can hold about 140,000 spectators. Speedway Motorsports had those in attendance socially distanced through the grandstands and masks were only required upon entrance. Fans were told they could remove them once in their seats.

Following the post-race fireworks, an announcement was made to the crowd telling fans they'd be dismissed by row.

Elliott won in his fifth All-Star appearance and is the 25th different driver to win the made-for-TV race. He and his father join Hall of Famers Dale Earnhardt and Dale Earnhardt Jr. as winning father-son duos of the event.

""Anytime you can join the Earnhardts in anything in racing, and to join Dad in winning this event, that's not just special. That's a lot of years and a lot of history. For everything to come full circle like that is pretty dang cool,"" Elliott said.

Bubba Wallace was wrecked out of the qualifying race, ruining his shot of racing for the $1 million prize.

One driver advanced into the All-Star race through a fan vote and Wallace had been leading when results were last updated by NASCAR a week ago. After he crashed 17 laps into the qualifying race -- which awarded three additional slots to stage winners into the 20-driver All-Star field -- he was no longer eligible to win the fan vote.

It didn't matter, anyway. Clint Bowyer was named winner of the fan vote and NASCAR said he received the most votes even with Wallace eliminated. Aric Almirola advanced by winning the first stage, William Byron for winning the second stage and Matt DiBenedetto for winning the third stage.

Wallace had race-ending contact with the wall when his No. 43 Chevrolet appeared to be turned from behind by Michael McDowell 17 laps into the first stage. He said he didn't need to see a replay because he knew McDowell's contact was egregious.

""Just disrespect. When you get hooked into the wall, I don't even need to see a replay,"" Wallace said. ""People say he's one of the nicest guys in the garage. I can't wait for the God-fearing text that he is going to send me about preaching and praise and respect. What a joke he is.""

A piece of Wallace's crumpled sheet metal was placed on the back of McDowell's team truck and Wallace was seen walking away.

Wallace climbed from his car and gave a thumbs-up to a contingent of fans cheering for him. Roughly two dozen organizers from Justice 4 the Next Generation travelled from Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia in an effort to diversify NASCAR.

Wallace is the only Black driver competing regularly in NASCAR's top series, and drivers rallied around him after a noose was found at his assigned stall at Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama. Federal authorities ruled last month the noose had been hanging since October and was not a hate crime.",[]

The premier said the decision was made after discussions with medical officers of health.

Ford’s comments came shortly after the Minister of Heritage, Sport, Tourism and Culture Lisa MacLeod told TSN Radio 1200 in Ottawa that the MLB team had been given the go ahead.

“Our first priority is the health and well-being of all Ontarians,” MacLeod said in a statement. “Ontario’s Chief Medical Officer of Health has approved professional sports plans submitted by the NHL and MLB to facilitate a safe return to play.”

According to MacLeod, these plans require players and staff to follow “strict quarantine and isolation protocols from the general public,” as well as provide public health authorities the ability to rescind the approval if protocols are not followed.

“We’ll continue to work with our federal counterparts and sports organizations to facilitate a safe return to play if athletes are permitted to cross the border.”

On Thursday afternoon, the Blue Jays said they are not confirming MacLeod’s statements at this time and noted that the club has not yet received the necessary written approvals from government and public health.

According to the Public Health Agency of Canada, the government issued a national interest exemption to the league's players and staff for pre-season training. The government is still reviewing the plan for regular season games.

Speaking on Thursday afternoon, Mayor John Tory said he was pushing the federal and provincial governments to make this decision and noted that they were receptive because the protocols are “extensive” and will keep residents in the city, especially those surrounding the Rogers Centre, safe.

“If that is the case then I don’t know why we wouldn’t be happy to see our Blue Jays, Canada’s team, Toronto’s team, playing in their own home stadium,” he said.

The team returned to Toronto last week to start training camp at the Rogers Centre.

The Blue Jays’ season opener is scheduled to take place on July 24 in Tampa Bay. Their home opener is scheduled for July 29 against Washington.

The 2020 season has 60 games, down from the usual 162 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.",[]

Social and racial justice is a theme of the NBA's restart in Florida, and part of that was permitting players to substitute Black Lives Matter messages, or the names of Black people killed such as George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, on the backs of their jerseys in place of their names.

Powell had hoped to replace his name with ""Am I Next?"" But the league has drawn up a list of approved messages for players to choose from, and the Toronto Raptors guard is frustrated that the NBA is limiting their voice on an issue that involves freedom of speech.

""I was really disappointed in the options that were given to us,"" Powell said on a Zoom video call Thursday. ""With a topic just like this -- social justice -- that we're fighting for, the fact that we were boxed-in to a list of 28, 29 sayings was really unfortunate.

""We've got a lot of guys in this league that . . . have been using their voice through this time and we're really excited about the whole thing, about being able to change our last names, and put a quote there that represents where we stand and what we want to say and how we feel about this, and I was really upset about the whole change and how we're really limited.""

Powell will wear ""Black Lives Matter"" on his jersey, choosing that from a list that he called ""cookie cutter"" and said doesn't truly touch on the topics of what players are trying to achieve.

Among the 29 slogans to choose from are: ""Say Their Names,"" ""Vote,"" and ""I Can't Breathe.""

""I wish there wasn't even a list,"" Powell said. ""It's a topic where it's freedom of speech, and you're taking your name off the back of your jersey that matters to you. That speaks volumes to how you view things and your approach to life and you shouldn't be boxed in to say you can only say this much, this is OK for you to say.""

Powell said, as long as players didn't use any explicit language, they should have been free to choose whatever they liked.

Rondae Hollis-Jefferson will wear ""Speak Up"" on his jersey.

""It sticks out to me, personally, because I think a lot more of us on this platform should definitely speak up, they should say something, especially if they believe and care about what's going on right now in our world as a whole,"" he said. ""I feel like we all should speak up and say something, bring somebody closer together, take it one step at a time, one person at a time and then watch that trickle effect as we rub off our energy, our love, our positivity on somebody. That goes a long way.""

Some NBA players such as New Orleans' Jrue Holiday have announced they're contributing their remaining game cheques to social justice causes and Black-owned businesses.

""I think what those guys have done is amazing,"" Powell said.

The 27-year-old, who signed a four-year, US$27 million contract extension in 2017, announced Wednesday that 100 per cent of proceeds from July orders of his Understand the Grind spring/summer line would go to two foundations: Toronto-based Black Women in Motion and Color of Change in the U.S.

""These are organizations that need our support now more than ever,"" Powell said on his Instagram page.

""You get out there and you miss it,"" the Dallas Stars coach said. ""You realize how much you enjoy being out there.""

The NHL's oldest head coach still worries about COVID-19 but not enough to stop doing his job. It's a risk-reward proposition coaches and executives around sports are weighing, and while Florida assistant Mike Kitchen is the only one to so far opt out of hockey's return, plenty of others are considering masking up behind the bench and taking other precautions in the middle of a pandemic.

""It's a different world out there,"" Bowness, 65, said. ""I'm going to have to adjust to it, there is no question. I just want to make sure I'm cautious, which we've been since this virus started, and I will continue to do that. My health -- hey, I'm a grandfather now, my first grandkid. I intend on playing some golf with that kid down the road. I intend on being here a lot longer. So, yeah, am I going to be careful? Absolutely.""

The World Health Organization said the disease can be more severe in people 60 and over, and the NHL has four head coaches and a handful of assistants in that age range. The average age of the 24 head coaches in the playoffs is just under 54, the second-oldest behind the NBA among North America's four major professional sports leagues.

With that life experience comes meetings like New York Islanders coach Barry Trotz held with his staff this week to talk about whether to don a mask for games and practices.

""I don't know exactly what I'm going to do,"" Trotz said Wednesday on his 58th birthday. ""I'm not too concerned. I'm in pretty good health, but it affects everybody differently if you do get it. I don't want to get it, so there's a good chance I could have a mask behind the bench, but I haven't decided yet. I should say I don't want to give it to anybody if I have it, but I don't.""

Coaches are relying on frequent testing at training camp and in the hub cities of Toronto and Edmonton, hoping before going into quarantine that players and their families can avoid contracting the virus that halted the season in March. All team staff are tested every other day for now and will be daily once games start.

""We're all doing everything we can not to bring it into our locker room,"" Bowness said. ""Give our players credit, as well, because this is a big sacrifice for everyone and they're looking after themselves.""

The NHL reported 43 players tested positive during voluntary workouts from June 8-July 12. At least three of those cases came from the Tampa Bay Lightning and one from the Boston Bruins, though the league took over reporting statistics in the name of privacy and anonymity.

Outside practice facilities, coaches' comfort levels might vary from a hotspot such as Texas to the Canadian province of Manitoba, where there have been zero reported cases in 13 of the past 14 days.

""It was possibly easier for me, because of the fact that I was pretty darn safe right from the start,"" 53-year-old Winnipeg Jets coach Paul Maurice said. ""I'm really confident in what goes on in our building, tested every second day, I don't feel particularly exposed.""

The only coach taking part in the NHL's return older than Bowness is 67-year-old Pittsburgh assistant Jacques Martin, who was on the ice for camp practices this week like normal. Columbus' John Tortorella, 62, Florida's Joel Quenneville, 61, and Montreal's Claude Julien, 60, also all felt comfortable enough to get back to work.

Tortorella, who along with Philadelphia's 59-year-old Alain Vigneault and Boston's 55-year-old Bruce Cassidy is a finalist for the Jack Adams Award as coach of the year, brushed aside a question about himself and said, ""Safety is the priority"" for all involved.

Kitchen made what he called ""a difficult decision to say the least, but the right decision for me and my family"" in opting out, and Quenneville said he wished his longtime right-hand man nothing but the best.

Much like players, only a handful of whom decided not to play, coaches had to make their own determinations.

""I think this is going to be an individual thing,"" Bowness said. ""We're all going to deal with it in our own way... We're all going to have to make that call.""

Ronald Gasser's 30-year sentence and manslaughter conviction were vacated Wednesday by the Louisiana 5th Circuit Court of Appeal, news outlets reported.

The panel's decision comes after the U.S. Supreme Court outlawed split-jury verdicts in April. The ruling was retroactive for all cases with convictions currently under appeal.

Gasser was convicted of manslaughter by a 10-2 vote in 2018. He had been tried for second-degree murder, but most of the jurors settled on the lesser charge.

Gasser fatally shot McKnight on Dec. 1, 2016 after a 5-mile (8-kilometre) chase over a bridge led to an altercation.

Witnesses at the trial said McKnight had been weaving in and out of traffic at high speed before the shooting. Prosecutors acknowledged to the jury that he was, in the words of Assistant District Attorney Seth Shute, ""driving like a jerk."" But they argued that Gasser escalated the conflict, following him down an exit that he would not ordinarily have taken moments prior to the shooting.

Gasser said he was defending himself because McKnight lunged into his car. The prosecutor said physical evidence proved Gasser lied.

Gasser's attorney, Dane Ciolino, praised the decision. Ciolino said Gasser would remain in custody until a bond hearing could be scheduled.

McKnight had been a high school football hero at Louisiana's John Curtis Christian School. He signed with the University of Southern California in 2006. In the NFL, the running back played three seasons for the New York Jets and one with the Kansas City Chiefs.",[]

Sports Interaction, an online sportsbook operated out of Quebec by the Mohawk Council of Kahnawake, announced a deal with the team last year as the club's ""official and exclusive online casino and sports gaming partner.""

""Sports Interaction will be asking the Edmonton Eskimos to change its name so that we can continue supporting the club and its fans,” spokesman Ryan Stetson wrote in an email to CTV News.

Stetson declined further comment.

The team has said it is accelerating its review of its team name and will report back by the end of July.

In a statement, the team says ""we acknowledge and appreciate the feedback and input regarding our name"" and that it takes the naming issue seriously.""

""We will be seeking further input from the Inuit, our partners and other stakeholders to inform our decisions moving forward. We’ll continue to listen carefully and with an open mind.""

SPONSOR PUSHBACK

Sports Interaction is the second of the team's 12 ""premier partners"" to publicly state its displeasure with the team's name.

On July 7, CTV News was the first to reveal Belairdirect, a national home and auto insurer, had said it would end its relationship with the team if the name wasn't changed.

""At Belairdirect one of our core values is respect, which is founded on seeing diversity as a strength, being inclusive and collaborative,"" reads a statement from the company.

""In order for us to move forward and continue on with our partnership with the Edmonton Eskimos, we will need to see concrete action in the near future including a name change. We have shared our position with the team.""

Belairdirect is a longtime sponsor of the team's 50/50 draw at Commonwealth Stadium.

Jiffy Lube told the Canadian Press it supports the further engagement.

""We look forward to hearing feedback from their ongoing discussions,” spokeswoman Kelly McClung said.

A spokesman for TFB & Associates, the Canadian brand owners of lozenge manufacturer Fisherman's Friend, said the issue is ""something we have been following closely.""

""We support Edmonton’s CFL team’s re-engagement in discussions with the Inuit communities and are looking forward to the timely and respectful progression of those conversations along with a positive outcome for all.""

Although it is listed as a premier sponsor, Boston Pizza said its relationship with the team came to an end due to a shift in corporate marketing strategy, and not necessarily due to the team's name.

""Our decision to end the sponsorship was made prior to recent events in society, and as part of a larger shift in our marketing strategy away from legacy sponsorships of professional sports teams,"" a company spokesperson told CTV News.

The Brick, Molson Coors, Discount Car and Truck Rental, James H. Brown and Associates, Save on Foods, Servus Credit Union, Telus and Tim Hortons all have not responded to multiple media requests filed by CTV News over more than week.

NAME RESEARCH

The team released its annual report on Wednesday which included some figures around support for a change away from the current name in its annual general report on Thursday.

The report did not include information on how the data was gathered or the methodology behind the findings.

The team says its research found 78 per cent of the western Arctic Inuit oppose changing the name. That support fell to 55 per cent of Inuit in Nunavut and to 31 per cent of Inuit in the eastern Arctic.

""We began our research and engagement program three years ago because we believed that it was of utmost importance to have input from the Inuit regarding our name,"" the report reads.

The report also states that pride in the name the common theme among those who support keeping the Eskimos moniker.

""Due to the recent debate concerning our name we have committed to seeking further input on this topic. Our perspective that Inuit input is crucial to this process has not changed.""

The team also repeated its pledge to update the future of its name by month's end.",[]

Located near the intersection of Latoria Road and Klahanie Drive, the B.C. government says the site will be home to a 500-seat elementary school.

The province provided $7.7 million to purchase the land, while the Sooke School District (SD62) contributed $960,000.

“As more young families decide to raise their children on the Westshore, building and expanding schools here is a top priority for our government,” said B.C. Premier John Horgan, who is also MLA for Langford-Juan de Fuca, in a statement Friday.

“Strong public services, like education, are key to B.C.’s restart and recovery,” he said.

Meanwhile, blasting and site preparation is already underway at two other building locations on the West Shore, which will be home to two more schools.

The two upcoming schools, located at 3100 Constellation Ave., include a 500-seat elementary school named Pexsisen Elementary School and a 700-seat middle school called Centre Mountain Lellum.

Both schools were given names by local First Nations and are located on different sections of a single plot of land.

The two schools are expected to open in September 2022.

“Families deserve to know that schools will be available close to home,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Education in a release Friday.

The coronavirus update will be provided in a written statement after 3 p.m. It follows Thursday's live update in which provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix announced another 21 confirmed cases of the virus, bringing the provincial total to 3,170 cases since the pandemic began.

Seven of the past eight days have seen the virus grow by at least 20 new daily cases in B.C.

There are currently 192 active cases of the virus in the province, including 15 people who are in hospital, three of whom are in critical care.

The province's death toll from the virus remains at 189.

There have been no new outbreaks of COVID-19 in health-care facilities or in the broader community, Henry said Thursday.

Health officials continue to monitor two outbreaks at long-term care facilities and one at a hospital acute care unit. They are also monitoring the community outbreak at Krazy Cherry Farm in the province's Interior, which now has a total of four cases associated with it, according to Henry.

The provincial health officer said there have now been 27 cases confirmed associated with a pair of private parties that happened in Kelowna on Canada Day. Eighteen of those people reside in the Interior Health region, while the remaining nine reside in the Lower Mainland.

Henry reminded those who attended the parties to monitor themselves closely, avoid close contacts with others, and to call 811 if they have ""any symptoms at all"" to arrange for COVID-19 testing.

Most of B.C.'s confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been located in the Lower Mainland, with 1,667 located in the Fraser Health region and 1,028 in Vancouver Coastal Health.

Elsewhere in B.C., there have been 223 cases of COVID-19 in Interior Health, 136 in Island Health and 65 in Northern Health.

Another 51 confirmed cases in the province have happened among people who reside outside Canada.

A total of 2,789 people who previously tested positive for the coronavirus in B.C. have now fully recovered.

These totals reflect confirmed cases, but Henry noted Thursday that serology testing suggests roughly eight times as many people in some parts of the province have actually had the virus.

The Ocean Futures Innovation Hub is intended to position Victoria at the forefront of the marine industry in Canada, acting as an incubator for upstart marine-focused companies and research.

The project is a joint endeavour with the South Island Prosperity Partnership and is a key part of the City of Victoria's long-term economic plan known as Victoria 3.0.

The city has now issued a request for proposals to develop a plan for the maritime centre in downtown Victoria.

""This initiative will lead to the growth of a strong regional ocean and marine ecosystem that supports business needs throughout the innovation continuum,” said Alex Rueben, executive director of the Association of BC Marine Industries, in a statement Friday.

""It will foster an entrepreneurial environment conducive to innovation, growth and global competitiveness,"" Rueben added

The city says the Ocean Futures Innovation Hub plan garnered overwhelming support from industry during a Victoria 3.0 roundtable last fall.

""Along with providing shared resources, a space for collaboration and educational events, the Ocean Futures Innovation Hub is an accelerator and incubator, offering critical business resources and mentorship needed for early-stage companies to grow,” said Julie Angus, CEO of Open Ocean Robotics.

Some say the innovation hub will be a crucial stepping stone away from a tourism-dependent economy in a post-COVID-19 world.

""Victoria harbour and the marine highway are strategic assets that are unique to our region,” said Sage Berryman, co-CEO Ralmax Group of Companies. “The Oceans Futures Innovation Hub has the potential to be the cornerstone of the region’s pathway to post COVID-19 economic recovery.”

Members say they are hoping to bring change to the province’s medical cannabis system.

“This is a complicated political chess game that we’re engaged in that’s never been done before,” said Ted Smith, founder of the Victoria Cannabis Buyers Club.

“Trying to get our club an exemption is a difficult and tricky path.”

Smith says the club needs an exemption from Health Canada in order to continue operating as a non-profit.

According to Smith, the Victoria Cannabis Buyers Club, which was founded in 1996, offers a wide range of medical cannabis products to its 8,000 members at a lower price than retailers.

One of those members, Suzan L’heureux, says the service the club provides is crucial for members like her.

“I used to go to a little store and it was $29 for these joints I use to get. Now they’re $63, so that’s a big jump when you don’t have money, you’re sick and you’re struggling,” said L’heureux.

The Victoria Cannabis Buyers Club was first raided by the B.C. government in November. After that first raid, Victoria city council sent a letter to the provincial government asking that the club be exempt from the current laws around the sale of pot.

Now, the club hopes the city will support them again.

“(We’re hoping) to get the city council to pass a motion to go to the federal government now to push for a meaningful dialogue to get an exemption for our club,” said Smith.

Smith says he’s tried to reach out to the federal government on his own but has heard nothing back.

“I’m already trying to get my head around how to crack Health Canada open here but they’re so far away and so caught up in other matters it’s going to be tough,” he said.

In March, Parks Canada was forced to close access to the popular tourist spot, as well as all back-country camping in the Gulf Island National Park reserve, due to COVID-19 concerns. On Wednesday, Parks Canada announced it was reopening the park on Sidney Island for day use and overnight camping.

Starting July 20, day-users and overnight campers are permitted to access the national park by using their own vessel or the open-air catamaran that serves as a ferry to the island. The parks service also announced that Sidney Whale Watching would be the contractor operating transportation services to Sidney Spit.

“The priority for us this year is to get the service up and running,” said Sidney Whale Watching owner Michael Child.

“We want to have a consistent service for folks that want to get over there for the remainder of the summer.”

As a result of COVID-19 protocols, the ferry operator has been working closely with WorkSafeBC and Parks Canada to resume service to Sidney Island. In order to maintain physical distancing on the 45-foot catamaran, Child says passenger capacity will be reduced from 41 to 31 for the 20-minute trip.

“We’re going to start at a significantly reduced capacity to make sure people can feel comfortable on the trip over,” said Child. “We are going to have more spacing on the boat and we have some physical barriers up on the boat as well.”

With more than 40 campsites and white sand beaches, Sidney Spit offers an opportunity to get away while staying close to home during the pandemic.

“Its one of the prettiest islands off the west coast of B.C. in my opinion,” said Child.

“What really makes Sidney Island special is it’s got these beautiful white sand beaches and we always joke that it is a Caribbean island in Canada.”

Child says after a short ferry ride across the Sidney Channel, families can enjoy a long sandy beach that stretches into the sea. They can also enjoy hiking trails found across the island that lead to places like the Sidney Lagoon, the spit’s lighthouse and the site of an old brick and tile company.

“We’re really looking forward to getting the service back up and running,” said Child. “I know [Parks Canada] will be happy to have guests back over there for the remainder of the summer.”

Child notes that people should be advised that Sidney Spit is a “pack-in, pack-out” park. There are no services on the island so park users are required to bring all the supplies they need for their stay and take it with them when they leave.

Access to the park is by reservation only. The ferry departs from the Sidney Whale Watching dock located on the Town of Sidney waterfront at the foot of Beacon Avenue. The ferry to the park will make four round trips per day, seven days a week, starting at 9:30 a.m.

“There is a pent-up demand to get out and enjoy the outdoors given the time of year and with people being cooped up so long,” said Child. “I think there is going to be some excitement around this, I know we’re excited about it ourselves.”

Monday will also mark the reopening of all back-country camping areas in the Gulf Islands National Park reserve. All visitors are reminded to bring a “clean trip kit” including hand sanitizer and a tablecloth for those using a picnic table.

“We have been working on the project now for almost four years and we’re on track to meet that regulatory deadline for treatment by the end of the year,” said Elizabeth Scott, deputy project director with the CRD’s Core Area Wastewater Treatment Project.

“We’re very pleased to be where we are and excited to be so close to the finish line.”

It has been a massive undertaking, coming in at just over three-quarters of a billion dollars and claiming the title of the largest infrastructure project ever in the CRD.

Once the tertiary treatment plant is completed, your sewage will still pass through two existing pump stations on its way to the new Mcloughlin Point Wastewater Treatment Plant. The two stations are located at Clover Point and Macaulay Point, and have both been expanded, rebuilt and rerouted.

“What we’ve done at these pump stations is upgrade them so that they include screening and de-gritting,” said Scott.

At those pump stations, waste runs through a machine that separates large solids from liquids. That liquid is then pumped through 35-kilometres of piping across the CRD until it reaches the new treatment plant, where it will receive the royal treatment.

It’s a three-stage treatment process beginning with primary treatment.

“That’s a physical process where you separate out the solids,” said Scott. “You basically allow heavier solids to settle out in giant tanks.”

Then, the waste passes on through to the secondary process, which is a biological process. During this step, micro-organisms breakdown some of the dissolved and suspended solids.

Finally, waste will then pass through tertiary treatment, which is when the effluent passes through a five-micro disc filter.

“The cumulative impact of those three stages is that you’ve removed and completely eliminated many pharmaceuticals, compounds of emerging concern and contaminants,” said Scott.

The CRD’s waste system will soon exceed provincial and federal regulations, which only require secondary treatment.

The last step before sewage makes its way to the ocean includes a two-kilometre journey down an outflow pipe. The waste is then sent down to a depth of 60 metres, where the treated water will be discharged into the ocean.",[]

The Island Discovery, which sails the waters between Powell River and Texada Island, was removed from service on Wednesday morning after a mishap occurred while crews were working on the vessel Tuesday night.

According to BC Ferries spokesperson Deborah Marshall, the problem is comparable to a problem with an electrical breaker in a house.

""A piece of equipment got damaged during the maintenance work, so it wasn't that the ship had an issue before the damage was caused,"" Marshall said Thursday.

Repairs were attempted Wednesday night but were unsuccessful. Crews are now waiting for a replacement part to be delivered and installed.

""What I'm told is the actual fix or the switching out of the switchboard isn't a big deal, it's actually getting our hands on the part,"" Marshall said.

The service interruption for the vessel, which only went into service on the route a month ago, is being criticized by some ferry users on social media.

Cindy Babyn, president of the Texada Island Chamber of Commerce, says the group's members are concerned.

""The chamber's been made aware that losing our Island Discovery has affected people trying to get their business done in Powell River for sure"" Babyn said.

She said islanders are happy to see the replacement Salish Orca stopping off at Texada during its runs between Comox and Powell River but the infrequency of getting vehicles and off the island is causing lengthy delays.

BC Ferries has also brought in a water-taxi service to transport foot-passengers between Texada and Powell River.

""Yes the water taxi is a very helpful way of crossing, however there are many entrepreneurs who need to use their vehicles to get to work and doing deliveries and other things so we really do require a ferry with vehicle accessibility,"" Babyn said.

BC Ferries also attempted to service the route with a different vessel, the Quadra Queen II, but incompatibility issues with the ramp and the stand-by vessel prevented that from happening.

The replacement part and a duplicate are being sourced from within Canada and in Europe where the Discovery and two other identical vessels were constructed. Marshall said whichever part arrives first will be installed.

There is currently no estimated time of arrival for when the Island Discovery will be returned to service. It is currently docked at Saltery Bay, awaiting the replacement part.

The North Island Princess, which previously sailed the Powell River-to-Texada route, is currently docked at the company's refit facility in Richmond and is up for sale.",[]

Premier John Horgan said Thursday the federal government’s newly announced Canada Safe Restart Plan will be crucial for the province’s recovery amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

Through the Canada Safe Restart Plan, the federal government has promised to disperse $19 billion to all provinces and territories to support safe economic restarts.

While Horgan did not specify how much of that total is being allocated to B.C., he said that a 50/50 cost-sharing program has been established to help support the province’s public transit system, childcare system, as well as individual municipalities.

The premier estimates that B.C.’s transit system will need roughly $600 million to “get back on track” due to decreased ridership amid the pandemic.

He adds that municipalities also saw dramatic drops in revenue, which can impact the services they provide, like community programs and recreation centres.

Horgan says the federal government has been a “receptive partner” when the province put forward its calls for financial support.

Alarming overdose report

On Thursday, the BC Coroners Service announced that June was the deadliest month in the province’s history for overdose deaths.

Horgan says that the B.C. government is working to address both the COVID-19 pandemic and the overdose crisis across the province.

The provincial government plans to build more treatment spaces and “remove barriers” to addiction recovery, with a greater focus on health-care rather than prosecution.

“The people who are addicted to opioids are not criminals, they’re patients,” he said.

Horgan said that while access to illicit drugs may be founded in a ""criminal element,"" those who face addiction challenges should not be considered criminals.

He added that he continues to support the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police’s call to decriminalize illicit drugs for personal use.

The BC Coroners Service says that 175 people died of illicit drug toxicity deaths in June. Meanwhile, a total of 189 have died of COVID-19 since the pandemic began months ago.

Horgan addressed concerns that the B.C. government was placing an unfair emphasis on the coronavirus pandemic, rather than the overdose epidemic.

“I want British Columbians to know that we are not abandoning them on this question,” he said.

The premier said that the number of deaths related to both health crises is “coincidental” and that the dangers of the coronavirus can erupt in a more widespread way than the overdose epidemic.

“These are two separate things,” he said. “We have an insidious virus that effects anyone at anytime and we have an opioid crisis that impacts people using drugs.

“The COVID-19 crisis is a global crisis. We’ve already seen in the United States what happens when you don’t follow basic guidelines,” he said.

While the pandemic is ongoing, Horgan says that health officials continue to address the overdose crisis.

He noted that when he hired provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry, one of her first tasks in the position was to help establish a provincial safe drug supply.

Horgan said Thursday that he plans for B.C. “to wrestle (the overdose crisis) to the ground, just as British Columbians collectively have wrestled COVID-19 to the ground.”",[]

The province says the Chinese Canadian Museum will be the first in the country's history, with a provincial hub in Vancouver's Chinatown and several regional branches throughout B.C.

The $10-million investment includes $2 million for planning and development work, and $8 million to establish an endowment and provide ongoing support.

""We've been working closely with the community for years and it has told us how important this museum is for everyone in B.C.,"" said Premier John Horgan in a statement Thursday.

""We are at a critical point when it comes to conversations about race, inequality and injustice in this province. Now is the time to come together to share the stories about how our province got to where it is – and to have conversations about where we want it to go,"" the premier added.

In addition to the Vancouver hub and regional branches, the province says the museum will include an online portal and ""digital experiences"" centred around locations across B.C.

A newly formed, non-profit Chinese Canadian Museum Society of British Columbia will lead development and operate the museum, the province says. The society's inaugural board is made up of 20 members, including representatives from both the provincial government and the City of Vancouver.

The society is chaired by Grace Wong, a former senior advisor to the University of British Columbia's provost office.

The society plans to kick off the museum initiative with a temporary exhibit at 27 E. Pender St. in Vancouver in August. The exhibit, titled A Seat at the Table, will explore the history of Chinese immigration and is a partnership with the City of Vancouver, UBC and the Museum of Vancouver.

The society has also signed a memorandum of understanding with the newly formed Victoria Chinatown Museum Society for the first regional hub and the launch of a pocket gallery in Victoria's historic Fan Tan Alley.

The pocket gallery is anticipated to open in time for the recognition of Chinese Cultural Heritage Week from July 20 to 27.

""Now more than ever, we need to come together and learn from each other,"" said B.C. Tourism Minister Lisa Beare. ""People told us they want a museum to showcase the diversity of Chinese Canadian history and culture, past and present. This museum will help foster a more inclusive society.""",[]

“She had the neatest miniskirt in the world,” Al recalls with a smile. “I fell instantly in love with her!”

Pat felt an immediate connection with Al too.

“He was such a kind and loving person,” Pat says. “He would do anything for me and anyone else.”

They got married six weeks later, on Friday the 13th. It was the only day the church was free.

“So [now] we actually celebrate on any Friday the 13th in the year,” Pat smiles. “There’s usually two of them.”

They’ve been lucky in love for 47 years. Although Al hasn’t been so fortunate in health.

“I felt wonky,” Al describes his early symptoms. “Not exactly a clinical term, but I felt wonky.”

His body was wonky and his mood too. Pat started writing reminders for him on a whiteboard so Al wouldn’t get confused. And then after an unrelated surgery Al was suddenly far more than wonky.

“It was like a totally different person when he came out of that,” Pat says.

Al was diagnosed with Lewy body dementia. Pat became his primary caregiver. They managed OK, until the pandemic shut down their respite support.

“He really went downhill very quickly,” Pat says. “And I went down with him.”

The situation was looking bleak. Then one day, Pat discovered the whiteboard looking anything but.

“He had taken it and coloured the whole thing in permanent marker,” she laughs.

He wrote ‘Pat is Amazing’ and surrounded the message with shapes and colours.

The man who’d never done anything creative in his life suddenly felt compelled to make art.

“It was a release,” Al explains. “This is a medium for me to be able to express myself.”

After Pat bought her husband a bunch of multi-coloured markers, Al started expressing himself multiple times a day. He hasn’t stopped for months.

“It was life-altering,” Pat smiles. “It’s so wonderful for him.”

It’s transformed their living room into Al’s ever-expanding art gallery. There are currently 113 of the eclectic and bright posters hanging on three of the room's four walls.

They all feature recognizable phrases radiating with vibrant colours. They range from Dr. Bonnie Henry’s motto (“Be Kind. Be Calm. Be Safe.”) to novelty song titles (""Purple People Eater"") to unexpected observations (""Dear Fly, Nobody Likes You"").

“You need to be able to laugh,” Pat says, remembering when Al debuted the fly poster. “I think I’d lost my laughter for a while.”

Now they’ve found that’s one of the secrets to staying lucky through so many unlucky Fridays.

Perhaps the other secret is celebrating the positive. Most of Al’s work features messages like, ""Follow your Bliss,"" ""Never Give Up,"" and ""Carpe Diem.""

“Sometimes its hard to find,” Pat says. “But there’s always a sliver lining.”

“No matter how difficult the time is,” Al says. “You can overcome.”",[]

The married father of two young children disappeared mysteriously on May 16, 2018, leaving his work van idling on the side of Cowichan Lake Road.

Hundreds of volunteers helped with the search effort that stretched into the fall. But the search ended in despair when he was found dead by suicide.

His wife, Tonya Kilmer, vividly recalls her shock when police told her the news at the family’s home.

“My heart just sank,” she recalled Tuesday. “Why are you here? How can you be here? How is this even possible? And it was the last thing that I would have thought – I was sure that Ben was still out there.”

In the 27 months since his death, Tonya has focussed on finding answers to those questions and to trying to understand why the man she loved — who had no family history of mental health problems and no diagnosis of mental illness — took his own life.

She says financial stress piled up over the family home Ben was building, leading to insomnia, and a cycle of worry over the course of seven months.

Initially, her husband was reluctant to ask for help, either with his mounting anxiety or the financial struggle triggering it.

Tonya says she doesn’t want to see other families go through the same pain.

“Just don't let pride get in the way of seeking help, of getting that help that is needed,” Tonya says.

The day Ben disappeared, his last phone call was to his counsellor, who couldn’t pick up because he was with a patient.

Tonya wants others feeling acute desperation to know that they can always 911, and police will help with mental health calls.

It’s a call he didn’t make, but one she thinks might have saved Ben’s life, a man she remembers as a true adventurer who loved dearly his family and loved being outdoors with them.

“A man who lived every moment to the fullest,"" she remembers. ""A man who loved living outdoors and being active with his family. A man who loved with his whole heart.”

Tonya says she’s motivated to come forward now and speak out about Ben’s life and death because of the stress many are feeling during the COVID-19 pandemic.

She’s sharing her story with a Cowichan Valley-based podcast called Obstacle Course Podcast, beginning Wednesday over three episodes.

The podcast is a not-for-profit effort by John Close and Andrew Langford. It focuses on people overcoming adversity.

The three episodes with Tonya look at what led to Ben’s death and how it could have been avoided.

“What was it that led to Ben being compromised like he was?” says Close. “And more specifically, how can we prevent this from happening too somebody else?”

“We go into darkness and try and shed light,” says Langford.

Two years after she lost the man she called her rock, Tonya is working to shed light on his death, so that it wasn’t in vain.",[]

The transportation ministry has awarded contracts to build a retaining wall along a section of Highway 14 that was cut to a single lane after a slide in 2018 just east of Port Renfrew.

Work on the 5.3-million dollar upgrade should wrap by next summer, while Part Two of the project starts in the spring and will repair a 500-metre section of road base -- with completion also expected next June.

Several fatal crashes have occurred along the narrow, twisting and busy highway that links Sooke to Port Renfrew and is the only route to popular tourist spots like Mystic and Sombrio beaches and French Beach Provincial Park.

So, laying eyes on a white whale swimming next to its traditionally black family members should be even more rare. While it is uncommon to see, a researcher says Tl'uk, a white orca living near the waters off Vancouver Island, isn't that hard to find.

""Chances are good you'll see it,"" said Fisheries and Oceans Canada researcher Jared Towers. ""But remember that whales need their space.""

Towers has watched something truly rare in his career on the ocean.

In 2018 he was one of the first Canadian scientists to confirm a white Bigg's killer whale had been born into the B.C. population.

According to Towers this white whale is one of only four or five ever recorded in Canadian Pacific waters.

Known by scientists as T046B1B, the nearly two-year-old orca also goes by Tl'uk. In the Indigenous language of the Coast Salish people, it roughly translates as “Moon.”

Ever since the little white whale was first spotted off Vancouver Island, it’s been making consistent appearances in videos and pictures.

Federal scientists say he is gaining weight, hunting with his family group and generally thriving.

“Yes, the whale is doing very well,” said Towers, who spotted Tl’uk as recently as last week near Alert Bay.

“It's seen very often around Vancouver Island and I expect it will continue to be seen as its family has a long sightings history around here.”

Born into a family which is apparently not afraid of the limelight, DFO researchers say it’s important to be inspired by the white whale and his family, but to do so at a great distance.

New federal regulations mean vessels must be 400 metres away from killer whales once they are spotted.

Marine operators with special permits can come as close as 200 metres, however.

Tl’uk is part of the Bigg's killer whale populations which, are known as transient orcas.

Unlike their salmon-eating cousins, the southern resident killer whales, Bigg's killer whales are thriving with new births and large family groups.

Southern resident killer whales are severely endangered with only 72 known individuals.

Bigg's killer whales swim the waters of eastern and western Vancouver Island and have been spotted as far north as Alaska.",[]

The barracuda was hauled up on July 5 by Tyler Vogrig and his father, Brian, who were aboard their fishing vessel conducting a stock of assessment of salmon for Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO).

The 24-year-old Vogrig, who's been fishing with his father since he was 14 years old, says his dad noticed the large predatory fish in their net was being followed by some seals.

Vogrig says the fish was docile when he pulled it up with a hand net and placed it in the ship's revival tank for about 20 minutes while his father contacted the DFO to find out what to do with it.

Once the barracuda was revived, it was released back into the ocean.

""I've been a fishing buff my whole life and I get excited when I see rare animals like this,"" says Vogrig.

""It's our responsibility to make sure the animal's OK and it's our job to make sure the animals are returned back into the water.""

Richard Dewey, the associate director of science with Ocean Network Canada, says the barracuda discovery is consistent with the sporadic trend of warm-water species showing up off the coast of B.C. as water temperatures increase due to climate change.

""They do come up, these rare species, periodically,"" says Dewey. ""It's not completely unheard of, but it's a trend we want to continue to monitor.""

Barracuda are known to be an aggressive and fast-moving fish with a high metabolism, therefore needing to consume a lot of prey. It's the same prey that native species like salmon depend on.

Dewey says barracuda travel in large packs, so if one was caught, there are likely more off the B.C. coast.

""As the climate shifts and these ecosystems perhaps shift further northward – which is an anticipated consequence of climate change – then we would expect see perhaps more encroachment of these warmer species more regularly and in higher numbers,"" he says.",[]

At its global premiere in Yokohama, Japan, the new vehicle, ""Ariya"" was billed as ""a new chapter for Nissan."" The event was held online because of the coronavirus pandemic.

""I can tell you this is a no-compromise car,"" Nissan Chief Executive Makoto Uchida said, stressing the Ariya symbolizes the company turning a new leaf in its business, culture and products.

""You have to drive it to feel it,"" said Uchida.

The Ariya is set to go on sale in Japan by the middle of next year, and in Europe, North America and China by the end of 2021.

It will cost about 5 million yen (US$46,000) and will be competing against the Tesla Model Y, which now sells for between $43,690 and $53,690 in the U.S., including incentives and other cost-savings of $6,300. In the U.S., the Ariya will qualify for a $7,500 federal tax credit.

The Ariya comes with autonomous driving, so it will park itself and brake on imminent collisions, connect to the net and offer concierge-like services. It also boasts features associated with electric cars, such as quick acceleration and a roomy interior.

The crossover blends the muscle drive of a sport-utility vehicle with the comforts of a regular car and is one category that's selling well even as the pandemic slams auto demand around the world.

Crossover vehicles have accounted for more than 40 per cent of recent U.S. auto sales.

Koji Endo, an auto analyst at SBI Securities, said the big test still lies ahead, because buyers are looking for various features, such as driving performance, resale value and how easy the vehicle will be to recharge.

""But it's clear this is Nissan's chance to patch up its totally devastated brand image,"" Endo said in a telephone interview.

He believes Tesla fans tend to be so loyal the Ariya won't lure them away, but it might appeal to new buyers.

""Expectations can't be higher for Nissan. If it can't pull this one through, it's in pretty serious trouble,"" Endo said.

Nissan's profits have tumbled, sinking into a 671.2 billion yen, or $6.2 billion, loss for the fiscal year that ended in March, its first red ink in 11 years.

The Ariya is that one bright spot in recent Nissan news dominated by the dramatic saga of Ghosn's run-in with the law and his escape last year to Lebanon.

Chief Operating Officer Ashwani Gupta called it ""a catalyst for change"" at Nissan.

More people see charging a car as everyday, like charging a mobile phone, and so range is becoming less of a concern, he told reporters.

The Ariya's driving range on a single charge will be between 430 kilometres (267 miles) and 610 kms (379 miles), depending on the type of battery and whether the model has a two-wheel or four-wheel drive.

Going electric is becoming increasingly attractive as people become increasingly worried about global warming, the environment and sustainability. Electric cars can get subsidies from various governments, including China and the U.S., the two biggest markets, as well as European nations like Norway.

Uncertainty remains over how Nissan will fare without Ghosn, who spear-headed its move into electric cars while leading the automaker for nearly two decades.

Ghosn was arrested in Tokyo in late 2018 and charged with under-reporting future compensation and breach of trust. Ghosn says he is innocent, arguing the charges were concocted to drive him out of Nissan leadership. Japanese authorities are now trying to get the U.S. to extradite two Americans suspected of helping him escape while he was out on bail.",[]

Sales of battery-powered and hybrid cars have held up better than the overall market amid a deeply painful recession, mainly thanks to the action of governments.

The 27-country European Union is moving ahead with a major shift in transportation as part of the bloc's efforts against climate change. Under regulatory pressure carmakers are rolling out a slew of new electric models so they can meet tougher limits on greenhouse gases that come into full force next year.

Battery-only models are becoming more affordable, especially as sales are supported by substantial government subsidies. As sales of internal combustion cars have fallen, demand for battery-only cars and hybrids that combine electric motors with conventional engines has been stable or even increased, recent statistics show. By contrast, electric car adoption is moving more slowly in the U.S. due to regulatory uncertainty.

The market share of battery and hybrid vehicles rose sharply across major European markets during the first half of the year, even as the outbreak closed showrooms in March and April. Germany saw an increase to 8.4% from 3.4% a year earlier as overall sales of all car types slumped 35%. France saw the plug-in share jump to 9% from 2.5%. Sweden saw a surge to 25%, from 10%.

One of the pandemic car buyers was Frank Schendel, a dentist from a small town outside the Bavarian city of Augsburg. In May he bought a battery-powered Hyundai Kona Elektro, a compact SUV-style hatchback. He had rented a Tesla on vacation for a couple of days.

""My son is getting his driver's license at the moment, and a Tesla is bit too expensive and too fast, so I was glad to discover the Hyundai Kona,"" he said.

He hasn't driven his 10-year-old Mercedes E-Class station wagon since. ""It's fun, fast and quiet, technologically up to date,"" said Schendel, 52. ""We drive the Kona everywhere: 500 kilometres to visit grandma, grocery shopping. We do every trip with the Kona.""

The 64 kilowatt-hour battery has a range of up to 484 kilometres, enough to reach grandma with just one stop at a highway charging station.

Electric car buyers are attracted by large government incentives. Under the German government's latest stimulus package, for example, an electric car with a price tag under 40,000 euros is eligible for a 9,000-euro incentive, 3,000 euros of that to be paid by the manufacturer.

Car buyers now have 70 different battery and hybrid models to choose from, with prices starting below 20,000 euros including those local subsidies in the case of the Seat Mii, the Renault Twingo ZE, and the Skoda CITIGOe IV. Volkswagen says it will start delivering its ID.3 battery hatchback by year end, starting under 30,000 euros.

""The demand is growing fast, very fast,"" said Juergen Sangl, an auto dealer in the town of Landsberg am Lech who sold Schendel his Kona. Sangl decided in 2016 to anticipate the trend and focus on electrics, which are 90% of his business. ""It has gone the way I suspected it would - first a trickle, now a flood,"" he said. Beyond the incentives, customers find electrics more attractive once range exceeds 300 kilometres (186 miles) on a charge.

The pandemic has nonetheless caused huge pain for carmakers. Daimler AG, maker of Mercedes-Benz luxury cars, says it will intensify cost-cutting efforts. ""Our previous efficiency goals covered the upcoming transformation, but not a global recession,"" said Daimler CEO Ola Kallenius.

Automakers in the EU need to reduce the average emissions of their fleets to 95 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometre driven starting next year. That's equivalent to 57.4 miles per gallon of gasoline.

To achieve that, manufacturers will have to lift electric sales from 7% to 12% of the market, according to advocacy group Transport & Environment. The new limit is part of the EU effort to comply with the 2015 Paris climate accord to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, blamed by scientists for global warming and accompanying climate change.

The U.S., with cheap gasoline and a federal government that wants to roll back fuel economy requirements, is lagging the rest of the world in electric vehicle sales and launches. But since automakers have to develop vehicles to sell globally, and some companies see electric cars as the future, the U.S. is starting to get more models. General Motors CEO Mary Barra has promised an ""all-electric future,"" with the company developing 20 electric models to sell globally by 2023.

President Donald Trump wants to roll back automotive fuel economy requirements enacted when Barack Obama was president. But the rollback has been challenged in court and it's uncertain which standards automakers will have to meet. If Trump loses the election in November, it's possible that Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic candidate, could reimpose the Obama-era standards.

Last year, automakers sold 236,000 fully electric vehicles in the U.S., only 1.3% of the 17.3 million new vehicles that were purchased.

In China, a reduction in subsidies led to a slowdown in electric sales late last year, but the government is moving ahead with its requirement for more low-emission vehicles over the long term. Electrics were 4.9% of the market.

Saul Lopez, e-mobility manager at Transport & Environment, said that European automakers appear on track to meet the C02 goals. He noted, however, that carmakers often seem eager to sell enough cars to meet the requirement, but not much more. Some electrics have sold out.

The reason: ""The carmakers make poor margins on electric vehicles, and good margins on SUVs,"" he said: ""At the end of the day, it's a compliance-driven market.""

One of those was the Toyota Highlander.

But now Toyota is countering with its fully redesigned 2020 Highlander, which starts the model's fourth generation. The new Highlander has more cargo capacity, a nicer interior and new technology features. But is it enough to unseat the Kia Telluride?

COMFORT AND REFINEMENT

Both SUVs seat up to eight passengers or seven people if you opt for the available second-row captain's chairs. Go this route and you get second-row seats that are almost as comfortable as the front seats.

The big difference in this category comes down to third-row seating. The Telluride's third-row seat has more comfortable padding and a higher seat cushion height. In the Highlander, the rearmost passengers -- particularly if they are adults -- will feel cramped in comparison.

As for interior design, Edmunds experts find the Telluride's dashboard more cohesive-looking than the Highlander's. Both have easy-to-use controls; it's just that the Telluride is a little more stylish going about it. The materials quality feels slightly better in the Telluride, with a higher-grade leather and more consistent craftsmanship.

Winner: Telluride

CARGO SPACE

The Telluride can hold up to 21 cubic feet behind its third row, while the Highlander is limited to 16 cubic feet. That's enough of a difference to allow you to fit the equivalent of a couple extra carry-on suitcases in the Telluride. The advantage swaps if you fold those third-row seats down; the Toyota can hold 48.4 cubic feet to the Kia's 46 cubic feet. The maximum cargo capacity with the second and third rows stowed leans back in favour of the Telluride's 87 cubic feet to the Highlander's 84.3 cubic feet.

Winner: Telluride

THE DRIVING EXPERIENCE

The Kia Telluride and Toyota Highlander are essentially neck and neck in regard to performance specifications. Both have a standard V6 engine that provides about 290 horsepower, and both offer optional all-wheel drive. In Edmunds' testing, these SUVs accelerated from 0 to 60 mph in 7.5 seconds, which is an average time for this class of vehicle. Around town, however, the Highlander feels a little quicker to respond from when you put your foot on the accelerator to when the vehicle begins to move.

Braking power is also similar, though the Telluride needed about 10 fewer feet to perform a maximum-braking stop from 60 mph. Both SUVs are surprisingly capable on a winding road and give you confidence in their handling abilities. Overall, the majority of drivers will find both SUVs equally easy and pleasurable to drive.

Winner: Tie

VALUE PROPOSITION

The 2020 Kia Telluride and Toyota Highlander are similarly equipped in their base trim levels, though the Kia's US$33,060 starting price (including destination) is $2,660 less than the Toyota's $35,720. The Telluride's price advantage increases as you progress through higher-trimmed models.

Comparable trim levels for the Telluride also typically comes with an extra feature or two that might not become available until a next-step-up Highlander. For example, the Telluride's base LX trim starts you out with simulated leather upholstery. To get the same feature in the Highlander -- instead of cloth -- you have to move up to the midgrade XLE.

As for fuel economy, the EPA estimates the front-wheel-drive Telluride gets 23 mpg in combined city/highway driving; the front-drive Highlander gets 24 mpg. Toyota also produces a Highlander Hybrid estimated to get 36 mpg. Kia doesn't currently offer a hybrid version of the Telluride.

Toyota's reputation for reliability is often an enticement for car shoppers, though real-world longevity is affected by many external influences. Kia, for its part, offers a more generous warranty to potentially ease your mind. You get five years or 60,000 miles of bumper-to-bumper coverage compared to Toyota's more typical three years and 36,000 miles. Kia's powertrain warranty is longer too. You do save a bit of money for maintenance on the Highlander, however. Toyota also includes the first two years of scheduled maintenance for free.

Winner: Telluride

EDMUNDS SAYS: The 2020 redesign of the Toyota Highlander represents a marked improvement over its predecessor. Its greatest liability is its limited third-row seat space, but it's otherwise a strong choice in its class. Overall, however, the Telluride is a comprehensively better SUV at a more accessible price.

410,410,410,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/sports/after-25-years-the-ford-bronco-is-back-1.5023671,"After 25 years, the Ford Bronco is back",'Peter Valdes-Dapena',2020-07-14,"It's been 25 years since the last Ford Bronco was made. Ford is bringing the brand back, with the unveiling of three new off-road-oriented SUVs under the Bronco name.

At an online event Monday night, Ford introduced the 2021 Bronco, which will come in a two- and a four-door version, and the smaller Bronco Sport. The new Broncos are engineered for hard off-road driving and include features designed to make it easier to get far from civilization and even stay there for a while.

The Bronco, which will come in a two- and a four-door version, and the smaller Bronco Sport will compete directly with Fiat Chrysler's Jeep line of off-road vehicles. The market for rugged SUVs, which Jeep currently dominates, is growing twice as fast as SUVs overall, Ford executives have said.

The larger Broncos will be available with 35-inch off-road tires and will be able to drive through water nearly 3 feet, 10 inches deep. It has independent front suspension, unlike its main competitor, the Jeep Wrangler. Independent suspension, used on almost all modern passenger vehicles, generally provides a smoother ride and better on-road handling than a single solid axle. It still has a solid axle in the back though, like most pickup trucks, a design suited to hard use.

Like the Wrangler, both the two- and four-door Bronco will have a removable roof s and doors. Buyers will be able to choose either a hard roof that can be removed in sections, a cloth top, or both. Unlike the Wrangler, though, the Bronco's doors will fit inside the vehicle after being removed.

The Bronco will be available with a choice of either a 10-speed automatic or seven-speed manual transmission. (The manual transmission will have six gears for ordinary driving, plus a seventh for low speed off-road driving.) It will be powered by either a 270-horsepower 2.3-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine or a 310-horsepower 2.7-liter turbocharged V6.

While all of the new Bronco SUVs are designed for hard off-road use, the Bronco Sport isn't quite as hard-core in its capabilities. It also has more convenience features than the more truck-like Bronco. While it's based on engineering that's similar to car-like crossover SUVs, Ford says that it's still intended for serious off-road use. Ford engineers boasted of the off-road testing the prototypes have been put through, including driving through deep sand, up steep inclines and crawling across boulder-strewn trails.

The Bronco Sport, available only as a four-door SUV, does not offer a removable roof. Instead of competing directly with the Jeep Wrangler, it's aimed more squarely at the Jeep Cherokee Trailhawk. It has a number of features intended to make it an ideal camping vehicle, like standard cargo-carrying roof rails designed to hold a rooftop tent. The rear liftgate has strong spotlights to illuminate the area around the back of the vehicle at night, and a cargo organizer tray in the back can slide out to be used as a table. The back portion of the roof is raised higher than the front, allowing enough room to store two bicycles upright with their front wheels removed.

Inside, there are zippered pockets on the backs of the front seats, as well cloth straps for hanging gear. There are also storage compartments under the back seats.

The Bronco Sport has independent suspension in both the front and back, like most vehicles intended for street driving, however it wil also be able to drive through almost two feet of water, according to Ford. It will have 28.5-inch off-road tires as standard equipment, but special First Edition models will have 29-inch tires with deeper off-road treads.

Buyers will be able to choose from either a 181-horsepower 1.5 liter turbocharged 3-cylinder engine or a 2.0-liter 245-horsepower 4-cylinder engine. Both engines will come with an eight-speed automatic transmission. In some versions, drivers will be able to select gears using steering wheel paddles.

All of the new Bronco models will have selectable driving modes for various terrain. They're called GOAT modes, for ""goes over any type of terrain."" (GOAT was Ford's code name for the original Bronco while it was under development in the early 1960s.) Modes include Normal, Slippery, Mud/Ruts and Rock Crawl.

There's also Trail Control, a sort of cruise control for off-road driving. With this feature, the SUV can move along at a set low speed while the driver can concentrate on just steering the vehicle rather than dealing with the gas and brakes. These sorts of features are available on a number of other off-road SUVs.

Both the Bronco and the Bronco Sport have blocky square-cornered designs that clearly draw from their 1960s predecessors. The shape also provides a real benefit in off-road driving, Ford designers explained. Drivers can easily see the peaks of the front fenders to know where their wheels are, something that's important to know when driving between boulders or around a steep drop-off, a design element that goes back to classic off-road vehicles ranging from the original Land Rover and Mercedes-Benz G-Class as well as classic Broncos. Additionally, an available camera system can provide a front bumper view of the terrain just ahead.

The Bronco Sport will be available later this year. The full-size Bronco won't be available until next spring, but Ford is taking US$100 deposits immediately for both the Bronco and the Bronco Sport. Prices for the Bronco Sport will start at $26,660. Prices for the two-door Bronco will start at about $28,500 and $33,200 for the four-door. Ford has not yet announced pricing for the four-door Bronco or the Bronco Sport.",[]

But instead of hospitality, the pandemic is exposing a glimpse of hostility aimed at those who are assumed to be outsiders.

""Being from Halifax, growing up here all but eight years of my life, I really didn't expect this,” resident Tony Mountenay told CTV News.

Tony and Debbie Mountenay chose to return to Nova Scotia during the pandemic because they were looking for a laid back retirement.

As required, they isolated after they arrived. But then they decided to go out and run errands.

""And we had three different incidents where people came up beside us, yelling at us, through the window, and when it first happened, we had to try to think, well what was that about?” Debbie said.

The answer was the licence plate on their truck — showing that they came from Ontario.

Visitors from beyond the “Atlantic bubble” have been vilified by locals fearing the virus could be imported.

Though relatively rare, there have been incidents of “plate-shaming.”

A woman from Quebec was told to go home while walking on a New Brunswick beach.

More than 15,000 Newfoundlanders signed a petition demanding their province not open the border to anyone.

Debbie said one woman who had harassed the couple had done so in front of her own children.

“She really shouldn't have been doing that in my opinion,” she said. “Another man, you could tell he was out of control.""

The Atlantic bubble, which encompasses the provinces of New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador, is a concept that was introduced recently to allow easier travel between the Eastern provinces as the region reopens.

People from all across Canada are allowed to travel to any Atlantic province, but those outside of the Atlantic bubble must isolate for 14 days — as leaders in the region are quick to remind people.

""The Atlantic bubble is open today, [but] that does not apply to those who are from Ontario, Quebec or Western Canada,” Nova Scotia Premier Stephen McNeil said. “If you're coming into our province, you're required to self isolate as well.""

The Atlantic provinces have largely fared well during the pandemic compared to provinces such as Ontario or Quebec. Of the Atlantic provinces, Nova Scotia has had the most cases in total, at just over 1,000 — a far cry from Quebec’s 56,521 cumulative cases.

The stress for locals in the Atlantic provinces is that out-of-bubble visitors could lead to a second wave of the virus.

Only last week, a string of new cases in Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island were proven to be related to travel from outside of the bubble. One individual flew from the United States to Toronto, and then to Halifax. This case was then connected to cases in Prince Edward Island.

McNeil said on July 6 that he is frustrated with travellers who do not isolate for the 14 days after they arrive.

“We have worked hard together and sacrificed so much in this province to help flatten the curve only to have some people come into our province who think they’re above it all, who think that the rules don’t apply to them,” he said. “Guess what? They do.”

But the Mountenay’s experience in Nova Scotia suggests that the uncertainty over who has isolated and who has not has led to some rather un-neighbourly behaviour.

In response, the couple has come with a way to alert people they’re not a threat. A piece of paper that clearly states a person has completed isolation.

""I don't want to get [COVID-19],” Debbie said. “And I don't want to give it to anybody.""",[]
412,412,412,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/autos/hamilton-wins-styrian-gp-ahead-of-mercedes-teammate-bottas-1.5021012,Hamilton wins Styrian GP ahead of Mercedes teammate Bottas,'Jerome Pugmire',2020-07-12,"SPIELBERG, AUSTRIA -- Lewis Hamilton won the Styrian Grand Prix from pole position on Sunday to clinch an 85th career win and move within six of Michael Schumacher's Formula One record.

Most of Schumacher's wins were during a dominant spell with Ferrari, but his old team is struggling badly. For the second time in the past four races, Charles Leclerc and Sebastian Vettel crashed into each other and went out.

When Hamilton stood on the podium he raised a clenched right fist.

Hamilton's record-extending 89th career pole on a rain-drenched track was one of his best in extreme conditions, but during the race he was hardly challenged as he finished a sizeable 13.7 seconds ahead of Mercedes teammate Valtteri Bottas and 33.7 ahead of Red Bull's Max Verstappen.

Because of social distancing amid the coronavirus pandemic, the drivers on the podium had their trophies delivered by a remote controlled device.

""What a weird year but (it's) great to be back driving with this kind of performance. The team did a fantastic job, it was just for me to bring it home,"" said Hamilton, who finished fourth last week after a time penalty. ""Difficult weekend last weekend but this was a great step forward.""

Montreal's Lance Stroll of Racing Point was seventh, picking up six points. Toronto rookie Nicholas Latifi of Williams Mercedes was 17th.

Bottas won last weekend's season-opening Austrian GP on the same Red Bull Ring track in Spielberg at the foot of the Styrian mountains -- hence the name change.

Despite the sizeable margin of Hamilton's win, Bottas maintains he can challenge for the F1 title. He leads in points 43-37.

""I have no reason to doubt any of my ability or skills. I know what I'm capable of,"" the Finnish driver said. ""I really feel some improvements in my driving since last year that's why I'm confident it will be a good battle for the championship this year.""

Like last Sunday, drivers again wore black T-shirts with ""End Racism"" and most took the knee a few moments before the national anthem.

Red Bull driver Alexander Albon did well to fend off persistent attacks from Racing Point's Sergio Perez and finished fourth ahead of McLaren's Lando Norris and Perez, who dropped to sixth after touching wheels with Albon late on.

McLaren's Carlos Sainz Jr. started from third and finished ninth, but collected a bonus point for the fastest lap.

At the start of the race, Hamilton got away cleanly while Verstappen did well to hold off Sainz.

Leclerc tried to overtake down the right entering a hairpin bend and ended up riding over the back of Vettel's car, mangling his rear wing and prompting a safety car to come out for two laps.

Vettel, who finished 10th last week, had to retire while Leclerc came into the pits on Lap 5 and was soon out of the race.

At last season's penultimate GP in Brazil, both Ferrari cars crashed out. Vettel appeared at fault that time after being overtaken cleanly by Leclerc and trying to regain position.

But this time Leclerc was far too hasty and impatient.

Up ahead, Hamilton was coasting and about five seconds clear of Verstappen when the Dutch driver came in for his first tire change on Lap 25 of 71.

Hamilton came in for fresh tires soon after and then Bottas a few laps later, meaning that by Lap 38 Verstappen was second again -- still five seconds adrift of Hamilton.

Verstappen's front wing was damaged on the right side and, with six laps remaining, his lead over Bottas was down to under a second.

Bottas overtook Verstappen on the next lap but Verstappen regained his position superbly, only to concede it again moments later as Bottas' superior speed proved decisive.

""When Valtteri tried to pass me I tried to make it a bit more difficult,"" Verstappen said. ""The podium is good but there's still a lot of work to do.""

Red Bull showed signs late last season that it was closing the gap on Mercedes, but this time Verstappen is not convinced a serious challenge can be mounted.

""I tried everything I could but it's still not enough,"" Verstappen said. ""As a team we want to win and fight for the championship, and to do that we need to win races.""

Renault driver Esteban Ocon was the other driver not to finish, but teammate Daniel Ricciardo was eighth behind Stroll.

Daniil Kvyat of AlphaTauri rounded out the top ten.",[]

Chairman Carlos Ghosn says he is assisting those who helped him flee from Japan to Lebanon last year but refuses to provide details about the escape, saying such information would endanger them.

In an interview aired late Saturday by the pan-Arab Al-Arabiya TV, Ghosn refused to comment on allegations from prosecutors in the U.S., who said last week that he wired more than US$860,000 to a company linked to one of the men accused of helping smuggle him out of Japan in a box in December.

Michael Taylor, a 59-year-old former Green Beret and private security specialist, and Peter Taylor, 27, are wanted by Japan on charges they helped Ghosn escape the country in December after he was released on bail.

Ghosn was arrested in November 2018 and was expected to face trial in April 2020. He posted 1.5 billion yen ($14 million) bail on two separate instances after he was arrested a second time on additional charges, and released again.

When pressed to speak about the Taylors, who are under arrest in the U.S., as well as others who helped him flee, Ghosn refused to speak about any specific person. He said that after he arrived in Lebanon he vowed not to speak about how he left Japan ""because any statement I am going to make will endanger the people who helped me leave Japan.""

Asked if he is aiding those who helped him get out of Japan, Ghosn said, ""of course."" When asked about the Taylors, Ghosn said: ""You are talking about specific people, and I will not comment. However, I am helping everyone who stood by me as much as I can, financially and in any way I can.""

""I made the entire plan of how to get out, but I needed information and assistance. I am not ready to involve these people at this moment simply by talking about it,"" he said. He is believed to have been smuggled inside a large box.

Ghosn, who holds Lebanese, Brazilian and French citizenship, said the ""only side that stood by me is the Lebanese state. They intervened and they asked the Japanese state, `Why are you doing this to him?""'

Ghosn said that when he arrived in Lebanon, Japan requested the Lebanese government hand him over. ""Lebanon approved, if they receive the case file. They (Japanese) didn't send anything for six months,"" he said.

Earlier this month, a Turkish court released four pilots and a private airline official from jail, pending the outcome of their trial on charges of smuggling Ghosn out of Japan to Lebanon, via Turkey.",[]

In screenshots from a now deleted post, the driver made the unfounded claim that the coronavirus is “not dangerous to those with good immune systems” and that people don’t need a vaccine “that will make us even more sick.” He says he came to these conclusions after doing some ""research.""

“Today, I no longer disinfect my bus because it is a false pandemic in order to better control people,” he wrote.

There is no evidence to support the driver's claim that the COVID-19 pandemic is ""false."" More than 12 million people around the world have become infected with the novel coronavirus; some 548,000 have died.

The Societe de transport de Montreal (STM) said in an email to CTV News that all buses are cleaned daily by maintenance teams, but “of course, we also ask our employees to follow public health and hygiene guidelines.”

The STM took to Twitter to add that ""One bad apple doesn't spoil the bunch."" The agency says it employs 11,000 people, ""and the very vast majority of them are doing a tremendous job following strict measures and recommendations in place since the beginning of the pandemic, to protect clients, colleagues and themselves altogether.""

Though the STM wouldn’t reveal how it intends to move forward with this particular driver, it said “it is our best practice to meet with employees to remind them of the instructions in force.”

A photo posted to the driver’s Facebook page suggests he’s also against the wearing of masks – which is set to become mandatory on all public transit in Quebec as of July 13. When Premier Francois Legault made the announcement last week, he said it would be up to bus drivers to refuse entry to passengers who aren’t wearing masks. No other enforcement measures will be in place.

The driver admitted that at the beginning of the pandemic, he showed up to his shifts 30 minutes early to disinfect his bus.

“I made a barrier to stop passengers from speaking to me… and I washed my hands a minimum of 20 times per day,” his post said. ""But with time, I found that something was wrong.""",[]

Musk, who has made premature predictions about the advent of completely autonomous cars before, offered the updated timetable in a pre-recorded message to a Shanghai tech fair.

""I'm extremely confident that 'Level 5', or essentially complete autonomy, will happen, and I think will happen very quickly,"" Musk said.

""I remain confident that we will have the basic functionality... complete this year.""

In years past, Musk had said Tesla may develop the technology for a completely autonomous vehicle by 2018, and then last year he said it may come by early 2020.

The California-based electric carmaker became the world's most valuable auto manufacturer earlier this month and its shares have soared this year thanks to strong output figures despite disruptions from the coronavirus epidemic.

The complexity and autonomy of self-driving car technology is classified up to ""Level 5"". Lower levels feature some combination of autonomous decision-making by the vehicle, along with as-needed human intervention.

But Level 5 denotes a car that requires no human intervention at any time, allowing the passenger to sleep or watch a movie while the car handles all navigation as well as adjustments to avoid collisions.

Tesla already enables partial autonomy for its cars, but analysts say the road to full autonomy faces considerable legal and regulatory hurdles, not to mention getting consumers to feel comfortable entrusting their cars with full control.

Tesla is racing with Waymo, Uber and traditional automakers to bring autonomous vehicles to market.",[]

Eckert, of Regina Beach, teed off her century year on Thursday after being a member of the golf club for nearly 30 years.

She attributes her love of golf to the people she has met along the way.

“I loved being with the women,” Eckert said of the ladies she would play with. “There was change all the time - not the same ones that I started with. But it was the people.”

The golf game has become a birthday tradition for Eva and her son, Murray. This one was extra special as many of Eva’s family and friends watched and cheered her on during the round.

“It’s a lot of love. It’s a great community out here,” said Murray. “Mom spent a lot of time with golfing with those ladies so a lot of them were here today to wish her a happy birthday. It’s fabulous.”

Beverley Krett has known Eva for more than 30 years and has played golf with her many times. Krett remembered when she provided Eva with a gift of a new set of clubs.

“She was 91 and promptly beat me,” Krett said.

Krett said she has learned a lot from Eva, especially outside the golf course.

Eva taught her “to be kind to people, not to judge people, listen to your intuition and just enjoy life,” she said.

Murray said that even in her old age, his mother is a great golfer.

“She tries to give me lots of tips but I’m not very coachable,” said Murray. “She’s a boring golfer, down the middle. I’m all over the place.”

Eva has taken some valuable lessons from golf into her life. She said there’s no point in getting frustrated when things don’t go her way.

“I think accepting things as they came,” said Eva. “And trying to do the best I could. As far as I know, that’s it.”

She said she believes holding that mentality through life is what kept her life above par.",[]

In a release, the SHA said it has identified additional people with COVID-19 in these areas, as a result of aggressive contact tracing.

While some of those who tested positive are linked to known trains of transmission, others have no known source of infection.

The SHA said this increased level of COVID-19 activity has increased risk of transmission to the public in these parts of Saskatchewan.

The following rural municipalities and areas have increased risk of transmission for the virus:

Maple Creek (No. 111)

Auvergne (No. 76)

Biggar (No. 347)

City of Swift Current

Eagle Creek (No. 376)

Grandview (No. 349)

Newcombe (No. 260)

Perdue (No. 346)

Pleasant Valley (No. 288)

Prairiedale (No. 321)

Tramping Lake (No. 380)

Cases are rising on numerous Hutterite communities in these municipalities. However, there are several other unrelated case increases in these municipalities.

The SHA is working with the Hutterite Safety Council, local Hutterite leadership, local municipalities and the business community to ensure COVID-19 mitigating measures are being taken.

Results from an additional 91 COVID-19 tests from residents in these areas are expected Thursday. More than 160 people are currently undergoing testing in south west and west central Saskatchewan.

The SHA said an increase in cases is expected in the coming days.

SHA is warning of an emergent situation in the southwest and central west areas of the province. The overall increased level in COVID-19 activity means there is an increased risk of transmission to the public in this part of Saskatchewan. https://t.co/1ndyuwqXGU — Saskatchewan Health Authority (@SaskHealth) July 16, 2020

On Tuesday, the SHA announced nine businesses in Swift Current had possibly been exposed to COVID-19, after multiple people tested positive for the virus.

Anyone that develops symptoms of fever, cough, shortness of breath, headaches, aches and pains, sore throat, chills, runny nose or a loss of sense of taste or smell are being asked to protect themselves and others by staying home, self-isolating and getting tested for the virus.

Saskatchewan residents are also being reminded to continue to follow public health orders by physical distancing, implementing proper hand hygiene and limiting the size of indoor and outdoor gatherings.

Here's some Regina activities to break the boredom,,2020-07-14,"REGINA -- COVID-19 has thrown a wrench into most of our Summer vacation plans but that doesn’t mean there aren’t some great things to enjoy right in our own backyard.

Maybe you’ve lived in Regina for years, or you have family coming into town and want to show them around. Remember that many of these places will still have restrictions in place, so it’s always best to check with the site before going to know what their rules are.

With that said, here are ten places (in no particular order) for your Summer stay-cation consideration.

WASCANA CENTRE

The obvious choice is Wascana Park. It’s often described as the jewel of the city. You can walk, run or bike the path around the lake (one way right now, due to COVID-19). Check out the wildlife. Feed the Canada Geese (just not bread, it’s bad for them! Try lettuce!)

Maybe visit the canoe and kayak club, rent a vessel, and head out on the water. There is no swimming allowed. It's a great place for exercise and relaxation!

LEGISLATIVE BUILDING

If you’re already at Wascana Park, don’t overlook the Saskatchewan Legislative Building. It was designed by Edward and William Sutherland Maxwell from Montreal and built between 1908 and 1912 in the Beaux Arts style.

Hutterite colonies with COVID-19 won’t be locked down, for now",,2020-07-16,"REGINA -- Saskatchewan has no plans yet to impose stricter measures on some Hutterite colonies after cases of COVID-19 further surged in their communities.

Speaking with reporters Thursday, Rural and Remote Health Minister Warren Kaeding said even though it’s possible there might be more enforcement if the situation worsens, it’s currently not necessary.

“If we were not getting the co-operation, the tremendous co-operation we have been with Hutterites in particular, we would maybe have to consider something like that,” he said.

On Thursday, the government reported 42 new cases of COVID-19 in the province. The bulk of those cases are located in the south and central regions, with the majority being in Hutterite colonies.

Given the increase, some are questioning why the government won’t lock down communities with higher cases. In the north, non-essential travel was restricted in April after cases increased.

Kaeding said northern communities requested the restrictions. Hutterite colonies, he said, haven’t requested the measure.

“I think with the co-operation and willingness of these communities to work with restrictions and the testing, they have not asked for that to occur,” he said.

Kaeding said he believes the province and communities have done everything they can to be safe.

He said the spread of the virus is difficult to predict.

“I wouldn’t say anything has gone wrong,” he said. “This is a long-term process we have to go through, and we are understanding how this is going to evolve and how this is transmitted.”

Scott Livingstone, the CEO of the Saskatchewan Health Authority, said the Hutterian Safety Council has been working well with the government to contain the spread.

He said health authorities have gone into communities to do more testing and contact tracing. As well, he said colony members have put restrictions on leaving the colony, wearing masks, washing hands and physical distancing.

“Hutterites didn’t bring COVID-19 into Saskatchewan,” he said. “Just like any resident in the province, we have to be aware of what we need to do as individuals and as a community to prevent and mitigate the spread of this disease.”

Livingstone said the spread of COVID-19 will depend on the public continuing to practice safety by physical distancing, wearing masks, hand washing and limiting contact with other people.

“We want to find those cases as quickly as we can and we want to contact trace those cases as quickly as we can,” he said.",[]

In Saskatchewan, 43 per cent of small businesses report normal staffing levels.

The CFIB says fifty five per cent of Saskatchewan businesses with staffing issues say their employees would prefer to stay on the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB).

Nearly half of these Saskatchewan businesses say their employees are concerned for the physical health of themselves and their families with 46 per cent, 27 per cent are dealing with childcare obligations, 14 per cent do not think there are enough working hours available, 18 per cent would prefer to stay on the Canada Emergency Student Benefit (CESB) and five per cent are concerned about taking public transportation.

The CFIB is trying to convince the federal government to make adjustments to the CERB program.

“CERB was created as emergency support for workers who had lost their job due to the pandemic, not to fund a summer break. This is why it is critical that all parties support the government’s proposed change to end CERB benefits when an employer asks a worker to return to work,” said CFIB president Dan Kelly.

The CFIB is encouraging the government to discontinue CERB when a person is offered a job.",[]

Prairiedale (No. 321)

Tramping Lake (No. 380)

Kaeding said some cases are associated with Hutterite communities, and some, more than 10, have been unrelated to these outbreaks.

Testing sites in these areas will work longer hours, Kaeding said, and plans are in place to deploy further testing resources to the areas that need them.

The SHA plans to set up testing sites at the impacted communities.

“We’re on colony, going door to door,” SHA CEO Scott Livingstone said. “It allows us to identify cases early on.”

VISITS RESTRICTED FOR CYPRESS REGIONAL HOSPITAL, LONG-TERM CARE HOMES

The Saskatchewan Health Authority will be temporarily restricting visits to the Cypress Regional Hospital, as well as to long-term care homes located in areas where there is higher risk of getting COVID-19.

The SHA said in a news release Thursday that family members or support people will only be permitted to the hospital for compassionate reasons.

It said no other visits will be allowed, and the restrictions will be in place until further notice.

Regina Police said it was alerted to the incident after the victim escaped from the home, where she alleges she was tied up, confined, assaulted and robbed of personal possessions and a vehicle.

In a release, police said the incident began around 9 p.m. on July 6. The woman allegedly visited the house in the 1200 block of Elphinstone St. with an acquaintance. Once there, she said she was attacked, tied up and assaulted throughout the night.

The suspects also allegedly threatened the victim’s child in an attempt to manipulate her.

The next day, the woman told police she was able to escape the home and contacted help. She sustained physical injuries, along with the emotional trauma.

Investigation led by the Street Gang Unit, along with the Street Crimes Units, resulted in the arrests of two women on July 14.

The Red Lily Leaf Beetle arrived in Montreal in the 1940s, and spread through eastern Canada. It has been spotted in several locations in Saskatchewan in recent years, however Tansey said he hasn’t heard any reports this year.

The beetle - known for its bright red back - eats all parts of the lily plant.

“Pretty much all lilies are on the menu, including the Prairie Lily,” said Tansey.

Local gardening centre, Dutch Growers, said the insects could become a bigger threat in the future.

“It is in Alberta and it is in Manitoba. So, things that are around us tend to eventually make their way here,” said Rachelle Hofmeister with Dutch Growers.

Hofmeister said gardeners should regularly inspect their lilies and if they do see the beetle or its larvae, it’s best to just remove it.

“If you see these, you see damage on your lilies, just squish them with your finger and that should be an effective strategy,” said Tansey.

But wearing gloves is recommended, especially when removing the larvae.

“They do this kind of weird thing where they put a fecal shield overtop of their body, to sort of hide themselves from predators,” said Hofmeister.

You can also put diatomaceous earth around the base of the plant in early spring, which Hofmeister said will dehydrate and kill the beetle, but is safe for other helpful insects.",[]

Carol McCallum runs the Sportsman’s Inn in Glenavon, with her son Chris. She recently received a letter from her insurance broker saying fire and liability coverage on the business will end August 1.

“In the letter it says that being the beverage liability thing and COVID-19, they are just cancelling my insurance,” said McCallum.

The hotel has been insured by Western Financial, through a group plan arranged by the Saskatchewan Hotel and Hospitality Association.

“You can only imagine, you know you’d think that all the things we’re being overwhelmed with regards to you know the pandemic, now we have another priority,” said Jim Bence, with the Saskatchewan Hotel and Hospitality Association.

McCallum has turned to another broker to find coverage but she says no company is willing to ensure the hotel, not even government owned SGI. She cannot operate without insurance.

“You know it just seems to me that the insurance companies are big money, banks are big money. What do you want, the banks to own everything? You know, okay, go ahead take my business,” said MacCallum.

Some small hotels and pubs may be forced to continue business without insurance. However, holding a policy is a mortgage condition and it might not be long before financing is cancelled as well.",[]

Speaking from the Cote-Nord region as part of a tour of Quebec, Legault said after studying the new cases in recent days, the vast majority stemmed from the health network and not from bars. Public health department has still not made a recommendation to close the establishments, he said.

Quebec recorded 141 new cases on Friday, with 78 new cases in Montreal and Monteregie with 33, making up 77 per cent of the new cases in the province. As much as 97 per cent of those cases originated in the health care sector.

""The majority of the cases weren't people who went to bars, but the issue is more private gatherings,"" he said, reminding Quebecers that gatherings of more than 10 people are not permitted, even for backyard parties or barbeques.



As Quebec's annual two-week construction holiday begins, Legault had a massage for would-be partygoers.

""I'm making a special call to Quebecers, it's fun to be a big gang, to celebrate, but it's not the time to do that, '' he said.

Montreal public health officials recorded 30 new cases related to at least nine bars this week, and asked that anyone who worked at or visited a bar in Monteal the tested. The result was hours-long lineups at testing sites, forcing public health officials to open two more clinics.

Legault reminded Quebecers that a new mandatory mask regulation comes into effect Saturday, requiring everyone to wear face coverings in indoor public spaces. In a bar setting, that means wearing a mask into and out of the bar, and when getting up to use the washroom or move about. Masks can be removed when seated at a table, providing people respect the two-metre distance.



He warned that police and inspectors will be deployed throughout the province to ensure the rules are followed.

Legault said the slight uptick in cases in recent days can also be attributed to the number of tests jumping from 8,000 to 15,000 per day, and all health network employees are being tested.",[]

The creditor proposal replaces a shareholder offer as the so-called stalking horse bid, which establishes the minimum conditions to be met for potential rival bids.

The offer by a group of debt holders led by Toronto firm Catalyst Capital Group is valued at approximately US$1.2 billion, according to court-appointed monitor Ernst & Young.

Up to US$375 million will be made available to the Cirque whose operations have ground to a halt because of the COVID-19 pandemic, while two funds totalling US$20 million will be set up to pay money owed to former employees and artisans. The agreement also commits to maintain Cirque's head office in Montreal for at least five years.

Other bidders have until Aug. 18 to submit a fully funded offers that are at least US$1.5 million higher than the creditor bid, under a process overseen by the Quebec Superior Court.

Telecommunications conglomerate Quebecor Inc. says it is no longer interested in participating in the auction, while Cirque founder Guy Laliberte, who sold his stake in February, remains interested.

""In them, we found some of our names, photos, and IP addresses,"" the organizers, who belong to a collective called C’est assez, said in a statement.

C’est assez was created to denounce sexual and psychological abuse following a wave of anonymous allegations on Instagram in Quebec over the past few weeks.

Multiple Instagram accounts created as a safe space for survivors to anonymously share their stories popped up for various Quebec regions.

Montreal’s, in particular, was a place for people to call out alleged abusers in the city’s music, tattoo, and piercings scenes – though the scope expanded as time progressed. The account, called victims_voices_montreal, is where popular TV personality Maripier Morin was called out, as was Simple Plan’s David Desrosiers.

""We’re taking this situation very seriously,"" C’est assez said of the threats that began to circulate online before the event. ""It’s a dark day for history.""

The event, titled Manifestation contre les agressions sexuelles, is currently scheduled to begin at 12 p.m. on Sunday in Montreal’s Parc Lafontaine.

""We need to take a step back and make sure it is truly our voices that will triumph during this day, rather than fear,"" the statement reads.

Despite the pushback, the group says it won’t be bullied into remaining silent.

""We must continue to confront the stereotypes and prejudices that result in some experiences not being considered legitimate,"" the statement says. ""Collectively, we must continue to fight. This demonstration of hate is just another example of daily violence that we are constantly confronted with, that we are denouncing through this new wave.""

The Montreal Instagram account for survivors' stories was deactivated indefinitely after it became difficult to manage, both due to a flood of submissions as well as harsh criticism from some – particularly when stories were posted about alleged abusers who had only been accused by one person.

That being said, accounts for several other Quebec regions – including Quebec City, the Laurentians, Monteregie and Outaouais – remain active, and one for Montreal universities was created just last week.

""We see you and we believe you,"" the page’s author wrote on its first post. The page has received dozens of submissions so far, including accusations against teachers, teaching assistants, students, and a notary.",[]

“It’s very difficult ... when you’re evading and surviving,” Dave MacDonald, founder and lead instructor of the International Canadian School of Survival, told CTV News Channel on Thursday.

“It’s bad enough when you’re just doing the survival on its own without people looking for you, but trying to hide from people and survive is 10 times or 100 times more difficult than sitting static in a position trying to survive.”

MacDonald speculated that Carpentier could be dehydrated by now, noting that finding enough water to drink and staying hydrated in these conditions was difficult if a person was on the move. Under the circumstances, Carpentier could also be suffering from exposure, he added, noting that there could be poisonous plants to deal with, as well as bugs that would come out in full force both in the shade and at night.

Police have been searching for Capentier all week, after the bodies of Romy Carpentier, six, and Norah Carpentier, 11, were found following a three-day Amber Alert. Earlier in the week, police said that the information police had indicated that he was still alive. On Thursday, authorities shared new evidence that suggested Carpentier broke into a trailer the day before, stealing items to aid in his survival. They also said Carpentier could be breaking into cabins and other secluded homes for necessities.

SKILLS NEEDED TO EVADE AND SURVIVE

MacDonald said Carpentier would definitely need shelter, since the temperature drops at night, along with food and water to keep going, and that he would need to be able to start a fire as well as take care of any wounds he may have.

Police said earlier that Carpentier and his daughters were believed to have been in a car crash more than a week earlier before the girls’ bodies were found.

MacDonald was not surprised Carpentier has not been located yet, given the densely forested wilderness the police were searching in.

“It would be a harsh environment,” he said. Still, “It takes quite the skill set to evade for any length of time,” he added. It can be done, but by people with substantial training, luck, and a plan, according to MacDonald.

How much training Carpentier has is unclear. L’Association des Scouts du Canada confirmed that he was a pack scouter with the 128 Charny chapter of the Scouts. The organization told CTV News that they’ve played games in nature and slept outside, but only learned basic survival skills.

Police are using ATVs, drones and K-9 patrols, as well as a helicopter as part of their search for the 44-year-old.

Various police operations are planned from Friday to Aug. 2.

The SQ says Quebec’s construction holidays are when the highest number of fatal collisions occur. Last year, during the two-week period, 15 people were killed in collisions on the police force’s territory.

The increase is likely due to the fact that thousands of Quebecers are on vacation during this period, several of which are travelling to their holiday spots by car.

Even if many people plan to spend their vacations at home this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the SQ says the closure of the US border could result in more cars than usual on Quebec highways.

As far as trails and bodies of water are concerned, the SQ is reminding Quebecers that wearing a helmet is mandatory when driving an ATV and that it is highly recommended to wear life jackets or other flotation devices during boat trips.

Below is the letter in full.

Mr. Premier,

Thirty years ago, Quebec entered one of its worst human, social, and political crises. The climate of violence that we witnessed from July to the end of September 1990 had dramatic consequences, including the death of a serving police officer.

Although the Oka crisis has sadly left its indelible mark in our minds, it can still serve as a reference because nothing has really changed in thirty years. However, the social and political divide between First Nations and part of the Quebec population is the result of decades of injustice and forced measures. It is obvious that subjecting an entire population to such actions can only leave wounds that are still open today. Quebec is no exception in this regard; examples abound around the world.

The AFNQL is addressing you today, publicly, first to respectfully acknowledge the memory of the summer of 1990 and to share with you, as Premier of Quebec, ways to prevent history from repeating itself.

The COVID-19 pandemic, police misconduct of a racist nature, a sad thirtieth anniversary, it is in this sensitive context that the debate on racism and discrimination is resurfacing in Quebec, to which the systemic nature is added, whether we like it or not.

Systemic racism and discrimination are not just concepts or theoretical notions. Rather, they are a set of facts and behaviors and we should not be afraid to name and denounce them if we are genuinely willing to correct them.

From the point of view of the AFNQL, when a people denies the fundamental rights of another on the basis of its race, we are in the presence of racism. When this denial is formally and systematically exercised by a State, we are in the presence of systemic racism and discrimination. Again, let us not be afraid of words. They help us face reality.

We must be reminded that the United Nations adopted the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples more than ten years ago, with the aim of breaking with such behavior and proposing viable solutions to States to redefine their relations with Indigenous peoples on a respectful basis. Moreover, the Declaration called for minimal standards to ensure the survival, the dignity and wellbeing of Indigenous peoples. In our view, the political decisions that led to the Oka crisis are a perfect example of actions to be prohibited under the Declaration.

The lesson could easily have been learned.

Against all odds, through recent court actions, your government is today challenging the fundamental right of First Nations to be self-governing, our right to take charge of our own services for our families and children.

Must we remind the premier that denying our right to self-determination will only make us redouble our collective efforts to ensure that Indigenous peoples get the respect they deserve? Putting so much energy and resources into impeding First Nations' desire to better serve their populations will only exacerbate systemic racism and discrimination.

It is difficult to be optimistic in the search for constructive solutions when the wounds of the relationship that should unite us are still contaminated by contempt.

We need to learn from the past and act to move in the right direction, one that will ensure that there is no turning back on mutually agreed principles. As leaders, we share the duty to find a path that is respectful and beneficial to our respective peoples. It is a matter, Mr. Premier, of willingness.

In Peace and Friendship,

Ghislain Picard, Chief from the Assembly of First Nations Quebec-Labrador",[]
441,441,441,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/business/pattie-lovett-reid-why-not-all-seniors-are-cheering-government-aid-1.5013719,Pattie Lovett-Reid: Why not all seniors are cheering government aid,,2020-07-08,"TORONTO -- Not all seniors are cheering when it comes to government aid.

On the one hand the government is helping high-risk Canadians get through a tough financial situation. Government benefits are seen by many as the financial lifeline they needed as jobs were lost, income reduced and financial futures were put on shaky ground due to the pandemic.

On the other hand the government will be taking back some of the financial lifeline it provided. The government benefits such as the CERB will be taxed and is considered to be income. Some aren't thinking about this today but it will become a issue when 2020 taxes are filed.

Others such as seniors who currently qualify for the Guaranteed Income Supplement are worried government aid might actually compromise their lifestyle. This fear of struggling financially isn't new to seniors who are vulnerable and barely making ends meet. Especially those who collect the Guaranteed Income Supplement and maybe generate a little bit of income from a side hustle yet still manage to come in below threshold limits.

In 2020 seniors are eligible to receive GIS if they are: A single senior with a total annual income of less than $18,600. A couple both receiving Old Age Security and with a combined annual income of less than $24,576.

Fear is mounting among low-income seniors who are receiving government aid and who may also be living in subsidized housing that is income-tested. The government aid they receive via CERB may push them out of the eligibility requirements for relief on rent. If this happens they will be hit twice - potentially higher rent and taxation on the benefit. Add to this the concern the GIS could be clawed, which has some wondering if the government benefit will do more harm than good to their financial situation.

Now to be fair, not all government aid will be taxed. It doesn't apply to the one-time special payment seniors will be receiving this week. To add some context, there are currently 6.7 million seniors who are eligible for the OAS pension and 2.2 million who are eligible for the GIS.

Where it gets sticky is if you are a senior, low income and collecting the GIS, some will still qualify for the government program even if they have a side hustle that brings them in a little extra money. If they are no longer making that little bit of extra money due to COVID-19 they now qualify for the CERB. The problem is that it isn't tax-free money and given the amount it could be more than they were making and push their income higher. This may result in them earning too much to qualify for low-income housing.

As the government views financial aid and those most vulnerable, there is a reasonable expectation and case to be made for exemptions for some low-income seniors collecting GIS and who qualified for CERB So the question is: do they or don't take advantage of the government benefit?",[]

The Surete du Quebec (SQ) says it found evidence on Wednesday night that Martin Carpentier visited an RV trailer located in the 50 sq. km area they’ve been scouring for a week near the town of Saint-Apollinaire, south of Quebec City.

Carpentier, 44, has been missing since July 8 when an Amber Alert was issued for him and his two children, Romy, 6, and Norah, 11. The girls' bodies were found on Saturday, but the search for Carpentier is still underway.

The SQ believes Carpentier may be visiting cabins and other secluded homes for necessities.

“We’re talking about an individual who is probably deprived of means and who is likely looking for materials to ensure his survival,” the SQ communications team said.

The force is asking everyone in the region – particularly, in Lotbinière MRC and the surrounding area – to check their cabins, camps, trailers and other such buildings for traces of break-ins, missing items, or things that may have moved, like clothing, food, and other necessities. Hunters who have hunting cameras are being asked to check their footage.

“Martin Carpentier doesn’t seem to be dangerous...,"" SQ Sgt. Ann Mathieu said during a press briefing on Thursday. ""This person wants to hide himself and wants to assure his survival.""

If residents don't feel comfortable checking their properties on their own, the SQ suggests asking a friend to go with them, or calling 911 to make an appointment with an officer who will accompany them instead.

Anyone with information on Carpentier is being asked to call 911.",[]

Royal Collection Trust, a department of the Royal Household that oversees Windsor Castle, Buckingham Palace and the royal art collection, has started selling premium small-batch London dry gin, retailing at £40.00 (CAD$68) per bottle.

The spirit is infused with 12 different kinds of berries and botanicals hand-picked from Buckingham Palace’s garden, including lemon verbena, hawthorn berries, bay leaves and mulberry leaves.

All sales will go toward the trust, a registered charity, and will help offset an anticipated loss of £30 million (CAD$51 million) this year due to the pandemic.

“For the perfect summer thirst-quencher, the recommended serving method is to pour a measure of the gin into an ice-filled short tumbler before topping up with tonic and garnishing with a slice of lemon,” according to the Royal Collection’s online shop, which also sells tea sets, necklaces made from freshwater pearls and miniature tubes of shortbread cookies advertised as “for emergencies.”

Already the gin has proven to be popular, with the first batch selling out within a matter of hours. New bottles are expected to be restocked in the coming weeks.

The Queen’s affinity for gin is well known. Her former royal chef Darren McGrady told magazine Food and Wine that, before lunch, the monarch often drinks a gin and Dubonnet — a sweet French vermouth made in France — with a slice of lemon and lots of ice.

According to the magazine, the cocktail is the Queen’s first of four drinks per day, including a glass of wine with lunch, followed by a dry gin martini, and a glass of champagne before bed.

The royal gin joins a long list of spirits linked to public figures. Canadian actor Ryan Reynolds sells gin under the label Aviation Gin, George Clooney has raked in millions with Casamigos Tequila, and Dan Aykroyd filters his vodka through diamonds and sells it in a skull-shaped bottle under the aptly named brand Crystal Head Vodka.",[]

But this summer, it's starting to fill back up, astonishing both locals and visitors.

Mountain Lake Lodge is a mecca for true ""Dirty Dancing"" fans who travel to the Pembroke, Virginia, resort to see the various landmarks featured in the film. There's the cabin that ""Baby"" and her family stayed in and the gazebo where guests took dance lessons.

But the lake where Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey practiced their famous lift is not what it used to be. The lake's water level first dropped in 1999 but came back in 2003. In 2006, it dropped again and by 2008, it went completely dry, according to The Roanoke Times.

In recent weeks, however, after a wet spring, employees noticed that it was filling back up.

""It's about a third full right now and it seems to be holding,"" Mountain Lake Lodge's General Manager Heidi Stone told CNN.

""It's very exciting,"" Stone added. ""The guests get very excited because for so many years it's been dry and looked more like a meadow. It's the prettiest when it's filled with water.""

According to scientists, this phenomenon of the lake draining and filling back up makes Mountain Lake one of a kind.

""The mountain lake basin is absolutely unique, not only in Appalachia but in the entire world,"" Roanoke College professor Jon Cawley said in a video posted on the lodge's website.

Cawley explains that after studying the lakebed, he and other scientists found that the lake hits a major low about every 400 years.

""When the lake drains -- when it actually empties out -- it is cleaning itself by moving sediment that has accrued in the bottom of the lake down through that rather complex plumbing system to actually make the lake bigger, deeper, and to keep it clean,"" Cawley said in the video.

Fans will have to wait to see if the lake will fill up completely, but Stone said even without the lake, there's other activities at the lodge to enjoy such as a ""Dirty Dancing""-themed weekend package that includes a scavenger hunt, trivia, and obviously a dance party.",[]

With Quebec province at the forefront of Canada's coronavirus pandemic, businesses have been reopening cautiously.

Le Monarque, a fashionable restaurant in Old Montreal, reopened its doors just a few days ago -- but not without putting some creative safety measures in place first.

""We wanted to give customers more space,"" chef and owner Jeremie Bastien told AFP. ""But we didn't want to remove tables or put up Plexiglas panels.""

BRINGING WORLDS TOGETHER

So when Le Monarque fired up its ovens a few days ago, it took several steps to ensure social distancing.

The idea of filling some seats with mannequins, thus providing separation between human clients, came from the team behind the Sarah Pacini clothing line, including prominent Quebec menswear designer Philippe Dubuc.

""We wanted to make a stylish, high-end installation because we are bringing two worlds together, those of fashion and gastronomy,"" said Dubuc, adding, ""I think these two worlds have always been close.""

The restaurant's 29 mannequins all sport Sarah Pacini and Philippe Dubuc designs. They are meant to be ""visually beautiful,"" both inspired by and fitting in with their elegant surroundings.

""We are there, of course, to create and market our clothing,"" Dubuc said. ""But we are also there because our job is to make people dream.""

SILENT AUCTION

Nassim Habashi, who was enjoying lunch at Le Monarque, approved, saying, ""I think it's a wonderful idea both to mark the separation between tables and to make the atmosphere much more pleasant, given the current situation.""

At the end of each meal clients are given a gift certificate redeemable in Sarah Pacini and Philippe Dubuc outlets.

Chef Bastien says the partnership has been ""very advantageous"" for both sides. But he stresses that it is about more than just ""creating distance or dressing up the space.""

The idea, he said, was to ""go a bit deeper (and) figure out what we can do to help the people around us who have suffered during the pandemic.""

The mannequins' clothes are not yet for sale. But restaurant patrons will eventually have a chance to take part in a ""silent auction"" and purchase the clothing they see -- with all profits going to charities.",[]

Founded in New York in 1818, Brooks Brothers survived two world wars, the Great Depression and even managed to stay afloat as dress standards eased in the office. But the pandemic pushed it into Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection with so many stores closed and, with millions working from home, a crisp suit pushed to the very bottom of shopping lists.

Brooks Brothers will permanently close more than a quarter of its 200 stores.

The retail sector was under severe pressure even before the pandemic. Rival Barneys New York filed for bankruptcy protection late last year. Since COVID-19 began to spread in the U.S, J.Crew,Neiman Marcus,J.C. Penney and other national retail chains have followed suit.

The virus has hollowed out spending in many places and the accelerated the shift to online shopping, mostly to the benefit of big retailers like Walmart, Target and Amazon.com. Stores have begun to open in some parts of the country, but millions of people are still hunkered down at home. There are regions in the U.S. that are now getting hit with a wave of infections and some companies like Apple are shutting down stores again in those areas.

Brooks Brothers said Wednesday that it will continue operations as it restructures and is looking to reopen shops that are not being closed permanently. The company employed 4,000 people in March, before it furloughed about a third of its workers.

Jonathan Pasternak, a bankruptcy lawyer at Davidoff Hutcher & Citron, said that even before the pandemic, Brooks Brothers' store expansion and the cost of making clothes in the U.S. had created a financial burden, but he does not believe the company will disappear.

“The good thing about Brooks Brothers: It's a very strong brand,” he said.

The company has a storied history, dressing at least 40 American presidents, including Abraham Lincoln, who was wearing a Brooks Brothers coat when he was assassinated in 1865. Brooks Brothers' two-button suits were a favourite of President John F. Kennedy.

But its cultural influence has been broad.

Clark Cable wore Brooks Brothers and Jennifer Aniston appeared on the cover of GQ magazine wearing nothing but a red, white and blue Brooks Brothers tie.

The Duck Brand Stuck at Prom Scholarship Contest challenged students around North America to create their best prom outfit out of duct tape.

Lena Hart, who was one of about 400 applicants in Canada and the U.S., spent 146 hours and 12 rolls of tape to create her dress.

""I started by going through past sketchbooks that I had, and I had two prom dresses that I designed,"" said Hart. ""They were my dream prom dresses. So I took those two designs and combined them into one.""

The winner in both dress and tux categories will win $10,000, while the runners up will get $500 and $100-worth of products from the company.

Hart's dress includes dozens of gold tape roses and petals. A video on the company's website shows how she created sheets with the tape to resemble real fabric, and then cut them to shape and taped together the final product.

""I took giant pieces of paper, cut them out and put them on my body to see if they would fit and adjusted them from there, "" said Hart.

Le Chateau, which operates 129 stores in eight provinces as well as some manufacturing operations, issued the dire warning late Monday as it reported its latest quarterly earnings report. Although the results covered a period before the pandemic, the company also noted the significant effects that being ordered to close all of its stores has had on its business.

""There are material uncertainties that cast significant doubt upon [our] ability to continue as a going concern,"" the company said in a press release accompanying its earnings report.

Those uncertainties predated the pandemic, as the company said it was already in debt and has defaulted on loans. Now, though, the Montreal-based retailer says it needs to obtain new financing to stay afloat.

Although all of Le Chateau's stores had reopened as of last week, the company warned that the pandemic ""will have a material and adverse impact"" on its business and that it does not expect to fully resume normal operations until 2022.

The company said it is in negotiations with its existing lenders and seeking new sources of financing, while also talking to its landlords about possible rent relief. It announced last week that it is manufacturing up to 500,000 hospital gowns as part of a federal contract.

Le Chateau's fourth-quarter results included a sales decline of 6.5 per cent year-over-year, to $175.9 million, despite a significant increase in online sales. The company recorded a net loss of $51.2 million, up from $6.1 million the previous year, which included a $42-million write-off and write-down of long-term assets.

Despite revealing that its entire operation may not be able to survive another year, Le Chateau has not announced plans to close any stores. This is in sharp contrast to how many other clothiers have handled pandemic-exacerbated downturns, as retailers including The Children's Place, Aldo and Reitmans have announced plans to close stores belonging to some of their brands this year. One analyst has suggested that more than 2,500 big-brand store closures could be announced in Canada this year.

The cover is one of four covers for the magazine’s July and August issue, and was revealed this week in a post on the magazine’s Instagram account.

“It’s about mental health,” the caption read. “It’s about time.”

The photo shows a nude model crouched in a bathtub in a larger room decorated in blue and white tile, with two nurses standing above her, dressed in old-fashioned uniforms.

The cover triggered a wave of criticism calling out the “offensive” and “disrespectful” concept.

Comments below the original Instagram post accused the magazine of attempting to “aestheticize” the struggles of mental health by using a mental health institution as a setting for a fashion shoot.

“MENTAL ILLNESS IS NOT AN EDITORIAL CONCEPT,” one Instagram user commented.

Vogue Portugal issued a statement on July 3 saying the cover was intended to “open up the topic of mental health” and spark “discussion.”

The magazine did not address the backlash directly in their statement, or address concerns that the cover was tone-deaf, but said that the issue itself contained interviews with psychologists “and other experts in the field.” They also said the theme of mental health was “not linked to the theme of madness, but instead [was] covered as an aspect of human emotions and behavior.”

They claim the design of the room depicted in the cover was formed after “deep research of hundreds of reportage photographs from some of the most relevant and famous documentarists who have captured mental health hospitals,” confirming that the cover is drawing on the history of mental health institutions for its aesthetic.

“We acknowledge the significance of the topic of mental health and our intention, through visual storytelling, is to shine a light on the important issues of today,” the statement reads.

Advocates say this defence misses the point completely.

Poorna Bell, a journalist and author who has spoken up about mental health advocacy since losing her husband to suicide, said on Twitter that Vogue Portugal’s defence was “unbelievable.

“The discussion has been had,” she wrote. “You’re late to the table and offensive.

“I don’t have patience or time for people and brands that in the face [of] overwhelming upset and evidence around why what they’ve done is problematic, cannot apologize and say they […] will do better.”

Rose Cartwright, cofounder of Made of Millions, a non-profit platform that is dedicated to mental health advocacy, pointed out in a statement Sunday that a fashion magazine is uniquely ill-equipped to comprehend or discuss mental health struggles.

“You could barely design a more perfect engine of mental ill health than Vogue - an advertising machine that finds beautiful ways of lying to women about what will make them happy,” she wrote on Instagram.

She pointed out that “madness” and many issues with mental health develop because people “exist in impossible situations that their minds can't make sense of, or because they've inherited holding patterns from generations of poverty, discrimination and abuse.

“These subjects are tonally off-colour for a brand that's built on luxury.”

The model depicted in the cover, Simona Kirchnerova, initially described it as a “career highlight,” on her Instagram to have been featured on the cover with her actual mother and grandmother playing the nurses.

After the backlash, she issued a statement saying “the model is not in charge of any photo shoot,” and revealing that she had dealt with depression herself in the past.

The other three covers for Vogue Portugal’s “Madness” issue include a woman sitting in a chair in front of a fake beach background, a woman in a voluminous black dress with numerous legs protruding from underneath the skirt, and a pair of hands holding a human heart.",[]

If you've ever wondered what space smells like, a new perfume may answer that for you. A Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign was recently launched for a new fragrance called Eau de Space to bring the smell of outer space back down to Earth.

The fragrance was developed by Steve Pearce, according to Eau de Space product manager Matt Richmond. Pearce is a chemist and the founder of Omega Ingredients, a company focused on the ""creation of the highest quality, provenance driven, natural flavours and ingredients for the food and beverage industry,"" its website says.

Pearce was originally contracted by NASA to recreate the smell in 2008 after he worked on a scent exhibition for which he recreated the smell of the inside of the Mir Space Station, Pearce told CNN.

Using notes from astronauts who described space smelling like ozone, hot metal and fried steak, Pearce used his knowledge of flavour and fragrance chemistry to produce combinations matching those descriptions, he said.

It took Pearce a few weeks to gather the ""right aroma chemicals"" to try out a few ideas before arriving at something he found satisfactory, he said.

The scent was created to help astronauts train before launching in orbit, and it was part of NASA's goal of eliminating any potential surprises astronauts might encounter or experience in space, according to the Kickstarter.

""It's kind of like a smell from a gun, right after you fire the shot,"" Peggy Whitson, an astronaut and former resident of the International Space Station, told CNN in a 2002 interview about the smell of space. ""I think it kind of has almost a bitter kind of smell in addition to being smoky and burned.""

Richmond said that he has struggled to describe how the fragrance smells, adding, ""Astronauts describe the smell as a mix of gunpowder, seared steak, raspberries and rum.""

The company's main goal with Eau de Space is to increase interest in STEM learning for K-12 students through what Richmond called ""experiential education."" He hopes that Eau de Space will start the discussion, with parents, teachers and scientists taking it from there.

Richmond revealed that they are looking into releasing a fragrance called Smell of the Moon based on the excitement around Eau de Space.",[]

Luke Pollard -- who regularly makes pizza for his friends and family -- told CTV's Your Morning that the enterprise started in March, when the novel coronavirus put a stop to his construction business, resulting in both he and his wife Brianna being out of work.

Towards the end of March, Pollard said his wife asked him how big his pizzas were. An hour later, she told him that custom-made boxes were coming the next day and that they were going to sell pizzas from their backyard the following weekend, to make some extra cash.

""It started off just with some friends, family, and then I started posting online on Instagram, and people started to reach out and then eventually we got a little profile in Toronto Life, and since then it's just been hundreds and hundreds of requests so it's been a lot of fun,"" Pollard said in an interview on Wednesday.

Pollard makes around 10 pizzas that people can order through Instagram to pick up from his backyard every Saturday night -- aptly calling the new business venture 'One Night Only.'

Customers can choose from four different pies -- cheese, pepperoni, spicy pepperoni with pickled jalapenos, and mushroom special. Each pizza costs $20 and comes with a homemade creamy garlic-and-dill dipping sauce.

Pollard said Torontonians from all over the city have been flocking to his Riverdale home for a taste.

""It's been a real fun experiment and journey, and it's just really a good time,"" he said.

Before COVID-19, the couple entertained almost every weekend, and as Pollard's pizzas got better and better, the dinner parties turned into weekly pizza nights.

However, Pollard's love for pizza began when he was a kid.

Growing up, Pollard said his mom loved to cook and instead of ordering pizza on Friday nights, she would make it herself.

""We started off ordering from chains, things like that, and then my mom, she started making her own dough and it kind of really opened my eyes to how delicious pizza can be once you get past the store-bought stuff,"" Pollard said, explaining that he set his sights on creating his own perfect pizza recipe.

""It's something I've worked on for a lot of years and finally developed this recipe that I can do out of my home oven that the final product is something that you might find at a pizzeria,"" Polland said.

Polland said pizza making is a process and he has to start readying the pies days before they’re sold.

""I typically start making the dough for Saturday on a Wednesday morning and that's a couple hour process. I let it do its thing for a few hours out, then it goes in the fridge for a long, cold, slow ferment, and then Saturday morning we start to prep and get ready for the afternoon,"" Polland said.

Despite COVID-19 restrictions lifting and his construction business having resumed work, Pollard said he enjoys making pizza so much that he hopes to keep the new business venture going.

""As soon as the restrictions lifted we've been slammed between [construction] and doing the pizza and it's been very busy,"" Pollard explained.

""But it's one of those things where the response has been phenomenal, and it's definitely something we want to pursue. So… we're just going let it sort of organically evolve.""

With only selling 10 pizzas one night a week, Pollard admits that it's difficult for Torontonians to get their hands on a pie but said he's looking to expand the business.

""Right now, even just with friends and family, it's pretty hard to get one to everybody so we're looking to scale up and we're going to be doing a pop up in the near future so we can just get more pizza out to more people,"" Pollard said.

""Because there's nothing better than handing somebody a fresh pizza and seeing the smile on their face.""",[]
453,453,453,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/lifestyle/competitive-eaters-nearing-human-limit-of-hot-dog-consumption-study-says-1.5025164,"Competitive eaters nearing human limit of hot dog consumption, study says",,2020-07-15,"TORONTO -- Competitive eaters are nearing the human limit for the number of hot dogs that can be consumed in 10 minutes, according to a new study.

Using sports science theory and mathematical modelling to project trends in performance, the new U.S. study found that the eating threshold for humans is around 83 hot dogs.

North Carolina sports medicine professor James Smoliga and a team of researchers analyzed 39 years of data from the annual Nathan's Famous Coney Island Hot Dog Eating Contest to calculate the maximum number of hot dogs one person could possibly eat during its 10-minute duration.

The study, published Tuesday in the journal Biology Letters, concluded that 832 grams or 83 hot dogs is the maximum amount for a professional eater to consume while the average person is only able to eat about 10 hot dogs in 10 minutes.

The study reported that it is unlikely anyone would be able to eat more than 83.

The current world record is 75, a bar set by competitive eating champion Joey Chestnut at this year's Coney Island event. Miki Sudo ate 48.5 hot dogs to win the women's division and set a female record.

""Though often perceived as an entertaining spectacle of gluttony, nearly four decades of data from the event provide insight into the limits of human gut capacity,"" the study said.

While the average human would run into a stomach capacity issue after consuming so many hot dogs, the study reported that competitive eaters specifically train to expand their stomachs.

Eating so many hot dogs – the current record of 75 hot dogs is roughly equivalent to 21,000 calories -- would ""likely alter normal, healthy gastrointestinal function,"" the study said.

While some may think of competitive eaters as the personification of gluttony, the study found that their physiology and digestive systems are unique.

According to the study, the early winners of the Nathan's contest engaged in ""binge-eating"" and topped out at between 10 and 15 hot dogs in the 10-minute period.

However, the participation of Japanese extreme eaters such as Takeru Kobayashi in the 1990s started a slow and steady rise in how much elite contestants could eat. According to the study, competitive eating was no longer just about appetite, but instead, competitors were training to eat a lot in a short time.

The study found that competitive eaters are able to eat such large amounts of food because they train their bodies to do so by ingesting a large amount of liquids or gels to expand the stomach without processing the calories.

Chestnut, for example, told ESPN in a documentary last year that his training regime lasts for the three months leading up to the annual competition and includes weekly practice competitions, a controlled diet and yoga and breathing exercises to help with his mental focus.

The study noted that the hot dog composition and size has remained unchanged at Nathan’s Famous throughout its 104-year history, allowing for sustainable comparisons between competitors over the years.

The study also compared how much humans and carnivores who live on land can eat, finding that that the achievements of human speed eaters are impressive even by comparison with other species.

According to the study’s findings, humans are able to eat faster than bears or coyotes, but slower than grey wolves.

""In summary, data from hot dog eating competitions suggest that there is stunning plasticity in gut capacity,"" the study said.

While the human limit for hot dog consumption is 83, the study warns amateur eaters not to try to test it for themselves.

The study said the average person could suffer serious health consequences while trying to ingest such a large amount of food including choking or rupturing their stomach.",[]

The chain has rebalanced the diet of some of the cows by adding lemon grass in a bid to limit bovine contributions to climate change. By tweaking their diet, Burger King said Tuesday that it believes it can reduce a cow's daily methane emissions by about 33%.

Cows emit methane as a by-product of their digestion, and that has become a potential public relations hurdle for major burger chains.

Greenhouse gas emissions from the agriculture sector made up 9.9% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in 2018, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Of that amount, methane emissions from livestock (called enteric fermentation) comprised more than a quarter of the emissions from the agriculture sector.

With an over-the-top social media campaign that teeters between vulgarity and science (sprinkled with more vulgarity), Burger King is banking on the heightened awareness of climate change and its responsibility to limit its own role.

According to a recent poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, about two out of three Americans say corporations have a responsibility to combat climate change. The gravitational pull of climate change is increasingly finding its way onto national political stage.

Potential customers are also cutting down on the amount of meat they consume, citing both environmental and dietary concerns. Burger King and rival McDonald's have added meat alternatives to their menus.

Two years ago McDonald's said it was taking steps to cut the greenhouse gases it emits. It tweaked the manner in which the beef in its Big Macs and Quarter Pounders was produced. The company said at the time that it expected the changes to prevent 150 million metric tons (165 million tons) of greenhouse gas emissions from being released into the atmosphere by 2030.

Burger King worked with scientists at the Autonomous University at the State of Mexico and at the University of California, Davis to test and develop its formula of adding 100 grams of lemongrass leaves to the cows' daily diets. Preliminary tests indicate that the lemongrass leaves help the cows release less methane as they digest their food.

On Tuesday, Burger King introduced its Reduced Methane Emissions Beef Whopper, made with beef sourced from cows that emit reduced methane, in select restaurants in Miami, New York, Austin, Portland and Los Angeles, while supplies last.",[]
455,455,455,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/entertainment/without-waiter-jobs-what-happens-to-creative-new-york-1.5024715,"Without waiter jobs, what happens to creative New York?",'Deepti Hajela',2020-07-15,"NEW YORK -- It's been the story for many a starry-eyed creative type looking for a big break in the Big Apple -- wait tables to pay the bills while auditioning, performing, singing, painting, dancing, writing, whatever it takes to make the dreams of success come true.

But there's been a plot twist, thanks to the coronavirus putting food servers out of work in recent months as restaurants were forced to shut down their dine-in services. And much uncertainty remains over what restaurant dining will look like even as New York City reopens.

Questions of whether there will be enough business for establishments to stay open and even have waiter jobs to fill are causing concern about what that's going to mean for the city's creative class if the jobs that helped them be able to live here and add to the city's artistic culture are no longer readily available.

""It really is a part of the artist's life in New York, so I don't know what that's going to look like if it's just suddenly not an option anymore,"" said Travis McClung, 28, who has spent close to nine years waiting tables while doing theatre, singing and more recently, trying to build his career in video editing and post-production.

The virus has been devastating for the city's restaurant workers. According to the state Department of Labor, restaurants and other eateries employed just over 273,000 people in February, before the city shut down in mid-March due to the pandemic. In April, during the peak of virus cases, that number had fallen to under 78,000. As the city reopened in May, it rose slightly to close to 100,000, still vastly below where it had been.

And while outdoor dining has been allowed in recent weeks, with around 6,600 restaurants in the five boroughs applying for permits to feed people on sidewalks and streets, the return of indoor dining has been put off indefinitely over fears that confined quarters would make virus cases spike.

For McClung, who came to New York City in 2009 from a Dallas, Texas, suburb to study theatre in college and started waiting tables here, a restaurant job has been a safety net, of sorts. Pre-pandemic, New York City's vibrant restaurant scene was busy enough that he always felt he had a fallback.

""It was a sense of security, it let me stay in New York City, pay the rent here,"" he said.

That's what led to his last pre-virus waiter job, a position at a casual dining place on Manhattan's Upper West Side.

""I had a big gig editing and it cancelled and I panicked and then my friend posted he was leaving that job,"" McClung said. ""I messaged him for a referral and then I got hired the next day.""

Rachel Berry, who moved to New York City in 2004, tried her hand at a bunch of different jobs like dog walking and nannying before moving to bartending and some waiting tables in 2016.

The Laurel, Maryland, native even spent some time at a 9-to-5 gig in her early 20s, but found the structure too rigid to give her enough time to work on her creative pursuits, which have included photography, painting, performing and most recently, interior design work.

""There's just something about the food service industry,"" the 36-year-old said. ""It affords me a life that I can get by in New York.""

She worries now about what will still be available in restaurants, as social distancing restrictions will require lower capacities in food and drink establishments for the foreseeable future, and whether she would have to work even more in other fields like retail to make what she has been able to in food service.

""Am I going to have the same opportunities afforded to me financially, or, you know, am I going to be stuck in this, I need two to three jobs to get by,"" Berry asked.

And that's of course assuming people don't leave, or hesitate to come to New York City now in the first place, said Jen Lyon, owner of MeanRed Productions, a company that puts on arts and music events.

That's a concern to her, as someone who looks to work with up-and-comers, in a city where it was already expensive and difficult for artists to sustain themselves.

As someone who spent years bartending, she has an appreciation for food service jobs and what they offer creative types.

They're ""the best jobs to have when you needed to focus on your art, especially in New York,"" she said.

But now, if those jobs largely disappear, ""What happens in my world is suddenly I don't have young artists to work with because they can't afford New York,"" she said. ""You don't have people creating art in New York anymore.""

The pandemic ""has scattered a lot of the potential artists,"" she said. ""We're going to lose a decade of possible talent until people figure out how to stay.""

Losing its creatives is also a ""huge threat"" to the city's fabric overall, said Eli Dvorkin, editorial and policy director at the Center for an Urban Organization, which advocates for policies that make New York City more equitable.

""That's a huge problem for New York which has been so dependent on its role as a cultural capital of the world,"" he said.

""As a city we can't afford to lose our creative edge. It's been one of the key drivers of the city's economic growth over the past decades,"" Dvorkin added. ""It's one of the reasons why I think New York maintains its status as a beacon for creative, innovative people from all over the world.""",[]

The Calgary brewery released its first sour beer this month as a celebration of 'Karen', the internet-coined name given to the stereotypical entitled, privileged white woman. The brewery's social media promotion of the beer used phrases that included 'Can we speak to a manager?' and the depiction on the label was of a fair-skinned woman with the crown of the Common Crown Brewing logo resting on her head.

The misguided attempt to be humorous drew swift criticism on social media as the name appeared to exonerate the actions of a select group who have stood in opposition to the Black Lives Matter movement.

On Friday, Common Crown announced its decision to remove the beer from store shelves and issued the following apology:

We wish to thank those who reached out and brought to our attention the error we have made in our recent release. We realize that our intent of the Karen label is insignificant at this juncture. Unfortunately, The Karen Cherry Sour missed the mark, and we promise to do better. Being tone deaf to racial developments is not an excuse, and we will work harder to stay informed and up to date on escalating situations. Thank you to those who sought to educate and inform us, and help us to recognize our error. We read through all of your comments and messages as a team. Moving forward, we will be working to do better, educate ourselves and collaborate with communities who support inclusion and diversity.

The Karen Cherry Sour has been pulled from shelves and is no longer available for sale. While this is just a small step in understanding our wrong, we are committed to moving forward and doing better.

Thank you.

CTV News reached out to the owner of Common Crown Brewing Co., Damon Moreau, for comment on the situation and he said the decision on the product name was made as a result of a team effort and the entire team apologizes for the mistake.

""We recognize the issue and the error,"" he said.

A majority of the product line was pre-sold and scheduled for delivery Friday, but Moreau says that's no longer happening. He says he's spoken with the company's licence holders that would have received the shipments and they have expressed their understanding of the situation.",[]

Patty Stop, located near Port Union Road and Lawrence Avenue East, got a highly coveted shout out from Drake on Instagram earlier this week. The rapper posted a photo of one of the shop’s stuffed patties to his 68.8 million followers and the response that followed was incredible, according to co-owner Freddy Gyebi.

“In terms of social media, my followers on my Instagram have been skyrocketing,” Gyebi told CTV News Toronto. “My views have been skyrocketing.”

Gyebi says he’s been friends with Drake for quite some time now, but admits he didn’t actually know the rap superstar would take to Instagram to show his support.

“A couple weeks back he was like ‘yo, I need to try one of your stuffed patties,” Gyebi said.

So the restaurateur made his way to Drake’s mega-mansion on The Bridle Path for a personal patty party.

“Set up the whole shebang, in terms of the lettuce, the tomatoes. I made the stuffed patty for him, he had it, he liked it. Then he had another one, said he liked it. And I didn’t know he was going to post it, I didn’t even know he posted it until one of my friends was like ‘yo he posted it.’”

The post that followed on Monday evening was simple, a stuffed patty on a countertop, tagged @pattystopinc with a head exploding emoji, the ultimate sign of respect.

According to Gyebi, the interest that came next has been immense and is more than welcome following a forced closure due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

“We had to shut down,” Gyebi explains. “COVID has definitely taken a toll on the business, but we’re still here, we’re still able to sell our patties to the community.”

In the meantime, the owners started a GoFundMe campaign in an effort to provide food to Toronto’s front-line workers with a goal of serving up 300 meals a week.

And while Gyebi admits that he doesn’t have a culinary background, he and his co-owner Jason Cheddie agree that their product is different because of what goes into it.

“It’s definitely the love we put into it. We put a lot of quality ingredients into our patties. It’s just not your average patty,” Cheddie said. “Everything is homemade. Straight original from our recipes.”

Drake understands that effort, according to Gyebi, and says that’s why an endorsement from the city’s biggest artist is so significant.

“To me, it means a lot. It just shows that, you know, he believes in being Torontonian. He wouldn’t do it if he didn’t like it, that’s the type of person he is,” Gyebi said.

“He’s doing it because he actually likes the product and he believes it in, you know.”

In a letter sent Wednesday to various ministers, the country's largest airline says the situation is becoming ""increasingly urgent"" as Canada has made virtually no change to its quarantine restrictions since mid-March despite improvements in containing the spread of the virus.

Air Canada's chief medical officer, Dr. Jim Chung, wrote that the restrictions are severely impacting the airline, its customers and employees, as well as an overall recovery.

He says the proposed measures mirror those adopted by the European Union, Britain and other jurisdictions.

The Montreal-based airline says it is not proposing relaxing U.S. border restrictions that are expected to be extended until at least late August.

It notes that requirements in place to travel to various countries include pre-departure medically certified negative COVID-19 tests to enter the Caribbean; a waiver of quarantine requirements after a negative test on arrival to Iceland, Austria and Luxembourg; and mandatory testing on arrival to South Korea, Hong Kong, Macau and the United Arab Emirates.

""There are many other interests affected by the quarantine restrictions -- not only jobs and pensions, but also the social and economic well-being of individuals and communities that rely on air travel, as well as basic freedoms of mobility,"" says Chung.

""Business and labour leaders alike have implored the government to act on easing these restrictions in order to strike a better balance, without adversely impacting public health.""

India's state-run carrier, Air-India, has been operating limited flights to the United States, Europe, Gulf countries and several other nations since May to bring back hundreds of thousands of Indians stranded there and also carry home foreigners stuck in India.

The Greater Toronto Airports Authority (GTAA) announced on Tuesday it is cutting 27 per cent of its workforce at Toronto's Pearson Airport to allow for a more ""nimble, innovative, and recovery-focused"" operation.

""These changes reflect a significant decrease in global air traffic, with passenger numbers at Toronto Pearson currently at approximately 1996 operating levels,"" the GTAA said in a statement.

The GTAA said passenger numbers in April of this year were reduced by 97 per cent compared to the same period of 2019.

The reduction of jobs will come through the elimination of about 200 unfilled positions, combined with voluntary departures and layoffs totally about 300 employees.

The reductions come into effect beginning on Monday, with job losses extending through fall 2020.

Among the high-ranking departures are two of the GTAA's vice-presidents, whose work will be redistributed under a revamped management structure headed by Craig Bradbrook.

Bradbrook had been the GTAA's vice-president for aviation services and is now in the newly created position of chief operating officer.

""This reduction in force is a difficult but necessary step, and one that we take with great sadness,"" GTAA president and CEO Deborah Flint said in a statement.

""We are committed to maintaining our operations and the health and safety of the airport as we evolve our organization to drive our recovery. I am confident that we have a capable and resilient team and the right approach to come through these challenging times with strength.""

Among the management departures was Kim Stangeby, vice-president and chief strategy officer, who had also been GTAA's interim vice-president for human resources.

GTAA said it will complete a search for a new chief human resources officer.

The airport operator says it's also working with the Unifor union and Pearson Airport's firefighter association to implement the changes while respecting their labour contracts.

“We take the health and safety of our patients, employees and physicians very seriously,” said Dr. Brendan Carr, the president and CEO of Nova Scotia Health. “Requiring people to wear masks adds another layer of protection that will help reduce transmission of COVID-19 and is consistent with evolving evidence and advice from public health experts.”

Dr. Krista Jangaard, the CEO of the IWK Health Centre, said the two organizations have been monitoring the situation closely and are constantly evolving in their response to COVID-19.

“As we plan for a potential second wave, we want to ensure a consistent approach across all hospitals and health centres in the province,” she said.

The requirement does not apply to hospital inpatients, children under the age of two, or staff working in non-clinical areas, once they have arrived in their workspace where they can maintain physical distance from others.

Staff and physicians working in clinical areas are already required to wear a mask.

Even while wearing a mask, Nova Scotia Health says patients, visitors and essential support people should still maintain a physical distance of two metres from others, when possible.

“We must also stress that masks are not a replacement for physical distancing,” said Dr. Shelly McNeil, chief of infectious diseases for the Nova Scotia Health Authority’s central zone. “Physical distancing and good hand hygiene are the most effective ways to minimize the risk of spreading COVID-19 and must continue to be practiced while in our facilities.”

Visitors will continue to be screened upon arrival. Anyone with COVID-19 symptoms, or who is supposed to be self-isolating or needs to be tested for COVID-19, will not be allowed to enter.

Meanwhile, the Nova Scotia government announced Friday that drivers and passengers will be required to wear non-medical masks on public transportation, starting on July 24.",[]

The $18.4 billion Safe Restart Agreement provides direct transfers of more than $200 million to New Brunswick in the current fiscal year.

Higgs said today in a news release the new deal will help the province's efforts to address concerns facing New Brunswickers in adjusting to the new normal.

The federal transfers are designed to help provinces with COVID-related expenses for things such as personal protective equipment, child care and senior facilities.

It will also give provinces access to an enhanced federal stockpile of personal protective equipment.

Higgs says the COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the need for comprehensive action to secure the future of Canada's health-care systems.

In a news release from RCMP, Bain is described as about five-foot-ten and 175 pounds, with brown hair and brown eyes.

Bain is considered a suspect in the investigation and may be dangerous. Police advise anyone with information on his whereabouts, or who sees him, to not approach him and to call police immediately.

On May 20, with the assistance of the New Brunswick RCMP West District Crime Reduction Unit, a search warrant was executed at a home on Route 635. During the search, police seized more than 185 items and illegal substances, including 31 long guns and 22 handguns, among them 24 prohibited and/or restricted weapons – many of the firearms were loaded.

Police also seized more than three kilograms of what is believed to be cocaine, and nearly 5.5 kilograms of what is believed to be crystal methamphetamine, as well as quantities of ammunition and Canadian currency.

On May 27, a warrant for Nicholas (aka Nick) Bain was issued in Fredericton Provincial Court, for possession of a prohibited or restricted firearms with ammunition, without a licence or registration.

The owners, Ambassatours Gray Line, are selling the vessel, which is a life-sized version of the TV character.

The asking price is $495,000.

Company CEO Dennis Campbell says the firm was thinking of selling before the pandemic, as they had to subsidize the boat's daily tours due to reduced demand.

Now, with COVID-19 causing huge reductions in travel to the province, Campbell says the company can't afford to keep operating the tug at a loss.

He says he's open to an out-of-province buyer, but is hoping a local group can find a way to continue operations in some form.

""With a severe reduction in visitation to the waterfront, due to COVID-19, we're encouraging Theodore, now age 20, to start a new life chapter,"" Campbell said.

Theodore Too, the vessel's official name, was built in Dayspring, N.S., in 2000 as a replica of the title character of the children's TV show, which aired on CBC TV between 1993 and 2001.

In the early years, the replica spent summers on the Great Lakes in Ontario and on the eastern seaboard of the United States and Canada, promoting tourism in Nova Scotia.

From the mid-2000s onward, the tugboat hosted child-themed tours of the Halifax harbour, with passengers including former fans of the television show.

However, Campbell notes that most children who watched the program in the 1990s are now in their 30s, and demand for tours has significantly decreased in recent years.

In an interview, Campbell said potential uses for the vessel range from a waterside cafe to a summer ferry, as the boat can carry up to 49 passengers.

At present, with social distancing rules in effect, the vessel could only take about 12 people per trip, he estimated.

He said the vessel has received full marine maintenance annually.

Campbell estimated a new owner would face monthly expenses of more than $2,000 to maintain it while dockside as a new use is developed.

Theodore Too is listed with Scruton Marine, marine brokers and consultants who specialize in the sale of commercial marine vessels.

When she first moved, she knew there would be a wait, but, like the rest of the world, she had no idea COVID-19 was coming.

Once the pandemic hit in March, transplants were put on hold, and Galloway's fate was left up in the air.

Pandemic restrictions and her condition meant she couldn't go anywhere. Her husband had already left work, and their home in North River, N.S., behind to be with her.

That means the Galloways have been paying the bills at home and in Toronto.

""We've been living on one income right now,"" she says. ""The government does cover just the rent cost only, everything else is out of pocket.""

Galloway says she and her husband managed to find a small house to rent in Scarborough. But they recently had problems with their water system back home, flooding the basement.

​""It's been a stressful, long seven months,"" says Galloway. ""We're hoping it ends soon.""

In the meantime, Galloway walks around their rental tethered to an oxygen machine.

Transplants recently resumed in May, but now she needs to be matched with a new set of lungs. Even when that happens, there's no guarantee the transplant will happen right away.

""Sometimes people get two or three false calls before they get the right lungs,"" she says.

According to the Lung Association of Nova Scotia, there are eight people from Nova Scotia who are in Toronto waiting for lung transplants, and one person from Prince Edward Island. There are also nine Nova Scotians and one person from P.E.I. on the list, waiting to get a call to move to Toronto.

Michelle Donaldson, communications manager with the provincial Lung Association, says the pandemic made an already stressful time even more difficult for people who are waiting.

""I think it creates a lot of stress and also those people are waiting for a lifesaving procedure, so can they afford to wait?"" she says. ""That was one of the things that was a big concern amidst the pandemic.""

The waiting and worrying is something Galloway is all too familiar with, after her father had a double-lung transplant himself more than a decade ago.

He had a rare blood protein disorder known as Alpha-1 antitrypsin disease, which is considered hereditary. He died two years after his procedure at the age of 54.

Galloway, who is 48 years old, says doctors have tested her for the disease, but so far those tests have come back negative.

""But they think I have something out there that they're not sure of, the way I'm going downhill so fast, and I'm so young.""

In the meantime, Galloway says the wait is both an emotional and financial strain.

Friends and family back in North River have been pitching in to help, holding fundraisers and raffles to raise money to help the Galloways pay their expenses.

An online fundraising campaign has also been launched as part of those efforts.

Galloway says total strangers have also donated, including one woman who made a contribution in memory of her son, who died in a car accident and was an organ donor.

Most of all, Galloway misses home, and the daughter and granddaughter she can't see right now except over video chats.

She hopes all the waiting will eventually lead to one thing.

""To get the lungs to come home,"" she says. ""To get better, just to get that call, is my hope.""",[]

There may be a river splitting the New Brunswick community of Campbellton and the Quebec communities of Pointe-a-la-Croix and Listuguj, but the three often operate as one, and being split apart by New Brunswick's border closure hasn't been easy.

""We need the premier to realize that everyone's serious and we've had enough,"" said Campbellton Mayor Stephanie Anglehart-Paulin.

She says the three communities share the hospital, schools and facilities and that businesses on her side are suffering without their neighbours.

""It would be like saying Fredericton North, 'OK, you're no longer part of Fredericton, now go to McAdam to go grocery shopping,'"" said Anglehart-Paulin. ""That's what they're telling these people to do, go two-and-a-half hours to go grocery shopping.""

This week, Premier Blaine Higgs said he was considering opening the border to the Gaspe Peninsula, allowing those Quebec residents to come across into New Brunswick more freely.

Anglehart-Paulin says she doesn't need all of the Gaspe, just a 30-kilometre radius to include her sister communities across the river.

During an interview with CTV News, Higgs said he met with the other Atlantic premiers Thursday afternoon and will again Friday morning, but says he believes it's possible.

""We're looking at two immediate communities right now in the border region and would like to be in a position where we could elaborate on that, let's say later this week or certainly later next week,"" Higgs said. ""We've been getting a lot of interest from the area to do so. We will expand it as we can. Right now, it will be limited, but it will certainly reflect the bulk of the concerns that we've been getting from the region.""

CTV News reached out to the Nova Scotia government to ask how it feels about the idea of New Brunswick opening to a small part of Quebec. The province did not respond before time of publishing.

Anyone from Quebec can enter Nova Scotia now, but they are required to self-isolate for 14 days once they arrive.

""What are we afraid of? The bogeyman?"" said Anglehart-Paulin. ""At this point, there's no cases there. There's no cases here. We just want to keep our little community bubble together. We got half of our, 50 per cent of our population's across the way.""

Education Minister Zach Churchill announced Thursday that his department will release its full plan next Wednesday.

“Our priority is to have students in school. We know that’s where they’re going to do their best. We know that’s best for families for a teaching and learning environment, so our priority is to have them in school,” said Churchill.

“But, of course, we do have to be responsive to the evolving situation with COVID-19, so, as I mentioned previously, we do have some fallback positions, either at 50 per cent capacity or all the way down to zero if the situation necessitates that.”

Nova Scotia schools have remained closed since March break in an effort to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Students continued their education at home during the pandemic, either online or with workbooks. The school year for students ended on June 5.

If students do head back to the classroom full time, it is expected physical distancing and enhanced sanitation protocols will be in place.

Teachers, parents and opposition MLAs have been calling on the Nova Scotia government to release a plan for the upcoming school year for weeks.

The Department of Education released a statement to CTV News on Wednesday, saying it has been evaluating the feedback it received from parents, students and teachers, as well as advice and direction from public health officials and the IWK Health Centre.",[]

This week, Halifax Regional Police (HRP) and the Nova Scotia RCMP both announced they were purging years of street check data.

HRP says they will no longer retain existing historical street check records in their current form beyond December 2020.

Instead, the force says it is retaining the data in de-identified form, which means that an individual could not be identified from the information that is left.

""It will be kept in this form for research purposes only, as per Dr. Wortley's recommendation. The specifics of this are still being finalized as we consult with the other stakeholders. It would not be appropriate for us to speak on behalf of the African Nova Scotian Community,"" said HRP Const. John MacLeod.

The purging of street check data is something activist Kate MacDonald is concerned about.

""This information, if it's going to be destroyed in the end, I don't know why it wouldn't be released back to the folks who it was referring to or who it involved,"" she said.

The Nova Scotia RCMP are also purging their records.

Following recommendations in the Wortley report, RCMP say personal information related to RCMP street checks in the Halifax area will be purged in April 2021.

If an individual wants to obtain information that may have been recorded about them as part of a street check in HRM, they can file a Privacy Act request for personal information. RCMP say there is no cost for this, but requests must be filed by April 15, 2021.

RCMP say they use a different information system in the Halifax Regional Municipality than the rest of the province.

Data recorded as part of a street check outside of the Halifax area is automatically deleted from the system after two years. Anyone who wants to get access to information using that system may file a Privacy Act request at any time.

""Street checks have been a really important issue in our province,"" said Nova Scotia RCMP spokeswoman Cpl. Jennifer Clarke. ""It's important for people to understand what we're doing with their information and how they can get access to it, if they choose to do so.""

MacDonald would like to see the data connected to street checks released and the process for that streamlined.

""If I have a file on myself, of street check surveillance or observation, I would love to see what is being said about me because right now, it's kind of this blind space where I don't really know how deep street checks went, like is there a file of me saying I was sitting on this step, on this day, with these people?"" said MacDonald.

While police prepare to dump years' worth of data, the official opposition is renewing calls for the province to apologize to the African Nova Scotian community.

""The best time to say you're sorry is as soon as you realize it's time, so, that should have happened in this province a long time ago. I'm hopeful that the province will just make the apology,"" said Nova Scotia Progressive Conservative leader Tim Houston. ""It's due to the community and we need to move forward.""

When an apology may happen remains unclear. The premier says the justice minister is working on the file.

""Anything that we can continue to do to improve and heal the relationship between law enforcement and African Nova Scotians is a good step but, there's a lot of work that we will continue to do to heal that divide and quite frankly heal the historic issues that have been faced by the community,"" said Stephen McNeil.",[]

The algae has been found in the Lake Major water supply, but Halifax Water says a toxin emitted from blue-green algae is still below the acceptable concentration determined by Health Canada.

""Any harmful blue-green algae that we test for are coming back non-detect, so in other words the water is perfectly safe,"" said James Campbell of Halifax Water. ""There's no issue whatsoever with any kind of blue-green algae issues that can develop.""

Lake Major supplies water for 103,000 residents in Dartmouth, Cole Harbour, Eastern Passage, North Preston, Westphal, and Burnside.

People who live in those communities do not have to do anything different when it comes to the water coming out of their tap.

It is the first time blue-green algae has been reported by Halifax Water.

In Moncton, N.B., the municipal water supply at Turtle Creek was found to have traces of blue-green algae in 2017 and again in 2018.

The water always remained safe to drink.

All three levels of government provided a total of $6 million in funding for an improved filtration system.

In Dartmouth, algae blooms have been observed at Lake Mic Mac.

Warnings about blue-green algae have been posted this summer at the Irishtown nature park in Moncton as well.

High temperatures are being blamed for all of it.

""There is an increase in algae, little green round things, that produce toxins and this is directly following the warming of the water,"" said Peter Leavitt, the Canada research chair of evironmental change and society at the University of Regina.

Back at Halifax Water, Campbell says they put this message out because there's been a lot of reports in the news lately of different lakes and beaches being closed because of blue-green algae.

""We just wanted to make sure people have confidence in their water supply,"" he said. ""The water supplied by Halifax Water is perfectly safe.""

Labi Kousoulis said he talked earlier this week with student leaders who are negotiating with the university over the waiver and seeking to have its wording changed or replaced by a code of conduct.

The original waiver required students give up potential legal claims of ""negligence, breach of contract, or breach of any statutory or other duty of care,"" even if the university fails to take reasonable steps to safeguard them from COVID-19 risks.

Kousoulis said he doesn't know what the wording will be going forward, but added the new waiver will not look like the old one.

""At this point, the waiver that was circulated, I'm quite certain will not be the waiver the students will be expected to sign,"" Kousoulis said following cabinet meetings Thursday.

On Monday afternoon, a letter of protest signed by about 350 students, staff, alumni and local residents was sent to university president Andy Hakin calling for the waiver's withdrawal and amendment.

A spokeswoman for the university confirmed Thursday the administration is in discussions with students and other stakeholders including parents and the board of governors, and will ""review its decision to ensure it presents the best way forward.""

The university in Antigonish, N.S., is offering a mix of online and classroom instruction this fall, with 72 per cent of undergraduate courses being offered in-person.

In June, the campus published a detailed plan it said ensured the university would meet public health protocols to prevent spread of the disease. Last week, however, the university emailed students the liability release waiver, asking them to sign before attending classes.

The letter of protest criticized the administration for what it said was a failure to consult students and a ""disregard for student voice.""'

Hakin had distributed an email to the university community stating the waiver was part of the institution's approach to managing risk.

""The university has been advised by our insurers that insurance companies will not provide coverage related to the pandemic by the end of the year,"" Hakin wrote. ""The waiver enables StFX to proceed with plans to have students back on campus, including having students in residence and in-person academic delivery.""

Mount Allison University in Sackville, N.B., and Acadia University in Wolfville, N.S., are also providing in-person classes in the fall, but spokespeople for the universities told The Canadian Press they aren't currently requiring students sign legal waivers.

Navies around the world have described their junior sailors as ""seamen"" for decades if not centuries, with the Royal Canadian Navy using ""ordinary seaman,"" ""able seaman,"" ""leading seaman"" and ""master seaman.""

But those terms are being replaced in Canada as the navy -- which is short hundreds of sailors -- charts new waters to become more diverse and inclusive, according to Cmdr. Deborah-Lynn Gates, who is responsible for the navy's personnel policy.

""We appreciate tradition,"" Gates told The Canadian Press. ""And we're not downplaying tradition absolutely at all. But it's truly a matter for us to show that we are progressive and that we are listening and we are really, truly representative of Canadian society.""

The move is also aimed at making sure the navy's most junior members feel safe and proud of their ranks and jobs, Gates said, acknowledging the double entendre associated with the term ""seaman.""

""What this will do is ensure a safe environment so there is no double entendre,"" she said. ""Definitely at the tactical level, we want to make sure our most junior members understand and feel safe when they are being called their rank, being called their name or being addressed.""

Members of the navy as well as the public at large will be able to vote online on two alternatives starting Friday, with both variants substituting ""sailor"" in place of ""seaman"" in different ways.

One simply replaces ""seaman"" with ""sailor"" in the existing ranks. The other would do away with adjectives such as ""able"" and ""leading"" in favour of labels such as ""sailor first class"" and ""sailor second class.""

There will also be an option to suggest alternative terms.

The poll will be posted online and run until the end of July. The results will feed into senior commanders' decision on which term to use. The suggested change will ultimately need to be approved by cabinet.

The plan to drop ""seaman"" has already prompted backlash on social media, with some criticizing what they see as an overabundance of political correctness and others decrying a loss of tradition. Others, however, say the move is long overdue.

Gates suggested the use of ""seaman"" has been a potential barrier to recruitment for the navy, which has been pushing to address a shortage of 850 sailors. The navy has said it can manage the shortfall at the moment, but is worried about the longer-term implications.

""When they hear you'll start off as an ordinary seaman, it's maybe just a little thing, but it did not resonate,"" Gates said. ""So we know it's not resonating with recruits and for us it's a matter of making sure we're being representative and that we are modern and forward-looking.""

This year the challenge was to bring people together, while also keeping them apart.

“We wanted to bring happiness and warmth to everybody’s hearts,” says Gabrielle Maillet, a community officer.

The New Brunswick city hired two local artists to paint a total of 500 rocks, each one unique and with a connection to the city.

Natasha Hache is one of the artists talking part in the project. She was tasked with coming up with a theme for 250 rocks and has painted, on average, 15 a day.

“I like to go for drives very often, so sometimes when I’d go for a drive I’d get inspired from what I would see. So I’d be like ‘I remember this,’ go back home and try to paint the feeling I had with it too, because I paint a lot with emotions when I do it and I experiment a lot with colours,” says Hache.

Starting Wednesday, the rocks will be hidden throughout the city’s parks and trails. If you find one, you can keep it.

“We’re going out in all the trails and all the parks and we’re going to try to hide them well, because we want this to spread as long as it can so it’s going to be a nice treasure hunt,” says Maillet.

“While the parade offers incredible opportunities for gathering and celebration, pride is more than just that one event,” says Adam Reid, the executive director of Halifax Pride.

“Pride is a community celebration where we get to celebrate and advocate. So we're doing other things this year that we still think are equally valuable and equally important.”

Reid says it was important to plan some in-person gatherings as well, including a march and candlelight vigil.

“The pride festival is a time for gathering for our community, so while online does offer great opportunities for accessible events, we know how much those in-person opportunities for folks to gather mean to our community,” says Reid.

Pride festivals in Moncton, Saint John, and Fredericton have joined forces to virtually host New Brunswick's first ever provincial pride festival.

Organizers say the first week of the festival has gone so well, they are discussing keeping virtual events post-pandemic.

“Hopefully we'll be able to gather again and have our regular parade, but with virtual we're able to include audiences from across the country and around the world, really,” says Michael Cummings, the president of Saint John Pride.

Social activist group GameChangers902 have been named Halifax Pride ambassadors.

“Black, queer, and trans folks have always been at the forefront of understanding pride as being anti-police brutality and abolitionist at its core. So it kinda feels like pride is now starting to return to some of those ideas, and integrate them in a way that prioritizes the most marginalized and most racialized, which is actually how pride was created,” says Kate MacDonald, 2020 Halifax Pride ambassador.

Pride amplified is this year’s theme, which Reid says speaks to the need to amplify the voices of communities that are all too often sidelined.

“So this is our chance to shine the spotlight on folks like GameChangers902, our incredible ambassadors, and let everyone know about the work they are doing to help bring an end to societal racism and police violence,” says Reid.

Some of the events planned for the week include a virtual art show on Friday, a virtual drag show on Saturday, and the candlelight vigil and march on Monday night. Organizers say physical-distancing will be enforced at all events and recommend attendees wear masks.",[]

The incentive was created to help overcome the loss of tourism revenue because of the COVID-19 pandemic and to stimulate the tourism industry.

Many tourist attractions in New Brunswick are quieter than they normally would be at this time of year, so the provincial government is trying to boost traffic with a new incentive program that offers a 20 per cent rebate on staycations.

""There’s been 15 per cent occupancy in hotels or less,"" said Carol Alderdice, the president of the Tourism Association of New Brunswick. ""It’s just been devastating -- it really has.""

Refunds will be capped at $1,000 and the province has set aside $3 million for the initiative.

Alma, N.B., motel owner Linda Lindsay says the plan offers hope.

""I am very excited by this program,"" Lindsay said. ""It really is going to incentivize people to travel in the province.""

Debra Cooper is visiting from Nova Scotia and would like to see the program extended to tourists from other bubble provinces.

""We are spending quite a bit of money to be here with our cottage, souvenirs and park entrance fees so it would be nice if all Maritimers were allowed the same,"" Cooper said.

The province says the initiative was developed by the Tourism Labour Force Adjustment Committee, which is made up of industry representatives from various sectors, including the Tourism Industry Association of New Brunswick.

""We understand the province's financial situation and we appreciate the support to the industry through this travel incentive program,"" said Alderdice. ""It will benefit our tourism operators and other economic sectors by encouraging New Brunswickers to travel more and spend time in their province this summer.""

The province says there are four types of expenses they will offer rebates on:

accommodations (such as hotels, motels, inns, B&Bs and campsites);

food and drink (such as restaurants and food trucks);

activities (such as entrance fees to attractions, museums, art galleries, cultural events and outdoor adventure activities); and

travel (such as vehicle rentals, ferries and parking).

Residents can apply for the 20 per cent rebate on eligible expenses up to $1,000.

To qualify for the rebate you must be:

a permanent resident of New Brunswick;

have valid and detailed receipts from registered New Brunswick businesses; and

have a paid overnight stay at a New Brunswick accommodation.

A list of eligible expenses and criteria is available online.

Applications for the rebate will be available online and must be submitted between Oct.1 and Oct. 30.

Anyone with questions about the program should contact the New Brunswick Tourism Department at explorenb@gnb.ca.

Another boost to the tourism industry could be on its way.

New Brunswick Premier Blaine Higgs recently floated the idea of opening the Atlantic bubble to people from the Gaspe region of Quebec.

""We would like to welcome folks from Quebec, but we want to make sure the health and welfare and the safety of the residents of New Brunswick is the number one priority,"" said Tourism, Heritage and Culture Minister Bruce Fitch.

It's still in the discussion stage so, for now, the rebate program is what officials hope will lead an economic recovery.",[]

Twenty-two people were killed in the attack, which also affected several communities throughout Nova Scotia's Colchester County, in April.

The fund was announced by the provincial government days after the tragedy, with the aim of supporting the families of those killed, and the affected communities, into the future.

The province partnered with the Red Cross, which accepts donations and manages the fund. To date, the fund has raised $5.5 million, but the Red Cross is still working out how best to distribute the money.

""Regardless of the amount of money distributed, it will never make folks whole again,"" says Bill Lawlor, the director of government relations for the Red Cross in Atlantic Canada.

Lawlor says the Red Cross has a responsibility to administer the funds equitably and is also accountable to the many donors to ensure it's done carefully.

""It's not just a matter of speed, and simply divide by 22 and move on and be done with it,"" he says. ""We want to make sure we provide some equitable distribution to those who have been impacted.""

On Tuesday, a family member of two of the victims expressed concern in a Facebook post about the process.

Harry Bond's parents, Peter and Joy Bond, were killed in the mass shooting.

In his post, Bond writes, ""They [Red Cross] want to know how much life insurance each have received, and what our bills and expenses are…. What business is that of their's [sic]?""

His post drew concern from others online.

CTV News reached out to Harry Bond for an interview, but he did not provide any additional comment or agree to speak to a reporter.

Other families contacted by CTV News did not express any concern over how the fund is being managed.

The Red Cross says it has been in contact with the families to get an understanding of their unique circumstances. Bill Lawlor says that conversation can be a difficult one, but says the Red Cross is not asking families for specific amounts when it comes to their finances.

""But we want to make sure that there's some due diligence on our part, as guardians of the trust, to really get some comprehensive understanding of what has happened,"" Lawlor adds.

Lawlor says some commentary on social media has also suggested the Red Cross is keeping a percentage of the funds to cover administrative expenses but says that is not true and that anyone suggesting that is ""misinformed.""

""When the government of Nova Scotia asked us to be the guardians of this trust, they indicated that they will take care of any administrative expense, so that there's no need to have to take that from the trust itself,"" he says.

That's what Karen Dean has been hoping to hear. She's among those who became concerned after seeing the post online.

The Middle Musquodoboit woman has raised $95,000 so far with sales from the Nova Scotia Strong clothing line she created as a fundraiser.

""I do hope that they will give everybody that money without causing them any more grief,"" says Dean.

Lawlor insists the Red Cross ""will get this right by the families.""

The ""Stronger Together Nova Scotia"" fund is still accepting donations, and Lawlor says the Red Cross will evaluate over the next few months how long to keep it going.

The organization will publish a report online after that so donors can see exactly how their money is being used to help those touched personally by the tragedy.",[]

It's got all the brightly lit nostalgia that's been mostly absent in the year of COVID-19, but there's nothing vintage about this midway's operational plan.

""In the old days, the midway would just be wide open,"" said Nathan Smithers, the general manager of East Coast Amusements. ""We want everybody to come in, pack the midway, nice and busy. That atmosphere is gone now. It's going to be a strict, only so many people that we can keep safely socially distanced.""

Once one group leaves, another can enter.

Rides will be cleaned after every go and employees will be wearing masks.

They say they've had to think of everything.

""There's a lot of products out there that will kill this particular virus, but if you sat down on it and some of the wetness remained it might dye out your clothes,"" Smithers said. ""So now I'm going to be wrecking people's clothes, so I have to find sanitizers that are not too harsh but still approved to fight the virus.""

It all seems counterintuitive for an amusement park, and some don't understand why it's allowed at all.

""It just blows my mind what they're doing here,"" said one observer, who said they definitely won't be attending.

On June 29, Premier Blaine Higgs gave all businesses the go-ahead to reopen.

Some say it's a bit of normalcy that's needed more than ever.

""If they can be careful there, it's the same as being careful at Tim Hortons, it's the same as going to get your groceries -- as long as you're careful,"" said one Fredericton resident.

Smithers says he has been getting some angry calls and emails, but says he needed to do something to survive.

""It's about keeping our employees working and getting them back to work,"" he said. ""If we can't employ them, they're going to find work elsewhere if they can, and we may not have enough staff for next year if we made it through the winter, you know, surviving with zero revenue.""

His operational plan has been given to public health, the city of Fredericton and the New Brunswick provincial exhibition for review.

He is hoping to be open by Thursday afternoon and remain open this weekend and next.",[]

The RCMP received a call about the incident at 3:15 a.m. on July 11. The caller reported that a female had been dragged into the woods and assaulted by a woman and three males with a knife.

Police say she sustained minor injuries. Her age was not released.

In two separate cases, Ontario licence plates have been questioned in New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, and the tone of the response comes as a shock to those who are used to the warm Atlantic Canadian welcome.

Laurie Stewart, a councillor in the village of Petitcodiac, N.B., was enjoying a coffee in Salisbury on Monday.

He was parked in his son's rental car, which had Ontario licence plates, when he was approached by another vehicle.

""They also had their windows down and slowed down and started hollering at me to 'go home!"" and it wasn't just 'go home,' it wasn't nice words at all, and had their fingers out the windows,"" Stewart said.

Stewart says the resistance against plates outside the Atlantic bubble was a shock to him -- and not the welcoming Maritime behaviour he's used to.

""They didn't stop and ask why I was here,"" Stewart said.

There was a similar scenario on Prince Edward Island, where one woman from Ontario is staying at her cottage on the island.

After her 14-day isolation period, she went grocery shopping, where she was asked a series of screening questions, including if she had been outside of Atlantic Canada in the last two weeks to which she replied no and finished her shopping.

""As I was leaving, the security guard talked to me, he asked me whether or not that was my car, he pointed to my car with the Ontario plates, and I said, 'Yes' and he then asked me how long I had been in P.E.I. for,"" said Ontario resident Beverly Carlaw.

Carlaw says she felt she was being questioned a second time because of her plates.

She says she felt it was unwelcoming behaviour and what she calls ""not good for tourism.""

""It's the suspicion,"" she said. ""It's the notion of the 'other' of the person who 'doesn't belong' that comes out very clearly, and that's not how one identifies P.E.I.""

Many say they are feeling self-conscious driving around with licence plates from provinces outside the Atlantic bubble.",[]

So, when history student Misty McKinney discovered a trunk filled with garments from the Victorian era, they were surprised and thrilled.

“The fact that it has survived at all is an absolute miracle and I was just tickled by the condition of most of what was stored in that trunk,” says Bernadette Fowler, an historic garment specialist.

The trunk, which is lined with newspaper from 1867, contained ladies wear and sections of fabric.

“When you look at the velvets and the silk tassels and you look at the glass beading on some of these pieces, this is evening wear or gowns or pieces of gowns that has probably been worn to some of the higher functions in Saint John,” says Fowler.

The trunk, which has most likely been at Loyalist House for 150 years, is unlikely to ever be on public display.

“To put it out on permanent display in Loyalist House, you'd be lucky to get a season out of it. It's going to start showing damage. They fade, they crack, they break down and then it's gone,” says Fowler.

Instead, the garments will be examined and catalogued by professional conservators.

“Being able to see each stitch, and the unfinished pieces with the needle still attached to the garment, it's almost like shaking the hand of the person that made them. You get to meet a piece of them,” says McKinney.",[]

Residents of Heron Gate can visit the COVID-19 pop-up testing location on Cedarwood Drive between 9 a.m. and 1 p.m. Heron Gate is located in Alta Vista Ward, which has the highest rate of COVID-19 cases in Ottawa.

River Ward Councillor Riley Brockington says a pop-up COVID-19 testing centre will be set up from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. at the Heatherington Family Centre. Brockington says ""all welcome"" for testing.

Ottawa Public Health has worked with the Champlain Region Incident Command and Ottawa Paramedics to expand COVID-19 testing beyond the COVID-19 Assessment Centre at Brewer Arena and the two COVID-19 clinics.

In a statement to CTV News Ottawa's Christina Succi on Thursday, Ottawa Public Health said, ""The rate of confirmed cases, sources of infection and socio-demographic characteristics of these clusters are considered when determining recommended sites for mobile testing.""

""It is through this surveillance data that OPH and CHIRC identify the need for mobile testing service based on which communities would benefit most from testing in their community.""

Dr. Paul Roumeliotis also says there should be increased bylaw enforcement targeting bars to make sure establishments are following the COVID-19 measures as they reopen for dine-in service.

Starting Friday, restaurants can open for dine-in service, and gyms, movie theatres and other businesses are allowed to open in Ottawa and eastern Ontario. Bars are allowed to open for dine-in eating, but no dancing or walking around is permitted in the establishment.

""Many of my medical officer of health colleagues were a bit disappointed that bars were actually included,"" said Dr. Roumeliotis about Ontario allowing bars and restaurants to reopen for indoor dining during Stage 3.

""Although you can have the best intentions. You can limit 50 people, don't dance, don't walk around, but if you're drinking and sometimes you lose your inhibitions those things go out the window.""

Speaking on Newstalk 580 CFRA's Ottawa at Work with Leslie Roberts, Dr. Roumeliotis noted the Quebec Government has ordered bars to stop serving at 12 a.m. across Quebec following an increase in COVID-19 cases, mostly in Montreal.

""We would have preferred not to have bars right away open. Let's start with dine in restaurants first,"" said Dr. Roumeliotis.

""Essentially they're treating them like dine-in restaurants. You are going to go in, sit down, not walk around, not mingle, not dance. So hopefully those restrictions will be abided by and we won't get the increase cases that we've got in Quebec.""

The Ontario Medical Association released a statement Friday afternoon, calling on the Ontario Government to rethink opening indoor bars.

""The evidence from other jurisdictions is that the reopening of bars carries significant risk,"" said OMA President Dr. Samantha Hill.

""When people consume alcohol, inhibitions are lowered, making them much less likely to practice physical distancing, proper masking behaviours and good hand hygiene. Indoor locations with decreased air ventilation present a particularly high risk of transmission

Host Leslie Roberts asked Dr. Roumeliotis if there should be extra policing of bars and restaurants in the short-term to ensure the rules are followed.

""I think people should be more diligent,"" said Dr. Roumeliotis adding that bylaw officers should conduct enforcement of the COVID-19 rules that encourage physical distancing.

""There should be presence there to ensure that, because to me that's a very high-risk area. So, I think if you're going to do any enforcement, or any policing or any surveillance, it should be really focused on a high-risk area. We have evidence that it's high risk because we've seen it in Quebec.""

Ottawa and eastern Ontario enter Stage 3 of Ontario's COVID-19 reopening plan on Friday, just over a month after entering Stage 2 that allowed more businesses to open.

Host Leslie Roberts asked Dr. Roumeliotis if Ottawa and eastern Ontario will remain in Stage 3 for the ""foreseeable future"" and into the fall. Dr. Roumeliotis said ""yes"", adding there's three phases to the pandemic.

""There is the acute phase which is phase 1, which was March until we entered the second phase, which started with Stage 1. So Phase 2 has three stages, one, two and now we're three,"" said Dr. Roumeliotis about the start of Stage 3 of the business reopening on Friday.

""Phase 3 itself is recovery once we have a vaccine. So, we're going to be in Stage 3 for the foreseeable future, for sure for the next few months for sure, likely most of 2020. I can't predict beyond that.""

Dr. Roumeliotis said it's important for public health units to keep ""all the mechanisms in place"" like contract tracing and surveillance, along with encouraging people to do their part to limit the spread of COVID-19.

""Wear your masks, socially distance, wash your hands, don't go out when your sick,"" said Dr. Roumeliotis.

""Those are the things that kept us safer than other countries as we went through the first wave and those things together, although we're increasing the gatherings and those type of things, I think will be important for us to prevent a second wave.""",[]

While you may be disappointed your summer vacation plans have changed, it gives you a chance to explore your own neighbourhood in Ottawa.

Is there a Hidden Gem in your neighbourhood that you’ve discovered?

Like many of us, Paul Masson has been at home during the pandemic. Early on, he decided to get some fresh air in Ottawa.

""This gave me kind of a reason to go and look; to seek places that I haven’t been to before.”

He explored his own neighbourhood, and found a spot that he’s never been to - tucked away, in a wooded area of Bells Corners.

“I decided to follow the paths, kind of like the Robert Frost poetry; you take the path less travelled… I came across really nice little brooks and trickling water.”

He is not alone; many have taken to exploring their own neighbourhood. Tamara Hinternberger is used to travelling.

“Normally, I’ve always left town to do my adventuring and my discovering; and, because of the pandemic that took that out of the equation for me. So, I needed to find new places to go, to help ease the isolation and the loneliness, so I started just walking around the neighbourhood… I’ve seen so many things that I never knew were here.”

She started off close to home.

“One day when I was sitting at the locks, I saw the trail behind and I walked behind the Parliament buildings; and I found the staircase that leads up to the summer pavilion there.”

One step - leading to many more.

“Walked up - I think its 287 steps; and, I could see different parts of the Ottawa River and into Quebec, and it was just stunning how beautiful it was.”

She expanded her walk to head out even further; eventually walking 10 to 20 kilometres per day.

“I’ve just walked around, you know - only probably a small portion of the city; but I’ve seen so many things that I never knew were here.”

Coming across various pathways, trails, wooded areas; all, while meeting people also out for the first time.

“Now, I found that people are friendlier; they’re very respectful of social distancing, but people will stop in the park and talk to you - and everyone just seems to have a genuine concern for how people are doing now.”

Ashley Gentile found a spot that she’s never noticed before near the Earl Armstrong Bridge - which, connects Barrhaven and Riverside South,

“There’s like a dock, where you can view the sunset; and then there’s a path across the river - the Rideau River… Because of COVID, I’ve been trying to get outside more and started walking more.”

It has given her a change of scenery from work and school at home.

“It’s been great to like, discover my neighbourhood more; and figure new spots; I’m really glad that I discovered that spot.”

Hinterberger realized she does not necessarily need to travel all over the world to find something new,

“It’s been great to like, discover my neighbourhood more; and figure new spots; I’m really glad that I discovered that spot.”

Ottawa has many trails, bike paths, and spots to explore in your own neighbourhood. If you’re heading out somewhere new, be safe. The City of Ottawa reminds everyone to keep physical distancing and be aware of any dangers, such as ticks or drowning.

Council approved the City of Ottawa's new mandatory face mask bylaw on Wednesday requiring people to wear masks in enclosed public spaces during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the bylaw includes an exemption that allows employees working in non-public areas or behind a physical barrier to go maskless while working in public buildings.

""The intent of the bylaw is to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission in enclosed public spaces where close contact between persons is likely and increase the risk of spreading COVID-19,"" said Ottawa Public Health in a statement to CTV News Ottawa.

""There may be some areas of the premises that preclude public access, thereby reducing the risk of transmission between patrons and employees. However, COVID-19 can be transmitted between employees sharing these spaces and between patrons and employees when items are exchanged.""

Ottawa Public Health encourages all workers to wear masks within the establishment, ""including those who are behind physical barriers.""

The health unit tells CTV News Ottawa that masks decrease the risk of COVID-19 from respiratory droplets that may enter around the sides of a physical barrier and contamination of surfaces behind the physical barrier by infected employees.

The City of Ottawa's mandatory face mask bylaw covers the following places:

Calypso waterpark in Limoges is not allowed to open.

Waterparks and amusement parks are not included in the third phase of the province’s reopening plan.

“We were really disappointed because we were pretty sure that Calypso was part of phase 3,” said Sandra Nadeau, Director of sales, marketing and communications for Calypso.

""The initial framework had said waterparks would be included, and so we were surprised because we had already started working with our local waterpark, Calypso,"" added Dr. Paul Roumeliotis, the Eastern Ontario Medical Officer of Health.

Dr. Roumeliotis said he has worked with Calypso in the past weeks on a plan he felt was ready to reopen.

He said the plan is “very well thought out”.

“I’m hoping that the committee that reviews the exemptions, agrees with my opinion, we believe that they can open safely,” said Dr. Roumeliotis.

The plan includes physical distancing measure throughout the park, sanitization stations, mandatory masks in indoor areas, as well as comprehensive sanitization of items like tubes and mats used on water slides.

Calypso says its plan has been submitted to the Ontario government — but it needs an answer on reopening soon.

“We need an answer, you know, right now, because we’re holding all these employees and trying to keep them, to work with us this summer, but there’s only a month and a half left,” said Nadeau.

“We do have their proposal, we are bringing it forward, we are bringing it to the command table with the chief medical officer of health, and once that is cleared, we’ll let folks know,” said Lisa McLeod, Minister of Heritage, Sport, Tourism, and Culture.

While Calypso fights for a chance to reopen this summer, it’s a different story across the border in Quebec.

“So far, it’s a success, for us it is,” said Emilie Desagne-Bouchard, Communications and Marketing Manager for Mont Cascades. “We were scared not to be able to reopen so we can totally feel how Calypso’s feeling.”

Medical Officer of Health Dr. Vera Etches announced that Ottawa Public Health is mandating the use of masks in indoor public spaces to help limit the spread of COVID-19.

Ottawa Public Health has tips for washing, re-using, storing and discarding a cloth mask or face covering after using it on its website.

The health unit says masks or face coverings become contaminated, especially when touched by your hands.

Removing the mask:

Ottawa Public Health says, ""after washing your hands with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, remove your mask by pulling the ties or ear loops away from your ears.""

Washing the mask:

If your mask has a removable, non-reusable filter, make sure to remove and throw out the filter before machine washing or hand-washing your mask.

When using a washing machine, Ottawa Public Health says put the cloth mask directly into the washing machine or in a bag that can be emptied into the washing machine. Throw out the bag after you have used it to store your mask.

Wash your hands again with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer after handling your mask.

Wash the masks with other laundry using a hot water cycle.

For hand-washing the cloth face mask, Ottawa Public Health says use laundry detergent and water as hot as you can stand, then dry thoroughly.

If you are discarding damaged or worn out masks, drop them in a lined garbage bin.

Ottawa Public Health says do not leave any discarded masks in places where others can come in contact with them such as shopping carts, public seats, but stops or on the ground.

Reusing your face mask

Ottawa Public Health says cloth masks may be re-used throughout the day, ""if not soiled and undamaged.""

When removing your face mask, public health says ""with clean hands, remove the mask from your face and fold it in half so that the outer space is inwards (so that the contaminated outer surface is not contacting anything during storage) and place it in a clean, sealable bag until ready to use it again the same day.""

Can I wear my cloth mask all day?

Ottawa Public Health says a mask can be worn all day as long as it does not become damaged, damp or dirty.

""Do not share your mask with others,"" the health unit says.

""Remove your mask with clean hands when you are safely able to do so and wash your hands using soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.""

Storing your face mask during the day

Ottawa Public Health reminds people ""do not place your used mask into your pocket.""

When reusing a mask, place it in a clean, sealable bag until ready to use it again the same day.""

Disposable masks

Ottawa Public Health says disposable masks should not be washed, reused or recycled.",[]

TikTok lets users record and post short video clips. It's proven incredibly popular, especially with teens and people in their early 20s.

However, security experts and some U.S. politicians have issued warnings about the app's origins and about what it does in the background when it is and is not being used, prompting some companies to tell their employees to remove it from their phones.

Carmi Levy, the director of content marketing at the London, Ont.-based Info-Tech Research Group tells Newstalk 580 CFRA's ""The Goods with Dahlia Kurtz"" that TikTok collects far more data than it needs and he's advising smartphone users to delete it.

""This app is bad news,"" Levy says. ""We're just not paying attention. Everyone is so focused on sharing cute little videos of their dogs dancing to fun music that they don't realize that, in the background, this app is probably one of the worst of the worst that we've ever seen in the era of smartphones.""

Levy says the popularity of TikTok with young people is part of the reason he's warning people about the risks.

""It is a relatively young demographic that doesn't see smartphone apps as a risk,"" he says.

Levy points to the permissions TikTok asks the user to approve before they can use it.

""The app is deliberately built to access everything on your phone. When you install it, it pops up a little message saying, 'Do you give us the right to access your contacts, your schedule, your camera, your mic, your location services?' Everything. Of course, you say 'yes' because you want to use it.""

Levy also warned that a Chinese company called ByteDance makes the app, which leaves them open to influence by China's communist government.

TikTok has said it stores user data on U.S.-based servers that aren't subject to Chinese law. It has also denied sharing user data with the Chinese government and has insisted it would not do so, if asked.

Nevertheless, Levy still warns that the data the app collects is far broarder than it needs to be.

""This app collects so much information on us,"" Levy says. ""It's not just within the app; it's everything else that we're doing. You post something on Facebook: TikTok knows. You tweet something: TikTok knows. You go to the store to buy something: TikTok knows.""

Earlier this week, Amazon told its staff to delete the app in a companywide email, before backtracking about five hours later, saying the directive was a mistake.

Below are some of Levy's tips for keeping your data safe.

'Is it reasonable?' Check your permissions

Levy says apps of all kinds ask for permission to use certain things, like your microphone, camera, or location. Just because an app wants to access those things does not make it dangerous, but he says to consider whether the request is reasonable.

""Ask yourself, when you're installing an app, what are the reasonable things this app should be asking for in order to do its job?"" He says. ""It makes sense for Google Maps to ask for access to location services. Similarly, if it's a scheduling or collaboration app, it should probably have access to our calendar and contacts. There should also be controls within the app to allow us to turn those accesses off if we wish but still use the app.

""The problem with TikTok is it asks for everything, even if the services aren't related to what the app is trying to do.""

Get rid of apps you're not using

Levy suggests reviewing your apps regularly, and being more cynical about downloading new ones.

""We need to start looking at what we download and what we use it for, and we need to be a lot more careful about what we say yes to and what we hold on to over time,"" Levy says.

Levy says apps that are not on your smartphone's front screen are used less often.

""If you're not using that, get rid of it,"" he says. ""If you're not using them regularly, they're still most likely collecting information in the background.""

Be choosy about new apps

""Look at each app not just as something cool that all your friends are using,"" Levy says. ""Only download the things you're going to use. Worry that these apps are, in fact, spyware. Assume an app is spyware until it proves otherwise. When you're on the app store, read the page. See where it comes from, see how many times it's been downloaded, look at what other people are saying about it, look online and read the reviews.""

He also warns that some apps will install more than one icon, and you may not know you're installing multiple apps if you just rush to download something.

Review your settings, app by app, regularly

""Go into your settings. It will actually tell you which apps are accessing which services. Go through them one at a time and ask yourself, 'am I really comfortable with that?' Turn off the accesses that are not comfortable for you,"" Levy says.

""Apps are always doing stuff in the background that we may or may not know about, so we've got to keep them honest and do regular maintenance.""

Levy suggests setting an alarm in your calendar once a month to remind yourself to review your apps.

""When it pops up, take an hour or half an hour, and just go through your devices for things that look funny because, chances are, if they look funny to you, they are problematic and you're going to want to shut them down now.""

Family and friends of Nick Tanti, who was stabbed to death in February, said they're upset the man accused of killing Tanti is out on bail while awaiting trial.

Aiden Kee, 26, was granted bail for $104,000 on Wednesday afternoon.

""I'm so upset,"" Nick's mom, Sharon, said outside the courthouse. ""I'm disgusted.""

Tanti, 27, was stabbed outside a downtown Guelph bar on Feb. 29. He was taken to hospital, where he later died of his injuries.

""I know his close friends will never recover from it,"" Nick's friend Danielle Wilson said.

Aiden Kee and his brother Angus Kee, 22, are both facing first-degree murder charges in Nick's death. At the time, police said they were all known to each other.

Angus was granted $75,000 bail in May.

Police escorted Aiden from the courthouse after his release.

""I am very disappointed in Canada's legal system,"" Sharon said. ""It is not a legal system, it is a freedom system where you don't have to do anything at all and you get out on bail.""

Defence lawyer Ari Goldkind, who isn't involved in the case, told CTV News Kitchener the circumstances are extremely rare.

""No matter what the charge is, our criminal code does not prevent bail on any charge where the circumstances warrant,"" Goldkind said.

Aiden's defence lawyer declined to comment to CTV News Kitchener. His next court appearance is scheduled for July 21.

On Tuesday, the Canadian Human Rights Commission said Canadians shouldn't be using the cards for mask exemptions, even if they look real.

A collective of anti-lockdown groups in and around Toronto is behind the cards. One representative said they were created as an education tool for businesses about masking exemptions.

Many regions in southern Ontario have adopted mandatory face covering policies. Waterloo Region's bylaw took effect on Monday, and Brant County and the City of Brantford voted in favour of similar bylaws on Tuesday night.

Huron and Perth Counties will require masks in indoor public spaces on Friday.

In all cases, there are exemptions for people with medical conditions preventing them from wearing masks.

The camps will run between Aug. 4 and Sept. 4. They're open to children and youth between the ages of four and 12.

Registration will open on July 15 at 9 a.m. on a first come, first served basis. Parents can register by phone at 519-837-5699 or online at Rec Enroll. Anyone paying cash can do so at city hall.

“We’re excited to provide a safe, inclusive and exciting camp experience as we welcome kids back to camp this summer,” Lynne Briggs, manager of Recreation Services, said in a news release. “We’ve modified our program to ensure the health and safety guidelines set out by the Province of Ontario and Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health are followed to keep everyone safe.”

The camps will shift towards outdoor activities, all while promoting physical distancing between campers and counsellors. The indoor pool will remain closed, the city said.

City officials said they will also cap camps at eight campers and two counsellors per age group.

Everyone will be screened before entering camps. All children will get their own supply kits, rather than sharing between groups.

Camps will run from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the West End Community Centre and River Run Centre. There are a maximum of 50 campers per week between the two locations. Parents can register their children for a maximum of two weeks.",[]

The regions will move into Stage 3 of the province's economic recovery plan, along with most public health units in Ontario, the provincial government announced Monday.

Region of Waterloo Public Health’s Acting Medical Officer of Health Dr. Hsiu Li Wang said the region was notified on the move into Stage 3 on Monday afternoon.

""This will be a welcome update for many in our community,"" she said. ""We are able to move to Stage 3 because of the efforts of our residents to date.""

Dr. Wang said people will need to remain vigilant as more businesses open their doors.

""I ask all residents to please continue to follow the public health measures to slow the spread of COVID-19 in our community,"" she added.

Mandatory masking bylaws came into effect in the region on Monday. People need to wear masks in all indoor public spaces and on public transit, with some exceptions.

Waterloo Mayor Dave Jaworsky said the move into Stage 3 is ""welcome news for those businesses who have been waiting patiently.""

""We can't lose sight of the fact, however, that we are still in the midst of a pandemic and we cannot let our guard down,"" an emailed statement from Jaworsky said in part. ""This is still a serious issue and we must follow physical distancing.""

He also advised businesses to be deliberate in their plans to welcome people back through their doors and stick to guidelines from public health officials to avoid another shut down in the future.

""Only open when you're absolutely ready, don't rush it,"" he said. ""Nothing is more important than keeping everyone healthy.""

Businesses such as the Apollo Cinema in Kitchener, are getting ready to welcome people back to their theatre.

""We are super excited,"" Director of Operations Cara Watson said. ""We have been slowly planning our reopening.""

The theatre has one screen, with seating for about 300 people. It will be restricted to 50 people under Stage 3 to follow the province's guidelines.

""We already planned to space out our seating and have designated seats within the theatre for people to sit in, to ensure spacing between groups of individuals,"" Watson said.

F45 Training Kitchener Sportsworld owner Brittany McLean said she's thrilled to be able to open again soon.

""It's been a really long four months of constantly pivoting to create ways to keep our members engaged,"" she said.

While restaurants can allow patrons inside again, physical distancing measures have made reopening not a viable option for some local businesses.

""We have eight tables, so to social distance it's two to three tables, which really will not pay the bills,"" said Dulce Baptista, owner of Breakfast, Blues & BBQs.

Baptista said the restaurant will stay closed, but she'll keep focusing on a food truck.

""Previously, people were driving to the restaurant, so I hope people will still drive to us,"" she said.

Indoor gathering sizes will increase to up to 50 people, a large increase from the 10 people currently allowed under Stage 2. Outdoor gatherings can be up to 100 people under Stage 3. People will need to maintain physical distance if they're gathering with people outside of their social circle.

The provincial government says certain activities won't be allowed because they are considered high-risk for the spread of COVID-19, including amusement parks, water parks, buffets, dancing at restaurants, and saunas and steam rooms.

Some regions, including the Toronto-area, Niagara and Windsor, will stay in Stage 2.

Guelph’s Precision Biomonitoring and Biomeme, a Philadelphia company, both usually work in DNA testing. Together, they developed a test for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The mobile testing platform can deliver results for up to nine samples in about an hour, the company said in a news release.

“This approval is the result of the dedication and commitment of our teams at Precision Biomonitoring and Biomeme, as well as ongoing collaboration with our validation partners,” Dr. Mario Thomas, CEO of Precision Biomonitoring, said in a news release. “This rapid test can now be distributed everywhere across Canada, especially in remote areas and workplaces where creating virus-free zones is vital. We can now bring the lab to the sample.”

Currently, people need to visit a testing centre and wait several days for results.

The SARS-CoV-2 Real-Time RT-PCR Test will be deployed across the country now that it's approved.

The approval aligns with the federal government's plan to work with innovative companies to combat the pandemic, according to Precision Biomonitoring.

The government says the hospital had been working with staff at the home for weeks to contain the virus' spread.

In early May, the government issued an emergency order allowing it to appoint temporary managers to long-term care homes that are unable to contain outbreaks.

Environment Canada issued a heat warning for the city earlier on Friday, warning that a tropical air mass will bring several days of temperatures in the low to mid 30s with humidex values likely to make it feel closer to 40 at times.

The weather agency said that the hot conditions will last until “at least Monday.”

Speaking with reporters during a press conference outside a North York community centre on Friday, Tory said that the city is “very, very close” to advancing to stage three of the province’s reopening plan but can’t afford a “series of intensive crowd scenes where people don’t follow the health guidelines,” something that he said is a concern whenever the temperatures spike.

“We have seen what happens when people just assume there is no problem and behave themselves accordingly and the result would be that we can’t open the city up as wide as we want to anytime soon,” he warned. “I would just ask people that if you go to a place and it looks like it is already a big crowd scene think about going somewhere else and if you are on a beach and there are other people there, which inevitably on weekends like this there will be, please consider wearing a face covering even though it may not be a natural place to do it.”

There have already been a number of large parties that have taken place at Woodbine Beach and Cherry Beach so far this summer and as a result the city has begun closing the parking lots at some of its beaches after 7 p.m. on weekends.

There have also, at times, been large crowds reported at other beaches with people not always following physical distancing guidelines.

Earlier this month, large crowds actually prompted officials in Wasaga Beach to limit the number of beachfront parking spots available and begin limiting the number of people allowed onto the beach. Other cities, however, have not followed suit.

On Friday, Tory said he understands that people will be looking for ways to “get outside and get some relief from the heat” this weekend but he said that he hopes that desire does not get in the way of public health advice, which still stipulates that people should be at least two metres apart from those outside of their circles.

“I ask for your cooperation because in the end it is for your benefit,” he said. “ Your ability to have a good time sooner in the city, a real good time, a broadened out good time in more places whether it is sports or patios or restaurants, will depend on the degree to which we make the effort to follow the health advice now.”",[]

The city normally offers hundreds of different day camps and summer recreational programs but it had to cancel all of it back in May due to concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Since then it has created a modified summer day camp program known as “CampTO” but due to the need to ensure physical distancing there are thousands fewer spaces available for Toronto youth; not to mention less choice as the programming at all of the reimagined camps is identical.

During a press conference outside Oakdale Community Centre on Friday morning, Mayor John Tory announced that the city hopes to partially fill the gap in programming this summer through the launch of two new free summer drop-in programs for youth at up to 100 local parks.

The first program, ParksPlayTO will be for any child aged 12 and under who are accompanied by a caretaker. Tory said that recreational staff will lead participants in a range of activities, including nature exploring, gardening, active games, arts and crafts, family fitness, storytelling and music circles.

The second program, Summer in the 6IX, will be for young people between the ages of 13 and 24. Tory said that programming for the older group will be more broad and will include dance, fitness, ecology and sports as well as leadership and employment.

“It has been a very challenging year for young people. We often talk about their parents and others but we forget sometimes that kids can find it challenging too. They don’t have the structure in their life of going to school, seeing their friends or even being able to play some of the games because even now as we reopen the city there is restrictions placed on how sports fields can be used,” he said.

“This program is meant to help address that and make sure that kids do have something that they can do this summer.”

The city elected not to hire more than 8,000 recreation workers this summer after it cancelled most of its planned programs.

Tory, however, said that the new drop-in programs will create employment opportunities for some young people.

As for the programming itself, he said that public health considerations will be top of mind with enhanced sanitization procedures and a policy that will require all participants to leave their contact information in the event that it is need for the purposes of contact tracing.

“All of these programs we have had to redesign and launch later in the summer, the delay in part is because we have had to take into account new considerations,” he said.

Both programs will begin on July 20 and run for the rest of the summer.

Its investigators have also interviewed 14 additional witnesses, including seven police officers.

However, the agency says it's been made aware of another witness who was at the apartment at the time of Korchinski-Paquet's death, and is trying to speak to that person.

The SIU says it has asked the family's legal team, which is conducting its own investigation, to identify any additional witnesses and provide any information about the case as soon as possible.

Speaking at Craven Farms in Chatham, Ont. as part of his “summer tour” on Thursday, Premier Doug Ford applauded the agreement, thanking the federal government for the “desperately needed funding.”

“This historic agreement proves what we can do as a nation when we stand united,” Ford said. “My friends, make no mistake, by standing united, by standing together as a province, Ontario was in a strong position to get a deal from the federal government.”

Last month Ford said that Ontario needed $23 billion in federal assistance to prevent service cuts and keep municipalities from running deficits, something they are not legally allowed to do. But on Thursday the premier didn’t seem concerned about the drastically lower amount in federal funding they would be receiving, calling it a “great deal for Canada and a great deal for Ontario.”

No further details were released on how the province will divvy up the $7 billion or when they will get the funding.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau made the funding announcement in Ottawa Thursday afternoon and said that seven priority areas were outlined in the provincial agreements. The priorities included testing for COVID-19, the purchase of personal protective equipment, supporting vulnerable populations and ensuring childcare availability.

He also said some of the funding will be earmarked for municipalities, but said it was up to each province to decide how to allocate the money.

""Our towns and cities have been at the forefront of responding to COVID-19,” Trudeau said. “Cities must remain up and running if our economy is to eventually get back up and running. If cities aren’t equipped for a safe restart, people will not be safe.""

Trudeau added that provinces would not be allowed to “take money from one bucket and put it in another.”

The announcement comes after months of advocacy by big city mayors, who have argued that they are “bleeding” millions of dollars as businesses were shuttered and residents asked to stay home to help curb the spread of the novel coronavirus.

Toronto Mayor John Tory has renewed this call multiple times since the pandemic was declared in March, saying that without emergency funding thousands of city employees would have to be laid off and a number of critical services would have to be cut.

Toronto is said to be losing about $65 million a week in revenue because of the pandemic and officials predict the city could be out at least $1.5 billion by the end of 2020.

This estimation is based on a three-month lockdown and six-month recovery period and does not take a potential second wave of COVID-19 into account.

Following Ford’s news conference, Tory spoke with reporters about the funding and thanked both the federal and provincial governments for their “unflagging efforts,"" calling the agreement a “big deal.”

He said that he hopes to hear from the premier before the next city council meeting at the end of the month about how the money will be allocated.

""While we await further details as to the allocation of these funds to cities and towns across Ontario and indeed across Canada, I know Premier Ford is mindful of the size and the scale of transit systems in Toronto and the rest of the GTA and the tremendous damage that has been inflicted upon the transit systems by the pandemic,” Tory said.

“I’m confident that those realities will cause the premier and his government to ensure that Toronto’s particular challenges are fairly addressed when the allocation of these funds are finally done.”

The mayor said that he is “cautiously optimistic” that the new funding will help the city avoid some cuts, but also said he would have to see “the fine print” before making any promises to residents.",[]

It happened shortly after 10 a.m. at a construction site at Simcoe and Wellington streets downtown.

Helicopter footage showed the crumpled crane collapsed on top of an office building. Some of the upper windows of the building also appear to have been smashed.

While some reports from the scene indicated there may be injuries, Toronto Fire said that is not the case.

“The operator is not injured. She made her way down with the assistance of one of her colleagues and was down upon our arrival,” Fire Chief Mathew Pegg told reporters at the scene.

It’s not clear if anyone was inside the affected offices when the crane struck the building. That building and two adjacent buildings have now been evacuated as a precaution.

Pegg said firefighters’ main concern is public safety in the event of any further collapse.

“We just need to deal with the public safety hazard, given I am told the crane is just about 200 feet in the air,” Pegg said. “We need to secure that and make sure that it doesn’t end up with a subsequent incident.”

He said a collapse perimeter has been established around the crane in case there is further movement.

“Obviously we can’t control or prevent the movement or failure of the crane at this point. We are taking every precaution we can to make sure that it is secured,” Pegg said.

He said stormy weather conditions could complicate those efforts.

“We’re having to keep an eye on the weather. Fortunately it’s OK right now but we’re paying particular attention to weather moving through. We have to be very vigilant about things like heavy rain, wind and the potential for lightning, but so far so good.”

Pegg said Toronto Fire will remain at the scene until engineers come in to take over and see to the safe removal of the crane.

On Thursday night, Toronto Fire District Chief Stephan Powell said the dismantling of the crane has been halted due to inclement weather. It will resume on Friday morning.

Local roads around the site have been closed off as a precaution.

It’s not yet clear what caused the structure to fail.

Ontario Premier Doug Ford said on Tuesday that the province’s health officials are working on a strategy to handle a second wave should one hit the province and will release the plan ""shortly.""

""We have a plan that will be rolling out and we're prepared,"" he said. ""We are 100 times better, more prepared now in health care and PPEs ... but we can never, ever, ever, let our guard down.""

But when would a second wave be most likely?

Many experts believe the answer is in the fall when influenza season returns, but Tim Sly, an epidemiologist and professor emeritus at Ryerson University's School of Public Health, said while there is no way to be certain with a new disease, he believes it will likely be driven by public behaviour.

""That’s what we are really talking about with a second wave, it's a relaxing of the precautions put in place in the first place,"" Sly told CTV News Toronto on Wednesday. ""As we relax them, sure enough it comes back.""

Sly said that because only a small percentage of Ontarians have been infected with COVID-19, the population has little immunity to the virus. He said it wouldn't take loosening public health measures by much to increase the spread and potentially spark a second wave.

Ontario, which has a population of 14.5 million people, has had about 37,000 confirmed cases of the virus.

""The analogy I like is the one of a bone-dry forest floor: We managed to prevent everyone from smoking, no camp fires, no cigarettes, strict adherence, but the forest floor is still 97 per cent ready to go up.""

""It just takes one match, so we can suppress the bits of smoke and be proud of that, but it's ready to surge into fire again the moment people start breaking the rules.""

""As you relax and let down the guard, that’s when it (the second wave) takes place and you can see it happening in the United States.""

Stage 3 introduces 'heightened risk' of renewed spread

The CEO of the Ontario Hospital Association, Anthony Dale, said that while the province's economic recovery is vital, so too will be preparing for a possible second wave of patients.

""By its very nature, moving to Stage 3 introduces heightened risk of renewed spread,"" Dale said in a statement on Tuesday. ""As a result, it is essential that Ontario's health-care system be ready for further outbreaks and a second wave of the pandemic. Nothing should be taken for granted.""

Dale said the province must develop a contingency plan to ensure regional service and staffing plans are in place ahead of the surge.

Resources must also be provided to health-care services outside of hospitals, Dale said, with the OHA calling for a ""widespread expansion"" of home care, community services and virtual care.

Surveillance video released by Toronto police shows an example of one such incident.

In the video, one of the thieves stands near the front door of the house and pulls out a device that captures the signal being emitted from the keyless fob, which is somewhere near the entrance inside the house.

The device, a radio frequency amplifier, captures the fob’s signal from inside the house and extends it so that it can reach the car.

The boosted signal then unlocks the car and also starts the vehicle's engine.

The thieves then simply drive away with the vehicle.

The survey was conducted on behalf of the Ontario Public School Boards Association (OPSBA) during the final week in June, when Ontario schools were still developing plans for September and before portions of the province were authorized to move into Stage 2 of the province’s reopening plan.

While the poll found that 53 per cent of parents with children in the public school system are comfortable or somewhat comfortable with returning to school in September, 43 per cent said they were uncomfortable or somewhat uncomfortable with the idea.

Nanos Research also found 12 per cent of parents will likely keep their children at home in the fall, while 32 per cent are considering the idea.

The poll also found that parents living in northern and southwestern Ontario are much more comfortable with the idea of students returning to school in September, than parents living in urban centres. In Toronto, for example, just 44 per cent of parents said they were comfortable for students, staff and education workers returning to school.

OPSBA President Cathy Abraham said while the poll is a snapshot at the end of June, it gives educators and school boards a better picture of parents' state of mind about their children mingling together during what could be the second wave of the pandemic.

""It really gives us solid evidence that these are the things that parents and our communities are worried about, are thinking about and are talking about,"" Abraham told CTV News Toronto.

""It's valuable information. It gives us something that we can go to the ministry [of education] and say we need to talk.""

The results could also throw a wrench in the province's back to school plans, since Premier Doug Ford and Education Minister Stephen Lecce have both expressed a desire to see students returning to school five days a week with a maximum class size of 15.

Lecce has asked school boards to consider three options for the fall, including a full-day in class model, a learn-from-home option and a hybrid of the two.

If students are expected to learn from home, the OPSBA poll found that more than 90 per cent of parents say it’s important for elementary school students to have ""real-time, live interaction with their teacher and other students.""

For in-school learning, which Ford has said is the preferred option, the poll found parents are ""nearly twice as likely to agree"" that spending on education is more important than eliminating the deficit.

Respondents to the poll identified cleaning supplies, student transportation, creative learning environments, support for students, and more online learning professional development for teachers as priorities for education spending.

Carlene Jackson says that if the board chooses to cohort some or all of its elementary student population into groups of 15 in September, they would “be creative” and find a new way to deliver French language instruction.

“We are looking at various models and trying to be creative to ensure that we are able to continue to provide delivery of French,” she told CP24 on Thursday, adding French Immersion would continue.

“We’ve never planned or stated that we would be cancelling French Immersion – just wanted to make that very, very clear.”

She said they’d also look for additional occasional teachers qualified to teach French.

Her comments come one day after the board released several scenarios for when classes resume in September.

The Board says that cohorting some or all of the elementary student population into groups of no more than 15, something public health experts support, would cost between $20 and $249 million extra for the year, even if classes are let out early and things like French are taught differently.

Even just bringing kids back with normal class sizes and regular public health measures such as use of PPE and ending certain uses of TDSB property could cost the board $22 million extra for the first four months of the school year.

“If we went with back to school full time with regular class sizes there is no additional cost other than the health and safety measures that we need to put in place, which also have a quite hefty cost,” Jackson said.",[]

It says this will give consumers more options for delivery services when buying alcohol from Ontario retailers, including the LCBO and The Beer Store.

The province also says it is removing the requirement for liquor delivery services to obtain a signed receipt as well as restrictions that prevented them delivering to any private space, such as offices.

While Stage 3 of Ontario’s reopening guidelines will permit movie theatres in a wide swath of the province to open this Friday, Cineplex says it will not do so.

“We are still reviewing what's being proposed by the province, so as a result we aren’t in a position to open our theatres in Ontario on Friday,” company spokesperson Sarah Van Lange told BNN.“While we are certainly excited for the day our operations can resume, our top priority has always been the health and safety of our employees and guests and ensuring that their time with us is safe, comfortable and welcoming.”

Ontario’s Stage 3 reopening guidelines state that movie theatres are subject to an occupancy limit of 50 people, excluding staff.

Most large movie theatres in the province could comfortably contain many times that.

Cineplex has 62 multiplexes in Ontario.

Landmark, a chain with ten cinema locations in Ontario, told CP24 the rules as they stand will prevent theatres from opening in the province at all.

“(Ontario’s rules) will prevent the re-opening of movie theatres across the province,” a spokesperson said Wednesday.

“The provision to limit movie theatres to 50 Guests does not recognize the configuration of our properties and the personal space that is afforded to each Guest. Theatres control showtimes, seating layouts, and auditorium capacity to ensure physical distancing can be maintained at all times.”

Speaking on Monday, Finance Minister Rod Phillips said the province was working with theatre operators to find a solution where theatres could possibly welcome more than 50 guests at a time.

“This is an area where Minister (Lisa) McLeod has already been working with the associations that represent theatres, to work on that safe reopening plan that I talked about so you know the kinds of considerations that the Chief Medical Officer is concerned about of course is you know how many washrooms are there, the concession stands, making sure that there aren't too many people so it isn't just about the theatre rooms themselves, it's about the broader facility,” he said.

Provincial industry-specific guidelines don’t appear to be ready for theatres either.

While the province has put out guidance for entertainment, museum and gallery workers, no specific guidance document or advice has been provided for cinemas.

The industry was forced to shut down entirely on March 17 as part of the Ford government’s emergency declaration, which also shut schools, restaurants, daycares and most other indoor spaces.

Ontario’s guidance for cinemas takes a much different approach than other jurisdictions. In Alberta, distancing measures mean cinemas can fill up to about 45 per cent occupancy.

In Saskatchewan, cinemas are capped at 30 per cent occupancy.",[]

Mayor John Tory has confirmed that the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario has launched an investigation into MARBL, located in the city's downtown.

A video originally published to Instagram shows dozens of patrons crammed into a partially outdoor seating section while surrounded by unmasked employees carrying drinks.

A version posted to Twitter had been viewed more than 18,000 times by Tuesday and triggered outcry online.

Many social media users called on local and provincial authorities to strip the bar of its liquor licence.

MARBL confirmed in a statement to The Canadian Press that the video was authentic, but insisted it did not show the restaurant was breaking public health rules.

""When thunderstorms began in the middle of service on Friday, we were forced to bring the group under the covered portion of our patio to finish their evening. The two minutes of footage that has been shared is an anomaly and not reflective of the rest of the evening, which was all socially distanced,"" the club's statement said.

Tory, however, said public health guidelines apply to all restaurants and bars under current Stage 2 restrictions, regardless of the weather conditions.

""I think it was made fairly clear at the beginning that ... people who are on the outdoor patios, which were permitted, would have to seek shelter elsewhere other than piling into these establishments,"" Tory told a news conference on Monday.

MARBL on King St. has once again shown they don’t give a damn about physical distancing.

The majority of total deaths to date have been reported in people over the age of 79. One person under the age of 19 who had COVID-19 has died in Ontario, but it is not clear if the death was caused by the disease or other health issues.

Eleven patients who died were between the ages of 20 and 39, while 111 were between the ages of 40 and 59, and 722 were between the ages of 60 and 79.

More than 1,800 people over the age of 80 have died of the disease.

COVID-19 testing in Ontario

In the last 24 hours, just over 25,726 COVID-19 tests were conducted by officials.

Ontario health officials have conducted nearly 1.7 million tests for the disease since the pandemic was declared.

More than 16,000 tests are still under investigation.",[]

“I nearly passed out. I thought where am I going to get the money to pay that bill,"" Kenny Wong said, speaking to CTV News Toronto.

Wong said he bought the property in February and he received the bill in June.

“It’s $38,000 and that's the outstanding water bill from the previous owner,"" Wong said.

Wong explained that on closing the deal for the property, his lawyer didn't check to see if the utility bills were paid in full. The home was vacant for a year and a half and he now believes a water pipe must have burst while the home sat empty.

“I called Alectra Utilities and they said due to privacy reasons I’m not entitled to know anything [about the previous owner] which is really frustrating, but they are demanding I pay the $38,000 outstanding.""

Wong feels the utility companyshould have known something was wrong and questioned why a bill would get that high.

“Why didn't they do anything about it? I mean that is really, really off the charts to add up to those kinds of dollars,"" Wong said.

When CTV News Toronto reached out to Alectra a spokesperson explained that they tried to collect the money from the the seller, but were unsuccessful.

“Mr. Wong was not informed about the water account arrears until the sale had closed,"" the spokesperson said. “It is the purchaser’s responsibility to ensure they understand any costs and arrears related to the property they are buying.”

Wong did purchase title insurance and has filed a claim hoping it will cover the cost of the bill. Alectra has now assigned an agent to Wong's s case and hopes the two sides can reach a reasonable resolution.

The most common reason for high water bills in the GTA is a running toilet. A single leaky toilet can waste more than 900 cubic metres of water in a month creating a water bill of more than $2,600.",[]

“One of the greatest things we have seen is the number of new families who are looking to get into boating to connect with their families,"" Rick Layzell, a member of the Boating Ontario Association, tells CTV News Toronto.

Layzell says families are looking for new ways to have fun while keeping physically distant from others and that boating is one of the best ways to do that.

Andre Ganton is with United City Yachts, a company that specializes in selling large pre-owned boats, and says that many people are trying out boating for the first time while others are selling their smaller boats to upgrade up to larger one.

“My feeling is we are going to have one of our best years in a decade,"" Ganton says. “Boating is just naturally a socially distant activity. You can get on the boat, you can head out on the water, you can drop anchor and go swimming.”

And RVs sales appear to be just as popular. At the Camping in Style RV Centre in Whitby, sales manager Erroll Knight says there is a huge interest in large RVs as well as tent trailers.

“We have a great country and this summer is a great opportunity to see it in an RV,” Knight says.

The RV boom is not limited to Ontario. Knight says many Canadians across the country eager to hit the road, while staying away from the crowds.

“The amount of people looking to get out of the city and go to a campground is everybody’s goal right now,"" Knight says.

The only issue for families looking to get into boating or RVing is supply. Many boats and RVs are produced in the United States where sales are also going up, so there is growing concern that suppliers may not be able to keep up with demand.",[]

However, there are a few things you should know before you decide to rent a cottage or a vacation home to keep you and your family safe.

“Right now people have been locked up in their homes so now they are looking for somewhere to go and it's often nearby,"" Airbnb Canada Spokesperson Nathan Rotman told CTV News Toronto.

In the wake of the novel coronavirus, Rotman says Airbnb has adopted strict measures to ensure that their listings are clean and safe for guests.

“There are protocols of how to clean your home to make sure it is completely sanitized as well as making sure there is a buffer for guests,” Rotman said.

Meanwhile, some owners of rental cottages in Port Stanley, Ont. say they are anxious to have visitors from the Greater Toronto Area and are asking renters to bring their own personal belongings and groceries as well as limiting the number of guests.

“We are going to have our renters sign a contract simply stating the cottage is sanitized from best of our ability and that they assume all responsibility while renting from us,” owner Kate Deshaw explains.

Ideally, the property should already be disinfected but to be safe, you can also do a thorough wipe-down yourself, making sure to clean high-touch surfaces like counters, faucets, doorknobs and refrigerator handles.

You will also want to check the cancellation policy carefully and expect additional cleaning fees. You should bring sanitizer, masks and practice social distancing.

Also, don't travel if you're already sick. If someone develops symptoms during your stay, take precautions.",[]

“I just decided to start this ‘Colours for COVID’ initiative because my husband’s a doctor working in a COVID-19 assessment centre at Mount Sinai,” Logan Lass told CTV News Toronto. “It was just a way for me to give back and really just help the community.”

Lass has been selling tie-dye clothing through her Instagram account, @ColoursForCOVID.

“I had a bunch of friends reach out and say, ‘I want a sweater! I want a hoodie!’” she explained. “I was like, why don’t I actually make these and raise money for a good cause. And so I’m donating 100 per cent of all net proceeds to Sinai.”

So far, Lass has sold more than 150 hoodies and has raised more than $4,000. Each hoodie costs $55.

“From us, just as customers, I think one, it’s great to support a friend who’s doing this,” Allison George, a coworker of Lass who purchased a hoodie, said. “I think it actually is a literal way to give comfort to people during a pandemic.”

“The response to Colours for COVID has been amazing,” Dr. Elliot Lass, Logan’s husband, said. “So many of my coworkers have supported it and I’m so proud of Logan.”

The funds raised are going to the Mount Sinai Health System, with donations helping with personal protective equipment.

Family and friends, all together for the first time in months, gathered outside Erin Mills Lodge Nursing Home on Thursday to cheer and express their love to Jovita Lee, who smiled and waved at her physically distant visitors.

“It was bitter sweet because, of course, we couldn’t get too close, we couldn’t hug her or touch her but it was just a relief to be able to see her,” Lee’s granddaughter Sarah Barnett told CTV News Toronto on Thursday.

“To see all of us together at once and to see us singing happy birthday to her, I think that really lifted her spirts and for the first time she was able to lift her head up higher and just waive to everyone.”

Lee’s fight against COVID-19 was not easy. Her family says that she and her roommate were the first two people in their long-term care home to get the disease.

Lee, who had been moved into the home only two weeks before the pandemic hit, had trouble eating and was fighting a high fever.

Despite the outbreak at the facility being over, her family says it still took a significant toll on her. Her granddaughter said Lee now needs to use a wheelchair, has trouble lifting her head and is very low energy.

Barnett describes her grandmother, who came from the Philippines to Canada in the 80s, as a fun-loving person who loves the Toronto Blue Jays, parties, dancing and being in the spotlight, and so Thursday’s surprise was the perfect one.

“She loved to dance, loved having parties. Every year, she wants a party so she could invite everyone and feed everyone,” Barnett said.

Barnett said her grandmother, who loves to be around family, had a tough few months and lost some friends at the long-term care home due to COVID-19 after 17 people died at the home.

Now, Barnett said she’s glad things are starting to look better.

“She was already in an unfamiliar place and then shortly after to not see her family at all for three months [was hard],” she said. “[Thursday] was the first time she had seen us all together since moving to the home and overcoming the virus.”",[]

The first was in 1918, during the Spanish flu when Stallworthy was just three years old. The second, today, when she turned 105 during Covid-19.

She admits she doesn't remember much about her first pandemic birthday, but this was one she will never forget.

Dozens of people gathered down the street from the Kingston Road home where Stallworthy has lived for more than half a century, and then, on foot, paraded past her house to offer their best wishes. Sitting on her front porch, Stallworthy watched as person after person came to pay their respects from a safe social distance.

""It's just tremendous,"" Stallworthy told CTV News, ""I'm absolutely blown away.""

Stallworthy was born on July 12, 1915, in London, England. Before moving to Canada in 1951, she'd already lived through two world wars and the great depression. One of the first things she did upon settling in Toronto, was to join the congregation of Kingston Road United Church. ""I've been working my bottom off ever since,"" Stallworthy said with a laugh. To this day, she remains active in the church.

And it's her faith that she credits with getting her to 105, an age she admits she never thought she'd reach. When asked for the secret to her longevity, Stallworthy replies, ""I think it's my belief in good old God.""

Sunday's birthday parade was organized by her fellow parishioners. Granddaughter Sheri Gardiner told CTV News, ""she just loves people, and I think it's pretty obvious today that people love her too​.""

Finding a way to safely celebrate a 105th birthday during Covid-19 can be a challenge.

""I feel as if I'm living my life in a bubble,"" Stallworthy said.

The normally active and social centenarian says she's been trying to stay social but at a safe distance from those who visit. And she says while she heard stories about the 1918 pandemic from her mother, Covid-19 gives her pause. ""Well this one is so different, I'm not sure how we're going to come out of it.""

Stallworthy has been married twice, and along with remaining active in her church, she's a lifetime member of the Girl Guides and speaks to students about her experiences during the war each Remembrance Day.

Those at her birthday celebration marvelled at how active she remains at her age. Stallworthy says with a smile, ""life has to be lived. And you have to get up in the morning and say 'thank God I'm alive,' even though it hurts a little everywhere.""

As for what she might do to celebrate her 106th birthday next year, Stallworthy thinks for a second, and then says she'd like to fly to British Colombia, to visit family- including a new great-grandson she has yet to meet.

But for this birthday, Stallworthy sat back, and blew kisses from her porch- celebrating a milestone most will never achieve, and looking back at a life most could never imagine.

""It's been an incredible journey, and I feel that I'm the luckiest woman in the world to have gone through it.""",[]

Canadian volunteers with GlobalMedic are now working to assemble and send emergency food kits to those in need.

About 1,400 families in areas that were affected by Category 5 Hurricane Dorian will be receiving these kits.

The hurricane swept through the island, causing catastrophic damage, on Sept. 1, 2019.

In the months that followed, many people in the Bahamas were left strongly affected by not only the hurricane, but also the sharp decline in the tourism industry due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Some residents were just starting to get their lives back in order six months after the hurricane hit when all of a sudden no one was able to travel to the island anymore, leading to many people losing their jobs.

The global shutdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has slowed, and in some cases stopped, any progress made in rebuilding on the island, according to GlobalMedic.

Rahul Singh, the executive director of GlobalMedic, said these volunteers are now trying to help feed those in need, which he calls a step in the right direction.

The emergency food kits being assembled by the volunteers include grains, beans, rice, peas, and grits. The kits will be loaded onto a shipping container on Wednesday before being railed onto a boat in Halifax and then shipped out to the harbour in Freeport, Bahamas.",[]

Ford, on Wednesday, touted an ""historic investment"" of $1.75 billion to ""kick start the development of long-term care beds"" over the next five years.

""Today's announcement will result in an estimated nearly 8000 new Long Term Care beds and 12,000 redeveloped Long Term Care beds,"" Ford claimed.

However, sources in the Ministry of Long-Term Care confirmed the government re-announced commitments that had been made by the former Liberal government and beds that were allocated over the course of the past two years.

Of the 7,889 new beds Ford promised to build, roughly 6,000 were allocated by the Wynne government in 2017 and 2018, and the remainder was allocated by the Ford government in 2018 and 2019.

Merrilee Fullerton, Minister of Long-Term Care, was first to reveal the government's plan for 8,000 beds in November 2019 during Question Period.

""Our government... is investing $1.75 billion to create 15,000 new beds and redevelop another 15,000 in five years,"" Fullerton told the Ontario Legislature. ""We’ve already got almost 8,000 beds allocated this year so far, 50% of the requirement.""

""This year alone, we have allocated 1,814 new beds and reaffirmed our commitment towards building 6,085 previously allocated beds,"" Fullerton said.

Government sources told CTV News Toronto on Wednesday that the ministry will be able to build and re-develop just 4,000 beds in 2022, as the province offers developers new incentives to recoup their investment earlier in exchange for fast-tracked construction.

In a statement to CTV News Toronto, a spokesperson for Minister Fullerton didn't address Wednesday's re-announcement, but emphasized the changes to the construction funding model would ""kick-start construction.""

""Our government consulted with the sector to understand what was needed to encourage rapid development and our modernization of the way government funds the development of long-term care beds will do just that,"" the statement reads.

""Yesterday’s announcement means that thousands of long-awaited beds will finally get built.""",[]

Ontario Premier Doug Ford first declared a state of emergency on March 17 as the province grappled with a surge in COVID-19 patients. Since, the province’s emergency orders have been extended several times.

""Although the trends in public health indicators continue to improve, we must remain on our guard and only relax emergency orders if and when safe to do so,"" Premier Doug Ford said in a statement released Thursday.

""By following our gradual plan to reopen the province, we are seeing people get back to work and resume many activities safely. We do not want to undo the tremendous progress we have made together.”

The statement said the province decided to extend the orders to ensure it continues to have the “necessary flexibility to protect public health and safety as more businesses reopen and people go back to work.”

The extension of the emergency orders comes as the most of the province heads into Stage 3 of Ontario’s reopening plan on Friday.

On July 7, the province introduced a new bill called “The Reopening Ontario (A Flexible Response to COVID-19) Act” that it says will ensure measures stay in place to address COVID-19 once the emergency deceleration ends.

The 188-page bill proposes changes to 20 pieces of legislation to help with COVID-19, but it includes a few changes that are not related to the pandemic.

“The government continues to review emergency orders currently in place to determine when and if they can be safely eased or lifted,” the province said in the statement.

“Keeping the emergency orders in place provides the government with the necessary flexibility to ensure the protection of vulnerable populations, such as seniors.”

Ford said on Tuesday that the province’s health officials are working on a strategy to handle a second wave should one hit the province and will release the plan ""shortly.""

""We have a plan that will be rolling out and we're prepared,"" he said. ""We are 100 times better, more prepared now in health care and PPEs ... but we can never, ever, ever, let our guard down.""",[]

The Premier's Office unveiled an eight-week long provincial tour on Tuesday, that will take the premier to 38 ridings in seven regions of Ontario ""to thank Ontarians and the many businesses across this province for stepping up and doing their part during COVID-19.""

While the premier will visit manufacturing plants that have been producing N95 masks and face shields during COVID-19, Ford's first two stops -- Waterloo on Tuesday and Essex on Thursday -- will be to NDP-held ridings, leading to some accusations that the premier is using the healthcare crisis to appeal for votes.

""[Premier Ford's] priorities are way out of order - he has a detailed plan to reopen pubs and movie theatres, but none to get our kids back in school this fall,"" said Liberal Leader Steven Del Duca in a statement.

""Doug Ford should spend his summer figuring out the crisis in our schools, not campaigning for re-election.""

While Ford officially kicked off his re-election campaign in February at convention for the Progressive Conservative party in Niagara Falls, much of the campaign-related work was put on hold due to COVID-19.

The Premier's Office quickly fired back saying ""unlike Del Duca's Liberal party, Premier Ford believes that meaningful work doesn't just happen in downtown Toronto.""

""Millions of Ontarians from across the province have banded together in response to COVID-19 and the Premier is taking this opportunity to show his appreciation for their leadership and sacrifice during this extremely challenging time,"" Ford's office said in a statement.

The report, which looked at relevant studies published between late January and end of May found that the death rate for adult COVID patients in ICU decreased over time, to 41.6 per cent from above 50 per cent. Dying from COVID while in ICU, however, was still nearly double that of patients admitted into ICU for other viral pneumonia.

Researchers noted that the ICU mortality numbers did not change significantly around the world, even though factors like admission criteria, treatments delivered, and the thresholds for the treatments were different across the studies.

“Reported ICU mortality fell over time. Optimistically, countries in the later phase of the pandemic may be coping better with COVID-19,” the paper concluded.

“Our analysis is reassuring in that in-ICU mortality is lower than early reports suggested.”

The paper noted that a patient’s age, comorbidities, as well as ethnicity were likely to have a “significant influence” on mortality but did not look into why due to the limited information provided by the data.

Researchers pulled data from 24 observational studies that reported the ICU outcomes for 10,150 patients from China, the United States, France, Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands, Hong Kong, Italy, Singapore, Spain and the UK who were admitted with a COVID-19 diagnosis. The study looked at the number of ICU deaths as a proportion of “completed” ICU admissions -- meaning those who were either discharged, or died. Patients still alive in ICU were excluded.

The paper did not explore the impact of treatments since those details, aside from use of a ventilator, varied from study to study, according to the researchers. Analysis by geographical location, sample size, patient characteristics like age, those who were intubated versus those who were not, did not demonstrate any significant differences, it said. But analysis based on the month of publication “was significant”, the authors wrote, noting a reduction in reported mortality over time.

“This remained significant after adjusting for geographic location and proportion of outcomes reported,” the paper said.

The study attributed several possible explanations for these findings:

• the amount of learning that is taking place as a result of clinical studies being quickly published all over the world, especially earlier in the pandemic

• the criteria for ICU admission possibly evolving over time, with non-invasive ventilation care taking place outside of ICU

• it takes time for the data to reflect patients who stayed in the ICU for a lengthy period

• earlier studies, which were smaller, could have overestimated mortality rates

In Canada, a study published in CMAJ at the end of June also looked at critically ill patients admitted to ICU for COVID-19 in Metro Vancouver between Feb. 21 and April 14, 2020. That report found that mortality was lower than what other studies had published, suggesting that the prognosis for severe cases might not be as poor as previously thought.

The B.C. study reported that among the ICU patients it followed, 15.4 per cent died, 10.3 per cent remained in the ICU, 13.7 per cent were discharged from the ICU, but remained hospitalized, while 60.7 per cent were discharged home.

LIMITATIONS OF STUDY

A key limitation to the new study published in Anaesthesia was the high degree of heterogeneity -- meaning there was a lot of variability in the data -- from study to study.

“Intensive care provision and admission criteria likely differ across global healthcare systems, and so the definition of ‘intensive care’ is unlikely to be consistent in all studies,” the paper said.

Asia reported more non-invasive ventilation, for example, while China reported greater use of antiviral drugs such as corticosteroids and immunoglobulins that were less commonly used in Europe and North America.

“This is consistent with research findings to date suggesting that no specific therapy reduces ICU mortality,” the authors said.

Reported outcomes, including survival rates between studies, also varied greatly.

Advanced respiratory support is widely used outside of ICU, a possible indication that patients admitted to intensive care are likely much sicker, the study said. This was the case in Italy, for example, where many patients were given non-invasive ventilation outside the ICU, due to severe demand for critical care beds.

“Patients admitted to ICU were more likely to undergo invasive mechanical ventilation and more likely to die,” researchers wrote.

Despite the variations in the studies, the researchers said that further analyses did not result in significant differences, suggesting that the study’s mortality estimates were still notable.

Still, the paper said that in the future, it was important to have more consistency in the data collected and reported, with information on how “intensive care” is defined, the admission criteria for ICU, and clearer details on a patient’s status on admission along with the treatment they received.

The study added that examining the longer-term outcomes of the patients discharged from ICU was also worth exploring further.

The systematic review and meta-analysis was led by Prof. Tim Cook, a consultant in Anaesthesia and Intensive Care Medicine, Royal United Hospitals Bath NHS Foundation Trust, and the University of Bristol’s School of Medicine, and colleagues.",[]

The joint study by researchers at the B.C. Centre for Disease Control, University of B.C., LifeLabs and public health scientists is posted on the health research website medRxiv and a news conference on the findings is scheduled for Thursday morning.

The authors say the findings indicate successful suppression of community transmission in B.C., with an estimated overall infection rate of less than one per cent.

The study looked at anonymous blood samples collected for reasons unrelated to COVID-19 by LifeLabs in March and May, before and after public health measures were introduced.

The first samples in March found two of 869 specimens were positive, for a prevalence of 0.28 per cent, while the May sample found a prevalence of 0.55 per cent.

Health Minister Adrian Dix described the estimated infection rate as ""very low"" and says it shows the effectiveness of British Columbia's public health measures and co-operation of the public.

""It reinforces the fact that we're on the right track,"" Dix says.

""Of course, this is as the study suggests a dual-edged question, a low level of transmission but also very few people with antibodies to deal with potential future spikes of COVID-19.""

If the study's prevalence rate is applied to the whole provincial population, it could mean about 28,000 people have had the novel coronavirus, while 3,149 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed to date, however Dix noted the results are specific to the Vancouver area.

Health officials have repeatedly said that more people have been infected with the virus than have tested positive and Dix calls the estimated prevalence rate in B.C. ""encouraging.""

""Overall the level of infection in B.C. was low and that's due to the actions of people in B.C. That said, there are more people who were infected with COVID-19 than tested positive and that's something we've said clearly, especially in the period of March and April when we were focusing our testing program particularly on specific groups including health-care workers,"" Dix says.

The study is the first of its kind in Canada, he says.

The study is also important because it involved people who did not self-select for COVID-19 testing, so they likely didn't believe they had the virus, Dix says.

The study was authorized by provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry and approved by the clinical research ethics board of the university. It has not yet been peer reviewed.

British Columbia recorded 21 new cases Wednesday and no new deaths. There are 207 active cases while 2,753 people who tested positive have recovered, the government said in a news release.

But he said the pandemic had put those gains at risk.

""The avoidable suffering and death caused by children missing out on routine immunisations could be far greater than COVID-19 itself,"" he said in a statement.

During the pandemic crisis at least 30 measles vaccination campaigns have been cancelled or are at risk, the two UN agencies said in a joint statement.

As of this May, the pandemic had disrupted immunization programs in three-quarters of more than 80 nations responding to a UN survey conducted with the US Centres for Disease Control.

Reluctance to leave home, transport problems, economic hardship, restrictions on movement or fear of being exposed to the virus were among the reasons given for the slowdown in immunisations.

PROGRESS STALLED

""COVID-19 has made previously routine vaccination a daunting challenge,"" said UNICEF Executive Director Henriette Fore.

""We must prevent a further deterioration in vaccine coverage ... before children's lives are threatened by other diseases.

""We cannot trade one health crisis for another.""

Progress on immunization coverage was already stalling before the new coronavirus hit, the UN agencies said.

Malaria and the diphtheria, tetanus and whopping cough jab -- known as DTP3 -- had reached about 85 per cent of the target age group worldwide.

""The likelihood that a child born today will be fully vaccinated with all the globally recommended vaccines by the time she reaches the age of five is less than 20 per cent,"" they said in the statement.

In 2019, some 14 million children missed out on life-saving vaccines.

Two-thirds of them are in 10 countries: Angola, Brazil, DR Congo, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, and The Philippines.

In Latin America and the Caribbean, historically high rates of vaccination have slipped, the UN reported.

In Brazil, Bolivia, Haiti and Venezuela, immunization coverage has dropped by at least 14 per cent over the last decade.",[]

At a press conference after a delayed, 10-day mission in Turkmenistan, WHO's Senior Emergency Officer for Europe Catherine Smallwood recommended the government adopt measures including contact tracing ""as if COVID-19 were already circulating.""

""We are aware of and concerned of reports of acute respiratory disease or pneumonia,"" Smallwood said.

She credited the government's ""recent activation of stronger measures"" as part of efforts to prevent the potential spread of the virus in the country.

Smallwood added that authorities in the reclusive country of around six million people had conducted 60,000 coronavirus tests, citing official figures.

""The actions taken in Turkmenistan will have impact for the people in the country, but also throughout Central Asia, Europe and the world,"" Smallwood warned.

State television on Wednesday evening showed strongman President Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov wearing a mask for the first time as he was pictured fishing while on holiday.

Berdymukhamedov then gave four large fish that he caught to a children's summer camp, where they were turned into fish soup, the report showed.

Law enforcement on Monday began apprehending citizens for not wearing masks after the health ministry warned of ""high concentrations of dust"" and ""pathogens"" in the air.

'FAKE NEWS'

Police had previously been seen discouraging citizens from wearing masks and face coverings were absent at mass government events overseen by Berdymukhamedov in recent months -- some of which attracted thousands of people.

Speculation has been building that the authoritarian government in ex-Soviet Turkmenistan is preparing to acknowledge that the coronavirus has entered the country, even though health offices have not reported any infections.

At a government press conference earlier on Wednesday, Foreign Minister Rashid Mederov appeared to suggest viruses could reach the country via dust storms.

""We do not exclude the influence of natural factors on the distribution of hazardous substances, including viruses. Especially dust and salt storms from the bottom of the Aral Sea,"" Meredov said, referring to a mostly dry inland lake in neighbouring Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan.

That lake's devastation is the cause of regular ecological problems in the region.

Turkmenistan ordered this week the suspension of passenger trains from Thursday.

Meredov said Wednesday that buses between regions had been stopped and citizens from outside the capital would take university entrance exams remotely.

Ashgabat's largest bazaar and a key supermarket chain were also shuttered earlier this week.

The WHO had tried to visit the isolated, oil-rich country in the spring, but the mission was held up by travel logistics, the foreign ministry said.

Last month the foreign ministry dismissed as ""fake news"" a US embassy health alert warning Americans over potential coronavirus cases in the country.",[]
564,564,564,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/men-women-should-limit-alcohol-to-1-drink-a-day-u-s-experts-say-1.5025466,"Men, women should limit alcohol to 1 drink a day, U.S. experts say",'Candice Choi',2020-07-15,"NEW YORK -- If you decide to have an alcoholic drink, limiting yourself to one a day is best - whether you're a man or woman.

That's the new advice experts are recommending for the U.S. Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which are scheduled to be updated later this year for the first time in five years. The guidelines now say men should limit themselves to two drinks a day, and that women should limit themselves to one. That advice has been in place since 1990.

In a report released Wednesday, a committee of experts noted there isn't adequate evidence to support different alcohol recommendations for men and women, and that research supports tightening the limit for men. U.S. health agencies that issue dietary guidelines aren't required to adopt the committee's recommendations.

“As a nation, our collective health would be better if people generally drank less,” said Dr. Timothy Naimi, an alcohol researcher at Boston University and one of the experts on the committee convened by federal officials.

The proposed advice shouldn't be interpreted to mean that not having a drink on Thursday means you can have two on Friday, Naimi said. One drink is the equivalent of about one 12-ounce can of beer, a 5-ounce glass of wine or a shot of liquor.

The advice is based on links that researchers observed between drinking habits and all causes of death, including heart disease, cancer and car accidents, rather than a specific physical harm that alcohol might have. Such observational studies, common in food and nutrition science, do not establish a cause-and-effect relationship but they are often the best evidence available, so experts use them to give guidance.

With alcohol, Naimi said two drinks a day was associated with an increased risk of death compared with one drink a day. He said the increase was modest, but notable enough for the committee to recommend updating the advice.

Whether the proposed new advice would influence behaviour isn't clear. Many Americans already exceed the current advice on alcohol limits, Naimi noted. Still, he said most people could generally benefit from any reduction in alcohol, even if they're not within the advised limits.

The report noted that the guidelines may be aspirational, but are important for “stimulating thought around behaviour change.”

The guidelines are based on the overall health of a population, and an individual's risk from drinking could vary depending on a variety of factors and health habits, said Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, a professor of nutrition at Tufts University.

Mozaffarian also noted that many people misinterpret the current advice to mean they should have one or two drinks a day. The limits are meant for people who already drink. The guidelines do not recommend that people who do not drink alcohol to start doing so.

Even if most Americans aren't familiar with the details of the U.S. Dietary Guidelines, they're subject of intense lobbying because of their power to shape the advice dispensed by doctors and what's served in federal food programs, including school lunches.

Other changes recommended by the committee include tightening the limit on added sugars to less than 6% of calories, down from the previous limit of 10%. Federal officials are expected to issue the updated guidelines by the end of the year, after considering public comments and input from other agencies.

According to the federal government, COVID-19 cases have been reported among passengers on 10 domestic flights and 16 international flights since June 29. It advises the list is not exhaustive and is based on information from “provincial and territorial health authorities, international health authorities and public websites.”

The affected international flights arrived in Canadian airports from Mexico City, Cancun, Zurich, Paris, Addis Ababa, Islamabad, Lahore, Qatar, San Francisco, Washington, D.C., Dallas, Detroit, and three flights from Charlotte, N.C.

Health officials in British Columbia, Manitoba and Saskatchewan are advising those on board 11 flights into those provinces in the last two weeks that fellow passengers have since tested positive for COVID-19.

Manitoba health officials said Tuesday that one of five new positive cases in the province was a passenger on WestJet flight 261 from Winnipeg to Calgary on June 27 and on WestJet flight 526 from Calgary to Winnipeg on July 2.

Officials said those who sat in rows 7 to 22 on the Winnipeg to Calgary flight and rows 4 to 10 on the Calgary to Winnipeg flight are considered close contacts of the infected passenger. They must self-isolate for 14 days following the flight and monitor for symptoms.

Those not sitting in the affected rows should self-isolate if they develop any symptoms of COVID-19: fever/chills, cough, headache, muscle aches, sore or hoarse throat, shortness of breath or breathing difficulties, loss of taste or smell, unusual fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite or lesions or rashes without clear cause.

Saskatchewan has red-flagged five flights since June 11 and two in the last two weeks: WestJet flight 296 from Calgary to Regina on July 6 (no information on affected rows is available) and July 4: Air Canada 7947 from Toronto to Regina, rows 14 to 20.

Health authorities in B.C. say four affected flights have landed in Vancouver in the last two weeks.

They are: Air Canada 8421 from Kelowna on July 6; Air Canada 311 from Montreal on July 8; American Airlines 1270 from Dallas on July 6; and, United Airlines 375 from San Francisco on July 7. Affected rows are not listed for any of these flights.

Manitoba has kept a running tally of affected flights since the beginning of March that includes 43 domestic and international flights either departing from or landing at a Canadian airport that have had one or more passengers test positive for COVID-19.

Alberta, Ontario, Quebec and the Atlantic provinces don’t specifically post information about flights affected by COVID-19.

On July 8, the Nova Scotia Health Authority did warn of potential exposure on a June 26 Air Canada flight (AC 626) from Toronto to Halifax.",[]
569,569,569,ctvnews,https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/the-stigma-is-real-front-line-pandemic-worker-says-her-child-was-shunned-by-neighbours-1.5027121,'The stigma is real': Front-line pandemic worker says her child was shunned by neighbours,,2020-07-16,"TORONTO -- When a group of kids were invited for a playdate last month in six-year-old Gaby Munshaw’s neighbourhood, she was told she couldn’t join the fun.

The Ontario girl had been out riding bikes with friends on June 16, when the parent of a different set of children invited the young cyclists over to his yard.

But Gaby’s mother said that because she is a front-line pandemic worker, her child was excluded.

“He told her that she wasn’t allowed to play because the kids were afraid of her,” Crystal Munshaw told CTVNews.ca over the phone on Thursday. “Because her mommy is a COVID nurse and she might have COVID. My daughter came home in hysterics and hid behind a tree.”

Munshaw, who has since taken a leave from work at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Barrie, to be near Gaby more, hasn’t hugged her daughter in months. She has been living in a trailer parked in the backyard of the Midland home where her parents live with the girl. Only a handful of employees at the hospital have been diagnosed with COVID-19 since the pandemic began, she said, noting that none were direct-care staff and all were believed to have contracted the virus in the community, not at the hospital.

The rejection Gaby faced because of her mother’s job has been difficult for the girl. She cried herself to sleep that night, said Munshaw.

“It’s heartbreaking,” she said. “This kid is broken and hurting.”

Gaby may not be alone, according to a new Statistics Canada report. Of more than 4,000 respondents in Canadian Perspectives Survey Series, about one in five said they fear being exposed to COVID-19 stigmatization as public health restrictions lift across the country. About one in ten said they feared stigma associated with their work at a hospital or other health-care facility.

The social consequences felt by health-care workers has been evident throughout the pandemic, including reports in some countries of nurses being “assaulted, abused and ostracized.” In New Brunswick, a doctor gained international attention when he was blamed for causing a cluster of COVID-19 cases after crossing provinces to pick up his young daughter because the girl's mother had to attend a funeral in Africa.

The new Statistics Canada report suggests there is considerable social fear among Canadians beyond contracting the virus itself. But for Munshaw, this isn’t about being afraid anymore.

“It’s not a fear. It’s reality,” she told CTVNews.ca.

“I know I can’t be alone. I’ve now been off work for three weeks because I’m having panic attacks every time I think about going back… and how it’s going to affect her and how I help her through it. The stigma is real.”

Our new article examines which groups of people feel more afraid of unwanted or intimidating acts or behaviours because they may be judged as putting others at risk of contracting #COVID19. Here are some of the reasons people fear being stigmatized: https://t.co/kYcdNaByHc pic.twitter.com/hUTH3VHAtx — Statistics Canada (@StatCan_eng) July 15, 2020

Despite the stigma that Munshaw and her daughter have experienced, children are at far lower risk of contracting COVID-19, according to available data. Across Canada, there have been fewer than 8,000 known cases of the virus in children and teens and only one death among people under the age of 20, though much is unclear about that solitary case.

While children may be less vulnerable to the health effects of COVID-19 as a disease, parents have expressed concerns about setbacks in numerous other areas, including social, behavioural and academic regression.

Social consequences related to stigmatization are best combated with education, says Toronto pediatrician Dr. Dina Kulik.

“Empowerment comes from education,” she told CTVNews.ca over the phone on Thursday. “Let’s say you have a seven-year-old and they’re being bullied or shunned because they have a runny nose. Let’s teach our kid to express through education why it is that they’re not a risk to other people. Or teaching them: ‘This is why we’re going to stay two metres away from people, this is why we’re wearing a mask, why we’re washing our hands.’ If they understand how to protect themselves and others, and they come into a situation where others are judging them, they can use that knowledge to educate others to minimize or lessen the burden of that stigma.”

This type of strategy may be easier for some children than others, suggested Munshaw, whose daughter has a speech delay that worsens in stressful situations. Munshaw wishes more adults would be educated about risk levels, too.

“Guaranteed I’m not the only one dealing with this with a child. Guaranteed I’m not the only health-care worker being treated like garbage because you are a COVID nurse and people are uneducated,” she said.

“At a time when we’re saying ‘We’re all in this together,’ we’re not.”

Since the incident in June, Munshaw reached out to two of Gaby’s friends who also have front-line worker parents. Gaby has had playdates with each of them now this month. They’ve been swimming, had a bonfire, and played in the rain with water guns.

Gaby still knows that kids are “afraid of her,” Munshaw said, but small moments have been helping. Earlier this week, a neighbourhood friend biked by and asked if Gaby wanted to join.

“She flew off the porch so quick,” her mom said. “She went for a bike ride twice around the block and came back and said to my mom, ‘See, I do have a friend.’”",[]

(Ronan O’Doherty/The News)

Traffic in both directions through Webster’s Corners was halted for a time this morning as emergency crews dealt with a cyclist who was struck in the 26000-block of Dewdney Trunk Road.

The call came in about 10 a.m. And police and fire crews were on scene.

An air ambulance was called in, and a landing site sent up at Webster’s Corners Elementary. But at the last minute the chopper was called off and the cyclist taken by ground ambulance to hospital.

RCMP are still on scene of the accident.

(Ashley Wadhwani – Black Press)

Racist graffiti was discovered in Memorial Peace Park on Sunday, July 12.

At least one historical plaque was damaged with black marker or crayon containing an expletive and the letters “Blck Lives”.

It is unclear if racist graffiti appeared elsewhere in the park.

“There was some graffiti on the bandstand and there has been the theft of some of the plaques, but the two things might not, and are likely not, be related,” said Valoree Richmond, director of parks and facilities for Maple Ridge Parks, Recreation & Culture.

RELATED: Windows broken, racist graffiti left on Okanagan home

Last week, as part of the regular maintenance of Memorial Peace Park, explained Richmond, a staff member noted that there was some graffiti markings on the bandstand on the concrete surface.

There were six markings in total, she said.

City staff began cleaning off the graffiti on Tuesday using a power-washer and returned on Wednesday to do an overall washing of the bandstand and the surrounding site.

RELATED: Maple Ridge BIA: Tagging doubled in downtown core

General clean-ups, said Richmond are part of the regular maintenance of the park and just had to be moved forward by one week because of the graffiti.

The removal of the dedication plaques is an ongoing issue and is separate from the graffiti.

Five plaques were reported missing last November, said Richmond, and in January, 12 went missing, which prompted a police file being opened up on the matter.

Currently staff are looking at options, in consultation with the Maple Ridge Concert Band Society, on a long term solution to recognize the contributions of donors rather than plaques that will reduce the opportunity for theft, said Richmond.

The graffiti was reported to the Ridge Meadows RCMP through their online reporting system by a Maple Ridge resident as mischief or theft under $5,000.

Parks reservation system changed – Maple Ridge News,'Colleen Flanagan',2020-07-16,"Golden Ears Provincial Park in Maple Ridge is one of B.C.’s busiest. (Tom Fletcher/Black Press)

A Maple Ridge woman wants to see a fair public consultation process over the reservation system for B.C. Parks.

Angela Dunne-Massey, who lives only 15 minutes away from Golden Ears Provincial Park, wants the system to change to include a portion of first-come, first-serve sites for the public.

“It is tremendously awful,” Dunne-Massey said of the current system.

She is angry that there is a lack of camping spots available at the park, but a lot of no-shows.

And she isn’t the only one to complain.

Kathie Rennie, who also lives 15 minutes outside the park said the system has taken the fun out of, “packing up on a whim and heading to go camping”.

And, she added, without first-come, first-serve she probably won’t go back to Golden Ears.

About two years ago Dunne-Massey started a petition to keep access open for first-come, first-serve campers that currently has 10,618 signatures.

“There should be a balance between the groups,” explained Dunne-Massey.

There are groups that can’t do reservations, she said, like seniors and health care workers, who can’t possibly know four months in advance if they are able to book a site.

And Dunne-Massey feels that based on Dr. Bonnie Henry’s recommendation about staying micro-local, B.C. Parks should have made all camping first-come, first-serve.

“But they didn’t do any of that,” she said.

READ MORE: B.C. residents can now reserve a provincial campsite for a stay starting June 1

Instead, campgrounds are empty, added Dunne-Massey, and, “people who are actually the taxpayers are not getting the benefit that they are supposed to be able to use”.

Dunne-Massey said her friends were at Golden Ears the last weekend of June. They had reserved their sites but noticed that there was no one at the sites around them. So they drove to the main booth where you pay for your spot and asked if they could purchase the sites for their friends, said Dunne Massey.

However they were told that the sites were booked.

But, said Dunne-Massey, for the five days they were there nobody showed up.

Dunne-Massey and her team – Lucien Campeau, Mel Turner, and Mike Babor – want a meeting with the Minister of Environment and Climate Change Strategy, George Heyman, who oversees B.C. Parks.

They were supposed to meet with him in March but the meeting was cancelled due to COVID-19.

“I’m not saying we need 100 per cent, I’m saying we need a portion of it,” said Dunne-Massey of having first-come, first-serve spots.

“I think that as taxpayers we should have access to a park, especially when it is 15 minutes down the street.”

(THE NEWS-files)

A local restaurateur is petitioning the federal government for rent assistance after finding out she is ineligible because her business is located on government property.

Sally Kang, owner of Sushi Eben-Ezer, located in the Maple Ridge Business Centre at 22470 Dewdney Trunk Road, owes her landlord five months of rent since COVID-19 restrictions forced her to close the doors to her business on March 17.

However, Kang was told she was ineligible for the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance program, CECRA, established by the federal government, in partnership with the provinces and territories, to help small business owners impacted by COVID-19 with rent, because her landlord is the City of Maple Ridge.

CECRA allows eligible commercial property owners to reduce rent for small businesses impacted by COVID-19 by a minimum of 75 per cent from April to June or forgive it entirely.

Now Kang, and her husband James McDevitt, have initiated a petition asking the federal government to change the requirements of the program to include business owners who lease commercial property from government landlords.

“This has resulted in a great loss of wages as the business owner, Sally Kang, who has stopped all business operations on good faith due to COVID-19 and due to the fact that the government of Canada wanted people to self-isolate to flatten the curve,’ read the online petition.

The couple are hoping other commercial business owners across the country and their customers to get behind the petition, along with those in Maple Ridge.

“We would like a call out to all Maple-Ridge business owners also affected in the same way as we are to petition the government together,” said McDevitt.

An electronic petition can be found on the House of Commons petition website, petition number e-2717.

So far the petition, started July 15, has garnered 20 signatures – the most, 13, in B.C.

It closes for signatures at 3 p.m. on August 14.

In a video posted to social media on July 15, 2020 by the Ridge Meadows RCMP, Mounties share why they do the work they do. The local detachment is launching a new strategic planning initiative and asking the public to get involved in helping shape how Mounties serve the community. (Ridge Meadows RCMP - The Why video screen grab)

The Ridge Meadows RCMP is launching a “strategic planning initiative” and are asking the public to get involved in helping shape how local Mounties serve the community.

“The three-year strategic plan of the Ridge Meadows RCMP will align detachment activities and the deployment of resources with national, provincial and our communities’ priorities,” said Cst. Julie Klaussner in a release issued Wednesday afternoon.

Over the past six months the local detachment has worked with elected officials of Maple Ridge and Pitt Meadows “to understand and implement their respective community priorities,” she added.

In the coming weeks an online survey is expected to be made available to the public. A date has not yet been announced.

In March, the City of Pitt Meadows announced it will “take the next step forward in creating an independent RCMP detachment to improve service and safety” following recommendations from the Police Services Review.

“A city’s number one job is ensuring the safety of the community while getting the best possible service and value for our dollars,” said Pitt Meadows mayor Bill Dingwall, in a March press release.

“The evidence is clear that the best way to achieve this is through the creation our own independent RCMP detachment. The community feedback that we received demonstrates that our residents support this decision,” he added.

If approval is given by the RCMP and the province, Pitt Meadows plans to put in motion a transition plan with the City of Maple Ridge and the RCMP which they say can take up to three years.

“The existing operating budget is $5.4 million and it’s anticipated that the independent police detachment can be accommodated within the City’s annual operating budget without a property tax increase” said Mark Roberts, Pitt Meadows chief administrative officer, in the same March release.

“There will be transitional costs for the delivery of a new policing model that would require a one-time capital investment for facility space to accommodate an independent detachment, support staff, parking and equipment,” he added.

City of Pitt Meadows says it is seeking formal approval from governing bodies before moving ahead with a transition plan.

Meanwhile, as part its new strategic initiative the Ridge Meadows RCMP will be releasing a series of videos to help the public understand the detachment’s role in the community.

“The Ridge Meadows 2021-2024 strategic plan development will be unique in that we have created a three-part video series to assist in understanding ‘why’ our employee’s do the work they do, ‘how’ our employee’s provide service to the community and a final video release sharing with the public ‘what’ the final plan will be after public consultation and collaboration,” Klaussner explained.

Ridge Meadows RCMP are telling people to ease off on the gas pedal after nabbing nine speeders since Sunday, July 12.

Some drivers were particularly reckless on the local roads according to a recent tweet by the local Mounties.

One driver was caught travelling 161 km/hr in an 80km/hr zone, and another wasn’t far off that – racing along at 160 km/hr in an 80km/hr zone.

Over the last 72 hours our Frontline police have stopped 9 excessive speeders. The top 3 were:

*161 km in an 80 km/h zone

*160 km in an 80 km/h zone

*154 km in a 60 km/h zone

A third was nabbed speeding at 154 km/hr in a 60 km/hr zone.

According to ICBC, high speeds can result in stiff fines and vehicle impoundment.

Travelling 40km/hr over the speed limit will cost a driver $368, or more, if within a playground or construction zone.

Police can also confiscate a motorbike or car for seven days at the same speed infractions. This can escalate to 30 to 60 days for repeat offenders.

Ridge Meadows RCMP are looking to the public for help identifying a pair of credit card scammers who targeted seven locations in May.

Police say two women completed fraudulent transactions in-and-around Maple Ridge from May 14-27.

Media relations officer, Const. Julie Klaussner, said investigators have exhausted all avenues in identifying the two suspects, so are hoping someone might recognize them by their pictures and descriptions.

Both women are white with dark hair, tied back into pony tails.

The first suspect was approximately 20-years old with a slim build. She was seen wearing large black sunglasses, a black t-shirt with turquoise sleeves, and black leggings.

She might have a tattoo on her right forearm, and was seen carrying a cross-body bag with red and green straps.

Suspect number two was sporting a pink and purple hoodie with brown boots, and was carrying a black purse.

Anyone who recognizes the women is asked to contact Const. Sam Ko of the Ridge Meadows RCMP at 604-463-6251 and reference file #2020-10569.

Maple Ridge council is considering a plan to close a section of 224th Street on weekends, while also allowing businesses to expand their patios into parking spots.

The proposal will allow pedestrian and bike traffic – but exclude vehicles – on Saturdays and Sundays.

Kevin Fulton, owner of Silver Valley Brewing, said city hall quickly processed his application for a temporary patio in one parking spot, and now it is awaiting provincial approval. He expects to have it within a week.

He is “totally in support” of the weekend street closures, to bring more pedestrians downtown, rather than bumper-to-bumper traffic. He noted there would be about eight restaurants that could benefit, and “a bunch of great shops.”

“All of those businesses would stand to benefit for sure,” he said. “I think it’s a good idea.”

Fulton asserts the public would also benefit by the area being safer for pedestrians.

The issue was before council Tuesday night, and Coun. Kiersten Duncan voiced concerns about social distancing. Council should not encourage the public to go downtown shopping and mingle during the COVID-19 pandemic, she said.

“Try as we might to implement social distancing, this is going to be bringing people together unnecessarily, and people could get sick,” she said. “I think it’s a good idea for the future, and when we’re in a better situation, we’ve got a vaccine, things are starting to normalize again, great, I will be supportive of this…”

Fulton said there is an argument to be made that business patrons are safer from the virus when they are outdoors. Also, they are better able to maintain social distancing.

“I think it’s exactly what you need in a pandemic,” he said.

It may not get city approval this summer, because council sent the matter back to staff to consult with the chamber of commerce and Downtown Maple Ridge Business Improvement Association (DMRBIA).

Ineke Boekhorst, executive director of the DMRBIA, also serves on the city’s transportation advisory committee (TAC), which put the plan before council. It would close the street between Dewdney Trunk Road and 119th Avenue. Traffic from the south could still access the parking lot to the Walmart, and Selkirk Avenue.

“It has been done in other communities to increase pedestrian traffic, bicycles, kids on tricycles and pleasant access to downtown,” Boekhorst said. “It may be very positive.”

Downtown businesses have “of course” been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting shutdown. They need all the help they can get, she said.

“Three months with very little revenue is not easy for a small business,” Boekhorst noted.

A plan to close the street to vehicles permanently, which came to council almost a decade ago, was not viewed favourably. It was considered in June 2011, as a Healthier Communities initiative.

The street has been closed to traffic numerous times for special events, but generally only for a day or an evening.

Council heard the proposed weekend road closure would cost an estimated $24,000 to $36,000 to have concrete road barricades set up and removed over a 16 week period. Coun. Ryan Svendsen wanted staff to look at more affordable options, such as using city vehicles to block lanes.

The Chameleon Restaurant already has a patio licence, Taco Fan and Silver Valley Brewing have applications in process, and Cremino Gelato and Caffe has inquired, noted city staff.

All businesses in the area will be consulted, council insisted.

The BC SPCA is asking pet owners to take a pledge this summer not to leave their animals in vehicles – for any length of time.

Every year the BC SPCA receives nearly 1,000 calls to rescue animals who have been left inside vehicles on hot days.

The No Hot Pets pledge will serve as a reminder to pet owners to keep their pets safe, as well as a warning to others of the dangers of leaving animals in vehicles.

It’s an issue in every single community, said Krista Shaw, manager of the Maple Ridge branch of the animal welfare organization.

“Dogs can pretty much expire in 10 minutes if left in a hot car,” said Shaw, adding that she thinks everybody should take the pledge.

Dr. Aman Preet with Meadowvale Animal Hospital in Pitt Meadows sees a few cases every year of dogs suffering from heatstroke.

If an animal is left in a car accidentally and may be suffering from some form of heatstroke, Preet suggested cooling down the animal by putting water on the paws and on the animals head.

Even spraying rubbing alcohol on the animal’s extremities, especially the paws, will help cool the animal down, noted Preet.

“But it is best to take the pet to the clinic because it could be life threatening,” she added.

Lorie Chortyk, general manager of communications for the BC SPCA, calls the death of a pet left in a hot car a completely preventable tragedy.

READ MORE: Adoptions skyrocket, emergency boarders up at Maple Ridge SPCA

“We know that people love their pets and would never knowingly put them in danger, but many pet guardians are just unaware of how quickly their pets can suffer when left in a vehicle in warm weather,” said Chortyk.

“Even parked in the shade, with windows cracked open, the temperatures inside a vehicle can become deadly,” she added.

Dogs don’t sweat like humans, so they can’t release heat from their bodies as quickly, meaning they can succumb to heatstroke and heat exhaustion in a short period of time, noted Chortyk, especially senior pets and those with flatter faces.

Signs of heat stroke, she said, include exaggerated panting, rapid or erratic pulse, salivating, anxious or staring expression, weakness or lack of coordinated, vomiting, convulsions and collapse.

READ MORE: Pets still being locked in hot vehicles, Maple Ridge SPCA

If you see a dog in a car in hot weather, the BC SPCA recommends taking the following steps:

• If the animal is showing clear signs of heatstroke or distress, call your local animal control agency, police, RCMP or the BC SPCA Call Centre at 1.855.622.7722. Do not attempt to break a window to rescue an animal – not only do you risk injuring the animal, but only RCMP, local police and BC SPCA Special Constables have the authority to enter a vehicle lawfully to help an animal.

• If the animal is not in distress, but you are concerned, note the license plate and vehicle description and ask managers of nearby businesses to page the owner to return to their vehicle immediately. You may wish to stay with the vehicle to monitor the situation until the owner returns.

“Even if you are just popping in for a minute to pick something up, even if you think you are only going to be two minutes and you parked in the shade and the windows are cracked, it’s still not appropriate to leave a dog in a car,” added Shaw.

So just leave your pets at home, she said.

Maple Ridge assistant fire chief Doug Armour passed away over the weekend from cancer. (THE NEWS-files)

Maple Ridge fire department is mourning the loss of assistant fire chief Doug Armour who passed away from cancer this past weekend.

Armour started with Maple Ridge Fire and Rescue in 2001 as a paid-on-call firefighter and received a career position in 2007. In 2015 he became a training officer for the department, and in July 2017 he began his new job as an assistant fire chief.

At the time, Armour said his new responsibilities would revolve around fire prevention.

“I’ll now be looking at inspections for residential and commercial buildings, and then I’m also in operations, so I’ll be looking after the trucks and equipment through all the halls,” he said in a 2017 interview.

READ MORE: New assistant fire chief for the Maple Ridge department

Armour worked with his older brother, Stuart, for 17 years in the security alarm industry before he was hired full-time at the fire department.

“He was a fantastic guy,” said Stuart.

When the opportunity came, Armour quit the security industry without being hired and spent every waking hour at the fire hall to make sure they knew how badly he wanted to be part of the team, Stuart recounted.

It was a huge, life-changing decision, but it was the right one, added the elder sibling.

“You could tell that’s where he wanted to be. That became his life and it was either that or his family,” he noted.

Either Armour was spending time with his family at soccer games or ball hockey – or other activities his sons were involved in – or he was at the Justice Institute helping with training or working with new recruits, said Stuart.

Armour just celebrated his 20th wedding anniversary three weeks ago, two days before he drove himself to the hospital for what was supposed to be routine day surgery.

He drove there with his wife and her mother, who were going to pick him up after lunch.

However, Stuart said, there were complications that led to more complications and he was eventually diagnosed with cancer, that – it turned out – had been there for some time.

“The type of cancer that doesn’t show up until it was quite advanced,” Stuart explained.

“The one consolation is he didn’t know how sick he was and he didn’t suffer,” he added.

Armour’s family moved to Canada from Scotland in 1973, so Stuart said, they don’t have a lot of family here.

“The fire department was his other extended family,” his brother said.

Comments and condolences poured in on Facebook after a post announcing Armour’s death by the Maple Ridge firefighters union, IAFF 4449, on Sunday, July 12.

Stuart wrote on Facebook how proud he was to be his brother.

“So sad you have been taken away from us way too soon. I know you will find peace knowing that your immediate family and all your family in the fire service will make sure that you will never be forgotten and that the impact you have made on so many people will be remembered forever,” he said.

“We will stay strong and continue to live our lives like you would want us to. I love you brother. Say hi to Dad for me,” added Stuart.

Armour’s cousin Gary Bell wrote about how missed he will be, by so many.

“Not only were you an exceptional husband, father, friend, firefighter – you were an exceptional person. I loved all the times that we have had together from when I used to take you for car rides when you were little, to watching your career as a firefighter grow, and as you became both a husband and a father,” said Bell.

“You were an amazing person and you will be missed. I’m going to miss you cous and all our laughs together,” he said.

City of Maple Ridge Mayor Mike Morden released a statement on behalf of himself and council saying that Armour was a trusted member of the fire department who gave back to his community and served with honour and integrity.

“He brought a calm influence, perspective and a quick wit to those around him,” read the statement.

“Our hearts go out to Danica, Cade, Tavis, his family, friends, and fellow firefighters. He will certainly be missed by all, and we thank him for his service and dedication to our community,” the statement finished.

Online Morden posted personal comments about how Armour gave to the community and served with “honour and professionalism each and every day.”

“I’ve personally known the Armour boys for more than two decades, Doug left Stu and I to follow his passion in the fire service after working in the security industry. RIP Doug,” said the mayor.

“This is such sad news. My condolences to the Armour family. RIP Doug,” wrote Maple Ridge Councillor Judy Dueck.

“We are so incredibly saddened by this news. To assistant chief Armour’s family, and to all his brothers and sisters at City of Maple Ridge fire [department], please know you are in our thoughts and in our hearts,” the Ridge Meadows RCMP wrote.

“Heavy hearts today as we learned we’ve lost another fellow firefighter from our first responder family to cancer. We will take it from here Doug, rest easy sir,” said the BC Professional Fire Fighters.

Carmen Van Dop wrote what a kind and good man Armour was.

“May Danica and their boys be surrounded by love and support as they face these difficult days ahead. May we each honour Dougs memory by loving our families with the same intensity that Doug loved his. Rest easy Doug, you are loved,” wrote Van Dop.

In addition to his brother, Armour also leaves behind his 83-year-old mother Elizabeth Armour, wife Danica, and two sons, Tavis, 15, and Cade, 17.

Leanne Koehn with the Ridge Meadows Recycling Society will be part of a Zoom panel discussion on plastic. (Colleen Flanagan/THE NEWS)

A documentary that follows the impact of plastic around the world will be shown for free for an additional week, to recognize Plastic Free July

The Story of Plastic, released this year on Earth Day, takes an international view of the whole process of plastic from extraction, to processing, to where it ends up in the world, and its impact on humans and the environment.

When Kirk Grayson, with the Maple Ridge Climate Hub – an organization putting on the event in partnership with the Ridge Meadows Recycling Society – first saw the movie she described it as mindboggling.

“What stood out for me the first time I watched it was just how grotesque it was the mountains of litter that wash onto shores of countries where the country doesn’t have the infrastructure and the ability to deal with things like this,” she explained.

“How would I feel about that if that was happening in Burrard Inlet,” asked the environmentalist.

READ MORE: Plastic, the gift that keeps on giving

One of the big takeaways from the film for Leanne Koehn with the Ridge Meadows Recycling Society was how nobody really thinks about what plastic is, where it comes from, who’s making it and why.

“The movie really showed how much of a bigger issue it is and how we really need to address that,” she said.

Plastic Free July started in Australia in 2011 as a month of awareness about ocean plastics.

READ MORE: No problem recycling plastic in Ridge

It came onto Koehn’s radar about five years ago when she started recognizing the month. Now it is a worldwide event.

The month is to raise awareness, noted Koehn, about how much plastic people use. And, she said, she is encouraged about how many action plans for the reduction of plastic have come about in recent years from all levels of government.

A panel discussion took place on Tuesday, July 14, moderated by Grayson, that featured an in-depth discussion about the film with Koehn and Jennifer Henry of Perk Eco Inc., a company that shows businesses how to recycle efficiently.

The Story of Plastic can now be viewed until 11:30 p.m. on July 21.

Anyone wishing to see the movie can register online at Eventbrite or on the Maple Ridge Climate Hub Facebook page and an access code for the movie will be sent to you.

Grayson was most disturbed by what one activist intervied in the movie said, which was that children born today will not have a memory of a clean planet.

“That kills me,” she said.

The Alouette River Management Society is frustrated they have heard nothing from the city about what is happening with a proposed residential development along the banks of the river.

“We’ve heard nothing,” said executive director of the local conservation group Greta Borick-Cunningham.

A letter was sent June 16 from ARMS president Ken Stewart addressed to the City of Maple Ridge mayor, councillors and CAO Al Horseman, asking where they were at in the process, but they have heard nothing back.

Specifically they wanted to know the city’s response following the submission of Eyford Partners solicitor Nathalie Baker’s legal opinion regarding the city’s handling of the development application – an opinion submitted on behalf of ARMS.

“We expected to get some response either way from the city’s solicitors back to our solicitors so we kind of knew did they agree or not agree with the contents of that letter,” explained Borick-Cunningham.

But, again, they heard nothing.

READ MORE: Maple Ridge conservation group takes legal action against city

Borick-Cunningham is concerned that it is now going on nine months that the city received their lawyer’s letter and they have had no response.

“We don’t know whether the city’s lawyers have discussed anything with the Mayor and council about this. What their recommendations are,” said Borick-Cunningham.

And she feels that the community deserves to know what the City of Maple Ridge’s legal advice is to the mayor and council on this issue based on their lawyer’s critique of that proposal’s process. Especially after a huge turnout to a public hearing that took place early last year.

The city, though, said they are unable to comment.

“As this item is a legal matter, the City and/or Mayor and Council are unable to engage or respond to any related inquiries,” wrote Tracy Camire, with the City of Maple Ridge, in an email on behalf of Mayor Mike Morden.

Right now ARMS is waiting for the “shoe to drop”, said Borick-Cunningham.

“Either for best case scenario that the entire residential proposal is pulled and is not given fourth reading. Or it is sent back to the application process where they’ve found fault where the application process erred and then to redo those steps again and to go to another public hearing,” she noted.

However Borick-Cunningham and her team at ARMS are preparing for the worst case scenario – if the proposal goes through to a fourth reading, which would trigger ARMS to demand a judicial review.

They are currently raising money for their legal fees through their Save Our Salmon campaign, fees that are expected to cost the group upwards of $60,000.

So far they have raised about $31,000.

And they are calling on the city for full transparency.

“ARMS Board of Directors is officially asking that the city and our elected officials disclose the city’s legal response to the legal claims put forth by Ms. Baker on behalf of ARMS, prior to moving the application to 4th reading, as we believe it is a matter of public trust,” concluded Stewart in his letter to the city.

Driver was leading the class of 18 socially distanced participants three days after the reopening of the pool.

Joan Farrell, one of the participants, has been doing aqua fit for the past decade and was elated to be back in the pool.

“We’re spaced and, look, we’re good in here,” said Farrell, referring to the change room where only Farrell and one other lady shared – two metres apart.

“This is the best thing for your joints and for our age group. That’s why we love it,” explained Farrell who tries to do Aquafit as much as she can. Usually she does the class three times a week. This week, though, she lucked out because she was able to book all five days.

“We were giggling the first day we went in the pool,” added Farrell.

Geri Bolan, another participant, is satisfied with how the city’s parks, recreation and culture department has handled the public’s safety.

“I think Maple Ridge parks has really done a good job at making sure everybody stays healthy and provides us with everything that we need,” said Bolan.

Many safety precautions have been taken at the Hammond Outdoor Pool, said aquatic coordinator Chris Westwick with the City of Maple Ridge Parks, Recreation and Culture.

There’s a separate entrance and exit for the public and maximum capacities set for different activities in the pool.

“I think our customers are really happy to be back and enjoying being able to experience the water again,” added Westwick.

Locals looking to burn off some energy will have more options this week as Maple Ridge and Pitt Meadows open up their recreational offerings.

The Hammond Outdoor Pool welcomes swimmers back as of Monday, July 13.

To maintain safety there will be registered time slots for length swimming, Aquafit classes, and public swims. Access to pool will be coordinated to ensure physical distancing.

The Maple Ridge Leisure Centre’s fitness centre will cater to those working to tone up those summer bodies when it re-opens on Wednesday, July 15.

It is asking its members to register in advance in lieu of just dropping in. Hourly time slots can be booked on the city’s website.

Anyone who would prefer to avoid working out indoors can now register for yoga, Zumba and spin through the leisure centre too.

The outdoor group fitness classes allow members to gain all the benefits of being pushed by their peers with the added safety reassurance of being physically distanced outdoors.

Classes will take place in the gated plaza on the east side of the leisure centre.

Pitt Meadows is opening their sports fields and BMX tracks to organized sports groups too.

It will not be business as usual however.

The focus will be on skill development, so no games, scrimmages or contact play will be permitted.

“I would like to thank the community, specifically, our sports groups for being patient as we coordinated the safe reopening of our sports fields,” said Mayor Bill Dingwall.

“I know that this is welcome news by everyone who is eager to return to physical activity and practice for the sports that they love.”

Field times have been re-booked based on the original field user summer allocation schedule for returning groups with the exception of all special events.

Due to COVID-19 restrictions, tournaments and special events will not be held in 2020.

Groups wishing to book field times are asked to forward their requests to bookings@pittmeadows.ca.

Prior to booking a sports field, groups must have a sport-specific COVID-19 Safety Plan that details precautions to be put in place to mitigate the risk of virus exposure or infection.

“We recognize that is has been a tough few months, especially for children, and we are excited to be able to get some of our sports groups returning to sport,” says Chief Administrative Office Mark Roberts.

“We ask that they ensure they are following the guidelines so we can keep our fields open.”

(Facebook photo)

You may think that you’ve never seen Ron Hupper, but if you‘ve lived in Chilliwack and you’ve ever driven along Keith Wilson Road, you almost certainly have.

Do you remember a guy sitting in a motorized wheelchair at the end of a driveway, waving at you as you drove by? Do you remember asking yourself, ‘Who is that guy?’

That was Ron, a local celebrity of sorts who epitomized the saying, ‘When life gives you lemons, make lemonade.’

Nearly nine years ago, he suffered a bad stroke that left the right side of his body completely paralyzed. Beforehand, he was an active guy who owned his own business and traveled the world with his wife.

Having all of that taken away would leave most of us wallowing in self pity, but not the man that Taylor Roseboom called ‘Papa.’

“When he got home after months of physical therapy in Vancouver and Coquitlam, it was really hard for him because he used to be the man of house,” said Taylor, Ron’s 20-year-old granddaughter. “My Grandma started bringing him outside when she was gardening, and while he was out there, occasionally a family member would drive by an honk.

“So he ended up going to the end of the driveway to sit, and that’s where it started.”

The stroke left Ron mostly non-verbal. He could say a few words, like yes and no and good.

“And a few choice curse words,” Taylor added with a laugh.

But the stroke didn’t take away his smile, and that’s what drew people in. They’d drive by and there he’d be, relaxing in his wheelchair, grinning and waving.

People started honking, which encouraged him to wave even more.

“It became this thing where he wanted to go out there every day, because it gave him something to smile about,” Taylor said. “He grabbed his newspaper first thing in the morning and then he’d come inside to eat breakfast, but some days he’d be out there before he even had breakfast and my Grandma would have to call out, ‘Honey! You haven’t had your toast yet!

“If there was snow outside and his wheelchair couldn’t make it, or it was super rainy, he would be so frustrated. But even when he was stuck inside, he could still hear people honking their horns. I’d be like, ‘Oh Papa. There’s your fans honking for you.”

Soon enough, some of the more curious among the passers-by started pulling over to introduce themselves. People brought him cookies and brownies, and one kind-hearted soul brought him a blanket to keep him warm on chillier days.

“People started saying to me, ‘Hey, have you ever seen that guy over on Keith Wilson?’ and I’d say, ‘He’s my grandpa!’” Taylor said.

Ron’s health started deteriorating in March of this year, with a series of strokes and seizures landing him in the hospital for several months. Around four weeks ago he was moved to a care home, and doctors discovered two untreatable brain bleeds.

“It was hard with COVID because we weren’t allowed to visit him,” Taylor said. “It was hard for him because he didn’t have his Keith Wilson Road anymore, and I didn’t realize so many people truly enjoyed seeing him until he wasn’t there anymore. The day he died, I heard eight cars honk out there and I thought, ‘Oh my. He’s not even here anymore and people are still honking for him.”

Taylor posted the news to Facebook Saturday and was shocked by the response. Two hundred and six heartfelt comments (as of Sunday afternoon) from people whose lives Ron touched, every one of them read and appreciated by Taylor.

“My Papa was a really tough man. What he went through was so hard and it was so hard watching him go through it,” she said. “The biggest thing I learned from him is that I’m never going to treat life like it’s short or dwell on things, ever, because he adjusted and overcame something horrible and he was still our Papa.

“I will always push through and persevere, just like he did.”

Leafy greens galore will be grown in the Okanagan thanks to some innovative local technology.

CubicFarms, who provide systems to grow commercial scale crops indoors, operate their research and development facility out of Pitt Meadows.

They have agreed to a sale of 16 of their machines to a farming operation in Armstrong.

CubicFarms CEO Dave Dineson said the technology is helpful regardless of how great a climate it is used in.

“While the Okanagan Valley is a great location for growing fresh produce, the weather can affect growing seasons,” he noted.

“CubicFarms allows our customer to eliminate the weather variable and grow locally, all year round.”

He openly invited other growers to come visit the Pitt Meadows facility to get a first-hand view of how the technology works.

The system -which is scheduled to be installed by the end of the year – includes 14 growing machines, two propagation machines – which are used in the germination stage – and an irrigation system.

The company says it will reduce the need for physical labour and promises to maximize yield per cubic foot of available space.

Operations with the system in place can expect to grow up to two million heads of lettuce per year or thousands of pounds of micro greens.

This coming Monday (July 13) marks the two-year anniversary of the death of Bree Kinnee’s daughter, and the Maple Ridge woman feels like justice will never be realized for Megan.

Megan was 19 when she was killed. She was riding on a motorcycle with her boyfriend, Harrison Heth-Klems, when it crashed into an SUV in Abbotsford.

They were both thrown off the bike. Megan died instantly, and her boyfriend was taken to hospital in critical condition.

He survived.

Heth-Klems, 25, has since been charged in connection with Megan’s death. The charge of dangerous driving causing death was laid last July, and the case is set to be heard in court next spring.

It can’t come soon enough for Kinnee.

The mom is upset that Megan’s boyfriend has not pleaded guilty and hopes he will pay for his role in her death.

Dan McLaughlin, communications officer for Prosecution Service B.C., confirmed Heth-Klems is set to go to trial next April in Abbotsford Provincial Courts, with a pre-trial conference set for March 2.

McLaughlin could not say at this time whether Heth-Klems is intending to plead guilty, but confirmed he has elected to be tried by judge only instead of opting for a jury trial.

Megan had just graduated from John Casablancas Institute – a fashion, makeup, hair, and beauty school in Vancouver – at the time of the crash.

“She had just started to blossom. And if he hadn’t walked into our lives, she’d still be here, plain and simple. I want justice for my Megan,” Kinnee said.

On Thursday night they caught three impaired drivers, adding to the 80 impaired driving instances they investigated in the month of June.

READ MORE: Ridge Meadows RCMP worried the number of impaired drivers is increasing

A provincial summer impaired driving campaign has been underway since July 1, and Ridge Meadows RCMP are also carrying out Project Domino Effect, a local initiative which resulted in 553 impaired driving investigations in 2019.

Inspector Allison Good said although the program has bean considered a success – as there have been no deaths attributed to impaired driving since March 2019 – there is still work to be done to reduce the numbers of drunk drivers on local roads.

3 more impaired drivers caught overnight. In June we served 80 impaired driving infractions. Have fun but please plan a safe ride. pic.twitter.com/6ABi79wNjC — Ridge Meadows RCMP (@RidgeRCMP) July 10, 2020

“One impaired driver is one too many, regardless of the day of the week and on the tail end of our June results it is very concerning for police to see impaired driving trends continue,” she said.

As a result of last months high numbers, three local constables have become part of Alexa’s team, a provincial program named in honour of four-year-old Alexa Middelaer, who was killed by an impaired driver in 2008.

The program recognizes officers who completed 12 impaired driving investigations in a year.

“The numbers speak for themselves and people need to know that police will be out there this summer looking to ensure our community stays safe.”

Money to hire an additional 1.5 RCMP officers at the Ridge Meadows detachment has been redirected to address community safety needs, including the hiring of a new manager and two new community safety officers (CSOs) to patrol the downtown Maple Ridge core.

During the City of Maple Ridge’s 2020-2024 business planning a decision was made to hire a new manager, along with the two new safety officers, explained the city’s chief financial officer Trevor Thompson.

Business planning took place Nov. 18 through 20 and the resulting financial plan bylaw was given three readings in December and adopted in January, he noted.

It was during this planning, explained Thompson, that hiring of the RCMP officers was put on hold due to a police services review by the City of Pitt Meadows. That money, about $225,000, was, instead, “reallocated to address community safety needs,” Thompson said, noting the annual cost of the two CSOs is about $180,000.

Chad Cowles is the new manager of the community social safety initiatives for the City of Maple Ridge. He started as a CSO in Maple Ridge in September 2019, when the pilot for the initiative began. Another CSO was hired in January and another in April.

Previously, community safety officers were made up of RCMP auxiliaries. Now, the program is operated out of the bylaws department.

The most recent hires started patrolling the streets on Monday, July 6.

The team of five is focused on the downtown core and the commercial district of Maple Ridge. The officers tackle social issues like homelessness, drug addiction, and mental illness, said Cowles.

Their strategy, he elaborated, is of encouraging people towards “sober living pathways.”

“So we get connected with all of the social services in town and do simple needs assessments for people,” he explained.

During Phase 2 of the provincial COVID re-opening of businesses in town, Cowles noted, there was a lot of conflict between businesses owners and people who had been on the street throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, “and got quite comfortable there.”

“CSOs, right now, are focused on just buffering those conflicts and helping people feel safe when they are in the core, whether that be in parks or the business district,” Cowles said.

Councillor Gordy Robson believes Maple Ridge is leading the way when it comes to redirecting public safety money into areas that help people who are in trouble and need assistance to get off the streets.

“Defunding police means you are moving money from police budgeting into some other thing, and that’s exactly what we are doing,” Robson said.

The city is spending differently, as part of the public safety program, to be more effective in how they deliver public safety, said City of Maple Ridge Mayor Mike Morden.

And, he added, this is just one part of a much larger package.

The Community Social Safety Initiatives, as laid out on the city’s website, is a “multi-faceted program that seeks to ensure citizens feel safe and engaged; citizens are protected; and citizens’ well-being is supported.”

It explains that the City is working with community partners and other levels of government to gather input, identify service gaps, and seek opportunities to improve service levels where needed.

The plan includes the creation of the team of community safety officers.

“They meet people where they’re at. They respond mostly in the downtown core where there’s concerns about safety and various things going on, things that the RCMP, it doesn’t make sense for them to deal with it,” said Morden.

“Their role is to intervene and try and facilitate better outcomes for these individuals and ensure that our downtown core is safe for people to use and enjoy,” the mayor added.

The money did come from the public safety budget, Morden confirmed, clarifying that there’s been no reduction in how much they are spending overall on public safety.

“Community safety officers are around two-thirds of the cost of a police officer,” he cited.

“These individuals are hired because of their expertise in order to be able to respond to mental health, addictions, as well as, to deal with public nuisance and to try and change pathways for people,” said Morden. But also, he noted, they’re there to ensure citizens and the business community feel safe, and that they are safe.

Down by the Fraser River, Cowles said, a team of community safety officers recently found a person inside of a sewer pipe who had been homeless for more than 20 years.

The team was able to find the man housing that afternoon and the man was receiving alcohol addiction treatment the very next day, thanks to a partnership with Alouette Addictions.

Success stories like that take place when the stars align, said Cowles.

But, he said, a lot of their work is usually painstaking and requires an abundance of patience.

(@AddoilNoccp/Twitter)

A Lower Mainland towing company advertises that they’ll be the bad guys when it comes to removing illegally or dangerously parked vehicles – and at least one man recently ended up in handcuffs after getting violent over his car being towed.

Vancouver police say the incident happened at around 11 a.m. on Monday (July 13) in a parking lot at 3490 Kingsway Avenue.

Video of the incident was posted on social media, showing an unidentifiable man walking up to a Drake Towing employee in a parking lot and using a hammer to break the window.

While continuing to argue with the tow truck driver, a second man can be seen walking up to the truck and taking a picture of the driver.

According to police, the man’s car was in the process of being towed. No one was injured.

The man was arrested, and police have since recommended charges of assault with a weapon, uttering threats, mischief and possession of a dangerous weapon to Crown counsel for review.

The Vancouver Canucks are having their say in helping name one of the three recently rescued baby grizzly bear cubs at the Greater Vancouver Zoo in Aldergrove.

In a social media post shared Thursday morning, the NHL team suggest naming “bear #2,” described by the zoo as bashful, subtle and wide-eyed, Huggy Bear in honour of Quinn Hughes who was recently named a finalist for the Calder Memorial Trophy on Wednesday, given to the league’s rookie of the year.

The 20-year-old Canucks defenseman led NHL rookies in assists (45) and points (53) in 68 games, according to the league. He would be the third Canucks player to win the award and second straight, following Canucks forward Elias Petterson last season.

The trio of cubs were found by Alberta Fish and Wildlife officers in Crowsnest Pass, Alta. in April after their mother was killed by hunters.

“We are happy to announce they are healthy, playful, and settling into their new GVZoo (Greater Vancouver Zoo) home. But they don’t have names, and we hope you can help,” the establishment writes online.

“Bear #1” is described as curious, bossy and cheeky and “bear #3” as a jokester, playful and sociable.

610,610,1077,mapleridgenews,https://www.mapleridgenews.com/trending-now/b-c-ends-short-experiment-with-growler-fills-at-restaurants/,B.C. ends short experiment with growler fills at restaurants – Maple Ridge News,'Travis Paterson',2020-07-16,"For 111 days from March 26 until July 15 B.C. bars and restaurants were legally permitted to fill growlers of draft beer for customers to take away.

But few people knew, or were able to take advantage of it.

That’s because the temporary rule change by the Liquor and Cannabis Regulation Branch was designed to help restaurants, which were take-out only at the time, to be able to sell beer from kegs that were opened prior to the COVID-19 shutdown. The temporary permit was reversed in a July 13 policy update that extended the sale of packaged beer and wine from stores until Oct. 31.

“A lot of restaurants and brewery tasting rooms had surplus draft beer around, so they were allowed to use that to fill growlers,” said Ian Tostenson, president and CEO of the B.C. Restaurant and Foodservices Association. “It wasn’t [advertised], because you don’t want to [advertise] something you will run out of.”

READ ALSO: So you think you’re not a beer drinker

In the meantime, it stoked a small discussion in the industry as some customers liked it, said one rep from a local craft brewery. Some restaurants also abused the rule, which was supposed to be limited to a 1.9-litre growler or a 650ml bomber.

“There was examples of mason jars and other containers being used that were not laid out by the liquor regulation,” said Ken Beattie, executive director of the British Columbia Craft Brewers Guild.

Growler fills have now reverted back to only those establishments with a brewery manufacturing licence, which is the way breweries have always liked it, Beattie said.

“It’s been the lifeblood of new breweries to have growler sales, and tasting rooms,” Beattie said. “The guild of brewers advocated for it to protect the product, which is best fresh off the tap, the best beer you can have, and it drives traffic to ensure sales.”

In fact, for as popular as they are at many breweries, growlers are likely to be phased out at some breweries around B.C.

That’s because the reliance on growlers has decreased thanks to the advancement of mobile packaging companies which show up to can and bottle beer at small breweries, Beattie added. Having their own in-house packaging is a cost many brewers can’t afford. Other advancements – such as the “crowler,” a one-litre can – are also changing things by holding large amounts of beer, like a growler, but keeping it fresher for longer.

The reality is there aren’t a lot of requests for the right to serve growlers that the B.C. Restaurant and Foodservices Association is hearing about, Tostenson said.

“It’s getting into their turf, it’s really the domain of the brewers and it’s not a fight that we’re [taking on],” Tostenson said.

(Photo from Paranormal North Coast British Columbia’s Facebook page)

Northern B.C. paranormal researchers aren’t sure if strange goings on at a Kitimat-area bistro are tied to a 1975 attempted robbery at the same location, but what they did find left them intrigued.

Paranormal North Coast British Columbia is a Kitimat-based team that has, over the past three years, investigated different places around Kitimat, Terrace, and Prince Rupert, looking to try to explain the seemingly unexplainable.

Recently, they conducted an investigation of PF Pizzeria & Bistro at City Centre Mall, after employees reported strange goings-on in and around the establishment.

The team, made up of Danny Nunes, John Powell, Roy Lawson, and Keenan Mosdell, had received a call from employees at PF Bistro that there were weekly occurrences of things that shouldn’t be happening, such as weird noises, dishes flying off kitchen shelves, and something the Bistro staff call “Shadowman,” a shadowy apparition that many would see behind them out of the corner of their eyes.

So, the team decided to come in and investigate.

“The idea is that, if there are ghosts, they are composed of different energies, so the idea is that they can transmit different energy waves to hit different technologies and communicate with you,” Nunes said.

The team uses video cameras, audio equipment, and an app called Spirit Box that emits a loud, white noise that different energies can interact with to try to communicate with humans.

They also use temperature readings to try to document energies, as well.

“Humans emit heat signatures, yeah? So, you know, if you see something on a device shaped like a human, but it’s emitting a cold signature, then it’s like, oh my God, you’re going to freak out because that doesn’t make sense,” Nunes said.

“And even sometimes a heat signature, it’s like, there’s nothing there on the other cameras, but why are we getting this heat signature then?” Powell added.

Nunes and Powell said investigating is often boring and tedious and they’re not finding ghosts around every corner, like the TV shows would have people believe.

“You’re lucky if you get, like, audio evidence, so…you’re setting up cameras, you’re setting up audio devices,” Nunes said. “We document what’s going on, and try to put a face to what the witnesses are telling us.”

Nunes and Powell said the process involves setting up the equipment, then asking a series of basic questions, such as the spirit’s name, if they’re even there, etc., to try to get an intelligent response in return.

“You’re asking questions, like, out of thin air,” Nunes said. “You’re trying to guess whether there’s maybe something there or not.”

The team starts by interviewing witnesses to get a sense of the situation and try to find out if there’s any relevant history. From there, they try to recreate the witness testimonies to see if they can find out if there’s validity to their experiences.

In the case of The Bistro, Nunes said they talked to the employees and went to the Kitimat Northern Sentinel archives at the Kitimat Public Library to try to validate the stories and get a sense of the restaurant’s history.

They found out that in 1975, there was an attempted robbery at a sporting goods store on the lower level. The man had ended up in a shoot-out with the police. Police chased him to the second level, where the man reportedly later died due to a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.

The location of this incident? Right outside The Bistro where they’d been experiencing the strange activity.

Throughout the investigation, which happened near the end of June, the team saw an orb in the bathroom, heard a response that sounded like “Nathan” when they asked the spirit’s name, had a broom fall unprovoked in the kitchen, and got a vocal response to questions posed just outside of the staff bathroom, in the kitchen, and in main dining area.

Nunes and Powell said that they never saw the “Shadowman” the employees had spoken of, and they can’t confirm that the audio and video they got was the man from the 1975 robbery, but they said the footage they got validated the employees’ testimonies that something strange was going on.

“There’s a lot of different theories about what constitutes the paranormal,” Nunes said. “We’re not busting ghosts, we’re documentarians, really.”

Going forward, they said the team’s goal is to try to document occurrences all around Northwest B.C.

“The idea is to go up the road, from Kitimat to Prince George, and basically document these stories,” Nunes said. “If you can [document] something with a human form, that’s the gold at the end of the rainbow…[but] like I said, [we’re] not Ghostbusters, nothing we see is for certain, we’re just doing [our] best.”

A controversial mega-mansion in Richmond could be yours – for the price of nearly $22 million, or $1 million per thousand square feet.

The mansion, which was officially listed on Friday (July 10), features nine bedrooms and 11 bathrooms and is located on a 10-acre property at 9431 No. 6 Road.

The extremely large home is one of the last mega-mansions legally built in B.C. In 2018, the provincial government passed legislation that bans the building of houses larger than 20,000 square feet on Agricultural Land Reserve, instead capping homes to less than about 5,400 square feet.

Inside, the home includes a series of chandeliers, a media room and gym. In the back yard, it also features a large chess board and seating area surrounded by a fountain pond.

BCREA chief economist Brendon Ogmundson said in a news release on Tuesday that the average price for a single-detached home was roughly $748,000 – up slightly from the $729,000 in May and a 9.1 per cent increase from June of last year.

“Sales around the province surged back to pre-COVID-19 levels in June,” Ogmundson said.

“While there are some temporary factors that may have pushed demand forward, we are cautiously optimistic that market activity will remain firm.”

Fitness equipment from “a major gym franchise” will be auctioned online from a warehouse in Surrey this week.

Bids for close to 300 cardio machines will be sought for an online-only auction held at the Newton location of Able Auctions, 13557 77th Ave., on Thursday (July 23) at 9:30 a.m. Details are posted at ableauctions.ca.

The commercial-grade equipment is from closed locations of Steve Nash Fitness World, Able Auctions president Jeremy Dodd confirmed.

Under new ownership, the fitness company is being restructured.

“There are somewhere between 250 and 300 pieces of equipment (for auction),” Dodd said. “Right now it’s all cardio. Strength (equipment) is going to come but not quite yet. There are different owners of the equipment, different leasing companies that owned all this.

“I’ve never seen this much (equipment) like this before, it’s an awful lot,” Dodd added.

During the pandemic, Able Auctions encourages people to bid and make payments online.

“It’s gone really smoothly,” Dodd said. “It’s definitely a buyer’s market, you know, so there are good buys right now. As far as the process goes, it’s quite seamless and smooth doing it this way. People sign up and register ahead of time, we get going at usually 9:30 in the morning on a given day, and we go through the items one at a time and sell it all off – just like a live auction but with no auctioneer.”

Meantime, the company’s Langley location is where dozens of animatronic dinosaurs will be auctioned. On Aug. 6, Able Auctions will be selling off more than 50 life-sized animatronic dinosaurs, along with hundreds of fossils, more animatronic equipment, lighting, and speakers.

The animatronic dinosaurs include famous species such as Tyrannosaurus rex, Triceratops, and velociraptors, but also more obscure species, such as ouranosaurus, kentrosaurus, dilophosaurus, amargasaurus and a flying pterosaur, which was related to dinosaurs but part of a different lineage.

A display of all the items is scheduled for Wednesday, Aug. 5 from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., with masks mandatory, at Able Auctions’ Langley location, 19757 92A Ave.

A portrait by Pablo Picasso is among the artworks on offer at Heffel Fine Art Auction House’s virtual sale tonight.

Heffel says “Tete de femme,” an oil-on-canvas painted by Picasso in 1939, could fetch between $1.2 million and $1.6 million.

It’s one of 112 lots open for bids at the Toronto auction house’s spring sale, which was originally scheduled for May, but was postponed because of COVID-19 concerns.

Heffel says it’s recreating the real-time excitement of an in-person auction with its new live online bidding system. Prospective buyers can also place bids by phone, or can submit their offers before the sale starts.

Highlights include Canadian artist Alex Colville’s 1976 painting “Dog and Bridge,” which is expected to hammer down for between $800,000 and $1.2 million.

A triptych from abstract expressionist Joan Mitchell will also hit the auction block with an estimated price tag of $400,000 to $600,000.

The catalogue also features seven works from Quebec automatiste painter Jean-Paul Riopelle, including the nine-foot canvas “Le reveil,” which is estimated to be worth $1 million to $1.5 million.

Heffel is also selling several works from the Group of Seven and associated artists.

Lawren Harris’s ”North Shore, Lake Superior III” was stowed away among a late Canadian-born painter’s possessions for decades, says Heffel. But after being uncovered by relatives earlier this year, the sketch is on sale for a pre-auction estimate of $125,000 to $175,000.

Among three works on offer from Emily Carr is the 1929 canvas “Forest Interior,” which has been valued at $150,000 to $200,000.

Heffel says buyers will also have a rare chance to bid on one of Yvonne Housser’s portrayals of Cobalt, Ont. The auction house pegs the painting’s pricetag at $30,000 to $50,000.

(YouTube capture)

Alex Johnson wants to give someone $1,000.

The Langley resident and W.J. Mouat Secondary School grad revealed his plans to create a treasure hunt to find the money spanning throughout the Lower Mainland and Fraser Valley earlier this month.

Clues will be presented on his social media channels weekly before hopefully someone cracks the case.

Johnson, known as “mrtoucan2” online, said he simply wants to help someone out and give people something fun to do during the pandemic.

“I haven’t actually lost my job due to the pandemic and my wife just got an internship and she’s making money so we just wanted to share some of that because we’re so fortunate right now,” he said, noting he works in construction. “And I wanted to give the money away in a fun and creative way.”

He said he and his wife have been saving up for many months to put this plan into effect.

But he admitted part of the plan is to help build his social media following. His Twitch channel, where he will be announcing clues live on Saturday, currently has 67 followers. Johnson said he’s hoping to build a fun and interactive community on his channel for people who enjoy video games and being interactive.

Those who are unable to catch his Twitch stream for the clue can also visit his YouTube, Twitter, or Facebook accounts to receive the clue. Those will be shared on those social media platforms on Monday. The location of the money is an unknown location in either the Lower Mainland or the Fraser Valley.

Johnson said the clues will continue for the next three weeks, with some lucky person hopefully figuring out the location of the money by then. He said if the contest is a success there will be other treasure hunts with possibly more money to be found.

“If my Twitch stream and YouTube channel grow then I’ll be able to do more events like this where I can potentially give away more money,” he said.

He added that he is proud that all his content is family friendly and people of all ages can watch all of his streams and also participate in the treasure hunt for $1,000.

A coastal haven owned by the family of ’90s TV star is up for grabs on Vancouver Island.

Terrace Beach Resort, a commercial offering of 21 suites and cabins next to Ucluelet’s world-famous Wild Pacific Trail, was recently listed for $4,495,000.

The Priestley Family — Norma, Lorne and son Jason of Beverly Hills 90210 fame — have been welcoming guests to their vacationer’s oasis for the past 20 years.

“We are selling for simple reasons. We are getting older. Retirement age of 65 is long past,” said Lorne and Norma Priestley in an email to the VI Free Daily.

RELATED: West Coast resorts cautiously prepare to welcome tourists again

Port Alberni-based realtor Dave Koszegi is working with the Priestleys to find the right buyer.

“There is nothing available like it. It’s super unique and it has an interesting storyline with celebrity ownership and stuff,” said Koszegi. Jason Priestley became a teen heart-throb playing the character Brandon Walsh on Beverly Hills 90210.

Koszegi says he’s had a fair bit of interest in the property despite the challenges presented by COVID-19.

“It’s well-priced,” he said. “The inquiries that we’ve had, there have been a few investor/developer type people where normally they’d buy a resort and then strata title it and then split it up and sell it off, well [Terrace Beach Resort] is already strata titled.”

BC Assessment as of July 1, 2020 shows an increase to the value of each strata unit. ‘Unit One’ was valued at $510,000—previous year value was $463,000—for example, and ‘Unit Two’ was valued at $123,000—previous year value was $112,500.

Constructed in 1999, Terrace Beach Resort is designed to resemble a 1920 fishing village: the central building that houses the main office is built on pilings, with boardwalks that meander the majestic trees to adjoining beachfront cottages. Suites are fully-equipped kitchenettes and many have private decks with hot tubs.

Koszegi said the vacation property has been a popular and well-enjoyed spot.

“Anything on the West Coast, it feels like the day you build it nature is taking it back. I mean, it could use some upgrades,” he said.

Nonetheless, Koszegi adds that owning a resort in Ucluelet is a “world-class opportunity”.

“It’s so international. Europeans will come in the offseason. It’s a small little hideaway place with international draw and that’s the magic there. It’s unlike anywhere else on the Island,” he said.

Randy Small photo.

A weather photographer captured Comet NEOWISE soaring across Abbotsford’s early-morning sky on July 11.

Randy Small was just north of Lynden in Washington State when he was able to photograph the comet heading northeast over the Abbotsford around 3:30 a.m.

Small, who said he had woken up a little before 3 a.m. hoping to witness the once-in-a-lifetime comet. He said he was almost next to the border when he spotted it.

“I didn’t see it at first with the naked eye, but I just shot northeast,” Small said. “As soon as I shot, my camera picked it up.”

The comet, formally known as C/2020 F3 (NEOWISE), was discovered this year on March 27 by the NEOWISE Space Telescope.

Comet NEOWISE is a retrograde comet, meaning it orbits around our solar system in the opposite direction of the rotational axis of the Sun and planets.

NASA says the comet is about five kilometres across, and its tail is caused by its very close orbit around the Sun, heating its outer-ice layers and releasing gas and dust in a tail of debris.

Comet NEOWISE is expected to remain visible to eyesight throughout July, and orbit closest to Earth on July 23 at a distance of 103 million kilometres away, according to NASA.

Small – a part-time landscape and weather photographer, and part-time storm-chasing news stringer – said he’s frequently up at dawn and dusk hours.

“I’ve shot probably 80 per cent of the sunrises and sunsets [since 2016]” he said. “I’m willing to get up early, or get up at midnight and do crazy stuff if something special like this is happening.”

Blue Grouse’s winemaker led the initiative, but it would not have been possible without the enthusiastic co-operation of every winery and grape grower in the valley (Citizen file)

Buyers across the province will soon be able to pick up a bottle of wine marked as from the Cowichan Valley thanks to a new sub-geographical designation now officially being recognized under B.C. law.

“Officially recognizing the Cowichan Valley as a distinct and unique wine grape-growing region in B.C. is a testament to the hard work, passion and dedication of the many local entrepreneurs and staff in the wine industry,” said Sonia Furstenau, MLA for Cowichan Valley. “This is a well-deserved accomplishment for all those involved in producing exceptional wines and memorable winery experiences.”

According to a press release issued Friday morning, “defining geographic zones on wine labels connects consumers with the unique geographic area the grapes are grown and the wine is made in and increases exposure to the region for both wine and tourism businesses.”

The Cowichan Valley sub-GI is roughly defined as the area between the Cowichan watershed, the eastern coastline from Mill Bay to Maple Bay and the western area of Cowichan Lake.

“The Cowichan is home to family-owned and operated wineries and grape growers who have been part of the valley for generations,” said Lana Popham, Minister of Agriculture. “They take pride in the wines they produce and recognizing their hard work, skills and growing reputation on the B.C. and international stage is overdue. They make great wine in the Cowichan from the grapes grown in the valley, and the designation both respects and promotes that.”

The Cowichan Valley has the honour of being the first sub-GI outside of the Okanagan and joins the Golden Mile Bench, Naramata Bench, Okanagan Falls and Skaha Bench in the Okanagan Valley.

“The newly announced Cowichan Valley sub-GI recognizes our unique terroir and solidifies Vancouver Island’s position as an up-and-coming wine destination,” said Blue Grouse Estate Winery owner Paul Brunner. “Bailey Williamson, Blue Grouse’s winemaker, led the initiative, but it would not have been possible without the enthusiastic co-operation of every winery and grape grower in the valley. We are proud to be part of such a cohesive group of wine lovers and look forward to being part of an exciting future.”

Tourism Cowichan’s Jill Nessell said now Cowichan can rightfully recognized as a top-quality wine-producing region.

“Wine enthusiasts can now add Cowichan as an area to explore wines produced with this unique terroir. While the award-winning wines and beautiful vineyards draw thousands of visitors to Cowichan every year, it is the extraordinary people behind the wines that create memorable wine-tasting and tour experiences for locals and visitors from across the globe,” she said.

It’s about time Cowichan is recognized for its efforts, said Miles Prodan, president of the BC Wine Institute.

“Having Cowichan Valley officially recognized as a distinct and unique wine grape growing region in B.C. is testament to the maturity of the wine growers and producers in the region,” he said. “To put it simply, when you now see Vancouver Island, Cowichan Valley, BC VQA (Vintners Quality Alliance) on a bottle, it is your guarantee that you’re sipping a wine that is 100% grown and made in this particular terroir of British Columbia.”

Brett Bacon says he was just trying to prove to his son that he’s cool.

The father from Calgary is turning heads online after saving a baby eagle from drowning in the middle of a lake in Windermere, roughly 125 kilometres north of Cranbrook.

The shocking incident happened on July 4, according to a video posted by Bacon on July 4.

The video – which has been viewed 10,000 times as of Friday afternoon – shows Bacon hanging over the side of the boat trying to pull the eagle from the water. After grabbing it, the bird attempts to fly away a few times but appears to be caught on Bacon’s shirt.

Bacon’s infant son is seen lying safely on a seat nearby.

In an interview with the New York Post, the father said he brought the eagle to dry land where it flew away and has since been taken to a wildlife rehabilitation facility.

Black Press Media has reached out to nearby conservation societies for an update on the eagle.

Eagles are known to be fairly good swimmers and have thick down feathers which allow for them to float, according to biologists. However, occassionally juvenile or older eagles can drown if they’re too far from shore or get caught on something.

Who doesn’t love adorable fluffy kittens?

Their playful and firey like charm makes them irresistible, and let’s not get started on their giant like eyes and paws they have yet to grow into.

With that said, July 10, of every year marks National Kitten Day, a day intended to remind us that while kittens are well equipped to find their way into our hearts, many don’t find homes. Often kittens are either abandoned on the road, left wild and feral, or forgotten at a shelter.

National Kitten Day was founded by Colleen Paige, pet and family lifestyle expert, author and animal advocate. Paige wanted a day to highlight the fight kittens face in shelters and to encourage safe adoption. In light of the recent restrictions the pandemic has sprung on the world, more people are spending longer hours at home making it the perfect or should we say ‘purr-fect’ time to gain a companion which would make a difference in a kitten’s life.

READ MORE: Box of kittens found on median of busy B.C. street

Instead of purchasing a kitten from the pet store this year, adopt from a shelter.

How to get started:

Call your local shelter or animal welfare organization and complete necessary forms and background checks. Some organizations may provide financial support for foster parents, while others may not be offering support at this time due to COVID-19.

Before:

Involve the whole family in the fostering conversation. Will kids be responsible for feeding the new ‘roommate’? How will your family tolerate future adoption? Do your current pets tolerate other animals OK? The new pet is a big change for everyone, so allow everyone to weigh in, and suggest how they would like to help care for the pet. Adjusting to a new environment can be a daunting task for new pets. Many animals can jump onto high surfaces or squeeze into the smallest of spaces. To protect foster pets in a new environment and to safeguard your belongings, it’s recommended to animal-proof your entire house. Pay attention to any small or dangerous objects, such as pins, needles, paper clips, nails, staples, thread, string, rubber bands, caustic/toxic chemicals, mothballs, plants, and any other potentialy dangerous items.

After:

Make sure your pet is up-to-date on vaccinations. Many infectious diseases for pets are preventable through vaccinations, including Canine Influenza, Leptospirosis (which can be transmitted to people) and Lyme. Pets at varying ages have different nutrient requirements, so consider assessing your pet’s food and adjust accordingly. It is recommended to professionally groom your pet every four to six weeks. While that may not be possible at the moment, between salon appointments, use at-home grooming tools such as a cat or dog-specific toothbrush and specially formulated toothpaste, a nice rubber brush to help de-shed and invigorate the skin and coat, ear cleaner and cotton balls to gently cleanse the ears, and wipes for cleaning around the face, mouth and eyes.

While visiting the museum with her family, the province’s Minister of Tourism, Arts and Culture Lisa Beare announced half-price admission through Sept. 7.

“Now that we’re into phase three, I am encouraging British Columbians to explore the sights and attractions our province has to offer,” Beare said. “To give people a safe, affordable, family-centred experience, we’re providing half-price entry to the Royal BC Museum all summer.”

Beare said she was impressed with the safety measures in place at the museum for visitors.

Since reopening in June, the museum has operated under revised hours while closing to the public on Wednesdays to allow for an extra day for cleaning and care without visitors in the galleries.

The hour of 10 a.m. to 11 a.m. is reserved for seniors, vulnerable people and first responders. During all other hours visitor numbers are limited and visitors must book admission with a specific entry time to avoid crowds and lines.

Information and ticketing desks are protected by dividers to follow physical distancing guidelines and information about physical distancing is posted as well as signs and directions for new visitor pathways through the museum. Touch screens and other interactives are modified as the museum looks at new ways to provide interactive experiences.

The museum has employed enhanced cleaning measures of high-touch areas and other spots such as washrooms. Ventilation systems are turned up to move more air and hand sanitizer is available in public areas.

“We are pleased to welcome visitors back as we continue to reopen in stages in the coming months,” said Jack Lohman, Royal BC Museum chief executive. “As British Columbians explore their province this summer, they can feel confident the Royal BC Museum will provide them with an engaging, safe museum experience.”

The bear likely roamed Kitsumkalum Valley north of Terrace for many years prior to being relocated. (B.C. Conservation Officer Service photo)

Terrace conservation officers relocated a Spirit bear far into the wilderness to keep it away from human residential areas.

The bear got into a freezer situated outside a cabin in Rosswood, a small rural community north of Terrace, said Tracy Walbauer of the Terrace Conservation Officer Service.

“I’m not sure if he actually fed on anything in the freezer, but there was fish in the freezer and then we intervened immediately,” he said.

Conservation officers moved the bear about 50 km further into the wilderness.

“It’s still within its home range, so it could work its way back, but its got a big home range,” Walbauer said.

Walbauer said the bear is about 15 years old and has likely roamed the area for years.

“We believe it’s probably a 15-year-old bear, maybe 16 years old, based on his size, his teeth, and reports of a big Kermode bear in the area for that long,” he said, noting that the bear was large. “It was a big bear for sure. Probably 350 lbs. to 400 lbs.”

Spirit bears, also known as Kermode bears, are black bears with white fur resulting from a rare genetic mutation. They are primarily found in northern B.C.

Because Spirit bears are rare, conservation officers are far more likely to relocate them instead of killing them when they become too close to humans.

“When we catch them, we immobilize them, we look at them, make sure they’re in good shape, there’s no injuries, there’s no abscessed teeth or anything like that, and if they’re a candidate for being moved … that’s what we do,” Walbauer said. “Especially with Kermodes. We don’t do that with black bears. Conflict black bears we typically dispatch.”

Photo: Steve Smith Jasper was reunited with his owners Mary and Brent Hummel. Photo: Steve Smith Jasper was reunited with his owners Mary and Brent Hummel. Photo: Steve Smith

A Great Pyrenees dog has been reunited with his family after spending three days lost around Castlegar and swimming back and forth across the Columbia River.

Mary Hummel first noticed her dog Jasper was missing from their South Castlegar home early in the morning on Friday, July 3. She immediately began searching the neighbourhood and posting on social media.

“He is hard to miss, since he is white and weighs 140 pounds,” said Hummel.

The first report of a sighting came in from a boater later that day. He had seen Jasper on the banks of the Columbia River across from Genelle. Hummel searched the area, but was not able to find the dog.

The next sighting was reported Saturday morning, this time back on the other side of the river in Genelle. Once again Hummell rushed to find the dog, but without success. The scenario repeated itself several times throughout Saturday.

“He is a three year old that had never been away from home and he was really scared, so when he was approached by people, he fled,” she explained.

Later Saturday, Hummel was called by some campers who had seen Jasper floating down the river, once again on the opposite side from Genelle. They coaxed him to shore and he remained at their camp site for a while. But by the time a boater from Genelle took the owners across the river to rescue him, Jasper had disappeared again. The campers reported Jasper was weak, and had refused the food they had offered.

“We searched for a long time, but the country is so rugged, we did not find him,” said Hummel.

Sunday was a long day for Hummel as sighting of Jasper stopped coming in.

“We both thought he maybe succumbed to the river,” she said.

“We prayed and cried for a miracle.”

Finally, two more calls came in, both near the campsite where Jasper was last seen on Saturday. Hummel’s husband Brent bushwhacked looking for him, again all to no avail.

A Genelle resident then approached the Hummels, offering the use of his drone to search for the dog.

“We knew this might be Jasper’s last chance, so we came back with a guy that could report GPS coordinates,” said Hummel.

But the search was unsuccessful.

With plans to go back out the next day, the Hummels headed back towards Castlegar.

One of them said, “This isn’t like Hollywood, where your dog just comes out of the woods running toward you.”

But, that is exactly what happened.

“A miracle happened,” said Hummel. “Right in the middle of the road — there was Jasper.”

Hummel says Jasper is very weak, has lost weight and has sore paws, but otherwise is doing fine.

She says the real heroes of the story are the residents of Genelle, who along with other boaters and campers continued to help search and try to rescue Jasper.

“They shone as a community,” said Hummel.

“The community of Genelle came alive. I am so thankful.”

Rowling drew outrage on Twitter, in a story on June 6, 2020. (File photo by THE ASSOCIATED PRESS)

Dozens of artists, writers and academics have signed an open letter decrying the weakening of public debate and warning that the free exchange of information and ideas is in jeopardy amid a rise in what they call “illiberalism.”

J.K. Rowling, Salman Rushdie and Margaret Atwood are among dozens of writers, artists and academics to argue against ideological conformity in an open letter in Harper’s Magazine. The letter comes amid a debate over so-called cancel culture — where prominent people face attack for sharing controversial opinions.

“The forces of illiberalism are gaining strength throughout the world and have a powerful ally in Donald Trump, who represents a real threat to democracy,’’ the letter said. “But resistance must not be allowed to harden into its own brand of dogma or coercion—which right-wing demagogues are already exploiting. The democratic inclusion we want can be achieved only if we speak out against the intolerant climate that has set in on all sides.’’

Rowling, for example, has attracted criticism over her views on transgender issues, which have angered many activists. In a series of tweets, Rowling said she supported transgender rights but did not believe in “erasing” the concept of biological sex.

The comments prompted Daniel Radcliffe and other cast members of the Potter films to publicly disagree with her. Rowling was unmoved, but was attacked for weeks online.

The letter criticized the state of public debate and the “swift and severe retribution” dealt out to any perceived wrongs. It decried an “intolerance of opposing views, a vogue for public shaming and ostracism, and the tendency to dissolve complex policy issues in a blinding moral certainty.’’

“The way to defeat bad ideas is by exposure, argument, and persuasion, not by trying to silence or wish them away,” the letter said. “We refuse any false choice between justice and freedom, which cannot exist without each other.

Other signatories included Noam Chomsky, Gloria Steinem and Malcolm Gladwell.

626,626,1093,mapleridgenews,https://www.mapleridgenews.com/trending-now/sexologist-likens-face-mask-debate-to-condom-debate-what-can-we-learn-from-it/,Sexologist likens face mask debate to condom debate: What can we learn from it? – Maple Ridge News,'The Canadian Press',2020-07-07,"Society’s approach to condom usage since the 1980s can be applied to face masks today, one expert says

Jill McDevitt watched the conversation about face masks evolve over the last couple of months and realized it looked familiar.

This isn’t the first time public health officials have needed to convince people to wear something they didn’t want to wear in an effort to slow the spread of a serious virus, she says.

As a sexologist, McDevitt hopes the lessons from society’s approach to condom usage since the 1980s can be applied to face masks today.

“I was hearing about people getting very angry at others not wearing masks and it reminded me a lot of the conversation with not wanting to wear condoms,” said McDevitt, a San Diego-based sexuality educator, wellness coach and University of Waterloo graduate.

“Health organizations years ago were getting very angry and shame-based with the way they tried to make people use condoms. But we have gotten better at delivering the message in an effective manner over the last 40 years.

“So we’ve already done this work. We’ve already learned these lessons.”

McDevitt posted a widely shared list on her Facebook page last week highlighting ways to help convince people to wear face masks.

Among them was avoiding guilt-based methods, like shaming people online when they don’t wear masks in public; making sure face masks are accessible; and educating people on the risks of not wearing them.

But the biggest positive change, McDevitt says, needs to be making sure leaders and public health officials are on the same page with their messaging.

“We’ve all heard: wear the condom, wear the condom. But with masks, at first it was ‘don’t wear a mask,’ and now it’s ‘wear a mask,’ and every place has different policies,” she said.

“But as far as what happens on an individual level, I think normalizing it, learning how to have the tough conversations with people in our lives who don’t want to wear masks — not shaming people. I think those things are in our control.”

Hilary Bergsieker, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Waterloo, agrees that messaging needs to be consistent in order to get people to comply. She said some non-mask wearers in Canada may be dealing with a lack of trust in public officials who stressed early in the pandemic that masks weren’t effective but have since changed their tune.

Some of those people won’t have a choice anymore though. Cities like Toronto and Ottawa have bylaws taking effect Tuesday for face coverings in enclosed public spaces.

Other Canadian cities or provinces have also implemented face-covering rules in various settings. Quebec recently extended its face-mask rule province-wide on all public transit, coming into effect mid-July.

Canada’s public health officials say a non-medical mask or face covering can reduce the spread of a person’s own infectious respiratory droplets. This matches the advice of other health agencies including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization, which say face coverings help reduce the spread of COVID-19 in public settings, especially when physical distancing is not possible to maintain.

Despite the medical advice, Bergsieker says there are numerous reasons why people take issue with mask-wearing mandates.

Social media has shown us plenty of examples, like a video shared on Twitter of a woman screaming at a 7-11 employee in Texas after being asked to wear a mask in the store. Last week a Toronto woman posted a video of herself refusing to wear a mask in a hospital.

“Some of it is ideological. Whenever you tell people to do something you can engender a psychological state called reactance, which is basically this resistance to having freedom curtailed,” Bergsieker said. “As soon as somebody says ‘do this’ that makes you automatically at some level not want to do this.

“That’s particularly true if there are inconveniences and minor costs associated with the behaviour in question.”

Bergsieker says mask-wearing mandates will be effective — especially “if they have teeth” in the form of a fine or citation. People will comply with laws, she added, but that doesn’t mean they’ll be “psychologically convinced” the behaviour is necessary.

Harris Ali, a sociology professor at York University, says changing peoples’ behaviour takes time. But it can be done.

He likened mask-wearing to seatbelts, pointing to initial skepticism from citizens when provinces began enacting those laws too.

“At first everyone was like, ‘Oh, I don’t like this, this feels uncomfortable.’ And now we’re so used to it that we actually feel uncomfortable not wearing the seatbelt,” he said. “So slowly, gradually, there was a transformation in our thoughts.

“Right now it could be that people are feeling uncomfortable wearing masks, but you become more comfortable as it becomes more prevalent and it loses its novelty, and therefore it’s stigma.”

But how do we get to that point?

Ali says one way is in seeing the leaders, politicians and celebrities we respect and admire — “whoever the influential people in the society are” — wearing masks.

Bergsieker agrees role models can be effective in changing peoples’ attitudes. And like McDevitt, she doesn’t believe online shaming to be a strong influencer.

In fact, it can have the opposite effect.

“Online shaming can motivate people only if there’s a sense that the people whose opinion you value are going to see what you’ve done and disapprove,” Bergsieker said. “So if people who are refusing to wear masks think that their peers, the audience they care about, will actually think they’re being bold or brave or standing up for their principles, then public shaming like that will backfire.”

McDevitt says people need to be honest about the realities of COVID-19 when trying to convince others to wear face masks, but not rely on a fear-based approach.

She recalled a video she was shown in the 1980s that insinuated anyone who had sex would die by contracting HIV.

“We can talk about (COVID) like, ‘hey, this is a deadly virus,’ but when we’re honest about the whole thing, people are more apt to listen,” she said. ”A whole generation of people in the ’80s were told ’you’re gonna get AIDS and die if you have sex,’ and when that didn’t happen they stopped believing anything sex educators said for a while.”

McDevitt also says we need to allow for adaptations for those who can’t wear masks.

Things like face shields might be a suitable solution for an asthmatic, just as those with latex allergies have other options for condoms now.

“Whenever you’re just like: ‘you’re a jerk, wear a mask,’ we’re missing opportunities to have conversations,” she said.

“But of course there is also a flagrant disregard for others that has been common (among) some people who don’t want to wear masks, and that comes from a lack of empathy in a lot of spaces. … So I think the whole conversation is missing a lot of compassion.”

COVID-19 restrictions on camping site reservation and other forms of travel have led to increased demand and system bottlenecking, so when reservations opened across British Columbia on June 1, they went quickly. THE CANADIAN PRESS/AP/Robert F. Bukaty

On her first camping trip of the summer, hiker and adventure blogger Taryn Eyton was surrounded by more company than usual.

The Vancouverite, who works as a volunteer trainer with Leave No Trace Canada, normally spends large chunks of each summer outdoors. But COVID-19 restrictions on site reservation and other forms of travel led to increased demand and system bottlenecking, so when reservations opened across B.C. on June 1, they went quickly. She and her sister were lucky to snag a few June days in a provincial park just outside of Whistler.

As an experienced camper, the packing list is something she has down pat. But for many first-timers, knowing what to bring can be a challenge — one that quickly becomes expensive if you’re not careful when shopping for gear.

“A lot of people get intimidated by the idea of camping being all this gear that you need, all this special stuff,” she says. “If you go to a popular provincial park on a long weekend you’ll see people with just incredible camp setups. All power to them … [but] you really don’t need all that stuff.”

Eyton says campers on a budget should prioritize covering the necessities: Warmth and shelter.

If there’s anything to spend money on, she says, it’s a well-made tent. “The bare bones tent is probably going to leak or fall apart,” Eyton notes. While a high-quality tent may set you back a few hundred dollars, it’s likely to last two to three times as long as one that costs closer to 50 (but if the former is outside your price range, a tarp can serve as a suitable backup to cover holes in the event of a leak.)

The same rule applies to sleeping bags, with slightly more flexibility, Eyton says. A warm, well-made sleeping bag (at a few hundred dollars) is a plus if you’re planning to camp into the colder seasons, but for summer camping alone, a lighter, less expensive bag should suffice. If you’re worried about getting cold, pack a few fleece or wool blankets from home as an addition.

And air mattresses, while comfortable, are not always worth it, Eyton says: Foam sleeping pads typically offer more insulation from the ground and run at a similar price point. If any piece of gear is too expensive to justify buying at all, check your local gear outfitter or MEC branch for rentals, a short-term alternative to purchasing equipment you may never use again.

Shane Devenish, executive director of the Burlington, Ontario-based Canadian Camping and RV Council, says demand for both tent and RV camping has been at an all-time high since the start of June.

“It’s being perceived as one of the safest ways to go on vacation and take a road trip,” Devenish says.

Devenish notes that the budget-conscious should also take mileage into account when calculating the cost of a trip, especially in an RV or larger rental vehicle. “It’s better to have the expectations before you go,” he says, “rather than disappointment, or you’re pretty upset when you’ve got to go to the gas station so much.”

Beyond these upfront costs, camping remains one of the most affordable ways to spend a summer, Devenish adds. Eyton echoes the sentiment, and notes that an open-minded attitude and respect for nature are the only other essentials to take with you.

“It might rain, it might be cold, there might be bugs,” she says. “[Have] a plan for those things and how you’re going to deal with it and still have fun.”

As long as tenants keep up current rent as of September, they will have until July 2021 to pay the arrears in instalments, Municipal Affairs and Housing Minister Selina Robinson announced July 16. A ban on rent increases during the pandemic is extended until December 2020.

“Recognizing that many renters and landlords worked together to make arrangements during this crisis, the framework will also leave some flexibility for landlords to work with renters to further adjust the payment amounts,” the ministry said in a statement. “For example, allowing lower payments in the beginning of the agreement and gradually increasing the payment amounts over time or extending the duration of the payment process past July 2021.”

Along with the ban on rent increases, an emergency provision allowing landlords to restrict access to the common areas of rental buildings to protect residents from virus contamination.

After a lengthy conference call with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and other premiers July 16, Horgan congratulated Trudeau for putting $1.1 billion toward paid leave across the country “to make sure that people don’t go to work sick.”

Horgan, Yukon Premier Sandy Silver and Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister spearheaded the effort to extend sick pay to people who don’t have it from their employers. Details on whether the program will be delivered via the Employment Insurance or another method are still to be worked out, but it will be “nationally funded and nationally coordinated,” Horgan said.

He credited provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry for making infection control in workplaces a central part of the province’s relaxing of pandemic controls.

“Dr. Henry made it pretty clear to me early on in the pandemic that the biggest challenge we had in the restart was making sure that people didn’t go to work when they had potential symptoms that could lead to transmission to other workers or customers in the economy,” Horgan said.

The latest federal aid includes 50-50 shared support with B.C. on keeping transit operating and helping municipalities with their costs.

“There’s an increase in funding for mental health issues,” Horgan said. “There’s an increase in funding for child care. There’s an increase in funding for vulnerable populations, those with disabilities, and more to come in that regard.”

That’s four times the size of the last big deficit in 2012, when the B.C. Liberal government had to buy its way out of a rejected harmonized sales tax deal with Ottawa. And current B.C. Liberal leader Andrew Wilkinson has repeatedly proposed bringing it up to $15 billion, by forgiving the first 90 days of deferred taxes that Finance Minister Carole James has set for repayment by the end of September.

Collected but not remitted sales and hotel taxes, along with the government’s new employer health tax on payrolls, will total about $5 billion by fall, Wilkinson told the B.C. legislature July 15. Businesses who have been “running on fumes” for four months aren’t going to be able to repay it, he said.

James kept the door open to extending the repayment deadline, but has not commented on granting the tax holiday that Wilkinson has argued for in a series of letters to Premier John Horgan. The repayment schedule will be reviewed “well before we get to Sept. 30,” James said in question period.

“I’m afraid that kind of answer will be cold comfort to the thousands of businesses that are facing huge tax-deferred bills coming due this September, for which the minister refuses to provide an answer,” replied Abbotsford West MLA Mike de Jong, who preceded James as finance minister. “Families are facing work uncertainty or outright unemployment.”

The Business Council of B.C. has not endorsed the idea of a tax holiday, but it is calling for an extension of the payment deadline through 2020 and a staged repayment plan that could extend to the end of 2021.

“With a very slow economic recovery and the enormous damage inflicted on many economic sectors by the virus and the measures taken to contain it, we believe there is a strong argument for extending the 2020 tax deferrals until the end of the year,” BCBC chief policy officer Jock Finlayson told Black Press Media July 16. “We are not recommending an extension beyond that point.”

With an uncertain future for the COVID-19 pandemic, which has plunged B.C. government revenues as spending has ramped up, accumulated debt is also a key factor.

“From an accounting perspective, the government is not ‘losing revenue’ with tax deferrals,” Finlayson said. “ Rather, it receives the money due with a delay. The only cost to the treasury is the interest paid on the extra short-term debt – which today is substantially less than one per cent. So there is very little impact on the size of the deficit.”

The latest survey of businesses in British Columbia reveals few are confident the province’s $1.5-billion recovery plan will help them survive or succeed.

The survey of 1,401 member businesses from groups including the BC Chamber of Commerce, Greater Vancouver Board of Trade and Business Council of B.C. indicates owners want a bold, long-term recovery plan.

Only 16 per cent of businesses were confident in B.C.’s restart plan and 47 per cent were not.

Two-thirds of those surveyed were relying on some form of government support and owners were braced for a “second wave” of shutdowns or other problems if programs expire too quickly.

Some 28 per cent believed they’ll return to normal once programs end, 32 per cent expected to cut workers’ hours, 27 per cent anticipated layoffs, and one business in every 10 forecast either temporary or permanent closure.

Owners say payroll and wage supports must remain key components of B.C.’s recovery plan, along with fee and tax cuts.

The survey also identified expectations that the province must create better investment conditions.

Bridgitte Anderson, president and CEO of the Greater Vancouver Board of Trade, says business viability hinges on those measures.

Val Litwin with the BC Chamber of Commerce urges policy-makers to ”stay sensitive” to the vulnerability of the business sector.

“A bold economic recovery plan that helps small businesses compete is non-negotiable for a prosperous B.C., and when small businesses thrive so do communities and people,” Litwin said in a statement.

“Governments must keep focused on delivering their recovery plans swiftly.”

The survey, conducted with the Mustel Group, is the fourth in a series examining the effects on B.C. businesses since the pandemic flared in March.

(Tom Fletcher/Black Press)

The B.C. government reports farm product revenues hit a record in 2019, up to $3.9 billion, with increases in dairy, beef, eggs, chicken, blueberries, grapes and nursery plants.

Agriculture Minister Lana Popham credits the improved revenues to the province’s work in “helping farmers farm and strengthening food security,” as well as promotion through the Buy BC program in stores. But two thirds of the revenue increase over 2018 is from cannabis sales, which rose $300 million as legal retail expanded.

Dairy sales were up $47 million, beef up $25 million and field vegetables increased $17.5 million, with egg and nursery sales both up $14 million. But farmers note those are gross sales, not net earnings. And a chronic labour shortage has been sharply increased by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has followed a 28-per-cent increase in the minimum wage rate since 2017.

Like Vancouver Island and Fraser Valley berry and vegetable growers, tree fruit farmers are struggling to find enough workers for the labour-intensive picking of cherries and apples, the staple crops for the Okanagan and other fruit growing areas. Despite the B.C. government’s nation-leading effort to support agriculture by providing quarantine for foreign workers coming in from Mexico. A recent survey by the B.C. Fruit Growers Association found that more than 80 per cent of growers expect to reduce production this year due to COVID-19, labour market conditions and a slump in price for apples, by far B.C.’s biggest crop.

B.C. apple prices have been below cost of production for the last three years, after staging a recovery with the popularity of new made-in-B.C. varieties such as Gala and Ambrosia, said Glen Lucas, general manager of the BCFGA. Washington state’s apple production has grown rapidly to 50 times as big as B.C.’s, and harvest costs are rising.

“In the very short term, and the survey was asking about this year, that means just walking away from blocks, just leaving the apples and the cherries hanging,” Lucas said in an interview. “And that will most likely happen with some of the apple varieties that have been impacted by low prices the most.”

In the longer term, the B.C. industry expects continued reduction in apple acreage that has been seen over 50 years, as vineyards and other crops take their place.

“With this three-year hit on prices and increased costs, lots of regulatory costs, lots of actual cash costs going up, we’ll start seeing apple acres being pulled out,” Lucas said. “We’re concerned about food security and what that means, and I guess that gets back to the cannabis and the wine grape production.”

RELATED: B.C. cherry crop suffers losses from wet, cool spring

B.C.’s cherry crop is a smaller but profitable segment, which has struggled for the second straight year with frequent rains and this year, frost. Wet conditions mean using helicopters and large mobile fans to dry cherry trees, and reduced yield.

“There are fewer cherries, but what I’ve seen have been phenomenal,” Lucas said. “And I hear the apple crop is looking good. We are expecting good quality.”

The province’s Vancouver quarantine facility for foreign farm workers has prevented the kind of virus outbreaks seen in Ontario, where 14-day isolation takes place at farms. But even with that, the association expects to get through 2020 with only 60 to 70 per cent of the usual mostly Mexican workforce.

Mexico is having its own struggle with COVID-19, where widespread outbreaks have shut the government’s visa application centre and the labour ministry recruiting office.

“Buses aren’t running because of restrictions, or borders between states in Mexico will be closed and people can’t get past them,” Lucas said. “It’s just been one thing after another.”

The Bank of Canada is holding its key interest rate at 0.25 per cent in response to what it calls the “extremely uncertain” economic outlook from the COVID-19 pandemic, and plans to keep it there until the picture improves.

In its updated outlook, the bank said Wednesday it expects the economy to contract by 7.8 per cent this year, driven downward by a year-over-year contraction of 14.6 per cent in the second quarter.

The report pegs the annual inflation rate at 0.6 per cent this year, rising to 1.2 per cent in 2021 and 1.7 per cent in 2022.

Its inflation target is 2 per cent, and the bank said in its policy statement it will maintain the current rate until that target is achieved.

The rate will have to stay low to provide “extraordinary monetary policy support” to help recuperate from the economic impact of COVID-19, it said.

The forecasts included in the Bank of Canada’s monetary policy report also come with a caution that the numbers could be thrown off.

The bank’s outlook is based on the assumption that there won’t be a broad-based second wave of the pandemic, that lockdowns will be gradually lifted, and the pandemic will have run its course by mid-2022 thanks to a vaccine or effective treatment.

The monetary policy report said there isn’t enough information to forecast how deep the economic scarring will be from business closures or widespread job losses.

It’s also unclear how quickly consumer demand will recover through changes in spending habits, work patterns and social behaviour, the report said.

Still, the central bank said it appears the country has avoided a worst-case scenario envisioned by the bank in its last report in April.

The central bank’s key interest rate has been at 0.25 per cent since March when it was rapidly dropped in response to the economic fallout from COVID-19.

Governor Tiff Macklem has seemingly ruled out any further drops and has said that the central bank doesn’t plan to raise the rate until well into an economic recovery.

The Bank of Canada’s June interest rate announcement came on Macklem’s first day on the job as the country’s top central banker. Though he was only observer during the June round of deliberations by the bank’s governing council, he endorsed the decision to keep the rate on hold.

The report Wednesday said growth will pick up beginning in this quarter, the third of the year, with the country recouping about 40 per cent of the drop in output from the first half of 2020.

Much of that will be driven by the reopening of businesses and partial rebound in spending, the bank says.

But after an initial, quick bounceback, Canada will enter what the bank calls a “recuperation phase” where the pace of recovery will slow.

“As reopening progresses, many people will probably continue to fear contracting the virus, and uncertainty about job security is likely to persist,” the report said.

“Both consumer and business confidence are therefore expected to remain subdued, restraining spending and employment, particularly in activities that involve in-person interaction.”

The bank said the pandemic will continue to affect consumer and business confidence during this phase amid widespread changes in the economy, including the energy sector where low prices and reduced demand have put production well below its pre-pandemic path.

As well, the shock facing the oil sector has “renewed questions about the likelihood of pipelines being developed,” the report said.

Some lower-income workers, disproportionately affected by job losses or cuts in earnings, “will face prolonged income losses” and push more households to the financial brink, the bank warns.

While higher income households may have excess savings to spend during this phase, some households will prioritize paying down debts, or padding rainy-day funds due to the uncertain economic environment, the report said.

Heavy discounts on unwanted inventory and smaller-than-planned price increases for firms will also act as a drag on inflation, which the bank expects to remain weak before gradually getting back to its two per cent target.

Housing activity is also expected to slow over the next few years with the ripple effects of the downturn, and lower immigration, the report said.

The central bank said it will provide a more detailed analysis of its long-run assumptions for the domestic economy when it updates it outlook in October.

NDP changing WorkSafeBC regulations to respond to COVID-19 – Maple Ridge News,'Tom Fletcher',2020-07-14,"The B.C. government is pushing ahead with changes to increase insurable earnings under WorkSafeBC rules, and to give the insurer the ability to accept COVID-19 and other viral ailments as work-related without the current 90-day waiting period and investigation.

Labour Minister Harry Bains introduced amendments in the B.C. legislature July 14, emphasizing an increase in maximum disability benefits from $87,000 to $100,000, and authorizing WorkSafeBC to provide preventive medical treatment before a claim is accepted.

Changes to the Workers Compensation Act would also affect the rules for COVID-19 and other viral illness claims, which WorkSafeBC is already reviewing by the hundreds. Between 50 and 60 per cent of those claims are being accepted, Bains said.

A labour ministry statement on the changes puts it this way: “The legislation will fast-track the effective date of presumptions if established by WorkSafeBC board of directors for occupational diseases caused by viral pathogens. The presumption would simplify the process for workers who make a workers’ compensation claim if they contract viruses on the job. This would ensure that people who are at higher risk of contracting COVID-19 at work are able to access benefits more quickly.”

Employers have strongly opposed the change in “presumptions” that a coronavirus infection came from exposure at work. In a submission to WorkSafeBC, the Employers’ Forum argues that a better remedy is the national sick pay program proposed by Premier John Horgan and other premiers to deal with work lost due to pandemic rules and effects.

“Insufficient scientific information and the nature of this pandemic means the workers’ compensation system can only effectively address claims on a case-by-case basis, much as public health officials are currently doing win the contact tracing process,” the organization representing large and small employers said in its submission. “This pandemic – like all pandemics – is a public health crisis, not a workplace health crisis.

“Embedding public health costs in WorkSafeBC premiums could be ruinous for businesses who are unable to absorb any further fixed or variable cost increases because of the ongoing fallout from COVID-19, and could undermine the long-term financial stability of WorkSafeBC.”

Bains said the increase in insurable earnings represents a cost to employers, who fund the no-fault compensation system through payroll assessments. The government’s planned changes allow for “stability in premiums” for this year and the next two, Bains said.

In an economic update July 14, James released projections of a $6.3 billion drop in sales and income taxes, natural resource revenues and Crown corporation income. Spending adds the rest to what started 2020 as a balanced budget with a $227 million surplus, adding a $6 billion more to the deficit.

James said the remaining $1.5 billion of the $5 billion emergency fund voted by the B.C. legislature will be allocated for economic recovery in September, after the government completes a public survey and continues meeting with business sectors on how to proceed.

Beyond the emergency spending for business and personal financial relief, more than $1 billion of the additional spending is in health care, including lab testing, supports for long-term care facilities, health prevention and contact tracing for COVID-19, and mental health supports. Another $250 million has been directed to maintain child care services.

Nearly $90 million has been directed to temporary housing, meal and health supports, in addition to $110 million to buy hotels to move people living in encampments.

Crown corporation income is projected to be down $882 million from the February budget forecast, which James said is mostly due to the shutdown of B.C. Lottery Corp. casinos due to the pandemic. ICBC costs have declined in the early part of the 2020-21 fiscal year due to a reduction in travel, but that could change as pandemic restrictions on travel are lifted and more people return to work, she said.

B.C. Liberal leader Andrew Wilkinson warned of the impact of B.C. tax deferrals that are expected to run out this fall.

“Back in May we suggested a 90-day break on employer health tax, sales tax and hotel tax to get the economy rolling again,” Wilkinson told reporters after the update. “And instead what we saw the NDP do is say, no, they’re just going to let it pile up until September, October and send a huge bill to all these businesses when they’re least able to pay it.”

A survey by Statistics Canada suggests that almost one in five businesses will look to further staffing cuts, bankruptcy or closing their doors if present COVID-19 conditions last for six months or more.

According to the survey released on Tuesday, 19.3 per cent of businesses could operate at their current level of sales and spending for less than six months but would have to take additional action if it lasts for a longer duration. Nearly 35 per cent of hotels and restaurants only have the runway for six more months of lockdown measures, says the survey conducted May 29 to July 3.

The results come as many businesses are looking at government programs or credit to remain afloat.

Almost 64 per cent of survey respondents said they were approved for outside credit or government funding programs such as Canada Emergency Business Account loans or wage subsidies. Less than 24 per cent of businesses said in the survey that their rent or mortgage payments were deferred during the pandemic.

While working from home has increased during the pandemic, only about a quarter of survey respondents indicated they would likely offer teleworking as an option going forward after COVID-19 spread is contained.

The version released on Tuesday was a follow-up to a crowd-sourced questionnaire on the Statistics Canada website, a collaboration launched in April, with the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, that surveyed 12,600 businesses. The sample was not designed to reflect the overall Canadian economy.

Finance Minister Carole James expects to lay out the extent of the COVID-19 impact on the province’s economy this week, but how she will deploy a $1.5 billion relief fund will likely have to wait until August.

James is preparing to provide an update on the coronavirus pandemic’s effects on B.C. July 14. It will set out the progress of the province’s relief efforts for individuals and businesses, and include a range of financial forecasts about what the future holds for the B.C. economy.

But the $1.5 billion in borrowed money held in reserve for a recovery plan will not be finalized until after a six-week public consultation that runs until July 21, with analysis after that.

“Yes, we will have additional measures that will come later, after our consultation occurs,” James told reporters at the B.C. legislature July 13.

Many of the government’s measures are already in place, such as tax payment deferrals and reduced business school tax, plus the gradual lifting of pandemic restrictions on business and public activities. With the $1.5 billion recovery fund left from the $5 billion emergency appropriation voted by MLAs, the cost will be enormous.

“I’ve tabled legislation that says for the next three years we will not balance the budget. We will in fact have deficits,” James said. “But each and every year that’s going to have to be looked at. We’re going to have to see where the economic recovery is occurring. I’m afraid it’s a challenging time, and you’ll see that in some of the statistics tomorrow, when it comes to economic forecasters who have a wide range of what they anticipate could be coming, because of the uncertainty that’s there for, not British Columbia but in fact for Canada and the world.”

B.C. Liberal MLAs have called for faster action, and leader Andrew Wilkinson has sent a series of letters to Premier John Horgan with possible ways to use the relief money. Among those was declaring a sales tax holiday for struggling businesses, rather than just allowing them to defer sending in the sales tax they collect on transactions.

(Williams Lake Tribune)

With an estimated 7,000 people planting trees across Canada, the federal government has committed up to $30 million in emergency funding to help contractors cover the extra costs of COVID-19 protection.

The funds are aimed at keeping the Justin Trudeau government’s reforestation commitment to plant 600 million trees on schedule, covering costs such as sanitizing stations, additional accommodation and transportation space and personal protective equipment, Natural Resources Canada said in a statement.

B.C.’s annual program had more than 300 million of those seedlings scheduled to be planted in 10 weeks this summer, but the start was delayed to develop coronavirus pandemic plans. It got underway in May.

Measures ordered for industrial camps include spaced seating in trucks and buses, and physical spacing measures for camps.

“Faced with the challenges of both maintaining the manufacturing of essential products and ensuring seedlings are planted on schedule amid COVID-19, federal, provincial and territorial governments, together with industry, work collaboratively to quickly put in place measures to protect workers and communities,” the statement said. “The government intends to work with the provinces and territories to deliver this funding, which will preserve jobs for forest sector workers, including approximately 7,000 tree planters this year.”

In April, B.C.’s chief forester requested that any tree planting in B.C. that hadn’t started be delayed until May. Contractors imposed two-week isolation for employees before they went out to work

The B.C. government is carrying on its program through the Forest Enhancement Society of B.C., including fire prevention by removing fire-killed trees for fuel pellet production. Among them is a $1.25 million grant to the Cheslatta Carrier Nation, to rehabilitate forest areas severely damaged by wildfires in 2018.

Work started in May on the south side of Francois Lake between Grassy Plains, Ootsa and Cheslatta Lakes, 65 km south of Burns Lake.

“The wildfires of 2018 burned 75 per cent of the Cheslatta Community Forest and even more overall on the territory,” said Ben Wilson, forestry coordinator for the Cheslatta Carrier Nation.

Haney’s Farmers Market will be back later this month, but with a few significant changes.

The Saturday morning market was set to re-open for the season on the first weekend in May, but due to COVID and the requirements necessary to social distance and meet other safety guidelines, that opening was pushed back.

Now, with a series of new efforts and rules in place – including fewer vendors spaced out further, no live entertainment, and no food trucks on site – organizers are ready to give it a go, said Karen Curtis, the manager of Port Coquitlam’s farmers market.

The news you have all been waiting for: WE'RE BACK! We are thrilled to announce that we will be opening up our market in Memorial Peace Park starting Saturday, July 18th from 9am-2pm. We will also be keeping our Food Hub model so the online store will still be open for orders! pic.twitter.com/fnzga7cOJh — HaneyFarmersMarket (@HaneyFarmersMkt) July 4, 2020

One clear distinction between the past farmers markets in Memorial Peace Park and the new ones starting on Saturday, July 18, is that the social aspects have been stripped out, Curtis explained.

“We are a grocery store, we are not an event,” she said. “It’s going to be get in, get out, go home. It’s not a social outing.”

The market will feature 18 vendors, who will be selling their food from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. in the park.

Vendor tents will be spaced out much more than in past, meaning there will be fewer participant, Curtis said. And there will be spots laid out on the ground to encourage adequate social distancing.

RELATED: Fraser North Farmers Market moves to online model for summer season amid COVID-19

Haney Farmers Market is part of the Fraser North Farmers Market Society, which also runs a market on Thursdays in Port Coquitlam. Their first event is slated for July 16.

“We are all so looking forward to getting back,” said Curtis. “We are thrilled.”

While the markets, deemed essential services, could have opened earlier, there was a lot of work that had to be done behind the scenes to make sure the weekly markets adhered to all the safety requirements and that the vendors needs were also going to be met in a safe manner, Curtis said.

During that time, the society did initiate an online food hub to still keep shoppers connected with their local farmers and producers. Even with the return of the farmers markets, the food hub will continue – at least for the foreseeable future, Curtis said.

“It’s been very successful,” she said, noting that 60 to 70 people a week were accessing the Maple Ridge and Pitt Meadows hub.

It allows people to order from vendors online between noon on Wednesdays and noon on Fridays, then pickup their orders at Golden Meadows Honey Farm (19950 Old Dewdney Trunk Rd) on the following Saturday, between 9 a.m. and 2 p.m.

Items available through the hub include groceries, baked goods, eggs and proteins, fresh produce, beer and wines, breads, soups, and plants for the garden.

“We’ll keep doing what we can to get that local food out to everybody,” Curtis said, anxious for live markets to resume next week.

The official unemployment rate for B.C. remains at 13 per cent based on Statistics Canada totals for June, but that is partly due to more people having the confidence to look for work as the B.C. economy reopens, James said July 10. Youth unemployment is up slightly to 29 per cent, another sign of job seekers coming back in the hardest-hit areas of the economy.

Statistics show 118,000 additional jobs in B.C. from May to June, with half of those in the accommodation and food service industries that were directly affected by COVID-19 health orders. It’s an encouraging start, but net job losses for B.C. since the pandemic restrictions began remain at 235,000, James said.

“I think it’s a good sign that you’re seeing that 50 per cent increase in jobs coming from those sectors,” James told reporters in a broadcast from the B.C. legislature. “We’re starting to see, as we encourage British Columbians to safely and cautiously travel within the province … They’re providing support to accommodation. I know that the Okanagan is talking about how busy they are this summer.”

RELATED: Canada adds 953,000 jobs in June, unemployment rate falls

RELATED: B.C. residents regaining confidence, John Horgan says

Ken Peacock, chief economist for the Business Council of B.C., said the June employment numbers are a pleasant surprise, with the first full month of the province’s restart bringing almost triple the employment increase seen in May. But of the 118,000 new jobs, 102,000 were part-time.

“Now it’s not surprising that companies are rehiring people on a part-time basis rather than jumping into full-time hours,” Peacock said in an interview with Black Press Media. “And also when you look at the sectors that were hit, you see more part-time in food services, accommodation services, some of the tourism activities.”

The one area that continues to see declines is manufacturing, which Peacock said is an indication of B.C.’s export economy in a global pandemic.

“We know our forest products sector is hurting, mining activity is probably being dampened as we speak because of the global slowdown, so I’m going to be watching that manufacturing number and some of the export elements closely in the next few months,” Peacock said.

Statistics Canada says the economy added nearly one million jobs in June as businesses forced closed by the pandemic began to reopen.

The agency says 953,000 jobs were added last month, including 488,000 full-time and 465,000 part-time positions.

The unemployment rate fell to 12.3 per cent in June after hitting a record-high of 13.7 per cent in May.

As in May, even though more people found jobs, more people were also looking for work.

The average economist estimate for June had been for an addition of 700,000 jobs and the unemployment rate to fall to 12.0 per cent, according to financial data firm Refinitiv.

Statistics Canada says the unemployment rate would have been 16.3 per cent had it included in unemployment counts those who wanted to work, but did not look for a job.

The jobs report this morning says there are still some 3.1 million people affected by the shutdowns of March and April when public health restrictions forced businesses to close and workers to stay at home to slow the spread of COVID-19.

About 2.5 million didn’t have jobs in June, either due to temporary or permanent layoffs, while the remainder are working less than half their usual hours.

As restrictions eased, the number of people participating in the labour force grew by about 786,000 after May’s 491,000 gain, bringing those considered in the labour force to within 443,000 of its pre-pandemic level.

The gains, though, have not been shared equally between men and women, with the former gaining back jobs at a faster pace than the latter.

The unemployment rate for women was 12.7 per cent in June compared to 12.1 per cent for men. Similarly, the participation rate for core-aged men was less than one percentage point below the February level, while for women it was 1.4 percentage points short.

The underutilization rate — which counts those who are unemployed, those who want a job but didn’t look for one, and those working less than half their usual hours — was 28.3 for women and 25.5 per cent for men.

The Bank of Canada and federal government say the worst of the economic pain from the pandemic is behind the country, but Canada will face high unemployment and low growth until 2021.

The economic outlook released by the Liberal government Wednesday forecast the unemployment rate to be 9.8 per cent for the calendar year, dropping to 7.8 per cent next year based on forecasts by 13 private sector economists.

Another ridesharing company has moved further east into Pitt Meadows and Maple Ridge today.

On Thursday, July 9, Lyft announced the expansion of service, claiming to hear from both riders and drivers that there’s a “significant appetite” for the service not only in these communities, but also in eastern Langley, the Belcarra area, Lions Bay, and Bowen Island.

Pitt Meadows Mayor Bill Dingwall and Maple Ridge Mayor Mike Morden both said they’re keen to see the additional transportation option available for local residents.

“Pitt Meadows residents have been eagerly awaiting ridesharing in our community, and I’m pleased to say that day has come with Lyft now launching here,” Dingwall said.

“Ridesharing helps to reduce impaired driving by providing a safe and convenient way home. It is also yet another transportation option for residents to travel and a welcomed service to our city,” added the retired Mountie turned mayor.

As B.C. continues to re-open amid COVID, Metro Vancouverites are more inclined to explore the area again, believes Ted Lee of Tourism Vancouver.

RELATED: Uber to apply for ride-hailing licence in B.C., will operate in Lower Mainland

And that’s been substantiated, Lyft’s B.C. general manager Peter Lukomskyj.

Since the beginning of Phase 2, he said the company has seen rides to restaurants and bars increase by more than 500 per cent and trips to public transport and ferry terminals double, indicating people are looking to move around the region, Lukomskyj said.

“At Lyft, we’re thrilled to become the first rideshare company to serve all of Metro Vancouver. While we’re all staying closer to home this summer, we have an opportunity to really explore what our region has to offer. We’re looking forward to being a reliable, responsible, and convenient way for all Metro Vancouverites to move around our beautiful backyard,” he added.

“It’s great to see another transportation option for our citizens being launched today,” Morden said.

“Our council has been committed to ensuring that rideshare companies are able to operate with the collaborative regional approach to licensing. Congratulations to Lyft for this exciting announcement.”

Riders and drivers must self-certify that they will wear face masks throughout the ride, are symptom-free, and will follow health officials’ guidance related to COVID-19.

For more information, including inquiries about becoming a driver, people can also visit the Lyft website.

Changing the risk assessment of vehicle insurance rates took effect in September 2019, shifting the cost from vehicles to individual drivers. That includes a declaration of household members, employees and others who use the insured owner’s vehicle 12 or more days in a calendar year. When that’s not disclosed, an accident triggers an additional charge on top of the deductible and premium impact of a crash claim.

This one-time “financial charge” is not a fine, ICBC clarifies in a statement July 9. ICBC calls it the UDAP, or Unlisted Driver Accident Premium. Its rate varies depending how bad the undeclared driver’s accident record is, and can go as high as $5,000 added to basic insurance, plus twice the optional insurance premium.

ICBC gives an actual example of how the UDAP is much more costly than what insurance would cost a bad driver:

Description: Married couple, in their 50’s, living together in Metro Vancouver. One person has no crashes, and the other has caused three at-fault crashes in 2018. The one who has caused three previous crashes isn’t listed on the policy but drives the car anyway and causes a crash this year.

What they paid for their insurance: $2,800/year

What they should have paid if both people were listed properly: $3,900/year, a difference of $1,100/year.

Unlisted Driver Accident Premium (UDAP):

Total: $8,140

Optional portion waived by ICBC: $3,140

As governments roll out plans to reopen the economy in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, experts say individual Canadians need to update their own financial plan to move forward too.

The stock market crash in March and the plunge in interest rates left many investors feeling uncertain and vulnerable, while still more have been left without work.

Tina Cheung, a wealth adviser at Vancity, says it is always important to review your financial plan on a regular basis, but a review can be especially important during times like these.

“During these times of uncertainty it is important to have peace of mind, and to have that peace of mind, to achieve it, is to get a financial check up,” she said.

Investors who were shocked at the state of their investment portfolios at the end of the first quarter might breathe a sigh of relief when checking their statements for the second quarter as stock markets have rallied off their lows seen near the end of March.

However, Canada’s main stock index is still down from where it was a year ago and well off the highs it hit in February before the pandemic struck the markets.

“The effects of the pandemic on the market will eventually pass, like the global financial crisis did, but if these few months created any stress or loss of sleep, we need to go back and talk about your risk appetite,” Cheung says.

But she says if your risk appetite has not changed and your goal hasn’t changed, then it is critical to think long term and stick to your plan.

Before heading into a meeting with your adviser, it is important to have a firm grip of your budget and what your goals are for the meeting.

Cheung says you need to be prepared to have an open discussion and be ready with information like your monthly income and expenses.

For some, reviewing their financial plan may mean difficult decisions, facing depleted emergency funds due to the loss of a job and little prospect for a return to work at a level seen before the pandemic.

A poll done for TD Bank found that 38 per cent of those surveyed identified as financially vulnerable in April 2020 compared with 15 per cent in November last year. The poll also found that 13 per cent of those asked in April felt confident in their financial future compared with 20 per cent in November 2019.

If you have taken advantage of the payment deferrals offered by many lenders, you need to have a clear plan for when those deferral periods come to an end and you need to resume making payments.

Gio Bazile, a district vice-president at TD Bank, says some borrowers may start to struggle once the deferrals come to an end if their income hasn’t picked back up again.

“Part of what is going to be really critical is understanding what your future cash flow is going to look like and how do you work with your financial adviser with an impending financial hardship, how do you best balance your wants and needs,” he said.

Bazile says everyone is going to face their own situation, but it’s key to have a candid conversation with your partner or family to understand where you are financially.

“If your cash flow is low or if you are kind of over-leveraged from a debt perspective, then that’s probably a time to actually spend some time with your financial adviser,” he said.

“If you’re looking at your savings account and realizing, wait a minute, I may not be able to get through this next two, three months and beyond, that’s probably another really big trigger.”

Now that summer is officially here, British Columbians will be spending more time enjoying the outdoors.

And whether the activity is hiking or camping in the forest, soaking up the sun at the beach, hitting a bike trail, or simply relaxing on the patio, many will be cooling down with a refreshing beverage in a recyclable can.

That’s why Return-It is launching a suite of modernization initiatives that manage the province’s recycling system for beverage containers with refundable deposits, and it’s why Haney Bottle Depot has signed on to be part of one of those initiatives.

Specifically, they’ll be part of a six-month single-stream pilot program that enables consumers to return both alcohol and non-alcohol aluminum beverage cans together for recycling – without having to sort them. It is all done in one stream with one deposit amount.

This and other initiatives reflect feedback from consumers and put a clear focus on enhancing the Return-It recycling system to divert more material from our landfills, oceans, and waterways, said Allen Langdon, president and CEO of Return-It – a province-wide, not-for-profit product stewardship organization is also using new transportation technologies to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions associated with recycling.

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Return-It has been adapting and evolving its system by reducing touch points while improving convenience.

A series of other initiatives being rolled out this year to modernize the beverage container recycling system for a greener future will include:

· Expanding the number of Return-It Express Plus and solar-powered Express & GO contactless return stations around the province, including Vancouver Island, with new stations located in partnership with major retailers and shopping centres;

· Implementing a 10-cent unified deposit for all beverage containers – starting this fall – to simplify the overall system and make it even easier for consumers to recycle all their beverage containers – regardless of the size;

· Reducing greenhouse gas emissions through the implementation of a hybrid compaction truck that will reduce the number of vehicles used to transport containers for processing;

· Partnering with the Salvation Army to expand Return-It’s popular textiles collection program to safely drop off used clothing for recycling; and

· Introducing new automated sorting technologies and reverse-vending machines inside select Return-It depots to limit touch points in order to improve safety for depot employees and support the recycling experience.

“Even in these unprecedented times, British Columbians agree that recycling is important,” Langdon said.

“That’s why we are doing even more to help consumers easily return their empty beverage containers for recycling, with innovations that build on our success and provide new, convenient options for today’s busy lives.”

Even as the COVID-19 pandemic has forced many into new routines, people can’t lose sight of the importance of maintaining good recycling habits, said Alison Wood, co-founder of Ocean Ambassadors Canada, an organization committed to turning the tide of marine pollution by empowering youth, creating ambassadors, and inspiring change.

“I applaud Return-It for finding new ways to help British Columbians return their beverage containers – safely and conveniently – so we can ensure they don’t end up in our oceans and waterways,” she said.

“It is great to see Return-It modernizing its system to make beverage container recycling more convenient for British Columbians,” said Brock Macdonald, CEO of the Recycling Council of BC. “These initiatives are a positive step forward in improving recovery rates and keeping material out of our landfills.”

Haney Bottle Depot is located at 22935 Lougheed Hwy.

Services Card mobile app is being promoted as a way for more people to get access to B.C. government services without visiting an office to verify their identity.

The B.C. Services Card mobile app now allows card holders to send a picture and a short video of themselves to the Service B.C. office for verification. The new option is added to the live video call verification that was launched in June 2019, so people can apply at any time of the day or night. For submitted video, an email will be sent back once the verification is complete.

As might be expected, the citizens’ services ministry has created a how-to video showing the options for online verification of the mobile app. (See video below.)

The most popular use for video verification of the mobile app is student aid, with more than 53,000 post-secondary students having used the live video option to apply for loans through StudentAidBC in the past year. The mobile app can also be used to pay students loans and health-related bills, get access to personal health information, and view and manage personal income tax and benefit information.

The mobile app can also be used to submit a personal freedom of information request and receive records electronically.

While Maple Ridge Community Foundation is participating in the mural designing process, it is not involved in the building design, size, or other details. (Artist’s rendering/Maple Ridge Community Foundation)

A new building in the historic neighbourhood of Hammond will be decked out in colour and meaning, if the Maple Ridge Community Foundation has anything to say on the matter.

In what is being described as a community mural project, the foundation is seeking input from Maple Ridge residents for themes and ideas for two large images that will be installed on a new building at 11307 Maple Cres. in Hammond, explained Brenda Norrie, the foundation’s business relations manager.

“Share your design ideas with us and help us work with local artists to develop fantastic art for our community by our community,” she said, noting this is only at the initial concept stage of the process.

HAMMOND RELATED: 200 out of work as Hammond Cedar to close

Norrie noted there are some large expanses of wall space on the three-storey mini-warehouse building that will be home to the new murals.

While the building also faces Ditton Street and Lorne Avenue, the murals will be on the front of the structure, facing out onto Maple Crescent. And the dedicated spaces include an area approximately 50 feet by 19 feet in size, while the other is about 50 feet by 13 feet.

Each of the mural will be collage-style, Norrie said, and will feature multiple designs from multiple artists.

They will be based on a chosen theme for each mural, as determined in this stage of community input, she said, noting the murals will be vinyl installations rather than paintings directly on the building, to ensure longevity through the years.

This first stage of the mural process is simply gathering people’s thoughts and idea through an online survey, Norrie explained, expecting the building will be finished this fall.

In the next stage, local artists will have the opportunity to submit art to be considered for inclusion in the collage design.

The deadline to complete the survey is Monday, July 20. More information on the foundation and this initiative are available online at www.mrcf.ca/murals.

(GoFundMe)

A GoFundMe campaign has been started for a man who was found dead along a popular hiking trail in Lake Country on June 16.

The man in his 30s has since been identified as actor Josiah Black, best known for his role in Jigsaw – a 2017 Hollywood film in the Saw franchise.

“It is with a heavy heart that I write, on Monday, June 15, 2020, Josiah Black passed away suddenly and unexpectedly,” fundraiser organizer Jeremiah Black wrote, of the man found at Spion Kop Summit just after 9 a.m., June 16.

He leaves behind his wife, Alicia, and 16-month-old daughter “with another little boy or girl on the way,” the campaign reads.

“Josiah was loved and remembered by many as being a caring, loving father, husband, brother, son and friend to everyone who he came across,” the fundraiser reads. “During Josiah’s final days, he loved spending time outdoors, gardening, reflecting on the words of God, playing with his family, working on his classic VW Westfalia vans and writing through many facets.”

Black had a successful career in acting and stand-up comedy that brought him across North America from Vancouver to Los Angeles.

The GoFundMe campaign, launched June 22, has a $250,000 goal to “offer support, show love and offer encouragement to Josiah’s wife, baby and baby on the way during this difficult and uncertain time.”

“All of the funds dedicated in his name through this page will be offered directly to his family to help them with living expenses in the coming days, weeks, months and years,” Jeremiah Black wrote. “It’s my hope that they will be able to afford a safe home near to family if needed and have enough to put into a college fund for his kids.”

So far, nearly $20,000 has been raised in honour of Black.

Summertime always offers a bountiful harvest of fresh fruit and berries; and blueberries, are by far, one of my favourite. They are not only packed full of nutrition and flavour but are also a very versatile cooking ingredient.

Upon any investigation into foods that are rich in antioxidants, you will always find berries at the top of the list. Blueberries have most other berries beat when it comes to antioxidant levels. The health benefits that we gain from foods abundant in antioxidants are too numerous to list in complete detail but includes anti-aging, lower cholesterol, strong immune resistance to flues and viruses, and reduction in risks of cancer and heart disease. This being said, it is in our best interest to attempt to introduce blueberries into our meals whenever possible.

The first idea that crosses most people’s minds when considering blueberries as an ingredient is desserts, but blueberries also compliment many savoury dishes quite well. Here are two suggestions for you to experiment with in the kitchen:

Red meat – Since blueberries are very dark and intensely flavoured, they tend to stand up to meats that are also very bold. A red wine pan sauce on steaks, roast beef, or lamb for example, is always complimented by the rich intensity of a couple handfuls of blueberries cooked down in it. Simply strain out the skins for a smooth syrupy sauce. Many people who have cooked with me also know that I am a big fan of including a dark berry jam into ground meat dishes (chili, meatloaf, hamburgers, etc.) based on this same principle.

Salads – When dealing with acids in vinaigrettes, blueberries work well as added sweetness, either as a salad ingredient or pureed into the dressing. This helps tone down the sharp notes of vinegars, lemon, and lime juices. The result is a smoother more complex taste.

One last thing to remember is that blueberries are also enhanced by the taste of balsamic vinegar. Try this at home tonight: take a handful of blueberries, wash and dry them, and toss with a teaspoon of balsamic, and a sprinkle of sugar, if desired. The blueberries and the balsamic are both bold flavours and match up quite well.

Dear Chef Dez,

I love buying blueberries from our local farms in large quantities at a great price. What is the best way to freeze them? How long should I keep them before using them up?

Joseph C., Mission

Dear Joseph,

Blueberries are best frozen individually to make it easier to retrieve a certain measurement when they are frozen, rather than defrosting a solid mass of them. Line some baking sheets with parchment paper, and then wash and dry your blueberries. Scatter them all out on the lined baking sheets and freeze them completely. Once completely frozen, easily transfer them to freezer bags by sliding them off the parchment. I suggest keeping frozen blueberries for six to 12 months at the most for best results.

A Thanksgiving tradition that draws tens of thousands of Lower Mainland residents to Fort Langley every fall has been cancelled due to COVID.

Fort Langley’s 25th annual Cranberry Festival – always held on the Saturday of the Thanksgiving Day weekend in October – will not happen as a direct result of the pandemic, said Meghan Neufeld, the former festival coordinator and Fort Langley Business Improvement Area board member.

RELATED – VIDEO: Fort Langley Cranberry Festival rated a ‘huge success’

“This year’s Fort Langley Cranberry Festival was to take place on Saturday, Oct. 10 and would have been the festival’s 25th annual celebration,” she explained.

“Unfortunately, the desire to host the festival, even in an alternate-capacity, did not outweigh the need for public safety and regulatory compliance,” Neufeld said, acknowledging that the streets of Fort Langley are usually packed, shoulder to shoulder with festival goers for the one-day event.

READ MORE – LETTER: Fort Langley festival reminds us to be thankful

Due to the restrictions on gathering sizes limiting both the number of people and number of vehicles, the BIA directors made what she described as “the difficult decision to not proceed with the festival this year.”

The Fort Langley Cranberry Festival has been running since 1996 and has grown into a highly anticipated event of significant size – with more than 60,000 people visiting the village each year for the scheduled festivities.

“While it is disappointing that the event cannot happen this year, the Fort Langley BIA has high hopes that the village will celebrate the festival’s 25th anniversary in 2021,” Neufeld said, encouraging the public to still visit Fort Langley and “explore all it has to offer.”

Tony Award-nominated actor Nick Cordero, who specialized in playing tough guys on Broadway in such shows as “Waitress,” “A Bronx Tale” and “Bullets Over Broadway,” has died in Los Angeles after suffering severe medical complications after contracting the coronavirus. He was 41.

Cordero, who was born in Hamilton, Ont., died Sunday at Cedars-Sinai hospital after more than 90 days in the hospital, according to his wife, Amanda Kloots. “God has another angel in heaven now,” she posted on Instagram. “Nick was such a bright light. He was everyone’s friend, loved to listen, help and especially talk. He was an incredible actor and musician. He loved his family and loved being a father and husband.”

Cordero entered the emergency room on March 30 and had a succession of health setbacks, including mini-strokes, blood clots, septic infections, a tracheostomy and a temporary pacemaker implanted. He had been on a ventilator and unconscious and had his right leg amputated. A double lung transplant was being explored.

The Broadway and acting community was in anguish after news of Cordero’s death, with Lin-Manuel Miranda tweeting “What a loss, what a light” and Bernadette Peters “sending love” to his widow and infant son. Many asked people to wear masks in his honour.

Viola Davis was also among those in mourning, writing to his family that “my heart is with you all.” Fellow Broadway actress and president of Actors’ Equity Association Kate Shindle wrote on Twitter that she was “heartbroken for his family and deeply saddened by the loss of this talented and widely loved actor.”

During Cordero’s hospitalization, Kloots sent him daily videos of her and their 1-year-old son, Elvis, so he could see them if he woke up, and urged friends and fans to join a daily sing-a-long. A GoFundMe page to pay for medical expenses has raised over $600,000.

“I tell him, I say, ‘You’re gonna walk out of this hospital, honey. I believe it. I know you can,’” she told “CBS This Morning” this summer. ”‘We’re gonna dance again. You’re gonna hold your son again.’ My line is, ‘Don’t get lost. Get focused.’”

If you are able. There are broken hearts tonight. Fundraiser for Amanda Kloots by Erin Silver : Support Amanda Kloots Nick Cordero & Elvis https://t.co/aMyPrNXESc — Sarah Paulson (@MsSarahPaulson) July 6, 2020

The lanky Cordero originated the menacing role of husband Earl opposite his estranged wife, played by Jessie Mueller, in “Waitress” as well as the role of Sonny in Chazz Palminteri’s “A Bronx Tale.” It was at “Bullets Over Broadway” where Cordero met his wife. The two married in 2017.

Castmembers from “Waitress” — Jessie Mueller, Keala Settle, Kimik Glenn and songwriter Sara Bareilles — helped raise money for Cordero by covering his song “Live Your Life.” Sylvester Stallone sent a video with best wishes.

Kloots had said that it was difficult to tell whether Cordero understood happened to him, but said he could respond to commands by looking up and down when he was alert.

Her husband played a mob soldier with a flare for the dramatic in Broadway’s Woody Allen 1994 film adaptation of “Bullets Over Broadway,” for which he received a Tony nomination for best-featured actor in a musical. He and his family moved to Los Angeles to star in “Rock of Ages.”

On the small screen, Cordero appeared in several episodes of “Blue Bloods” and “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit” and he had a role in the film “Going in Style.”

Actor and guitarist for Bruce Springsteen Stevie Van Zandt offered Cordero his first TV acting gig in the final episode of “Lilyhammer.” After he was hospitalized, Van Zandt teamed up with Constantine Maroulis and Vincent Pastore to make a video performing “Live Your Life.”

Cordero was last onstage in a Kennedy Center presentation of “Little Shop of Horrors.” His off-Broadway credits include “The Toxic Avenger” and “Brooklynite.”

The virus has sickened other Broadway veterans, including the actors Danny Burstein, Tony Shalhoub, Brian Stokes Mitchell, Gavin Creel, Aaron Tveit and Laura Bell Bundy as well as composer David Bryan. It has also claimed the life of Tony-winning playwright Terrence McNally.

Hundreds of Summerland residents paraded past the Lekhi home on Hespeler Road on Thursday evening in a show of support for the Indo-Canadian family.

Earlier this week, the family’s home had been vandalized and racist graffiti, including swastikas, had been spray painted on the walls.

The incident left many shocked and saddened.

Those who participated in the parade on Thursday evening waved large Canadian flags and showed signs reading, “You are loved,” “We are all family,” “Hate has no home in Summerland” and other slogans.

In response, members of the Lekhi family waved signs of their own, reading “Unity” and “We love Summerland.”

Abhishek Lekhi, son of the family whose home was vandalized, estimated 150 to 200 vehicles in the lengthy parade.

Some of the participants were as old as 103 and others were as young as a few months old.

“Different colours, different genders, different religions. Everybody. Everybody was here,” he said.

The Lekhi family has lived in Summerland since 1987 and has lived in their home on Hespeler Road since 1990. “This is our home. This is our community. It doesn’t matter what anybody says, what anybody does. They can’t take away Summerland from us,” Lekhi said.

(Submitted)

The Abbotsford Police Department is looking for 30-year-old Matthew Roy after a suspected stabbing incident that occurred on July 13.

APD patrol officers were called to the 1600-block of Riverside Road in response to a stabbing and arrived on scene to discover a 34-year-old man suffering from stab wounds to his upper body. That man was then transported to the hospital with serious but non-life threatening injuries.

Police were told that a verbal altercation had occurred between two men, one then produced a large knife and stabbed the other. The suspect then fled on foot before the police arrived.

An inmate serving a life sentence for his part in the 1969 slaying of two men in Ottawa died at Abbotsford’s Pacific Institution on July 13.

David Brault has been serving time for two counts of non-capital murder, two counts of sexual assault and “other offences” since his arrest over 50 years ago, according to a July 17 news release from Correctional Service Canada.

CSC said Brault’s next of kin have been notified of his death.

A story in the Ottawa Journal, which stopped publication in 1980, says Brault was 24 years old in 1969 when he and another man pleaded guilty to the shooting deaths of Gerald MacDonald of Ottawa and Michigan resident Kenneth Vallee.

Brault told the court he became angry after being passed dangerously by two cars on an Ontario highway and after he chased each vehicle down, he and his friend shot both men.

A BC Hydro employee at the Site C work camp in Fort St. John has tested positive for COVID-19.

According to a statement from BC Hydro, the worker arrived from Alberta on July 13 and immediately self-isolated after receiving their test results from health officials.

Northern Health also conducted a second test, which came back positive on July 16.

“The worker is being cared for by the on-site health clinic, which has the trained staff, facilities and supplies required to provide health care to workers in isolation or quarantine,” BC Hydro said.

“The worker will continue isolating in their room, which is in a separate dormitory and away from other workers, until they are medically cleared to leave.”

Prior to self-isolating, the worker had not left the work camp or interacted with the local community, the utility corporation said.

Northern Health is now initiating contact tracing, and workers are being reminded to self-monitor and report any symptoms as per the site protocols.

BC Hydro said it has been closely monitoring the situation with COVID-19 since January, and implemented various policies in line with guidelines from provincial health officials.

On Thursday, 21 people tested positive for the novel coronavirus across B.C., bringing the total number of active cases to 192.

First we faced a physical health crisis, and stayed home to stay safe. Then came the mental health crisis, as reduced social contact and instability at home added stress to our lives.

“Covid was a big blow,” says Alicia Erenli, the Operational Supervisor at Foundry Ridge Meadows, which provides health and social services to young people. “Both the isolation and the abrupt change. It’s been a challenge for everybody, including youth whose social and emotional worlds were flipped upside-down, perhaps in uncomfortable home environments. Access to resources were limited due to isolation and restrictions, and for some, understanding how coping skills that helped in the past but just didn’t fit for this new reality.”

Foundry Ridge Meadows (formerly the Youth Wellness Centre) typically offers free supports to youth aged 12 to 24 from their beautiful new building at 22932 Lougheed Hwy, “where the old Frogstone Grill used to be.” Erenli wants to let the community know that Foundry is still here to help, even if their building looks quiet. In-person counselling and other services are available by-appointment, and new technology has allowed other supports to go virtual.

Join a video chat to play Dungeons and Dragons, watch a movie, discuss books, or chat with other caregivers.

The Supreme Court of Canada has upheld a judge’s decision to halt a murder case because of excessive delay, even though the accused man was long ago deported from Canada.

The ruling today is the high court’s latest pronouncement on the pressing issue of timely justice.

In 2017, a Quebec Superior Court judge ruled Sivaloganathan Thanabalasingham should not face trial for the alleged killing of his wife due to the nearly 60-month delay between his 2012 arrest and the start of proceedings.

In its landmark Jordan decision, the Supreme Court set a 30-month limit between the laying of charges and the conclusion of a trial for superior court cases.

Thanabalasingham was deported to his native Sri Lanka following his release, but arguments about halting the case continued to play out in the Canadian courts.

Last October the Quebec Court of Appeal said the Crown had not proven any errors in the trial judge’s decision to stay the murder charge.

Corey Hurren, 46, made a brief court appearance by phone Friday.

Hurren’s lawyer, Michael Davies, said he had not yet received disclosure of the evidence against his client and asked to have the bail hearing postponed until July 31.

Assistant Crown attorney Sabrina Goldfarb said the RCMP only sent their disclosure documents Thursday and it was not in a usable format, and that it would take until early next week for the evidence to be passed on to the defence.

Justice of the Peace Andrew Seymour granted the adjournment.

Hurren has been in custody in Ottawa since July 2, when police say they arrested him on the grounds of Rideau Hall after he allegedly crashed his truck through a security gate on the property where Trudeau and Gov. Gen. Julie Payette normally live.

Then he allegedly ran, carrying at least one gun with him, across the grounds towards the two residences.

Neither the Trudeau family nor Payette were on the grounds at the time.

Police say they caught up to him more than 10 minutes after the security breach, in the greenhouses behind Rideau Hall. Police then spoke to him for more than 90 minutes before arresting him.

Hurren, a Manitoba reservist and sausage-maker, faces 21 charges related to four guns he allegedly had with him and one of uttering threats against Trudeau.

Before the incident, he had posted online about the financial and other stresses he was under because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

A second House of Commons committee is to begin probing the aborted deal between the federal government and WE Charity to run a massive student-volunteering program.

WE gave up running the $912-million program amid controversy over hundreds of thousands of dollars in fees the WE organization paid to members of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s family for appearances at WE events.

Conservatives on the Commons ethics committee say they’ll be seeking copies of all records related to any speaking appearances involving Trudeau, his wife, his mother and his brother.

According to WE, most of the fees went to Trudeau’s mother Margaret, a mental-health advocate, for events between 2016 and 2020, and Justin Trudeau has never been paid anything.

Yesterday, the Commons finance committee heard from Youth Minister Bardish Chagger and senior public servants about how the arrangement with WE came together after Trudeau announced plans in April for a volunteering program for students who couldn’t find work this summer because of COVID-19.

That committee heard WE pitched the government on a different but related project days before the announcement, and officials saw the group’s connections with young people as vital to making the government’s program work.

The Royal Canadian Navy is looking to chart new waters by dropping the term “seaman” when referring to its most junior sailors and replacing it with something more gender-neutral.

Navies around the world have used the terms “ordinary seaman,” “able seaman,” “leading seaman” and “master seaman” for decades and in some cases centuries.

But Cmdr. Deborah Lynn Gates says those terms are being replaced in Canada as the navy, which is short hundreds of sailors, works to become more diverse and inclusive.

She says it is also aimed at making sure the navy’s most junior members feel safe and proud of their ranks and profession, acknowledging the double entendre associated with the term “seaman.”

Members of the navy as well as the public at large will be able to vote online on two alternatives starting Friday, with both variants substituting “sailor” in place of “seaman” in different ways.

While the plan to drop the term has already prompted some backlash on social media, Gates says the navy wants to show both Canadians and its sailors that it is a modern and progressive organization.

B.C. health officials have confirmed 21 new cases of COVID-19, marking five days in a row of higher daily case counts.

Three of the new cases are epi-linked, which means the person did not test positive for the virus but displayed some symptoms after being in close contact with an infected person or work in a facility with a known outbreak.

That brings the total number of active confirmed cases to 192, provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said in a news conference on Thursday (July 16).

Fifteen people are in hospital with three of those in intensive care. There were no new deaths since Wednesday afternoon.

Since the novel coronavirus was first confirmed in B.C. in February, there have been 3,170 confirmed cases.

The new cases were announced on the same day that results of a study by a group of B.C. researchers was released, suggesting eight times more people in B.C. have been infected with COVID-19 than the confirmed test stats.

Henry said that serology testing will help determine if transmission has been missed “when cases pop up out of nowhere seemingly.”

She says when an outbreak occurred in Alert Bay off northern Vancouver Island, the province did serology testing on residents there.

“That gives us a better idea of how this virus is transmitted in community settings so we can more nimbly target outbreaks as we go into the fall,” she said.

A suspended B.C. RCMP officer has been charged with a laundry list of sex offences dating back a decade.

The Ottawa Police Service announced 34 counts of voyeurism and three counts of sexual assault against Andrew Seangio, 35, on Thursday (July 16). The charges are connected to alleged incidents involving six woman known to him and are believed to have occurred between 2011 and 2018 while he was living in the city.

Seangio was charged in March by Vancouver police in connection to a string of sexual offences near an all-girls school last year. Shortly after those charges were laid, Seangio was suspended by the RCMP.

Police say Seangio turned himself into police Thursday morning.

Investigators believe there may be further victims and are asking anyone with information to contact their Sexual Assault and Child Abuse Unit tipline at 613-236-1222 ext. 5944 or to e-mail mcm@ottawapolice.ca.

Seven caribou habitat restoration projects received a total of $1.1 million in funding from the B.C. government’s Habitat Conservation Trust Foundation on July 16.

The funds are part of an $8.5 million commitment by the province, over three years, to support such projects.

“Human activity, such as forestry, mining, oil and gas, and road-building work, has altered caribou habitat,” stated a release from the Ministry of Forests. “Examples of activities that help restore caribou habitat include planting trees to restore areas to a pre-disturbed state and blocking former roads and other linear features, such as seismic lines (corridors cleared of vegetation for oil and gas exploration), to reduce predator access.”

One of this year’s projects will see the restoration of an 11-kilometre of road in the upper Bigmouth Valley 130 kilometres north of Revelstoke, led by Yucwmenlúcwu, a Splatsin-owned resource management company.

Last year the company planted almost 9,000 trees along a 5 km stretch of road in the valley and it continues to monitor the site to evaluate tree growth as well as impacts on wildlife.

Another project, approximately 30 km southeast of Anahim Lake in central B.C., will see trees planted along roads to create barriers and deter predator movement. The project is designed to benefit the Itcha-Ilgachuz herd.

A third project, in the Tweedsmuir caribou winter range, which is in the Skeena region 60 km south of Burns Lake, will see barriers created as well as lichen transplanted to the area.

Lichen is the preferred food source of caribou.

West of Chetwynd the Nîkanêse Wah tzee Stewardship Society was granted funding for three projects in hopes of protecting the Moberly (Klinse-Za) and Scott East herds. They will be replanting roads in the area that were formerly used for oil and gas exploration as well as 14 km of road in another location and 1.6 km of road in yet another location, both north of Mackenzie.

The Fort Nelson First Nation Lands Department will be replanting an area about 80 km northeast of the community to limit predator use of seismic lines as well as increasing habitat suitability for the Snake-Sahtahneh caribou herd.

This announcement comes two days after a study was released stating government-sponsored wolf killings in Western Canada had “no detectable effect” on reversing the decline of endangered caribou populations. And instead, factors affecting population decline include loss of habitat, logging snowpack variation and snowmobiling.

Several overnight backcountry camping areas in the Pacific Rim National Park Reserve will remain closed for the rest of 2020, including the West Coast Trail, the Broken Group Islands, and the Long Beach unit.

Parks Canada announced the decision to close these areas was done in consultation with local First Nations in response to concerns voiced by these communities about ongoing risks of COVID-19.

Overnight experiences on the West Coast Trail, including Keeha Beach, Tapaltos, all other locations in the Cape Beale region, and the Nitinaht Triangle are suspended for 2020.

One-way trails in the Long Beach unit, including Schooner Cove, Combers Beach, Nuu-chah-nulth, South Beach, Willowbrea and Halfmoon Bay will be closed.

The visitor centres, visitor services, interpretive programs and all group activities and special events throughout the national park reserve will not be operational.

Limited day use opportunities are still available in some backcountry areas of Pacific Rim National Park Reserve. However, motorized and non-motorized vessels, including kayaks, are not permitted to land anywhere within the West Coast Trail Unit.

All reservations for the Broken Group Islands and West Coast Trail will be automatically cancelled with all fees refunded.

Pacific Rim National Park Reserve falls within the traditional territories of nine Nuu-chah-nulth Nations. First Nations communities are among the most vulnerable to COVID-19 and visitors to backcountry areas in Pacific Rim National Park Reserve pass through Indigenous communities, Indian Reserve lands and Treaty Settlement lands.

Indigenous people are also present on these lands for cultural, ceremonial, and harvesting purposes. Visitors often interact with Beachkeepers in the Broken Group and Guardians on the West Coast Trail, who maintain infrastructure and provide guidance and cultural information to visitors.

Although B.C. has moved into phase 3 of its reopening, First Nations indicated that they were not ready to reopen and expose their territories to the risk of COVID-19.

Judith Sayers, president of the Nuu-chah-nulth Nations, along with the Heiltsuk and Tsilhqot’in First Nations had said on June 23, that travel in their respective territories will be restricted until safety concerns are met.

Hockey League has announced it plans to start its 2020-21 regular season Dec. 1, though teams can start training camps in early September. (Black Press file photos)

BCHL players will finally get to lace up their skates again in early September, though hockey season won’t start until December.

The B.C. Hockey League announced today that it plans to start the 2020-21 regular season Dec. 1. A press release from the league said that its communications with the province and health officials suggested that waiting until December “gives us the best chance at ensuring we have an uninterrupted season, while also maximizing the amount of regular-season games we’ll be able to play,” said Chris Hebb, BCHL commissioner.

Teams are being given the option to start training camp in September, and divisional exhibition games will be able to start once the province moves to Phase 3 of ViaSport B.C.’s return-to-play model, the BCHL press release notes.

The Nanaimo Clippers say they plan to open training camp Sept. 8, while the Alberni Valley Bulldogs say they’re planning for camp to open Sept. 14. An Island Division exhibition tournament is being planned to start in October and the BCHL news release noted that divisional exhibition games will be live-streamed.

“There’s going to be games played in that time, we’re just not confident we’re going to have a large capacity [for fans],” said Tali Campbell, Clippers general manager.

He said league governors anticipate that by Dec. 1, they’ll be able to fill arenas to at least a 50-per cent capacity.

The BCHL hasn’t released its regular-season schedule yet.

“Once the number of games has been determined along with the special protocols that will be put in place, we will be happy to provide more information,” noted a statement from Vernon Vipers ownership. “We look forward to seeing our fans and partners again very soon.”

The Bulldogs say they’re working closely with municipal staff to make sure their multiplex will be ready to welcome fans back into the building safely once the season starts.

“We’re anxious for the day when we can re-open our doors for our home opener and welcome our amazing fans back,” said David Michaud, Bulldogs president, in a press release.

BCHL teams rely on ticket sales, and will have limited or no gate during the first few months of the season while absorbing costs of running a junior hockey program.

“We’re certainly having to re-juggle our books and figure out ways to make things work in the larger scheme of things,” Campbell said.

But he said “every governor’s on board” with the extended training camp model meant to engage players, help them achieve their hockey and education goals, and prepare them for a 2020-21 season.

“[Players] want to come back … they want to aim to win a championship here,” Campbell said. “They want to get back into that culture of things and get going on practising and being part of a team.”

Ontario Premier Doug Ford says he’s looking forward to the Toronto Blue Jays playing at Rogers Centre this season after a member of his government said the Major League Baseball team has been given the green light to play games at home.

The federal government, however, hasn’t yet approved the plan.

Ontario’s Minister of Heritage, Sport, Tourism and Culture Industries Lisa MacLeod told Ottawa’s TSN Radio 1200 on Thursday that the Blue Jays have clearance to play in Toronto and travel to the United States for road games during the COVID-19 pandemic.

She said teams visiting Toronto will stay inside a quarantine bubble, which would include Rogers Centre and a hotel. MacLeod said the agreement will be rescinded if the protocols put in place are broken.

Because the plan would involve multiple crossings of the Canada-U.S. border both by the Blue Jays and by visiting teams, the final say on whether the plan can go ahead rests with the federal government. Canada currently requires individuals to quarantine for 14 days after crossing the international border.

While MacLeod said the Blue Jays “have been cleared by the federal government to play in both countries,” the federal government has yet to confirm that is the case.

Public Health Agency of Canada spokeswoman Natalie Mohamed said the immigration minister had issued a national interest exemption to the League’s players and staff members specific to pre-season training phases 1 and 2 earlier this month.

The Canadian government is still reviewing the Blue Jays’ and Major League Baseball’s plan for regular season games, she said in a statement.

Toronto Mayor John Tory said he urged the federal and provincial governments to approve MLB’s plan.

“This is one of the most extensive protocols I’ve ever seen to keep people safe in the city of Toronto,” Tory said. “They are going to actually sacrifice a lot by having themselves confined, largely when they are not out of town, to the hotel premises.”

The Blue Jays declined comment when reached by The Canadian Press. The federal government did not immediately respond for comment.

Canada’s deputy public health officer Dr. Howard Njoo had expressed concerns about the plan Tuesday, saying Canada and the United States are in very different places with regards to COVID-19.

Njoo said while Canada typically records around 300 new COVID-19 cases daily, the United States records over 60,000 cases per day.

Ford was asked why the Ontario government approved the plan.

“We got approval from the (Toronto) chief medical officer, and we discussed it with Mayor (John) Tory as well. We discussed it with the chief medical officer of Canada along with the deputy prime minister. And on top of it we talked to (Ontario chief medical officer) Dr. (David) Williams and our medical team. And yes I look forward to seeing them play even if it’s in an empty stadium.

“Folks if you’d seen the protocol, I think Major League Baseball’s was 150 pages,” he added. ”They’re probably even stricter than our chief medical officers.”

Tory doesn’t want the Blue Jays to be the only MLB team not to play in its home stadium.

“I have faith,” Tory said. “I’m very confident that this stereotype that we’re going to see all these people running around partying will not take place.”

The Blue Jays’ 60-game season starts July 24 at Tampa Bay, with the home opener set for July 29 against the Washington Nationals.

The Blue Jays currently are holding training camp at Rogers Centre after getting approval from the federal government.

Vancouver Whitecaps players including Patrick Metcalfe (centre) work out in a gym in Lake Buena Vista, Fla. on Monday, July 13, 2020. Vancouver’s wait ended at the MLS is Back Tournament against the San Jose Earthquakes on July 15. Vancouver, the last team to see action, was originally slated to open July 9 against FC Dallas but the game was scrapped when Dallas withdrew due to a rash of COVID-19 positive tests. THE CANADIAN PRESS/HO-MLS Mandatory Credit

LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. — Substitute Shea Salinas scored in the 98th minute as the San Jose Earthquakes rallied from 2-0 and 3-1 deficits to defeat the Vancouver Whitecaps in a wild 4-3 win Wednesday at the MLS is Back Tournament.

Goals by substitute Chris Wondolowski, in the 72nd minute, and Oswaldo Alanis, in the 81st, tied the game at 3-3.

Vancouver was reeling during the nine minutes of stoppage time before Salinas administered the coup de grace. The former Whitecap dribbled through the Vancouver defence, got a fortunate bounce and knocked the ball past goalkeeper Maxime Crepeau.

The Earthquakes dominated possession and had eight corners in the first 30 minutes but found themselves down 2-0 to the opportunistic Whitecaps, who led by two despite having just one shot on target.

Ali Adnan and Cristian Dajome scored for Vancouver, which also benefited from an own goal.

Andy Rios also scored for San Jose, which had plenty of the ball but lacked clinical finishing most of the night against a depleted Whitecaps side. Still, Crepeau had a busy night.

Adnan, Vancouver’s Iraqi international left back, opened the scoring in the seventh minute, curling a shot past a diving Daniel Vega from just inside the penalty box.

Vancouver made it 2-0 in the 22nd minute on an own goal when Dajome, after a San Jose corner went horribly awry, stole the ball from Brazil’s Judson and fed Yordy Reyna behind the Quakes defence. Reyna tried to slip the ball back to Dajome in the box but instead it bounced off Judson’s leg into the goal.

San Jose came on in waves and Rios cut the lead to 2-1 in first-half stoppage time off the Quakes’ 12th corner of the half, deflecting the ball in with a delightful flick of his foot with his back to goal.

Dajome capitalized in the 59th minute when a dreadful pass from Vega went straight to David Milinkovic, who found the Colombian alone in front for his first MLS goal.

The 37-year-old Wondolowski made an impact off the bench, flicking in a header to cut the lead to 3-2. The goal was the 160th of his career, adding to his MLS-record regular-season total, and his 14th against Vancouver.

Alanis then rose high to score off San Jose’s 19th corner, which tied a league record, to tie the game.

The Quakes outshot Vancouver 31-7 and also led the Whitecaps 11-2 in shots on target. San Jose also set a league mark with 22 corners and had 67.9 per cent possession. The Whitecaps lived dangerously on defence but made the most of their few chances at the other end, helped by San Jose blunders.

Vancouver was the last team to see action at the tournament, taking the field at ESPN’s Wide World of Sports complex after Orlando City and Philadelphia had already qualified for the knockout rounds.

The Whitecaps were originally slated to open July 9 against FC Dallas but the game was scrapped when Dallas withdrew due to a rash of COVID-19 positive tests.

San Jose opened the tournament last Friday with a 0-0 tie with the Seattle Sounders.

It was 26 C at the 9 p.m. ET kickoff after showers swept through the area.

After Vancouver went ahead, Crepeau made a fine save in the ninth minute to deny Jackson Yueill. Crepeau then had to deal with a powerful Cristian Espinoza shot.

Crepeau had to be sharp again in the 26th minute, clawing away a looping long ball from Espinoza that was destined for the top corner. The Whitecaps ‘keeper was fortunate in the 41st minute when a deflection off a defender following a corner went right at him.

San Jose outshot Vancouver 17-4 in the first half and had 73.4 percent possession.

Espinoza was yellow-carded in the 56th minute when he returned the ball for Vancouver throw-in head-high, hitting Adnan who tumbled theatrically to the turf. The card remained yellow after video review.

The Whitecaps are missing some key pieces at the tournament.

Forwards Lucas Cavallini, Fredy Montero and Tosaint Ricketts, defender Andy Rose and defender/midfielder Georges Mukumbilwa did not make the trip to the Florida tournament for personal or medical reasons.

Cavallini, Ricketts and Rose all started in Vancouver’s last league outing — a 1-0 win at the Los Angeles Galaxy on March 7 — while Montero came off the bench.

Wednesday’s starting 11 came into the game with a combined 29 MLS regular-season goals with Reyna accounting for 19 of those.

Backup goalkeeper Bryan Meredith left the team Tuesday to be with his family in New Jersey after the death of his mother Beth. Whitecaps player wore black armbands with B.M. on them with fullback Jake Nerwinski walking out holding Meredith’s jersey with Beth Meredith’s name written under the number.

Janio Bikel (adductor strain), who started at right back against the Galaxy, and defender Eric Godoy (quadricep strain) were injured in training Sunday.

Whitecaps midfielder Leonard Owusu, 23, made his first start while centre back Ranko Veselinovic, 21, made his MLS debut.

Captain Russell Teibert made his 200th first-team appearance. Whitecaps midfielder Patrick Metcalfe, a 21-year-old from Richmond, made his MLS debut off the bench.

Vancouver plays Seattle on Sunday before facing Chicago, which replaced Dallas in Group B, on July 23.

Group games at the tournament count in the regular-season standings, leaving Vancouver at 1-2-0 and San Jose at 1-1-2.

Maple Ridge goalie prospect, Eric Clark, will try to build upon his local success this year when he leaves home to join the JR A Estevan Bruins of the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League.

The 18-year-old hockey player, who recently graduated from Samuel Robertson Technical with straight As, said he’s looking forward to the challenge.

“It’s really exciting,” Eric said. “It’s going to be quite a new experience in my life.”

With two years of Pacific Junior Hockey League under his belt with the Ridge Meadows Flames and the North Vancouver Wolf Pack, Eric will have an idea of what to expect, but it will still be a jump in level of competition when he joins the Saskatchewan squad.

”Everyone’s going to be more accurate, and players are going to be fast,” he admits.

“It’s going to be a step up in everything.”

Despite riding high after a successful season that saw him go 17-0 with the Wolf Pack, he is working very hard to prepare for the next level. The young goaltender is putting in two days a week with Maple Ridge fitness trainer, Eric Arksey and another few days a week with goalie coach, Angelo Maggio, in Langley.

Eric said his family deserves a lot of credit for giving him the push he has needed over the years.

“My family’s been really supportive,” he insisted.

“They’ve been driving me to the rink forever and they’re always coming to watch. I couldn’t have done it without them.”

He will be put up with a billet family when he reaches Estevan, Saskatchewan, but will do his best to stay in touch with his mom and dad.

“We’re going to be FaceTiming almost every other night, so they’ll still be with me,” Eric said.

His mom, Laurie, said she’s very pleased for her son.

“He’s put in a lot of hard work,” she said, noting how impressed she is by his ability to be well-rounded with sports and academics.

“I’m definitely proud of how he’s been able to focus on both of those things which are so important to him.”

While it will be difficult when Clark’s not around, she said she feels her and husband, Tim, have been lucky to be able to have Eric close to home for so long.

“He’s had friends who’ve left their homes to play hockey a long time ago,” she said.

“A lot of kids [Eric’s age] are going away to college now anyways, so he’s old enough now that I feel comfortable having him leave.”

Following his Junior A stint in Saskatchewan, Eric said he would like to take his talents to the U.S.

“I’m hoping to go to the NCAA to play hockey,” he said, “I think it would be really fun and help me go further in life.”

(Edmonton Stingers Twitter photo)

All seven Canadian Elite Basketball League teams, including Abbotsford’s Fraser Valley Bandits, have descended onto St. Catharines, Ont. this week to begin preparation for the Summer Series event, which runs from July 25 to Aug. 9.

It’s the first semblance of pro sports in Canada and in the COVID-19 era that means safety, precautions and testing.

Bandits management told The News they are bringing a total of 15 people to the tournament, which includes players, coaches and other staff. They stated that ordinarily that number is usually over 20, but medical support is being sourced from the St. Catharines region so the team is not bringing a doctor, athletic therapist or a physiotherapist.

It’s a similar case for the other six teams in the league, as Bandits management said it is a very exclusive list of essential people that will be arriving and participating in the tournament.

Bandits vice president Dylan Kular said the tournament came to be after much consultation with Ontario health officials.

“All of our plans have been subject to the measures put in place by provincial, federal, and local public health and government officials,” he said. “Without their blessing we cannot move forward. We have been fully compliant with every requirement and will continue to be. Public health officials have worked closely with us to put in place exceptionally detailed medical protocols designed to keep our players, coaches, staff, local public and tournament officials safe.”

Every player and staff member at the tournament was tested for COVID-19 on Monday (July 13) after arriving. The test involves inserting a six-inch long swab into the cavity between your nose and mouth for approximately 15 seconds and rotating it several times. The swab is then inserted into a container and sent to a lab for testing. Niagara health authorities will then analyze the findings.

Anyone being tested will remain self-isolated until they receive word that they have tested negative and after receiving a negative test the individual will be allowed to train or work in the approved areas. A positive test will force the person to immediately adhere to the rules and supervision of local health authorities.

All players and staff who had arrived from outside of Canada for the tournament have been quarantined for two weeks as per the federal policy.

Kular said that testing and screening will be ongoing throughout the tournament.

“There will be daily screening and frequent testing of all individuals participating in the Summer Series,” he said. “There will be exhaustive cleaning measures at all times and in all areas of the arena, training facility and hotel. Also, each team will have someone designated to monitor their social distancing practices to make sure they conform to the six-foot rule. People will wear masks unless they are involved in the actual game or practice session. If an individual shows symptoms of COVID then they are given to the Niagara region health authorities for testing and contact tracing. Prior to round robin games commencing there will be another test administered.”

Players who test positive during the tournament will be immediately removed and provided a course of action by local medical officials. The CEBL has also created three safe zones: the Meridian Centre (where games are being played), a local training facility and a nearby hotel that is not open to the public during the tournament. The names of the hotel and the training facility will not be made public by the league.

“There will be very tight restrictions around who can enter the parameters of where we will live and work for the four weeks,” Kular said.

The names of those testing positive will not be made public, but the league may reveal the amount of players or staff that tested positive.

As the court season gets underway, the Seniors Tennis Society of Maple Ridge is looking to bolster its membership.

The association has around 45 members at the moment but they have had has many as 60 in the past said one of its founders, Roman Evancic.

To entice new members, he said they are offering free tennis lessons to anyone who is nervous about starting.

“I started at 65,” Evancic, who is now 82-years-old and looks to be in fantastic shape, said.

Regular tournaments help the members hone their games and a weekly “ladder” challenge is enticing to those who like to keep their edge in between.

“You play every Monday at your level, and if you win you move up a rung, and if you lose you move down a rung,” Evancic said.

“It’s a little competitive, which makes for lot of fun. Our goal is encouraging good exercise for seniors.”

John Jacobs, who serves as a director for the club, said they are always looking for new members for the club as some people move on from the sport, or can’t play for health reasons.

They accept people as young as 55 and there is no age limit on the upper end.

“It’s always nice to have new players to play with, as everybody’s got different abilities,” Jacobs said.

The matches are always doubles, so there is not quite as much running around, and players can form great bonds with their partners from game-to-game.

“I’ve made a lot of new friends here over the last five years.”

Good will extends to ensuring everyone is playing as well as they can.

Rick Ford, who serves as the vice president of the club said everybody with a fair amount of experience pitches in to teach others.

“We’ve put together some organized lessons at times,” he said.

“Lots of people come to this game later in their athletic life and like any sport, you need to learn it.”

Seniors interested in giving tennis a shot are welcome to show up to the Maple Ridge Tennis Club between 8 a.m and noon on weekdays, or they can call club president Roland Muzzolini at 604-820-4122 for more info.

Oilers fans pack the square during the Edmonton Oilers’ Orange Crush community rally in Sir Winston Churchill Square in Edmonton on Thursday, April 20, 2017. Hockey fans in Canadian cities with NHL teams have a reputation for expressing their exhuberance in the streets during the playoffs, and some admit the temptation to ignore physical-distancing guidlines may prove too great as the pandemic-postponed season resumes next month. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Codie McLachlan

As hockey fans gear up for a truncated season to begin next month, some in Canada’s two “hub cities” say the temptation to celebrate — and flout physical distancing guidelines — may prove too great.

“I can’t say no to a good time,” said Edmonton Oilers fan Jeet Jermana. “I’d be hard-pressed not to jump into a big party.”

On Friday, the NHL board of governors and NHL Players’ Association said they had ratified the return-to-play plan, paving the way for the league to resume its pandemic-hit season later this summer.

Toronto and Edmonton were also officially unveiled as hub cities where all games will be played, beginning Aug. 1. Training camps start Monday in the 24 cities with teams still in the running for the Stanley Cup, including six in Canada.

In 2017, when the Oilers nearly advanced to the Western Conference final, Jermana was among the thousands of fans who partied in Ford Hall at Rogers Place arena and in bars along the popular Whyte Avenue district.

But with COVID-19 this year, where teams will play in empty arenas, Jermana said he’ll likely watch more games at home, maybe with just a few friends.

That is, he said, until the Oilers advance and he and other fans won’t be able to resist going out.

“Once it becomes the ‘real playoffs’ I think more and more the momentum will grab,” he said.

Matt Black of Hotel X Toronto, located west of the city centre where multiple media outlets have reported that several teams will be based, said the prospect of any accommodation for celebratory fan gatherings, even outdoors, seems unlikely.

Nevertheless, Black said he expects citywide excitement will be palpable, even with empty arenas.

“You look back to those scenes of Jurassic Park and Maple Leaf Square and all of that … it would be great for people to be able to get together again but you just need to make sure that you’re doing it in a safe manner,” said Black.

The players themselves aren’t to have any contact with the general public.

Dr. Vinita Dubey, Toronto’s associate medical health officer, said in an emailed statement that players and staff arriving from abroad will also have to serve a modified 14-day quarantine as well as undergo rigorous screening and daily testing protocols, wear masks in indoor settings, physically distance and wash hands often.

An Edmonton police spokesperson said the service wouldn’t be able to comment over the weekend on what sorts of preparations they might make for crowds when the season resumes.

Geoff Grimble with the City of Edmonton said the city’s civic events management team would likely discuss the issue during a scheduled meeting on Monday.

“The City of Edmonton’s first priority is public safety and we’ll continue to follow the advice and requirements of the Chief Medical Officer of Health to ensure fans, players, coaches and staff remain healthy,” Grimble said.

Oilers fan Brendan McLeod admitted he may be lured to a street celebration when — not if — his team advances, but said he still wants to maintain physical distancing.

“We have to get through this together or else it’s not going to change,” said McLeod.

But Shadi Merhej, who said he enjoys both hockey and the Oilers, noted the sport doesn’t have quite as strong attraction for him in the summer.

“It’s daylight ‘til 11 o’clock. You don’t want to spend half your day watching hockey,” Merhej explained.

“I’d rather go for a bike ride, or rollerblade or golf.”

The oldest festival in Maple Ridge and Pitt Meadows will have to be celebrated online this year.

Country Fest, which has been celebrated since 1901, was stopped in its tracks by COVID-19.

There will be no cheering at the pig races, exhilarating fairground rides, cotton candy tastings, or taking in of the popular home arts features.

General manager for the festival, Lorraine Bates, said she was hoping there would be some way to keep the show going but in the end it did not seem possible.

“It would have been a nightmare and you’d end up with people getting angry and I just didn’t want that.

“I wanted them to remember what the fair was and not the diluted version.”

Since they had the use of the stage and federal grant money to put on a stage show, Bates said she decided that was the best way to keep the spirit of the fair alive, while taking care of an industry that has suffered during the COVID-19 pandemic.

“Entertainers are starving,” Bates said. “People aren’t booking festivals, or even bands in bars.”

She pointed out the musical guests were over-the-moon once they discovered they would get to practice their craft again.

“We’re paying everybody,” Bates insisted. “But some of them said they’d be willing to play for nothing just to be able to get back up on stage and do what they do.”

The show will take place over two days from July 25-26, and be broadcast from the stage at the Albion fairgrounds.

Anyone interested in streaming the concert, which will feature music from all over the world, can find details on the Country Fest website.

In between performances there will be 15 minute breaks while the acts get off stage and the area is sanitized. Bates said she thought the interludes would be a great time to recognize the parts of the fair which will not get the time to shine this year.

“We reached out to all the 4-H kids that would have attended and asked them to send pics of them with their animals which they are unable to show this year,” Bates said.

These will be shown in a presentation with other pics from past years of the fair.

Additionally, Bates said it was important to the organizers to show some thanks to the front-line workers, so they have arranged for police, fire, and hospital representatives to have their say too.

Though this year’s festivities will be quite different from past Country Fest celebrations, Bates noted they are remaining optimistic about future fests.

“We are excited to be able to connect with our past visitors knowing that this isn’t forever, it’s just for now.”

Guess they didn’t get the memo on social distancing, or we’ll assume they’re a family or a bubble that have been socializing together throughout COVID.

A group of six deer were spotted lounging in the front yard of a home near Black Sheep Pub Friday morning, about 10 a.m.

These girls and boys were caught resting and sleeping in the front yard shrubs, not far from the road, said photographer Colt McMyn, who couldn’t believe his eyes.

The four bucks and two does were snuggled together in the front yard of his great uncle Ron McMyn’s one-acre property on 128th Avenue.

It’s the Albion Community Garage Sale, and it’s happening tomorrow, Saturday, July 11 throughout the Maple Ridge neighbourhood, explained participant and co-organizer Tara Adamyk.

There are at least 20 home owners, in what she calls Tiny Town (a.k.a. Albion), that will be participating between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., selling everything imaginable.

“We are all very excited as the planning, collaboration, and execution of this event has brought us together as a sub-community after going through such a challenging time,” Adamyk told The News.

Residents in the area hosted a community garage sale two years ago in one of the exhibit buildings at the Albion Fairground. That event had 40 vendors and was a “huge” success, drawing buyers from all over the community, and even some from outside Maple Ridge, Adamyk explained.

Using a community grant, last year the group mixed it up a bit, holding a block party in conjunction with the fire department’s Hot Summer Nights visit. That event attracted upwards of 400 visitors, Adamyk said.

“Obviously we can’t do anything like that this year either. However, we want to keep the sense of community and collaboration going and this garage sale is really helping with that,” she explained.

“We can’t have an indoor garage sale this year with many people in one space,” Adamyk noted.

Many residents were asking on social media about if it was okay to host garage sales amid COVID.

“The consensus is mainly yes, as long as certain safety precautions are taken – which we are adhering to,” she said, noting this year participating residents will be hosting the sales in their own yards.

Admittedly, she said, the sales will look a little different than garage sales in past. Social distancing and masks will be required, and hand sanitizer is being made available at each of the participating homes.

There’s also another rule in play at tomorrow’s neighbourhood garage sale, Adamyk said. Buyers are not permitted to touch items for sale without permission by the seller.

“Many people love visiting garage sales, and it’s an opportunity for neighbours to be outside doing something together with their neighbours… at a distance,” she said.

But there’s been another reason wby she opted to help orchestrate Saturday’s sale.

She noted that several people in the neighbourhood have lost their jobs, been laid off, or are experiencing financial hardship due to the pandemic.

“So making a few dollars on some household items they no longer need is kind of exciting for some,” said Adamyk, who acknowledged she’s not a garage saler, but loves helping people and organizing events.

”Plus we’ve all been home a lot more lately and have realized how much stuff we have and don’t need.”

She suggests there will be a bit of everything up for grabs Saturday.

“Baby and kids items, collector items such as hockey cards, vintage games, and memorabilia, gently used items, homemade items, you name it,” Adamyk said.

The concentration of the sales are east of 240th Street, between 102nd and 110th Avenues. A Google map has been set up pinpointing the locations, with an information booth set up at Adamyk’s home at 24334 102B Ave.

We are heartbroken to announce the passing of our mom, Dianna “Dee” Parry on July 8, 2020 after a short but hard fought battle with Cancer.

Dee is survived by her husband Bob, her daughters; Rhonda (Dal), Cheryl (Tim), Elisa (Glenn), and cherished grandchildren. She leaves behind many other family members and lifelong friends.

Dee was born on February 27, 1952 in Regina, Saskatchewan but was raised in Winnipeg, Manitoba with her amazing and supportive extended family. She is predeceased by her parents Helen and Wilfred Ling.

She eventually moved to B.C. and raised her family in Maple Ridge.

Dee was devoted to her work and helping others. She was a hard-working and successful advertising sales representative at the Tri-City News and an active volunteer in her community. She organized many events and held fundraisers for Crossroads Hospice, Canadian Cancer Society and Seaforth Highlanders of Canada.

A single parent for many years, she was fiercely independent and always had a to-do list!

Mom could sew anything! And loved knitting too. She enjoyed hikes on Burke mountain with Bob and her fur baby Jake, shopping and lunch dates with her bestie Carol and bragged about her sharp shooting skills at the Gun Club.

She was a wonderful Grandma and will forever be remembered by family and friends for her bubbly personality, infectious smile and teeny tiny shoes.

Forever in our hearts.

Due to the current health restrictions a private family gathering will be held to celebrate her life.

With a variety of safety measures in place, the Payton and Buckle team welcomes you back to the store, says owner John Laanstra. Choose from a wide variety of summer-perfect styles at Payton and Buckle.

One of the Fraser Valley’s most popular locally owned shoe stores has reopened for business – and just in time for summer!

“We closed for two months to support the community’s efforts to prevent the spread of COVID-19, but with a variety of safety measures and sanitizing in place, we’re happy to welcome our customers back to the store,” says John Laanstra, owner of Payton and Buckle Fine Footwear in Chilliwack, Abbotsford and Pitt Meadows.

To maintain physical distancing protocols, only four customers are permitted inside at one time, and regular sanitizing of surfaces is happening throughout the day.

Recognizing the importance of fit for any shoe purchase, customers are permitted to try on shoes, Laanstra adds.

Step into a new summer style

The timing of Payton and Buckle’s reopening couldn’t be better, as we step outside and into a variety of warm-weather adventures – adventures that will be a lot more enjoyable with happy feet.

Whether it’s the trails or beach that beckon, it’s important to do it with shoes that provide the right support for your activity.

Fortunately, summer style doesn’t mean foregoing comfort, and conversely, quality and comfort can be super-stylish, Laanstra says. This is one case where you can have the best of both worlds, whether you’re shopping for walking shoes, sandals or flip-flops, or high-fashion shoes.

(Better yet, to welcome shoppers back to the stores following the recent closure, you’ll also find many of your regular-priced favourites at 25 per cent off, and sale footwear at an extra 35 per cent off!)

Brands like Vionic, for example, create “fashionable footwear with supportive footbeds,” giving you the comfort you want no matter the size and shape of your foot. In fact, many designs are adjustable to ensure the perfect fit.

Other popular choices include design-driven comfort styles from Josef Seibel, Clarks – created to let you walk longer and farther with less fatigue – FitFlop, for style and comfort with biomechanical technology, Ecco and Rieker.

And, in doing so, they also helped raise some needed money for a Maple Ridge environmental group.

A relatively new butterfly adoption program, hosted by the Alouette River Management Society (ARMS), translated to a big shot in the arm for the environmental stewardship organization that was forced – like many groups – to shut down operations early this spring as a direct result of the coronavirus.

Closing its centre and halting all its community-outreach programs – internally and those held out in the public – hit the bottom line for this organization pretty hard, according to executive director Greta Borick-Cunningham.

A large chunk of ARMS $150,000 annual operating budget typically comes from the spring education classes and camps. Shut downs meant a loss of at least $20,000 directly attributed to those programs alone, she explained.

Thankfully, Borick-Cunningham said, people’s love of butterflies has helped provide her group with a much needed infusion of cash. And she’s looking for a few other similar initiatives.

The butterfly adoption program, which started in 2019, was expanded this year. And thanks to the spread of word through social media it doubled last year’s participation of 100, and netted ARMS $6,100.

“Those additional funds were sort plowed back to make up some of the lost revenue from the spring education… It does make a big difference.”

All 200 of this year’s supporters had the chance to adopt a Painted Lady caterpillar larvae from ARMS, and due to the pandemic it was hand delivered to their front step.

The adoption program allowed folks – most of them children already self-isolating at home with their families – to watch and learn the lifecycle of a butterfly change right before their eyes.

It is proving a popular and growing program, said Borick-Cunningham, who expects it will be repeated and expanded again next butterfly season – which usually last about six weeks between mid-April and the end of May.

The fundraising initiative is one part of their pollinating program, which also includes school visits, public beekeeping workshops, and participation in numerous community events hosted by other organizations.

This year, due to the virus, “that came to a grinding halt,” said Borick-Cunningham, who’s also missing the chance to get her organization and its education and advocacy efforts out in front of the community.

Nevertheless, she said she’s grateful for the extra money raised from the butterflies.

But she’s now casting about for other fundraising options for ARMS, given their new reality.

For instance, the group is looking at hosting a virtual salmon adoption this fall, or alternatively selling owl or chickadee houses in kit form that can be built at home as a family project.

“We have to be creative to help leverage the funds that we’ve lost,” she said, pointing to the annual June fundraising dinner as another example. That event usually sells out with about 100 people and brings in about $8,500. It had to be cancelled due to COVID-related restrictions on gatherings, but Borick-Cunningham said they’re considering hosting a virtual dinner this fall.

Brogan’s Ride Against Cancer organizer Ken Johnson, seen here at the wheel of his prized convertible, will be taking part in the Sunday, July 12 fundraising ride against cancer, rain or shine from Langley to Harrison. (file)

Brogan’s Ride Against Cancer organizer Ken Johnson has been keeping a careful eye on the Fraser Valley weather forecast for this coming Sunday, July 12, the day for the third edition of the annual fundraiser.

“I saw one [forecast] that said it would be cloudy with sunny breaks and another that said there was a 60 per cent chance of rain,” Johnson told the Langley Advance Times.

How wet conditions are will decide how many of the more than 200 classic car owners who have expressed an interest in the event actually show up, he explained, noting that represents at least nine different car clubs from throughout the Lower Mainland and Fraser Valley.

“There’s a lot of people who don’t want to take their cars out if it’s raining,” Johnson acknowledged.

Even more of a wild card are the social distancing requirements of the COVID-19 pandemic.

It will make for a different kind of ride, without people able to hang out in the parking lot or fill the seats inside Brogan’s Diner – a co-sponsor of the annual event.

Instead of hanging out, drivers will be asked to arrive shortly before the departure time of 9 a.m. (sharp) and line up in the Highland Village mall parking – in front of Brogan’s.

At the scheduled time, they will leave for Chilliwack, then Harrison, before returning to Langley and Brogan’s.

“It’s really different this year,” Johnson commented.

Cancer is a personal issue for Johnson, whose wife Theresa is a cancer survivor.

He lost one of his best friends to cancer as well, and several other friends are battling the disease.

Money raised by the ride will go to specific families nominated by readers of the ride Facebook page, he added.

“We’re trying to help any way we can.”

Brogan’s will be able to accommodate no more than 80 people, thanks to Plexiglas dividers that Johnson helped install.

“It’s not so much about the money, as setting out in the sun and having a good time,” Johnson remarked.

He will be driving his classic convertible, a car that comes with a story.

“I rode in that car when I was four years old,” Johnson laughed.

Years later, he located it, and bought it.

It was not in the best of shape, and took about two years to restore, he recalled.

“I found it in the blackberry bushes.”

He’s had more offers than he can count to buy the immaculate 1950s classic ride, but he means to keep it.

Like most classic car owners, he is also not a fan of rainy weather, but that will not deter him from taking part in this year’s fundraiser.

“We’re going, no matter what,” Johnson declared.

READ ALSO: Classic car enthusiasts rev their engines for fallen friend

In its first year, the car show raised $3,700 that was distributed to three local families.

The second annual Brogan’s Diner Fight Against Cancer Car Show raised $2,900 for the cause.

This year, they are hoping to collect $4,000.

Donations can be at the GoFundMe page for Brogan’s Fight Against Cancer Car Cruise or by e-transfer.

Benito Tuyor is a bit of a fixture on the 3 North medical ward at Ridge Meadows Hospital, and his efforts for going above and beyond were recently acknowledged by a patient and hospital, alike.

Tuyor – who has worked at the Ridge Meadows Hospital since 2009 (two years as a care aide and since 2011 as a licenced practical nurse) was singled out as a Caregiving Angel.

Often a patient is grateful for the care that they receive and they want to do something to say thanks, explained Debbie Kennedy, with the Ridge Meadows Hospital Foundation.

Such was the case recently, when Tuyor was lauded for his efforts.

“A donation was made in Benito’s honour for his outstanding care and compassion, and for being there for the patient and their family,” Kennedy said.

The foundation has developed a program whereby people can acknowledge a staff member who does that little extra, and Tuyor was the latest to be recognized, Kennedy said.

By making a donation to the hospital, the person saying thank you not only expresses gratitude to the institution, but more importantly the individual Caregiving Angel, who receives a special angel pin and a letter honouring them from the foundation, Kennedy explained.

(Submitted photo)

It was with grit, enthusiasm and a little help from family and friends that helped Helen Horn summit the Lone Butte near 100 Mile House at 96 years of age on June 21.

Helen made the ascent with the help of a group of friends and her son Gus to celebrate a year since suffering a stroke. She’s no stranger to the Lone Butte as she used to climb if often in her younger years.

Born on her parents’ homestead in Lone Butte 96 years ago, Helen was born the daughter of a farmer-rancher who went on to marry a farmer-rancher. She worked the farm all her life until retirement and when asked what she enjoyed the most about it, joked there wasn’t time to think of joy in those days and instead she would simply wake up with a job that needed doing and she’d set herself to doing it, as simple as that.

“Time went by quickly and every year had a spring, a fall, winter and a summer and we did the best we could with what we had,” Helen said.

Since retiring Helen, with the help of her friends and family, has done her best to keep her mind and body active to keep herself healthy, happy and independent as possible. While she knows that everyone’s time comes for them eventually, she’s intent on keeping her own time as far away as she can as long as she’s able.

It’s thank to the people in her life, Helen said, that she’s still alive to this day as many people don’t reach her age and those that do often have serious physical or mental health issues limiting them in some way. It was this same group of people who pushed her and encouraged her to join them in hiking and climbing up the Lone Butte in mid-June.

The last time Helen had done it prior to this year was when she was 91, five years ago, and was able to make it up on “her own two feet.” This time, however, due in part to her advanced age and in part because of the difficult terrain, which she thinks has gotten rougher since her youth, she had to be assisted up via the use of rappelling equipment and at one point by getting a piggyback ride from young Dawson Schroevers.

“I did as I was told and I enjoyed every minute of it,” Helen said. “(At the top) we toasted the day, the people and the encouragement of everybody cause without that I could never have made the journey.”

Helen said they brought out some chairs to just enjoy the view and share a drink and some food together as for many of her companions, it was their first time on the Butte including that of young Ben who, at one year of age, was the youngest person on the rock. Helen added that they were blessed by the weather that day as, while it looked like it was going to storm, it held off and they instead were treated with sun and mild wind. She also quipped even the mosquitoes seemed to take the day off, which was a welcome relief.

“I was just so happy to see so many people,” Helen said, adding that everyone who lives in the 100 Mile House area should consider climbing the Lone Butte at least once in their lives.

Helen appreciates the support of everyone who came with her on this climb and the encouragement they gave her throughout the climb. It was an experience she greatly enjoyed and cherishes.

To the community of 100 Mile House as a whole, she’d like to encourage them to carry on the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic because she believes that without the community’s diligence the virus would not have bypassed the town. She’s hopeful that we can continue to hold ranks until this epidemic settles down, as she’s sure the world will never be the same after it.

Restrictions imposed in March due to the COVID-19 pandemic may have left more than a few people wondering how to keep busy at home – but retired Surrey firefighter Ron Henze didn’t let the sudden shutdown of ‘normal’ life keep him idle for long.

And the project that kept him busy – restoring a 1956 Farmall Cub tractor – did more than fill a gap in his own life. It returned a piece of history to its glory, evoking broad smiles from his best friend’s father, and even fired up a new glow in Henze’s South Surrey neighbourhood.

“When this COVID hit… I thought, I need a project. I needed something to do and I knew that tractor was there,” Henze said Friday, of the machine he’s seen sitting for the past decade in a shed on Bill McKeown’s Aldergrove hobby farm.

“It became the conversation piece of the neighbourhood.”

Henze grew up in Vancouver with McKeown’s son, Jim. Now 62, the pair have been close friends for more than 50 years.

McKeown bought the tractor back in the 80s, when he used to have some cattle on his 10 acres, his son recalled. At that time, it was already 30 years old.

Henze said he has long-admired the machine, and that he has often told McKeown during visits to the farm that if the senior ever wanted to part with it, he’d be happy to take it off his hands.

But while the 92-year-old wasn’t quite ready to bid it goodbye, he was thrilled by Henze’s offer to get it back up and running.

And so the project began.

Henze said after bringing the tractor home in April, he worked daily for close to two months to bring it back to life, bright red colour and all. His routine included coffee, music – and increasing curiosity from neighbours and passersby as he tinkered away for hours in the driveway.

Just about everybody that walked by or stopped to check in on the progress had a story to tell involving the same kind of tractor, he noted. Whether it was about an uncle who had one just like it, or of a time they used one back on their own farm, the tales – “these great stories about farm life” – came steady, Henze said, estimating he stopped eight times a day to talk to people about the tractor.

In the process, he even met neighbours he didn’t know he had.

“I think everybody just got to know each other a little bit better,” he said, describing the increased community feel as one of the positives that has come out of the pandemic. “It really brought out, in many ways, the best of people.

“Just working on (the tractor), meeting the people as they walked around, it was a feeling of comfort,” Henze added.

Fortunately, the restoration came together without a hitch, despite a seized motor, clutch and brakes. The only unexpected “challenge” was having to remove a pair of mouse nests.

Henze got all the parts he needed from a supplier in Ontario, and when he finished the tractor itself, carried on to restore a plow and other implements.

The day McKeown was able to take it for a ride was one for the memory books, the senior’s son said, lauding his friend’s “big heart.”

“He likes to see smiles on people’s faces,” Jim McKeown said.

“The joy he brought to my dad’s face was worth $1 million.”

“It brought tears to our eyes to see the joy that this project brought to a man that Ron has known for more than 50 years!” Henze’s wife, Brenda, added.

Henze said learning a little about the Farmall Cub’s history was another bonus of taking on the restoration and repair. He discovered groups and clubs of people fascinated by the International Harvester-produced equipment, or who have done their own restorations, all over North America, and even submitted a photo of his efforts to a contest being run by the Ontario parts supplier, in the hopes the image wins a place in the company’s upcoming calendar.

With the tractor now back at the farm, the father and son put it to use as recently as Thursday (July 2), using it to pull out a few trees.

As for Henze, it didn’t take long to find his next project – a 1960s Wankel motor that belonged to an uncle who recently passed away.

“It’s a challenge,” Henze said. “I’ve no idea what I’ll do with it if I get it running.”

“Welcome home.”

These are the first words anyone who attends a Rainbow Family of Living Light annual gathering will hear. It is both a greeting, and an affirmation that you found the right place and made it safely.

At a rest area near a remote north Vancouver Island river, colourful ribbons tied to branches of trees mark the way to the encampment, until you see several vehicles (some registered from out-of-province) parked alongside the trail.

Dread-locked hair, colourful attires, and smiling faces greet you along with the ‘welcome home’ chant at the entrance. Nobody asks who you are, or where you are coming from. Everyone here has come to escape ‘Babylon’ — a Rainbow term to describe the evils of modern life, such as technology and capitalism.

Members of the Rainbow Family of Living Light movement say they want to propagate a general ideology of acceptance and non-judgment. A deep sense of community and respect for individuals is fostered on these shared values.

“You can be comfortable being whoever you are and believing in whatever you want to,” said a man at the gathering who called himself Coco.

Another attendee, a young woman from Montreal, had flown in on Friday to be a part of the ‘celebration,’ her third. Several others are also returning attendees, some of whom have travelled around the globe to attend ‘world-gatherings’ of Rainbow Family. The gatherings are free and open to anyone as long as they have a “belly button,” said another attendee.

Rainbow Family — which originated in the U.S. sometime in the 1960s as a nondenominational, non-political counterculture group — has held annual gatherings all over the world since 1972. These gatherings attract a loosely-knit community of hippies, bohemians, nudists and itinerants, among others.

Based on Utopian ideals, Rainbow Family has no structure, no leadership, nor any spokesperson. Everything anyone says is expressed as ‘personal opinions’ and no one can tell anyone what to do.

Their gatherings usually takes place in July based on the lunar cycle, from full moon to new moon. There’s no end-date; people stay and leave at will. This year’s Vancouver Island edition has been in progress for more than two weeks.

It is taking place inside a remote forest area near Eve River in the vast, sparsely inhabited stretch of the Island between Campbell River and Port McNeill, where cellphone service ends and GPS coordinates are of no use.

A gas station employee at the Sayward junction is the best bet to ask for directions.

“I wish they wore shoes,” she says before pointing towards the direction in which she saw “many vans” heading over the past few weeks.

On Monday afternoon, at the gathering spot, colourful camping tents were spread across along the banks of a semi-dried-up pebbled river. Maybe two dozen people are visible. Children and pet dogs are playing by the stream of water outside their tents. A nude man practices yoga.

There’s a communal kitchen, featuring groceries that attendees packed in from farms or food banks. A sanitation spot with signage and a spray bottle has also been set up near a tree near the entrance.

“We’re practicing handwashing for COVID-19,” said Coco.

A small group of people have gathered around a fire pit where coffee is brewing. Full moon celebrations the previous evening went on from dusk until dawn. Musicians strum guitars softly and hum soft tunes as the smell of coffee and marijuana floats around. Everyone seems to be very relaxed or slowly waking up to the day.

The ‘sacred fire’ which was lit last week was still crackling in the afternoon. According to Coco, it will be kept “alive” throughout the duration of the gathering.

There are also ‘healing sessions’ that take place around the sacred fire before the evening gives way to music, dance and celebrations. A stick is passed from person to person around the circle and they are given the chance to speak and be heard. Some talk about their life journeys while others talk about traumatic, tough experiences. People also exchange and teach skills that they know to those who wish to learn.

Some were already packing to leave. A young woman from Vancouver who attended the gathering for the first time with her brother, said she will be back next year for the gathering as she found the experience of cutting away from technology and spending time in nature “personally uplifting.”

This year, the number of people who turned up was far less compared to previous gatherings, mostly because of the pandemic. While no one was wearing masks, people seemed to be cognizant of personal space.

A lot of people within the group have fluid beliefs when it comes to coronavirus. Some spoke about “preventive lifestyle” and the body’s capacity to self-heal and fight off any virus. Some dismissed the virus altogether as a conspiracy theory. None seemed to be overly perturbed by COVID-19.

Most learned about the gathering through informal Facebook announcements toward the end of June. Although there is no “leadership” for the Rainbow Family, a volunteer-based organizing council or “Seed Camp,” heads out to “scout” for a gathering place. The scout team also takes into account the ‘geopolitical’ nuances of the place, said Coco.

Over the years, the Rainbow gatherings have garnered controversy and an unfavourable reputation after incidences of violent behavior, drug abuse, murder and environmental littering in the U.S. was highlighted in the media.

In 2014, a news report by VICE highlighted the “dark side” of these gatherings, following a series of misadventures that took place at a gathering in Utah. A woman was arrested for stabbing a man and law enforcement also had to respond to drug overdose and people crashing a nearby wedding. The report also highlighted the group’s frequent clashes with forest authorities in U.S., saying “arrests and police run-ins have always been a hallmark of these gatherings.”

In 2013, Vancouver Island’s remote Raft Cove Provincial Park was shut down after authorities and locals found out that more than 2,000 people were looking to attend a planned Rainbow Family world gathering there.

Concerns of campfire bans, waste management and the fact that authorities had not been notified about the gathering were some reasons cited.

Rainbow Family members in this year’s Island gathering were quick to point out that a lot of people who attend are environmentally conscious. At the end of the gathering, groups of people volunteer to clean up, said one of the attendees. But without a structural hierarchy or ‘people-in-charge,’ it is difficult to say if the clean-up plan has been successfully implemented until after everyone has left the place.

Local authorities are aware of the Rainbow Family gathering. Constable Francios Veillette from the Sayward RCMP detachment, said that they are “monitoring the area” and there seems to be “no issues so far.”

People who have been attending the gathering for the past three or four years in B.C., have hardly noticed any problematic run-in with authorities.

“We’re peaceful people, we don’t incite violence or suport it and we respect everyone who comes to the gathering,” said an attendee.

For him, every year, coming to the gathering has been a pleasant experience almost like “coming home,” to familiar faces and new ones. His sense of belonging has never changed.

“Everyone is family here,” he said.

By Val Patenaude/Special to The News

The Dewdney Trunk Road – its name and origins – have come up a lot recently, so it seems a good time to revisit the story.

A “Trunk Road” refers to a major route across a large territory that provides access to the parts of that territory in a way that no other route accomplishes.

In modern times, we refer to such routes as “highways” or use other modern terms.

If you think of a trunk road as a trunk of a tree, the idea was that other roads would branch from or cross that main route and continue to expand access to hinterlands.

Maple Ridge council started advocating for a trunk road by 1884.

RECENT LOOKING BACK COLUMN: History never stops – inviting stories from the pandemic

The council of the day unanimously decided that it would be of material advantage to have a trunk road leading through the municipality from a point near Port Hammond station to Stave River.

The clerk was instructed to apply to the government for the necessary funds for the construction of the road and have it located by a competent engineer. [Source: Columbian 1884.04.09]

Extending such a road to Stave River would include all the surveyed townships of Maple Ridge District with the prize at the end being the already planned dam on the Stave.

Access would first be provided to land surveyors and they would be followed by settlers.

In 1884, the whole of Township 12 – which included the vast mid-section of Maple Ridge – remained unsurveyed except along the Fraser River.

The other big selling point was access to the Stave Falls and the planned damming of that gap.

The dam was planned many years before it could be built because of the access challenges. When the dam was completed in 1914, the lines that carried the power to the Lower Mainland were supported by a string of metal towers on the north side of Dewdney Trunk.

In the 1890s, the only passage across this territory was a path along which ox-drawn sledges could be dragged. When James Murray Webster opened up the Webster’s Corners area, all of his family’s belongings and construction materials were dragged in by sledge.

RECENT COLUMN: Roaring in the 1920s

Through the next few years, nothing happened but piece work along the desired route.

The municipality needed the provincial government to provide funding, especially for the bridges – which were always the most expensive parts.

In 1895, a group of anxious landowners petitioned the local government to take out a loan of $50,000 to build the road, but it was not possible as in those days, councils were elected annually and one council could not commit the next council to ongoing debts.

A huge obstacle on the expense side in 1898 was bridging Hick’s Gulf, which was the local name for where Kanaka Creek intersects the trunk road.

By that summer, the provincial government came through and work on that challenging section began.

By 1900, the gravel road from Pitt Meadows to the small town of Dewdney was complete.

The latter was the origin of the name “Dewdney Trunk Road.”

Both the town of Dewdney and the Dewdney Trail were named after Edgar Dewdney. He was an early surveyor who surveyed the Dewdney Trail and later the townsite of New Westminster.

The town of Dewdney was named for him when he became Lieutenant-Governor of BC in 1892. The Dewdney Trunk Road had nothing to do with the Dewdney Trail.

The route west of Pitt Meadows was a bit longer in coming as the Pitt River was far more formidable to bridge than Kanaka and it would be 1915 before that section opened.

Browning and the RCMP have engaged in conduct that is reprehensible and deserves punishment’

A second woman has filed a civil lawsuit against Kelowna Mountie Lacey Browning, accusing the constable of assaulting her while on duty.

The suit filed in BC Supreme Court by Fiona Read on Wednesday, July 15, comes less than a month after security camera footage was released showing Const. Browning dragging UBC Okanagan student Mona Wang down a hallway at her residence and stepping on her head. Wang is suing the RCMP officer, the Attorney General of Canada, the Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor following the incident.

Read’s allegations date back to the early morning hours of New Year’s Day 2016, following a party at her friend’s neighbour’s house.

Read was initially meant to spend the night at her friend’s house but she says she became uncomfortable at the party and began walking back to her friend’s house to gather her things. She had planned to head back to her own house. She claims her friends attempted to stop her from leaving but was eventually allowed to leave.

Leaving her car at her friend’s house, Read began walking home. She came upon an RCMP vehicle and, according to the suit, felt she was “in need of protection” and approached the cruiser to seek help from the officer, who was later identified to be Const. Browning.

Browning asked Read to confirm her first name was Fiona, the suit claims, and upon doing so, “Browning grabbed the plaintiff, flipped her around, grabbed her by her hair and pounded her head into the ground multiple times causing damage to the plaintiff’s face.”

“The plaintiff lost count of how many times her face was slammed into concrete,” reads the suit.

Read claims Browning then cuffed her and pulled her from the ground by her arms which were behind her back. Read was arrested and brought to the RCMP detachment, where she claims she was held for six hours and Browning never asked her a question besides her name.

Read was fingerprinted and eventually told she was being charged with assault and resisting arrest, though she was never read her rights and the Crown never approved the charges, the claim states.

“Browning charged the plaintiff in order to cover up her assault on the plaintiff,” the suit reads.

Despite arriving at the detachment in “extreme pain and discomfort,” Read claims she was not allowed to be treated by paramedics.

After her discharge, Read went to see a doctor, where her injuries were documented, including her bruised and swollen face, missing chunks of hair and injured right knee.

“As a result of the brutal assault by Browning, the plaintiff had to permanently quit running and skiing due to the severity of the injury to her knee,” the suit states.

“The actions of Browning and the RCMP were reckless, arrogant, high-handed, abusive, and showed a callous disregard to the plaintiff’s rights. Browning and the RCMP have engaged in conduct that is reprehensible and deserves punishment.”

The following day, Read claims she attempted to file a complaint against Browning to her supervisor but they refused to accept it.

“The actions of the supervisor are evidence of the RCMP being complicit in covering up Browning’s assault of the plaintiff,” reads the suit.

The plaintiff only became aware that she had a right to complain and take legal action against Browning’s actions following media reports about recent allegations against Browning and the RCMP’s statements that ‘they take complaints seriously.’”

None of Read’s claims have been proven in court and Browning has not filed a response.

The RCMP has not yet been formally served with the lawsuit but the claims will be reviewed and addressed by the Department of Justice through the normal civil processes, said Staff-Sgt. Janelle Shoihet.

“The allegations are also being reviewed to determine if there are any other actions that need to be taken,” she added.

Browning was placed on administrative leave after criminal and internal investigations were launched related to her actions against Wang.

Shoihet said the criminal investigation into the previous allegations has been completed and is now subject to an external review by the Abbotsford Police Department. Once they have completed their review, and if there are no other investigative requirements, the materials will then be sent to the BC Prosecution Service for charge assessment.

An online petition calling for Browning to be fired and criminally charged has reached nearly 375,000 signatures.

B.C. has reached a grim milestone, seeing record numbers of illicit drug overdoses for a second straight month.

In June, nearly 12 people died of a fatal overdose every two days across the province for a total of 175 lives lost.

In the first six months of 2020, B.C. has seen 728 deaths due to the toxic street drug supply. That’s compared to 543 during the same time period last year.

A majority of the deaths, or 70 per cent, are people aged 19 to 49 years old.

Broken down by health authority, there have been 488 overdoses in Vancouver Coastal, 556 in Fraser Health, 254 in Interior Health, 296 on Vancouver Island and 115 in the Northern Health region.

Vancouver, Surrey and Victoria continue to see the lions share of overdose deaths.

The concerning death toll comes as the province continues to grapple with two ongoing health crisis: the COVID-19 pandemic and the overdose crisis.

In a statement, chief coroner Lisa Lapointe said that the novel coronavirus has limited access to harm reduction services and called on doctors to follow the province’s guidance on prescribing legal opioids to drug users to support those at risk of overdose on the toxic drug supply.

“For those using substances – opioids or otherwise – please make sure you use only in the presence of someone who will call for immediate help if you need it, use at an overdose prevention or supervised consumption site, and have your drugs checked before using, if you can,” Lapointe said.

“The drug supply in our province is highly toxic and the risk of using alone is too high. Buddying up could save your life.”

Following the 170 deaths in May, provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said the pandemic has worsened the toxicity of the street-level drug supply, exacerbated by social contact restrictions forcing many to use drugs alone.

In an emotional address, the top doctor urged family and friends to reach out to drug users in their lives.

“Check up on your friends. Check up on those people, those workmates that you have that you may not be seeing as often. This is another time while we need to, while physically apart, connect with each other and support each other.”

More to come.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says the federal, provincial and territorial governments have reached a deal on billions of dollars in transfers to continue reopening economies amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

He says the federal government will contribute $19 billion to the effort.

The money is to help the lower-tier governments with needs such as funding child care, bailing out cities whose expenses have soared and revenues plunged, increasing contact-tracing capacity, and buying personal protective equipment.

The pandemic is a health crisis, but Trudeau says it has a deep economic dimension.

He says workers can’t work if their children don’t have safe care, and many can’t get to their jobs if they don’t have access to safe transit systems.

That means funding needed services better so they don’t have to rely on crowding many people into small spaces for their finances to make sense.

Signs for the Washington Redskins are displayed outside FedEx Field in Landover, Md., Monday, July 13, 2020.

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh)

The Washington NFL franchise announced Monday it is dropping the “Redskins” name and Indian head logo, bowing to recent pressure from sponsors and decades of criticism that they are offensive to Native Americans.

A new name must still be selected for one of the oldest and most storied teams in the National Football League, and it was unclear how soon that will happen. But for now, arguably the most polarizing name in North American professional sports is gone at a time of reckoning over racial injustice, iconography and racism in the U.S.

The move came less than two weeks after owner Dan Snyder, a boyhood fan of the team who once declared he would never get rid of the name, launched a “thorough review” amid pressure from sponsors. FedEx, Nike, Pepsi and Bank of America all lined up against the name, which was given to the franchise in 1933 when the team was still based in Boston.

The team said it is “retiring” the name and logo and that Snyder and coach Ron Rivera are working closely to develop a new moniker and design. The announcement came on the old letterhead with the Redskins name because the team technically retains it until a new one is chosen and approved.

Native American advocates and experts have long criticized the name they call a “dictionary-defined racial slur.” Over a dozen Native leaders and organizations wrote to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell last week demanding an immediate end to Washington’s use of the name. Goodell, who has fielded questions on the topic for years, said he supported the review.

Protests against the name predate Snyder buying the team in 1999, and, until now, he had shown no willingness to consider a change. Strong words from sponsors — including a company run by a minority stakeholder of the team — changed the equation.

FedEx earlier this month became the first sponsor to announce it had asked the organization to change the name, particularly important because CEO Frederick Smith owns part of the team. FedEx paid $205 million for the long-term naming rights to the team’s stadium in Landover, Maryland.

The lease at FedEx Field expires in 2027, and dropping the name keeps open various possibilities in Maryland, Virginia and Washington for the team’s new stadium and headquarters. District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser has said the name was an “obstacle” to Snyder building on the old RFK Stadium site, which is believed to be his preference.

The team recently started cutting ties with racist founder George Preston Marshall, removing his name from the Ring of Fame and renaming the lower bowl at FedEx Field for the team’s first Black player, late Hall of Famer Bobby Mitchell. Marshall, who renamed the Boston Braves the Redskins in 1933 and moved the team to D.C. four years later, was a segregationist and the last NFL owner to integrate his team. The current logo shows the profile of a red-faced Native American with feathers in his hair.

Major League Baseball’s Atlanta Braves and the National Hockey League’s Chicago Blackhawks have said they have no inclination to change their names. Some advocates would like to see all Native American names, mascots and imagery out of sports.

Long removed from the glory days of winning Super Bowl titles in the 1982, 1987 and 1991 seasons under coach Joe Gibbs, Washington’s NFL team has just five playoff appearances in 21 years and no postseason victories since 2005. The team has lacked a nationally marketable player since Robert Griffin III’s short-lived stardom, and the 2020 schedule features zero prime-time games for a franchise that used to be a draw.

Re-branding with a new name and logo — and perhaps the same burgundy and gold colours — coupled with turning football operations over to Rivera could be a boon for Snyder on and off the field. Even if a segment of the fan base opposes the change in the name of tradition, winning would more than make up for those losses.

Given the gravity of the new coronavirus pandemic and the abrupt decision to place the NHL season on pause in March, it didn’t take commissioner Gary Bettman and union chief Don Fehr long to realize they were going to have to work together if play was to resume any time soon.

Nearly four months to the day since the last puck dropped, the two sides put aside past differences to have a return-to-play plan in place, and the assurance of labour peace through September 2026 to go with it.

“When we got to March 12 and decided to take the pause, that began a period of perhaps unprecedented collaboration and problem solving,” Bettman said during a Zoom conference call with reporters Saturday, a day after the league and players ratified a 24-team expanded playoff, set to begin Aug. 1, and a four-year extension of the collective bargaining agreement.

“It was a recognition by both sides that we were being confronted with an incredibly difficult, a novel, unprecedented situation. I believed we would get to this point because it was the right thing to do for the game and for everybody involved in the game.”

Fehr, the NHL Players’ Association executive director, not only agreed with Bettman, but went out of his way to credit the owners for the approach.

“I was persuaded well before the end of March that not only was this different, but it was being approached in a fundamentally different way. I always thought we would find a way to reach an agreement,” Fehr said.

The bond established between the two was apparent during the 55-minute session, with Fehr agreeing with Bettman and then acknowledging how unusual that was by by saying: “I think that indicates something about the approach that was taken in these talks.”

Training camps are set to open Monday, which also represents the deadline for players to determine whether to opt out without penalty. If all goes as planned, teams will depart for their two respective hub cities, Toronto and Edmonton, Alberta, on July 26 to open a two-month playoff leading to the awarding of the Stanley Cup.

Many uncertainties remain, with Bettman and Fehr unable to provide definitive answers.

While acknowledging the likelihood of players testing positive for COVID-19, deputy commissioner Bill Daly was unable to say how many players would have to do so for the league to postpone or cancel the playoffs altogether.

Though conference playoffs and Stanley Cup Final are scheduled to be held in Edmonton, a person with direct knowledge of the plans told The Associated Press the site might change if the pandemic spikes in Alberta’s capital. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because it is an alternate plan that’s not been discussed publicly.

Bettman and Daly, who are based in New York, weren’t even sure if or when they could cross the border to personally attend games because those entering Canada are required to self-isolate for a 14-day period.

The only certainty is the NHL became North America’s latest professional sport to forge a path back to playing, but minus the public hiccups experienced by its counterparts.

Major League Baseball’s season was nearly scuttled before the two sides agreed to a 60-game format. Less than three weeks before NFL training camps are set to open, the league is experiencing push-back from its players on whether to play preseason games next month. Major League Soccer has had two teams already withdrawing from competition because of the number of players testing positive for the coronavirus.

And not only is hockey on the verge of returning, the CBA extension assures 12 straight years of labour peace, the NHL’s longest stretch since Bettman took over in 1993. During that time, play has been halted three times by lockouts, the last in 2012-13, when the season was shortened to 48 games.

“I think Don and I both recognize labour peace was something we couldn’t even quantify how important it was,” Bettman said. “But we both knew that for the business of the game to come back strong, there was enough disruption going on in the world that we didn’t have to add to it.”

Fehr said the months-long talks to reach a solution were a matter of perseverance.

“This is a very bad analogy, but you have to sort of navigate the kayak in a storm until the storm’s over, and then make sure the kayak isn’t full of holes so that you can go on and sail it in calmer seas,” Fehr said in a separate interview with The AP. “Or to put it another way there was never any pretense that this was business as usual.”

Owners benefit because they can generate much-needed revenue through sponsorships and advertising, even though games will be played in empty arenas.

Though players will likely lose a portion of their salaries for seasons to come to make up for 50-50 split of revenue, they benefit from a CBA that includes the possibility of returning to the Olympics, after the NHL opted out from the 2018 Winter Games in South Korea. The new labour agreement also addressed players’ demands to gain a post-career subsidy for health care.

The CFL has sent Canadian Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault a revised financial request.

A CFL source said Friday the league is seeking roughly $42.5 million in aid. In April, it asked the federal government for up to $150 million in financial assistance in the event of a cancelled 2020 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

At the time, CFL commissioner Randy Ambrosie said the league was anxious “to be accountable to taxpayers,’ and would attempt to repay a portion of government assistance through ”community programs, tourism promotion, the Grey Cup, our digital channels.”

The source added the new request is to cover operating costs and player salaries for a shortened 2020 season. The proposal also includes a letter of support from the CFL Players’ Association.

The source spoke on the condition of anonymity because neither the government nor CFL have confirmed the request.

Last month, the CFL and CFLPA began talks to amend the current collective bargaining agreement to allow for an abbreviated season. The two sides must sign off on any changes for any games to be played.

But prior to the start of negotiations, the CFL presented the union with a memo outlining the conditions it wanted and a completion deadline of July 23.

When asked about the revised financial request, the CFL said, “We continue discussions with the federal government including discussions on our possible return to play.”

While the revision is for substantially less money, the CFL’s situation hasn’t changed much. It still requires financial assistance with revenues having dropped drastically due to the COVID-19 pandemic and expenses expected to continue to rise if it tries to play a season with no fans

The CFL’s initial request of Ottawa consisted of three tiers: It called for $30 million immediately to manage the impact the outbreak has had on league business; additional assistance for an abbreviated regular season; and up to another $120 million in the event of a lost 2020 campaign.

When Ambrosie spoke to a federal standing committee on finance in May, he was roundly criticized for failing to stipulate where the funds would go and not involving the CFLPA in the process. But the source said the revised proposal mirrors an authentic financial offer and contains more specific details than the original one did.

The earliest an abbreviated ‘20 season will begin is September, but Ambrosie has stated a cancelled campaign also remains possible.

If the CFL holds a shortened season, it’s expected to do so in a hub city. Winnipeg has been mentioned as a strong hub candidate, but the source said Regina also is under consideration.

Curling Canada has been forced to re-think qualification for the Olympic team and mixed doubles trials after cancellations and postponements due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Teams and mixed doubles duos ultimately must win events or collect enough points at events to earn berths in the 2021 Tim Hortons Roar of the Rings and the national mixed doubles trials in early 2022.

The Roar of the Rings men’s and women’s champions and the victorious mixed doubles duo will represent Canada at the 2022 Olympic Games in Beijing.

The trimming of the Grand Slam of Curling from six events to two next season impacts teams’ opportunities to earn Olympic qualification points.

So Curling Canada declared the qualifying process on “hold” on Friday.

“The safety of our athletes is our prime consideration and we don’t want to put them under any kind of duress to be trying to participate in events to pursue qualifying points until we know they can do so safely,” Curling Canada high-performance director Gerry Peckham said in a statement.

“Until that time comes, we will look closely at the qualifying process and consult with our athletes to fine-tune the system to make sure it identifies Canada’s most deserving nine men’s and women’s four-player teams and 16 mixed doubles teams.”

Teams and duos with trials berths already in hand will keep them.

Teams skipped by John Epping, Brad Gushue, Rachel Homan and Kerri Einarson have qualified for the Roar of the Rings in Saskatoon from Nov. 27 to Dec. 5, 2021.

The pairings of Jennifer Jones and Brent Laing, and Jocelyn Peterman and Brett Gallant own berths in the mixed doubles trials Jan. 3-6, 2022, in a city yet to be named.

A plan to operate NHL game hubs in Edmonton and Toronto could draw hundreds of hockey players and staff to both Canadian cities, but business experts say their presence won’t give a huge boost to local economies.

While hundreds of people could be employed in positions relating to the games and hubs — such as security jobs, rink staff, food services and hotel housekeeping — the financial benefit of two bubble communities under tight seal would be “modest” at best, suggested Bank of Montreal chief economist Douglas Porter.

“When you think of how many tourists would normally be in Toronto during peak tourist season, I’m quite sure this is less than one per cent,” he said.

“The reality is, it’s not going to move the needle.”

But Porter, a lifelong hockey fan, said he anticipates a “reasonably meaningful positive” morale boost to Canadian sports fans who’ve been eagerly anticipating players returning to the ice in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The games are slated to start Aug. 1 with six Canadian teams qualifying for the 24-team resumption of play. No fans will be in the seats.

Edmonton and Toronto were confirmed as the NHL’s hub cities on Friday night.

“The fact that part of our world is getting back to some kind of normal will help reinforce the sense that things, generally, are moving in that direction and could help support the recovery,” Porter said.

The gradual comeback of major sporting events has drawn plenty of interest in recent weeks, with debates raging over the risks of putting players back into the games, even if spectators aren’t allowed in the facilities.

Further questions have been raised over whether rigorous testing is enough to prevent outbreaks within the isolated community, which could potentially throw the whole plan into a costly disarray.

Many of these factors make placing a value on hockey’s return especially difficult.

Michael Naraine, a professor at Brock University in St. Catharines, Ont., said the largest amount of money is on the line at large corporations, which he said is driving the return of major sporting events.

“The primary revenue driver for sports is broadcasting,” said the assistant professor of digital sport management and marketing.

“They need television advertisers come back. The league itself needs to gain its revenue from NBC and Sportsnet here in Canada.”

Politicians have preferred to emphasize the positive aspects of a deal with the NHL.

Alberta Premier Jason Kenney eagerly promoted Edmonton as the ultimate hub city for the hockey league, posting videos on Twitter that prominently featured the Rocky Mountains and other popular destinations in the province.

Naraine said those public expressions by leaders are more an attempt to “pander” to their constituents than actually drive any meaningful economic impact. He said this is especially the case in Edmonton.

“Having major events come to town allows them to beat their chests and say, ‘We exist. We’re on the map. Come look at us,’” he said.

“But the fact that the hub city will be in Edmonton is no different than whether the hub city would be in Toronto or Vancouver or elsewhere. It’s not going to significantly drive tourism all of a sudden.”

Patrick Rishe, a sports professor at Washington University in St. Louis, said he sees value in showcasing a lesser known Canadian city on broadcast television with “beauty shots” of the locale. He said it may also sit well with NHL executives.

“You never know,” he said. “Doing and serving a good deed for the league now, this could pay dividends down the road.”

Any semblance of a regular hockey season would be welcomed by Dana Parris, owner of the Lockeroom sports bar in Barrie, Ont.

Even though her business is over 100 kilometres away from downtown Toronto, she anticipates the excitement would reverberate to her customers.

“If we could have sports come back and we hit Stage 3 (of Ontario’s COVID reopening plan) around the same time, I will probably stop crying myself to sleep,” she said.

“If those two come together it’s just going to be the most beautiful thing.”

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File)

The NHL’s plan appears robust and detailed.

Once players enter so-called “bubbles” in two hub cities later this month as part of the league’s blueprint to resuscitate its pandemic-halted season, teams should — at least in theory — be fairly well-protected from the threat of COVID-19.

A 28-page document released earlier this week outlines a grocery list of health and safety measures where no stones seem left unturned, including mandatory daily testing and the wearing of masks whenever possible, all the way down to banning high-fives and advising against talking in elevators.

Getting to the bubbles largely unscathed by the coronavirus, however, could be the biggest challenge of all.

There will be strict rules once the 24 clubs set to compete in the league’s return-to-play plan head to the hubs and are quarantined from the general public — Toronto and Edmonton are the expected destinations — but players will be free to come and go as they please during training camps slated to begin early next week.

And while the league touched on the need to be prudent with regards to physical distancing outside team activities during camps in a separate document, it’s potentially a soft underbelly players, coaches and executives know could pose a risk.

“The rink is the safe spot, it’s clean,” Calgary Flames general manager Brad Treliving said. ”You’ve got the protocol that really is enforceable.

“The recommendation and the messaging to the players is going to be, ‘You’ve got to keep that (personal circle) as tight as you can.’”

The NHL plans to test players every 48 hours during camps, and Penguins head coach Mike Sullivan said there have already been conversations amongst his group about the possible pitfalls of the next 2 1/2 weeks as the league looks to kickstart a campaign that was suspended in March as the coronavirus swept across North America.

“Exercise common sense,” Sullivan said. ”It’s to everyone’s benefit, whether it be our players or the public in general.”

Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease specialist at Toronto General Hospital, said that message will be crucial for the league during this upcoming period of vulnerability.

“You’re not in a bubble, and players, just like everyone else in the world, are susceptible to this infection,” he said. “People have to be very careful to avoid going out and mingling with others in the world around them.”

While the virus is relatively under control in Canada, the explosion of cases south of the border, including hot spots like Florida, Texas and Arizona, represent a red flag. Of the 24 franchises tabbed for the restart, 18 are located in the United States and won’t head north until the end of the month.

“I’m not going to put words in anyone’s mouth,” Bogoch added. ”But you can be sure teams will be reading the riot act to their players on the importance of ensuring they stay safe and healthy.”

Canucks defenceman Quinn Hughes has been holed up in a Vancouver hotel since arriving back in Canada from the U.S. in late June as part of the cohort quarantine plan approved by health officials. He’s able to skate with a few teammates, but has otherwise mostly been confined to his room and is looking forward to a level of freedom.

“At a certain point we’re going to have to live our lives and we’re going to have to go to the restaurants and do these things,” he said. ”But I think you can be calculated and smart staying away from people and doing the best you can wearing a mask and washing your hands.”

And although British Columbia has been commended for its response and control of the virus, risks remain just like anywhere else.

“It’s on the players,” Hughes added. ”The players have to be responsible.”

Montreal Canadiens head coach Claude Julien, who’s 60 years old and in a high-risk age group for COVID-19, said his team will do whatever it can to assist players during camp, including getting groceries delivered.

“They’re taking this very seriously,” he said. ”They know the danger of it for them, for their teammates, for their families.

“We all have to do our jobs as far as being diligent.”

Of the 396 NHLers tested at team facilities between June 8 and Monday during small, voluntary workouts as part of Phase 2 protocols, 23 results — in the neighbourhood of six per cent — came back positive. The league said it’s also aware of 12 other positive tests for players not taking part in Phase 2.

Phase 3, which represents the start of camps, will see roughly 750 players report to team facilities next week, as long as the NHL’s return-to-play protocol and extension to the collective bargaining agreement are approved in the coming days.

That means nearly half of players set to compete had yet to be tested by the league as of earlier this week.

An outbreak within a team or teams could wreak havoc on the league’s return-to-play plans. Major League Soccer, which started its summer tournament this week, has seen both FC Dallas and Nashville SC pull out due to 20 combined cases of COVID-19.

Bogoch, who commended the NHL for its attention to detail inside what should be tightly-controlled bubbles, said even if every precaution is taken during camps, there’s a chance the virus will find a way through.

“You’re relying on people’s good judgment,” he said. “That might work out the vast majority of time, but it might not work out 100 per cent of the time.

“One case can certainly beget more cases.”

Exactly what the NHL is hoping to avoid.

The Fraser Valley Bandits have filled out the team’s coaching staff for the 2020 Canadian Elite Basketball League season.

Joining new head coach and general manager Kyle Julius will be Rob Damiani as assistant general manager, David Singleton as assistant coach, K.J. Smith as an advance scout, as well as Julius’ father, Stu, who will serve as a senior advisor.

The news also means 2019 Bandits assistant coaches Virgil Hill and Kyle Graves will not be returning.

Julius was hired as Bandits head coach and general manager back in December.

Damiani brings more than five years of basketball operations experience from the NBLC. He first worked under Julius with the Mississauga Power in 2014-15 and then joined the Kitchener-Waterloo (KW) Titans as the club’s assistant general manager in 2016-17. Damiani spent three total seasons with the Titans before joining the Formosa Dreamers as an advance scout in the fall of 2019 to support Julius’ basketball operations staff in the ASEAN Basketball League (ABL).

Singleton has coached professionally in New Zealand, Vietnam and Indonesia. In particular, Singleton served as the Head Coach and General Manager of the Cantho Catfish in the Vietnam Basketball Association (VBA) during the 2016 campaign. Singleton then joined the Saigon Heat as the lead assistant coach on Julius’ staff in the ABL for two seasons from 2017-2019. Specializing in video coordination and player development, Singleton became the Heat’s head coach for its 2019 campaign and led the team to its first VBA championship with recently signed Bandit Tavarion Nix at the Heat’s helm.

Smith is currently an assistant coach for Basquete Unifacisa in Novo Basquete Brasil, the first division league of Brazil’s Liga Nacional de Basquete. The 2018-19 season was Smith’s first year with the club and he helped the team win its first Liga Ouro (second division) championship thanks to a top four offensive and defensive ranking. Following the championship, the team was promoted to the first division where they were preparing for the playoffs prior to the outbreak of COVID-19 and the cancellation of the season.

He is the eighth basketball coach in a family that has dedicated itself to the game for generations. The members of his family’s coaching lineage extend from the high school level to the WNBA. Smith’s grandfather, Fred Smith, was drafted in 1968 to the Milwaukee Bucks. Smith specializes in both player development and scouting. He got his start coaching Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) basketball with the North Bay Basketball Academy (California) and the Erik Spoelstra Basketball Academy. He has also worked as a scout for PrepHoops Northern California, evaluating youth basketball talent with prospective collegiate potential.

Stu Julius will serve as a senior advisor on his son Kyle’s staff. Stu has a decorated basketball lineage that spans various levels of Canadian professional basketball. Stu joined the Lakehead Thunderwolves program in 1981 and served as head coach of the women’s basketball team for 18 years. He was named coach of the year twice during his tenure as head coach at Lakehead.

Lakehead missed the playoffs just once under Julius’ watch as he amassed an impressive coaching record of 311- 250 with the Thunderwolves.

He led the Thunderwolves to nationals twice and took the mantle as athletic director in 1991. Over the course of eight years as athletic director, the Thunderwolves hosted nationals four times between 1995 and 1997-1999. Julius was inducted onto the Lakehead athletics department’s wall of fame in 2013.

Following his time at Lakehead, Julius joined Wilfrid Laurier University’s women’s basketball program in 1999 as the team’s head coach. He led the Golden Hawks for nine seasons. Under Julius’ guidance, the Golden Hawks won a provincial silver medal and advanced to the Canadian Interuniversity Sport (CIS, now known as U Sports) championships in 2002-03 and 2003-04. For his efforts, Julius was named Ontario University Athletics (OUA) West Division Coach of the Year in 2002-03.

Since moving on from Canadian university sport, Julius has worked in the NBLC, both as an assistant coach with the Mississauga Power during the 2014-15 season, as general manager of the KW Titans in 2016-17, and as a performance consultant for the St. John’s Edge in 2018-19.

The CEBL team with the worst record will then be eliminated and and a six-team playoff will begin. The top two teams will receive byes, with the third ranked team taking on sixth and four and five squaring off. The CEBL championship game is set for Aug. 9.

Games will not be played in front of fans and teams will be separated from the general public with screening and COVID-19 protocols under the supervision of medical officials in place. Health and safety measures will be maintained for the participants, including social distancing and other specialized practices designed to limit interactions amongst participants.

A handful of games will be broadcast on CBC television, with the Bandits lone TV appearance occurring on Aug. 1 against Hamilton. All other games can be viewed on the CBC Gem streaming service.

“We are excited to bring live sports back to audiences in local communities across the country, who are just as hungry for the return to play as we are,” stated Chris Wilson, Executive Director, Sports & Olympics, CBC. “Our partners at the CEBL have come up with a plan that not only adheres to health and safety restrictions, but takes the competition to the next level.

Gary Longhi, a four-time Paralympian and Canada’s flag-bearer for the opening ceremonies of the 2000 Sydney Paralympics, has died at the age of 56.

The Canadian Paralympic Committee announced Longhi’s death Friday.

The road cyclist competed in the 1988, 1992, 1996 and 2000 Games, winning gold and bronze in ‘96 in Atlanta and silver in ‘92 in Barcelona.

The Montreal native was the first Paralympic athlete to be inducted into the Canadian Cycling Hall of Fame in 2017.

Ahead of his induction Longhi said that he cherished the camaraderie of cycling for the Canadian team.

“Sometimes in society I feel like an outsider,” he said. “On the bike I’m normal. Everything is smooth, not as harsh as usual. It’s freedom for me.”

Longhi took up elite-level cycling as part of his rehabilitation following a 1983 motorcycle crash that nearly claimed his life and left him in a coma for three months. His brain injury qualified him for Para cerebral palsy category of competition.

If it seems like it’s been harder to get a tee time this summer, it’s not just your imagination.

Golf Canada reports that there were 17 per cent more scores registered with the national sport body this June compared to the same month last year.

A total of 1,483,506 scores were submitted to Golf Canada’s handicap calculator last month compared to 1,271,782 in June 2019.

That ended a streak of three months when recreational rounds played in Canada dropped precipitously due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

As restrictions were lifted across the country in May, the number of scores registered increased.

In May, 165,026 people registered their scores between the 1st and the 15th but 265,480 submitted scores in the final two weeks of that month.

The May 1-15 numbers are a nearly 40 per cent drop from the same period in 2019 (211,809) but the May 16-30 numbers are just five per cent lower than last year (269,266).

The upward trend comes even as Golf Canada had to cancel all of its amateur and professional championships due to travel restrictions put in place to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.

A shift in how scores are registered has also been seen, with most recreational players entering their scores online instead of in the course’s clubhouse or pro shop, which have largely been closed this summer because of physical distancing protocols.

Golf Canada plans to launch an updated version of its scoring app later this month, helping to keep players physically distant and improve their game.

The NHL says 35 players have tested positive for the novel coronavirus over roughly the past month.

The league says 23 of 396 players checked for COVID-19 at team facilities have tested positive since voluntary Phase 2 workouts began June 8 — a rate of just under six per cent. In that same time period, the NHL added it is aware of 12 additional positive test results.

That’s an increase of eight players in Phase 2, and one from outside the NHL’s testing system, over the last week.

The NHL says it has administered more than 2,900 tests at team facilities.

READ MORE: NHL says 26 players have tested positive for COVID-19 since June 8

Ten additional players were confirmed to have tested positive in the spring — five from the Ottawa Senators, three from the Colorado Avalanche and one each from the Pittsburgh Penguins and Boston Bruins. That brings the total number of NHLers with confirmed positive tests to 45 since the schedule was suspended in mid-March.

The league is no longer providing details on the players or clubs with positive tests. There was no word on the health status of the 35 players in question, including whether or not they experienced symptoms or have recovered.

“All players who have tested positive have been self-isolated and are following (government) protocols,” the NHL said in a statement released on Twitter.

The league and NHL Players’ Association on Sunday night agreed on protocols to start training camps and resume the season. That includes daily testing once games get under way for players, coaches and staff.

Resuming is contingent on each side approving an extension of the collective bargaining agreement and the return-to-play protocol.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Frank Gunn

In the more than three months since the Toronto Raptors stepped off the court, the players have been scattered abroad.

Besides regular weight checks and virtual workouts, it’s been on them to stay in shape in less than ideal conditions. In these unprecedented times, many players said it’s been the longest they’ve gone without playing.

Coach Nick Nurse — who had noticed a few weeks ago how fit Marc Gasol appeared on team Zoom calls — still didn’t know what to expect when his team convened last week in Naples, Fla., to hopefully resume their quest for a second consecutive NBA championship.

“Players look fantastic, I mean absolutely,” Nurse said on a conference call Tuesday. “When you see them with the eyeball test they look great.

“I came in here open-minded. I didn’t know if we were going to be not really in the right frame of mind or whatever… But I am pleasantly surprised with the frame of mind, I am pleasantly surprised with the conditioning, and I just think you have a bunch of guys who have a high care factor.

“They love to play, they’re concerned about getting better individually, about their own careers, it just seems like they are doing a really professional job. I just think there is a strong love of the game there for a lot of these guys.”

Gasol, who missed 28 games this season with a hamstring injury, and veteran guard Kyle Lowry have looked noticeably leaner in recent photos circulating on social media.

“The chiselled Marc. Cut up. He looks great,” Nurse said of the big Spaniard.

Nurse said as highly as he already thinks of the cerebral Gasol, his improved fitness is motivating for Raptors teammates, might get him a few more rebounds a night and could give his legs more life down the stretch of games.

“If his conditioning improves him as a player it’s going to be a super added bonus for us,” Nurse said.

Raptors guard/forward Norm Powell called the physical change in Gasol ”drastic.”

“I make fun of him all the time, looking like a soccer player in Barcelona,” Powell laughed. ”He looks great, man, he’s moving great, he’s feeling great.”

Powell and Gasol have a tennis match scheduled for the next couple of days.

“Hopefully I’ll still be able to give him a run for his money,” Powell said.

Because of Canada’s requirement of a 14-day quarantine period for people entering the country, the Raptors were the first team to arrive in Florida ahead of next month’s restart at Disney World.

Despite the Raptors’ positive mindset, Powell said there was some trepidation travelling to Florida, which has seen a startling surge in COVID-19 cases. The more than 6,000 new cases reported Tuesday pushed the total over 150,000 in the Sunshine State. Deaths have climbed past 3,500.

More than 8,500 new cases were recorded on three consecutive days late last week.

The NBA announced last week that 16 players had tested positive for the coronavirus. ESPN reported Tuesday that the Nuggets had closed their practice facility after positive tests within Denver’s group travelling to Orlando.

Brooklyn’s Spencer Dinwiddie and DeAndre Jordan have also tested positive. Jordan won’t be with the team when it resumes play while Dinwiddie is still experiencing symptoms, so his status is uncertain.

Powell said he’s not particularly concerned about his well-being or that of his teammates, because the Raptors are following coronavirus safety guidelines “to a T.”

“I’m concerned about it just from a general standpoint of numbers increasing,” Powell said. “Outside (the NBA’s planned quasi-bubble), I’m very concerned about just how dangerous it is. I’m more concerned about my family members that are out, having to deal with going out in public, going back to work and putting themselves in danger of catching the virus.”

A week into what could be three months in Florida, Nurse said the Raptors have managed to stave off homesickness and boredom.

“The first week has gone by in a snap of a finger. That’s a really good sign,” he said.

The coaches are up early, and spend all day in the gym, with players arriving in staggered groups of four to practise — one player and two coaches per net.

“The days go by pretty quickly, we’re trying to mix in some days off, we’re trying to mix in a lot of different activities,” he said.

The team had a barbecue recently. They play ping-pong and pool.

“There are a few other things we’re trying to mix in, too. I don’t really sense much anxiety or people worrying about, ‘Man, this is going to be a long time,’” he said. “They seem really good. You can ask me that again in a month if you want. I’ve said that a lot, how much I’ve missed coaching these guys. I just sense that these guys like being around each other and like to play.”

The Raptors were 46-18 and second in the East when the league shuttered on March 11. They tip off the restart on Aug. 1 versus the Los Angeles Lakers, and face among the toughest eight-game seeding schedule of the 22 teams that will be in Orlando.

“I like the schedule, I think it’s great to see the Lakers again, (No. 1) Milwaukee again, just to get a feel for them again,” he said. “We’re playing really quality teams, I think every team we’ve got is a playoff team, so that’s going to be obviously those are good teams, so I like it.”

Dear Editor,

[RE: All Washington plate owners can’t be Canadian residents, July 4]

Plenty of U.S. citizens may live and work in Canada, and are not required to have their vehicles registered here.

For example, many US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers work at the Vancouver Airport in the pre-clearance operations. These officers and their families are temporarily posted here and can bring their vehicles from their U.S. home states. Some still live in Washington State and cross the border to work as they are deemed essential workers. Many others choose to live here to take advantage of their U.S. dollar salaries and the low Canadian dollar.

I can think of many other examples of where U.S. citizens may be living here with U.S. registered vehicles.

And rather than U.S. focus, how about the letter writer asking the B.C. and Canadian governments why we have done so poorly regarding the deaths per population in comparison to Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Australia, and New Zealand?

[RE: All Washington plate owners can’t be Canadian residents, July 4, The News online]

This person obviously has more time on his/her hands than common sense.

Going around collecting and trying to report U.S. licence plates is racist.

Maybe these people are dual citizens, could be doctors, maybe they are First Nations people who have more rights than other people when it comes to travel across borders.

I do not believe the data given by the NDP government, which is never challenged by local newspapers and the press in general.

Yet it is OK for the Simon Fraser University sports teams to try and erase British Columbias Scottish residents heritage and histor. SFU has used the Clans man name for decades – these students knew the name of the sports programs before entering SFU – if they don’t like the heritage behind the name, play somewhere else.

UNRELATED LETTER: Who says which healthcare workers are deserving of top ups?

My family is proud of our Scottish heritage and even more proud to be from the “Middleton Clan.”

And I just read where an Interior team is dropping the name “Rebel” from a sport’s team – lots of songs should now be banned from air play.

Billy Idol comes to mind – time for people to get a life – celebrate your roots and your heritage don’t allow left-wing SFU university students to deny your rights as a Canadian citizen.

743,743,1210,mapleridgenews,https://www.mapleridgenews.com/opinion/column-some-more-appropriate-names-for-washington-nfl-team/,COLUMN: Some more appropriate names for Washington NFL team – Maple Ridge News,'Associated Press',2020-07-04,"Finally, Washington’s NFL team would have a name everyone could cheer with pride

Now that Washington’s NFL team has taken a long-overdue step toward changing its name, it’s time to start lining up some possible replacements.

Washington Generals, anyone?

After defiantly resisting all calls to change its offensive moniker, the Washington NFLers finally bowed to the only thing that really matters.

The bottom line.

With the nation embroiled in social turmoil and economic upheaval, Nike stopped selling merchandise with the Washington nickname. For good measure, stadium title sponsor FedEx called on the team to come up with a moniker that would be more in tune with the current times rather than, say, the 1800s.

So, while Washington’s NFL team conducts what it calls a “thorough review” that almost will surely lead to a replacement by 2021 at the latest, let’s explore a few possibilities:

GENERALS — This would be a nod to the lovable losers who spent decades serving as the Harlem Globetrotters’ nightly pushovers, compiling a record of one win and somewhere north of 16,000 losses before they went out of business in 2015. Washington’s NFL team hasn’t been quite that bad in recent years, but it did go 3-13 a year ago and last won a playoff game in 2005. If Generals doesn’t work out, how about the Federals? They were Washington’s entry in the USFL during the 1980s, going 7-29 over two seasons in the ill-fated spring football league. A seamless transition, that would be.

GRIDLOCK — The District of Columbia has some of the worst traffic congestion in the nation, so this would seem fitting to all those commuters who’ve been spent roughly the time it takes to play an NFL game just trying to get to work. Also, it sums up our current political climate.

BLAZE — During the War of 1812, the British invaded Washington and set fire to numerous government buildings including the White House and the Capitol. Not necessarily a proud moment in the nation’s history, but probably a notch above Dan Snyder’s embarrassing tenure as team owner.

BUREAUCRATS — The team could pay tribute to all those nameless workers who keep the wheels of government droning along through turbulent times. They’ve certainly shown more imagination than some of Washington’s offensive schemes over the past couple of decades.

FOGGY BOTTOM BOYS — Foggy Bottom is one of the city’s oldest neighbourhoods, which would give Washington’s NFL team a chance to play off the fictional band created for the Coen Brothers’ classic movie “O Brother, Where Art Thou?” The Soggy Bottom Boys were fronted by a lip-syncing George Clooney, who hopefully could be persuaded to cut a video for the team’s new right song, “I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow.” It’s a catchier tune (and certainly more appropriate for the long-suffering fan base) than the hokey “Hail to the ….”

BLOSSOMS — While perhaps lacking the machismo of other potential monikers, the city’s famed cherry blossoms are in full bloom for roughly as long as the hopes of a Washington NFL fan each season. About two weeks.

SENATORS — Washington’s longtime baseball franchise was so horrible most years that its derisive motto became, “First in war, first in peace, last in the American League.” Hmm, that sounds familiar. Other names that were once used by pro sports franchises in the district include the Diplomats (a long-forgotten soccer team from the 1970s) and the Ambassadors (a team that never got off the ground in the World Football League). But forget about the Bullets, the NBA Wizards’ former name. That one was dropped because of its association with gun violence. It ain’t coming back.

HOGS — This name hearkens back to the team’s most glorious era, when a group of down-and-dirty behemoths dominated the offensive line of scrimmage and bullied Washington to three Super Bowl titles under Joe Gibbs. This might be the best way to appease those fans who are sure to object to changing the offensive moniker.

MONUMENTS — C’mon, how can you not like the Washington Monuments! A worthy tribute to the city’s stunning array of marble and granite remembrances, which honour everyone from the first president to Martin Luther King Jr. to the veterans of the Vietnam War. Some great logo possibilities, for sure.

RED TAILS — This is our pick. It maintains a link to the team’s current abomination of a name but also salutes the famed Tuskegee Airmen, the group of African American fighter pilots who broke down racial stereotypes during World War II.

Finally, Washington’s NFL team would have a name everyone could cheer with pride.

Dear Editor,

The community is celebrating Barbara Duncan, curator of the ACT Art Gallery.

Many of you may not know that the art gallery and the gallery store at The ACT were closed and its curator Barbara Duncan and her assistant Susan Thompson were fired by the arts council in late April, a mere five weeks into the lockdown of the COVID19 pandemic.

The gallery as we have always known it, is now referred to as the gallery space.

The arts council has never publicly admitted that they fired the curator.

In May, two high profile articles in The News featured the financial disaster the ACT was experiencing, but there was no mention of closing the gallery and firing Barbara Duncan.

The subsequent press releases from the arts council are cloaked around the pandemic creating a financial disaster.

RELATED LETTER: Board defends tough decisions ahead for arts centre

This decision has been kept from the public.

Consistent reference to the incident as a personnel matter that couldn’t be discussed, raised questions regarding Barbara’s competence or whether she was charged with something unlawful and this speculation has resulted in harming her reputation.

In a letter I received from the executive director, Curtis Pendleton, she stated that, “Barbara has done exemplary work in our community in her position as curator and she will be missed.”

Why would an employee who has done exemplary work be suddenly fired?

The arts council is effectively standing by and watching the fallout after they lit the bomb!

A 1,250 strong petition has been presented to the arts council and city council requesting a reinstatement of Barbara Duncan. An impressive result considering that not many people knew about it and was collected within a two-week period during a pandemic.

If the arts council had appealed to the public for support to keep the gallery and retain their their employees, I am certain the community would have responded generously.

They showed no confidence that the community would choose to save the gallery. However, taking this unilateral step ensured that the community would have no input nor be given the opportunity to keep this valuable cultural asset alive.

Instead of cutting two jobs, everyone could have agreed to take a pay cut or cut back on work days. But perhaps there always was a different plan before the pandemic and a perfect opportunity presented itself.

I felt proud to have such a professional be in charge of the many facets that a high quality gallery demands and I am requesting a thorough review by a third-party investigator to see if all the proper procedures were followed, if all other avenues to save the gallery were explored and whether the two employees were compensated for their sudden dismissal and given due process financially.

It is a publicly funded organization and this decision has made the public lose trust in this arts council. They have forgotten that they are accountable to the public. I feel the arts council owes Barbara and the community an honest explanation, and perhaps we can start there.

RELATED LETTER: What’s happening to key staff at The ACT?

On the sunny June 19, 40 supporters of the art community organized a surprise car and heart parade to honour Barbara Duncan. It should be noted that so many others wanted to attend, but we respected the provincial guidelines regarding large gatherings.

Barbara was our curator for 10 years and in that time, she built an exciting, well respected gallery, which was known for its support of local artists, professional artists and artisans, as well as featuring both contemporary and unique exhibitions.

She was the face of gallery, always respectful, innovative, and open to ideas.

The community did not want Barbara to disappear without a heartfelt appreciation within the park grounds outside of the ACT.

It was not a rally nor a demonstration, but a public celebration in recognition of Barbara’s support of our community and showcasing artists in their best light.

The arts community and its supporters wanted to honour and thank Barbara by giving her a warm, genuine, and joyful send off to remember the community of Maple Ridge by, because June 19 would otherwise be only remembered as a very sad day for Maple Ridge.

If you have a letter you’d like to submit to the editor for consideration, please email us at editor@mapleridgenews.com. Look forward to hearing your thoughts.

Dear Editor,

I’m writing in hope to shed some light on a current situation.

I am a health care aide, in a long-term care facility – in our community.

I have been for 10 years.

The government released an amazing article that all healthcare workers such as care aides, nurses, RTs, etc would be receiving back pay for working during COVID-19.

They stated that they would be giving a $4 an hour top up to our wages and it would be back paid from March 16 – when this pandemic really hit us.

Wow, sounds great right?

RELATED: Pandemic pay’ to give temporary wage top-up to 250,000 B.C. frontline workers

Honestly as a care aide, I’m used to being shafted by the public and our government.

I have worked in all areas of this field. I’ve worked at our hospital, I’ve worked for home care. I’ve worked for government long-term care facilities and private.

I feel like I’ve seen all sides to the spectrum.

Now, more than ever, we are seeing how little our long-term care facilities get in terms of staffing, support and supplies.

So, when the government came out with this great big plan, how could we not get excited?

Now we find out that they are only giving this “heroes pay” to government facilities.

Punch to the gut.

So as a private health care aide, who worked day and night, overtime included – during a COVID-19 outbreak, to hear that I’m not “good enough” (for lack of a better phrase) to be eligible for this pay increase, is such a slap in the face.

You’re telling me that, I have to follow the Fraser health guidelines, I need to follow all the government protocols, etc. But, I am not eligible for the same pay increase?

We do the exact same job, we follow the exact same procedures, we follow the same health guidelines, we work the same hours, we did the same schooling – yet I am not eligible?

I get up every morning, doing the same care on my residents, wear my PPE – which includes googles that are very difficult to do my job in.

I get up the same amount of residents and do their daily care, and meet their daily needs, I’m there for them for support, to help feed, to be there for them when their families are not able to. Yet, I am not eligible for this too?

Why is it any different than if I worked in a government-owned facility?

I make less money per hour working at a private care home.

And while you’re reading and thinking – well then work at a government facility, there problem solved – its not that simple.

First off, I have worked for two long-term care facilities that are government owned and I’ve worked for the hospital.

I probably won’t ever do that again.

The residents felt like numbers and not people. That’s not what I became a care aide for.

While I make less money per hour at a private care home – that is the choice I made, so that I could actually care for my residents, so I could know them, so I could know their families, and their likes and dislikes.

I chose this because I want to make a difference in a seniors life. That’s why I went to school.

And this is not a slam against government healthcare workers -–they work very hard, are understaffed, as are we – that’s nothing new, and deserve this [top up] as much as we do.

I think what I’m trying to get across is, why them and not us?

I worked during COVID and it was the hardest thing I’ve ever done as a care aide.

I would leave work in tears, almost daily during our outbreak.

I would be dehydrated and exhausted, over worked and under paid.

So why are myself and my fellow private long-term care facility workers being snubbed?

Why are places that haven’t even had to work with the virus, getting a lump sum of back pay, where private care facility workers who have put their lives on the line working directly with COVID, are getting nothing?

How is it fair that you’re basically saying one is better than the other, one is more deserving that the other.

Who decides who is more deserving?

Canada Day, on July 1, is typically a day for people across the country to gather for festivities and to feel good about our nation.

But this year, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the traditional celebrations cannot go ahead as planned.

In an effort to slow the spread of the pandemic, physical distancing regulations are in effect and gatherings of more than 50 people are prohibited. This means gatherings in the park and other festivities cannot proceed. Public events must be scaled down, at least for this year.

But Canada Day is not just about getting together for a flag-raising ceremony, a barbecue, and a piece of national birthday cake.

Instead, this is a day to feel good about this country where we live. It is a day to appreciate the things that make Canada a special place.

There is a lot to celebrate about Canada.

This is the place we call home. This is where we belong.

Some have deep ties to this land, going back many centuries. These connections must be respected and appreciated.

Many have family stories of how our parents, grandparents, or an earlier generation chose to come to this country to escape oppressive regimes, poverty or violence.

Some among us have made this choice themselves.

Some can appreciate the freedom to live as who they are, or the freedom to follow their religious beliefs.

These freedoms do not exist in all parts of the world.

And even when we disagree with trends or decisions, we are able to voice our disagreements. We have the right to hold contrary opinions. This is not a universal right.

For these reasons and more, there is plenty worth celebrating on Canada Day. In fact, there is a lot for each of us to celebrate, on July 1 and throughout the year.

Whether you mark the day by celebrating with family, friends, or complete strangers via our new virtual realities, the team here at the Maple Ridge-Pitt Meadows News wants to take this moment to wish you the very best for July 1 and the year ahead.

Whatever you have planned today, please take this sentiment with you.

Know that your local news team – which is dedicated to bringing you information about our hometown of Maple Ridge & Pitt Meadows – is proud to have been part of this community for almost 40 years now and we are excited to continue serving you well into the future.

From our family, to yours, Happy Canada Day everyone!

Sue Simning, mother of the the late Bradley McPherson, stands with her son’s black 1980 GMC Short Box, named “Emma.” (Special to the Aldergrove Star)

Arranged as an annual meetup of car lovers, family, and friends, the late Bradley McPherson’s memorial car show is hitting the road this summer to keep up with COVID-19 safety guidelines.

What went off last August without a hitch at Aldergrove’s Twilight Drive-In, Burnouts In The Sky, is switching gears in 2020 to an event where participants drive around the Fraser Valley, completing challenges in a bid to beat the clock.

RELATED: Brad McPherson still makes his mark, eight years later

“We felt this is the right thing to do with all that is involved and to protect the ones we love and all of you,” said McPherson’s mother, event organizer Sue Simning.

“The Twilight Drive-In has been unfairly controlled by Fraser Health and continues to be limited to only 50 cars at their venue,” Simning said.

McPherson, a 28-year-old victim of murder in 2011, is remembered most fondly by friends and family for working on cars like his black 1980 GMC Short Box, named “Emma.”

Russell Bidesi, was sentenced to life in prison in 2018, eight years after McPherson stood up for a woman being harassed at a house party in Newton.

This is the eighth year that his family has paid tribute to his life by hosting an event to raise money to fund scholarships for young adults just like him.

“We do this so we can keep the memory of Bradley alive,” said Simning, at last year’s event, which raised more than $11,369 for the Bradley McPherson Memorial Scholarship Fund.

Already in 2020, the group has doled out post-secondary scholarships to two high schoolers that faced challenges in the classroom, having attention-deficit disorder.

One of them is Walnut Grove Secondary’s Bethany Meszaros, who received $1,000.

“I have fought really hard to do well in school and I hope to become a teacher so that I can support others who have ADHD,” Meszaros told the family in a handwritten card.

An illegally-developed mountain bike park was so well known that even Google Maps listed it as “Unofficial Walnut Grove Mountain Bike Park” before a recent Township of Langley crackdown.

The bike park is located at the end of Telegraph Trail near 204th Street, on land that is both Township-owned and private, in a ravine that runs through Walnut Grove north of 88th Avenue.

Township council heard about the ravine in a July 9 report that was discussed at the July 13 council meeting.

The site includes a number of smooth dirt paths, small ramps and jumps, a fire pit, and some garbage scattered near Yorkson Creek.

According to the report, when staff recently became aware of the secret bike park, they found that embankments had been cut and filled, and tree roots and streamside plants had been removed in an environmentally sensitive area.

“During the site visit, youth and younger members of the public were observed utilizing hand-held equipment, such as shovels, axes, and wheelbarrows, to complete the referenced construction work,” the report says.

There was evidence that the work has been going on for “a number of year.”

In fact, someone has labelled the site “Unofficial Walnut Grove Bike Park” on Google Maps.

The Township is planning to fence off the entrance to the site.

Another portion of the site, closer to 88th Avenue, has already been cut off with temporary fencing, with multiple NO TRESPASSING and PRIVATE PROPERTY signs.

The adjacent landowner has been in touch with the Township, and said that an unused road allowance was providing an access point to the site.

Ramin Seifi, the Township’s general manager of community development, noted that the local youth have been “very innovative and creative” in creating the illicit bike park, but it is impacting the natural environment, and endangering the teens on land they don’t have the right to be on.

“It poses public safety concerns, environmental concerns, liability concerns,” said Seifi.

Staff wanted the council to know about the plans to fence off the site in case youth or their parents approached the council to bring up the sudden closure of the site.

The Township will also approach Google about having the “Unofficial Walnut Grove Bike Park” designation removed.

Seifi said that there are still hopes for some public access for the ravine area, however. Talks were underway with the landowner about completing an official path to allow access through the ravine to 88th Avenue.

Closure of Cascades Casino will mean a smaller share of profits, Rudy Storteboom predicts

Because of the COVID-19 shutdown of the Cascades Casino, Langley City may have less money for community grants next year.

Coun. Rudy Storteboom, a member of the City community grant committee, issued the warning on Monday, July 13, as City council prepared to approve more than $21,000 in grants to 12 City organizations.

“Because these funds come from casino revenues [and] because the casinos been shut down for so long the, available proceeds for community grants next year will be significant diminished,” Storteboom predicted.

Storteboom suggested the City should issue an advisory with the approval of the latest community grants.

This year, the City set aside $168,000 of casino proceeds to provide community grants to organizations that “contribute to the general interest and advantage of the City,” as a report by Darrin Leite, the City director of corporate services put it.

In the first round of approvals, made in February, the council awarded more than $123,000 in community grants.

Council unanimously approved a second round of grants on Monday, to 12 recipients, including $4,500 to Southgate Church, $3,500 to Special Olympics Langley and $2,300 to Douglas Park Community School.

Cascades Casino shares 10 per cent of its net profits with the City, as required under gaming regulations.

Since the inception of the Community Grant Program in 2006 the City has distributed more than $1.8 million of Casino revenue to various groups.

The City share, more than $7 million in a good year for the casino, has kept taxes 2.5 per cent lower than they would have been without the gaming revenue and kept Langley City out of debt, the municipality has estimated.

Casino funds have also paid for $11 million of the new Timms Community Centre, as well as bridge deck repairs on 200 Street, Douglas Crescent rehabilitation between 204 Street and 208 Street, and work on 56 Avenue, among other things.

As part of a province-wide lockdown to fight the spread of the novel coronavirus, B.C. Lottery Corporation (BCLC) ordered the shutdown of all casinos, community gaming centres, and bingo halls on Monday, March 16.

The temporary closure of all gaming facilities follows the directive issued by Attorney General David Eby and announced today by Provincial Health Officer Bonnie Henry.

While there remains no set date for the casino to reopen , Gateway was able to re-open Match Eatery & Public House in June and Atlas Steak + Fish restaurant on Thursday, July 2.

A highly anticipated annual event at Critter Care Wildlife Society has been cancelled due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

The rescue facility located in Langley is open to the public only two days of the year during its annual open house, but this year’s event will not be moving ahead.

READ MORE: VIDEO: Critter Care open house 2019

In the past, fees collected from admission to the event has raised as much as $30,000 for the society, funds that are used to buy medicine and specialized food for the critters.

“We’re sorry that our open house needed to be cancelled. However, if you still would like to have one or more animal sponsorships… you can,” the wildlife rescue centre wrote in an online post.

Available critters include bear, beaver, fawn, otter, raccoon, skunk, rabbit and chipmunk.

Those interested in sponsorship can mail a cheque for the amount of $25 to the facility (481 – 216th St., Langley, B.C. V2Z 1R6) including the name of the critter to be sponsored.

COVID-19 also forced the non-profit charity to cancel internships from abroad and they are now in search of locals to fill those positions.

“During an intern’s stay they will live on site; they are provided free lodging and food as they typically raise animals from a few weeks old and require feeding around the clock,” Critter Care wrote in an online posting.

“Interns are required to go on various rescues and sometimes they have the option to go on a release and watch their grown babies get introduced into the wild.”

Of the many changes in Langley grocery stores due to the COVID-19 pandemic, 12 Walnut Grove grads working as cashiers couldn’t have guessed this one.

Their boss Charlie Lee, owner and manager of the IGA shut the store’s doors early on Tuesday, July 7.

It wasn’t to have the employees restock shelves, or sanitize the shopping carts either.

It was to surprise them with the prom they never got this year after Langley district schools had to cancel grad events to comply with provincial health guidelines.

Store employee and grandmother of one of the grads, Patricia Webb, saw the set-up before she finished her shift at work.

She said it was “just fabulous.”

“I have never seen anything like it,” explained Webb, with table and chair coverings accented in blue ribbons and fanciful place settings and arrangements.

The grads were told by Lee, and three others on store management, to come donning the dresses and suits they had purchased for their grad banquet this year.

“The rest was a surprise when they got here,” Webb said.

The grads arrived at their workplace to a blue banner hanging proudly over the store entrance with the words, “Congratulations Grads, Class of 2020.”

From there, the teens were escorted inside – down a red carpet – to a banquet area where they danced, toasted with non-alcoholic champagne, and indulged in appetizers and meals catered by Brown’s Social House.

“It was more than any of us expected,” said 18-year-old cashier Izzy Sehdev who wore a velvet blue dress.

“Charlie even dimmed the store lights and had spotlights shone on us,” she explained.

There was even a white backdrop set up with props for a photoshoot.

“It was as close to a prom as you could get,” Webb said, amazed by Lee’s show of kindness to his young employees.

“He is one of the nicest people I have ever met.”

She said her granddaughter, 18-year-old cashier Emily Grant, looked “absolutely stunning” in the glittering gown she bought for prom last August.

“I don’t know of any other individual who would do something like this,” Webb told the Advance Times.

Grant agreed – “It was the closest thing to a prom I’ve had all of this year,” she said.

“It was really special because I don’t think anyone else in our grad class got anything like it,” Sehdev added.

“Us grads on staff all hang out outside of work anyways, so it was like having a dinner with your best friends.”

An adult male pedestrian has been sent to hospital and is in critical condition after a serious crash in Cloverdale.

Police have closed the westbound lane of Highway 10 between the 176th (Highway 15) and 168th Streets.

“Road closures are currently in effect as a result of a serious motor vehicle collision that occurred in Cloverdale,” Corporal Joanie Sidhu, media relations officer, wrote in a release.

Police say at about 9:41 a.m. the man was hit by a semi-truck at the intersection of 172 Street and Highway 10. The man was trying to cross north to south on No. 10 when the westbound truck hit him.

“The semi-truck driver remained at the scene of the collision.”

Sidhu said the Surrey RCMP Frontline and Traffic Services were at the scene to investigate.

The road is expected to be closed for several hours.

Police are asking anyone with who witnessed the collision, or has dashcam footage, to please call Surrey RCMP at 604-599-0502. Anonymous reports can be made through Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-TIPS or www.solvecrime.ca.

A 45-year-old Langley man has recently been charged with drug possession for the purpose of trafficking, months after a raid on a Brookswood home.

The Langley RCMP Drug Section investigation led to surveillance on a home in the 20300 block of 38A Avenue.

On April 15, local officers executed a search warrant for both the home and a vehicle that was seen leaving the home, said Cpl. Holly Largy, spokesperson for the local detachment.

Officers found 17 “flaps” of cocaine, along with some cash, packaging materials, and a digital scale.

The suspect was arrested after the search warrant was served, but was released from custody.

He has now been charged with possession of a controlled substance for the purpose of trafficking, and is due to appear in court in mid-August, said Largy.

In May, Langley Township forecast a possible $48 million shortfall in revenues, based on an estimate that just 75 per cent of property owners would pay their taxes by the July deadline.

But as of this week, the Township has determined that 85.5 per cent of property owners have paid their taxes already, including 92 per cent of residential property owners.

It appears to be “a normal year” for property taxes in the Township, noted Mayor Jack Froese.

This means things will be financially much simpler for the Township.

“It reduces our reliance on dipping into reserves, or borrowing,” Froese said.

If taxes hadn’t been paid, the Township would have run out of ready cash to pay for ongoing expenses sometime later in the year.

Langley City is in a similar state.

According to City staff, they have collected 82 per cent of their total property taxes, including 90 per cent of residential property taxes and 72 per cent of commercial property taxes.

“It’s fantastic that we have that, because we can keep our services going,” said Mayor Val van den Broek.

She noted that one of the reasons the level of payment is so high is that many City residents were already paying their taxes monthly through their banks.

The lower amounts paid for commercial property taxes in both City and Township do not mean that those taxes won’t get paid this year, either.

The provincial government mandated a two-month grace period for all non-residential property tax payments. Commercial and industrial landowners don’t have to pay their taxes until September, but a majority have still already paid in both City and Township.

For those who have not yet paid residential taxes, the penalties will be less if they can pay over the summer.

There is a 10 per cent penalty for non-payment of property taxes in B.C., but both City and Township modified its terms to reduce the first level of penalty.

In the City, half of the penalty was originally due after July 2, but that’s been reduced to two per cent. The remaining eight per cent is only due if the landowner misses an Oct. 1 deadline.

The 10 per cent late payment in the Township has been reduced to 1.75 per cent for those who missed July 2, and 8.25 per cent deferred to mid-November.

Both City and Township reduced their planned tax increases this year.

Probationary firefighter Nick Stobbe, firefighter Tim Payne, and lieutenant Andrew Penny all participated in the 2018 firefighter boot drive for Muscular Dystrophy Canada at the Save-On-Foods on 64th Avenue. COVID-19 has forced the firefighters charity to cancel a number of fundraisers, but the boot drive could still happen. (Langley Advance Times file)

When the COVID-19 pandemic scuttled their fundraising mayor’s gala this year, Langley firefighters had to come up with a backup plan to support local charities.

Nick Short, co-executive director of the Township of Langley Firefighter’s Charities Society (TLFCS), said if anything, there is even more of a need to help.

“Everyone has been hurt by COVID and charities are no different,” Short commented.

A golf fundraiser had been discussed in the past, but didn’t get very far.

“We bounced around the idea,” explained Short.

“But we already do a number of big events like the mayor’s gala and the boot drive. “

But now, with no gala, the appeal of an event that carries built-in social distancing was evident.

“We decided we could make it work,” Short told the Langley Advance Times.

On Monday, August 24, the first annual charity TLFCS golf tournament to benefit the Langley Hospice Society will take place at the Redwoods Golf Course near Fort Langley.

Fees range from $850 for a foursome, to $450 for a twosome.

To resister, or donate, visit the event website: www.tlfcschipin.com.

VIDEO: a jump in turnout for Mayor’s Charitable Gala fundraiser in Langley

Presented by POWER Earth Enterprises Inc and Vulcan Metalworks, the “Chip In” tournament includes a full 18 holes of golf, food and beverages, including smokie and beer or cider on Hole 10, as well as dinner with a choice of a sirloin steak, BBQ chicken, and and prizes.

Among the restrictions listed by Redwoods, everyone attending the tournament will be required to maintain physical distancing at all times.

There will be a consecutive tee times start, golfers are not permitted to show up earlier than 45 minutes prior to their tee time, no more than six people are permitted at registration or on a hole at any time, and no bag drops are permitted.

Short rates the response so far as “really good” while firefighters scramble to find more sponsors in a limited time.

He thinks there will be another golf tournament next year, but possibly moved to a different date to avoid conflict with the gala, which he described as “postponed” until 2021, not cancelled.

Another casualty of the pandemic was the firefighters annual daffodil campaign to help fight cancer, which was planned for Easter.

There is a possibility the boot drive may still happen, Short added, but that will depend on what restrictions health authorities have in place.

“The boot drive is fairly doable if we have to keep it to five or six [firefighters collecting donations at a time],” he elaborated.

On Sept. 3, Redwoods will host the Greater Langley Chamber of Commerce Golf Tournament, featuring 18 holes, lunch on the 10th holes and a Steak and lobster plated dinner, but no physical banquet.

Cost per golfer is $250, plus tax.

Fernridge resident David Turner, seen here at the start of the Brogan’s Diner fundraising ride against cancer in Langley City on July 12, 2020, found his latest car, a 1995 Firebird, at the back of an Aldergrove barn.(Dan Ferguson/Langley Advance Times)

Among the community of classic car owners in Langley, David Turner is known for owning a lot of cars, rarely for very long.

At 76, the Fernridge resident isn’t exactly sure how many have passed through his hands.

“I’ve probably had 30 good cars, cars that were fixed up nice for car shows,” he estimated.

“Over a lifetime, I’ve probably had a couple hundred.”

His very first car acquisition came about when he and his brother asked about a neglected 1946 Ford, and the owner said the two teens could have it for free, if they could push it off the property..

They did. As it turned out all the old car needed was a new fuel pump, and the brothers were able to sell it.

“It think we got $20,” Turner laughed.

His interest in cars started getting serious about the time Turner was 18, and he bought his first car for driving, a 1956 Ford that was a former California police cruiser.

After putting a lot of work into fixing it up, he didn’t get to drive it very long, because the car got hit by a drunk driver.

“It was a write-off,” Turner recalled.

“He [the other driver] had no insurance.”

After that, Turner went on to acquire many other vehicles, getting into the habit of buying them and working on them until someone else was willing to purchase them.

It was more of a hobby than a business, he explained.

“It was just for the fun of building them,” Turner told the Langley Advance Times.

“When I was finished, I’d get bored. As soon as I get them to the point where you can sell them, I sell them.”

A high point, he recalls, was selling his prized 1964 Comet, after 20 years of ownership, to Bill Gates’ neighbour in Seattle.

Now retired from his job with the Township water department, and a later job at a stove and stone store than lasted about 10 years, Turner still keeps an eye out for potential acquisitions.

“I’m always looking.”

Turner spotted his latest project while he was out for a drive and saw a neglected 1995 Firebird.

“I found it in the back of a barn out in Aldergrove. It was one of those ones you’ve got to have,” he related.

“I don’t think there’s more than 20 in B.C.”

It needed a lot of work.

“It was pretty rough.”

It took about 60 hours just to clean accumulated grime from the body, engine compartment and wheels, and get the T-roof locks working, among other things.

READ ALSO: VIDEO: Record turnout for third annual Langley car show against cancer

By the time he showed up for the annual Brogan’s Diner car show fundraiser against cancer, he said the car hadn’t been repainted yet.

The upholstery was in good shape, though, and he covered the driver’s side seat with a towel for protection.

Other than that, it was in good running order, perfectly able to handle the demands of a four-hour drive to Harrison and back.

Admittedly, it was a different choice for Turner, who usually ends up working on classic hot rods.

“I just wanted something different,” he explained.

“No matter what you do to a classic hot rod, it’s still not comfortable. These are a little bit more comfortable and fun to drive. And it’s collectible.”

He was able to make the round-trip in comfort with a working car heater while some hot rod owners ended up getting pretty cold, he related.

A 20-year-old grandson, aware of Turner’s tendency to lose interest in projects when completed, has been dropping hints about the Firebird.

Bad news for the grandchild; Turner isn’t planning on selling this one, although he concedes old habits might be hard to break.

“I hope not [to sell], this time,” is how he described his decision.

Alder Inn, located at 27214 Fraser Hwy. in Aldergrove, will be demolished after Langley Township mayor and council voted in favour of toppling the 71-year-old building Monday.

“The public has spoken,” voiced Langley Township Coun. Petrina Arnason at Monday afternoon’s council meeting – where the majority of councillors and mayor voted to demolish the long-standing Alder Inn.

“Having read all the different submissions from the community,” Arnason said it was clear what the majority of Aldergrove wanted.

“The community wants the building demolished now,” Coun. Kim Richter affirmed.

Up until July 13, the Township was asking Aldergrove residents and stakeholders in the community for feedback regarding Coun. Eric Woodward’s June 15 motion to demolish the 71-year-old downtown building.

“We’ve heard from the public that the building needs to come down,” said Coun. Blair Whitmarsh, referencing feedback results.

RELATED: Alder Inn could see a wrecking ball in the near future

The only member of council adamantly opposed to the demolition was Aldergrove resident Bob Long, who argued that the $250,000 estimated cost of abatement and demolition of the site was counter to the Townships’s vested interests.

“If we demolish it we will have no revenue coming from it at all. At least when it’s occupied we get tax revenue of $20,000 per year,” Long said.

“It will leave a big gap in the middle of downtown,” he continued.

“I think the building needs to be sold, or at least leased,” Long said, to recoup some of the cost of purchasing it – along with two adjacent lots – for $5.4-million in June 2019.

Woodward rebutted that demolition of the central site will in fact increase the value of the property at 27214 Fraser Hwy. due to “the removal of an old building that is no longer economically viable.”

POLL: Should the Alder Inn be demolished, or preserved?

Ultimately, councillors Long and Arnason voted against the demolition – with Arnason citing concerns about the accelerated pace of Woodward’s motion to topple the structure.

“I’m just going to vote what my conscience tells me is the right decision,” she said.

Long alluded to the Township not considering a recent offer made to buy and re-purpose the hotel.

The rest of council ultimately voted in favour of demolition.

Funding sourced for the project is to be determined by council at a later date, Township Mayor Jack Froese said.

The Aldergrove Credit Union Community Centre (ACUCC), just down the road from the inn was mentioned several times throughout the meeting.

Both Whitmarsh and Davis questioned an expenditure for demolition downtown after council was informed that the lack of financial resources has led to the extended closure of the Otter Co-op Outdoor Experience since mid-March, as well other recreational opportunities put on by the Township this summer in Aldergrove.

“Opening the ACUCC needs to be priority,” Davis said.

Because support straps were left on too long, several newly planted trees had to be removed from McBurney Plaza in Langley City. New trees were planted in early June, 2020. (Dan Ferguson/Langley Advance Times)

Unclear language in the contract to install trees in McBurney Plaza made it difficult to determine responsibility when all the trees started dying, Hirod Gill, Langley City manager of engineering services, told council Monday, July 14.

“It looks like there wasn’t enough clarity in the contract,” Gill said.

In his report to council, Gill said the contractor who installed the trees failed to remove support straps, damaging the trees and forcing their replacement.

“After a year, those straps were supposed to be removed, but it just didn’t happen,” Gill explained.

As part of the replacements, Gill related how a revised design for the plaza saw 11 trees reduced to nine, and a different type of surround installed at the bases.

Coun. Rosemary Wallace expressed disappointment.

“It is sad that the contractor, or whoever was responsible for the trees did not take care of them,” Wallace commented.

“It’s a shame.”

Mayor Val van den Broek wanted to know if the contractor paid for their mistake.

“Did they cover the charges?” van den Broek asked.

Gill was unable to provide a dollar amount, but noted the contractor did share the cost.

“By cost sharing, they kind of admitted they were at fault,” Gill observed.

Going forward, he said such contracts will be written to spell out “rules and responsibilities” in greater detail.

When the trees were replaced last month, Rick Bomhof, Langley City director of engineering, parks and environment told the Langley Advance Times that the strap removal “somehow fell through the cracks.”

By the time the mistake came to light, Bomhof said one tree was dead and a number of others were “severely stressed.”

Bomhof said it isn’t clear how the mistake was made after talks between the City and the contractor and designer responsible for the tree planting.

“No one’s really said, ‘we made a mistake here,’” Bomhof related.

However, the design consultant agreed to work on revamping the plaza for free and and the new trees were provided “at cost,” for about $6,000, plus the expense of pulling out the original trees and improving irrigation and drainage in the plaza, Bomhof said.

Lone complaints will no longer be enough to trigger traffic calming investigations in Langley City, under a new policy approved by council.

Under the new guideline approved at the June 15 council meeting, at least half the people living in the affected area, or 10 people, whichever is the smaller number, will have to support an investigation.

Once a plan is developed, 50 per cent, or 10, of the residents will have to support it before measures like speed bumps are deployed.

It doesn’t apply to busy arterial or collector roads.

Rick Bomhof, the City director of engineering, parks and environment, said a lot of staff time is involved when a traffic calming complaint is investigated.

“We have limited resources,” Bomhof told council.

“There’s a list of requests that we have and we can only get to so many.”

A staff report to council noted that minimum thresholds exist in other Lower Mainland communities like Maple Ridge, where the threshold for a traffic calming review is 75 per cent of residents in the affected area, Surrey with 40 per cent or 10 residents, Vancouver with 30 per cent or 12 residents.

As for the Township of Langley, which does not have a specific number at the moment, the City staff report said the other Langley is “considering an update to their policy to also require a minimum number of residents’ support before initiating an investigation.”

Most members if council supported the policy change.

Coun. Teri James wanted to know how the boundaries would be set.

“Who decides that area, city hall?,” James asked Bomhof, who replied that the City would, and people pressing for traffic calming would be told the boundaries.

Coun. Paul Albrecht, called the proposal “overdue,” a “very good step” that will add clarity for staff

Coun. Rudy Storteboom said he was proud of the calming measures already takenin the City, even though they can generate complaints.

“Inevitably it boils down to the fact that, well, ‘it slows me down,” Storteboom commented.

“So, it’s working.”

When Storteboom asked if the new policy would allow opponents to petition for removal of traffic calming measures, Bomhof replied that it was possible.

Coun. Nathan Pachal felt that was unlikely, given that, in cases of “other traffic calming measures, we’ve received 80 per cent plus support” when thye Cuty has conducted polls.

Pachal called the threshold ”a fairly low barrier, to get 10 signatures.”

READ ALSO: Curbing speeding in Langley City

Mayor Val van den Broek voted against to the new policy, saying it could discourage people from reporting problems.

“I think its super important that we leave all avenues open,’ van den Broek maintained.

“I think we’re going in the right direction … but I think if we limit it to what is being proposed it’s gong to stop people from reporting what’s going on.”

“I have very big reservation that people will not be reporting.”

Councillor Rosemary Wallace asked about calming measures on 200 street near Penzer park.

Because that is an arterial road, it would likely be an enforcement issue, Bomhof replied.

“It doesn’t mean nothing could be done to slow traffic but it would be ” a little more more complicated” than a residential street, Bomhof said.

Bomhof added single complaints will still be recorded.

“It’s all logged,” Bomhof noted.

“It’s not that we won’t take the calls.

Setting a threshold, Bomhof said, will allow staff to prioritize complaints.

“If it [traffic] is truly an issue I would think there would be more than one individual.”

It’s been a bad year for mosquitoes in the Fraser Valley. (Black Press Media files)

If you want to become an involuntary blood donor this year, go for a walk near the Fraser River, and the mosquitoes will gladly oblige.

It’s one of the worst summers for mosquitoes in years, and multiple episodes of high water on the river is being blamed, having left behind pools and puddles that are prime breeding ground for the insects.

“The mosquitoes are bad in Fort Langley with the extended high water,” said Cheryl MacIntosh, commodore of the Fort Langley Canoe Club.

Although the club has shut down its group activities due to the coronavirus pandemic, individual members are still paddling about alone or in family groups. But getting into the water isn’t that much fun right now, MacIntosh said.

“Preparing the boat, loading and unloading by the water are the difficult times,” she said. “Once on the water and moving they are not as bad, as long as you keep moving.”

Morrow BioScience is running the nuisance mosquito program for Metro Vancouver again this year.

“It’s not been a particularly good year for mosquitoes,” said Shaun Calver, Morrow’s operations manager.

In fact, a combination of a rather damp July and multiple high-water events on the Fraser River have resulted in what he called a “perfect storm” for mosquitoes.

Each rainfall, and especially the high water levels, created conditions for more mosquito eggs to hatch, and more larvae to become blood-sucking adults.

However, the end is near.

“It is tapering off,” Calver said.

The mosquitoes live several weeks in their adult form, depending on the temperature.

“The hotter the weather, the quicker they die off,” he said.

Morrow BioScience applies bacterial larvicide to water bodies to try to cut down on the numbers of the biting insects, as well as monitoring larva levels and conducting public education on mosquito prevention.

The company is finished with its larvae control efforts for the year, barring another unlikely rise in river levels, Calver said.

Local municipalities and Metro Vancouver have long advocated for people to help control mosquitoes by removing unnecessary standing water on their properties, particularly items like old tires, blocked gutters, bird baths, or buckets that can hold stagnant rainwater.

Mosquitoes are most active between dusk and dawn, and are attracted to dark and intense colours. To avoid them, try to wear light coloured clothing, wear long-sleeved shirts and pants, and tightly-woven materials. Mesh “bug jackets” or “bug hats” may be needed during extreme conditions.

Morrow also recommends using an insect repellent containing DEET.

Police have recovered $75,000 worth of stolen goods, including 3,200 pounds of rice, from a Langley warehouse.

A statement released Tuesday, July 14, by the Burnaby RCMP Prolific Offender Suppression Team (POST), said the investigation began with the theft of a large shipping container of rice.

On May 10, 2020, officers received a report that a container full of rice, worth an estimated $20,000, had been stolen from a business in South Burnaby.

In mid-June, police received a tip that some of the stolen rice was being sold online and in public.

Further investigation led police to a warehouse in Langley.

On June 26, 2020, police executed a search warrant at the Langley warehouse and found the rice, along with 26 pallets of sandals, 400 packages of paper towels, a “large quantity” of toilet paper and diapers, a crate of ammunition, and more than $1,500 cash.

Langley RCMP are looking into some high-end or unusual thefts this month, including the heist of $10,000 worth of remote control cars and parts, and the disappearance of two metal commemorative plaques from a local overpass.

On June 23, it was discovered that a Big Steel Box container in the 6200 block of 203rd Street had been looted, its locks broken.

The container had held numerous remote control cars, batteries, controller units, and other parts. According to Langley RCMP Cpl. Holly Largy, the items were related to a local business for RC racing.

A July 10 theft was even stranger. Someone pried off the two commemorative plaques that marked the 2007 opening of the 204th Street Overpass, which crosses the Langley Bypass and the railroad tracks in Langley City.

There hasn’t been a spike in metal thefts recently, Largy said. Depending on the price of various metals, the theft of wire, plaques, or old pipes may skyrocket, but that doesn’t seem to be an issue at the moment, so it’s unknown why someone went to the trouble to pry the plaques loose, said Largy.

Another major theft was on July 13th, when someone broke into a garage in North Langley and stole multiple mountain bikes.

The bikes are collectively worth almost $15,000, Largy said.

Also under investigation is the theft of about $700 in cosmetics from a Shopper’s Drug Mart on July 6, and the theft of about $100 in merchandise from Superstore on June 21.

Police released video images of two women suspected in the cosmetics theft, and of one woman suspected in the the Superstore theft.

Anyone with information on any of the thefts can call the Langley RCMP at 604-532-3200, or to leave an anonymous tip, call CrimeStoppers at 1-800-222-8477, or visit www.solvecrime.ca.

Blue Grouse’s winemaker led the initiative, but it would not have been possible without the enthusiastic co-operation of every winery and grape grower in the valley (Citizen file)

Buyers across the province will soon be able to pick up a bottle of wine marked as from the Cowichan Valley thanks to a new sub-geographical designation now officially being recognized under B.C. law.

“Officially recognizing the Cowichan Valley as a distinct and unique wine grape-growing region in B.C. is a testament to the hard work, passion and dedication of the many local entrepreneurs and staff in the wine industry,” said Sonia Furstenau, MLA for Cowichan Valley. “This is a well-deserved accomplishment for all those involved in producing exceptional wines and memorable winery experiences.”

According to a press release issued Friday morning, “defining geographic zones on wine labels connects consumers with the unique geographic area the grapes are grown and the wine is made in and increases exposure to the region for both wine and tourism businesses.”

The Cowichan Valley sub-GI is roughly defined as the area between the Cowichan watershed, the eastern coastline from Mill Bay to Maple Bay and the western area of Cowichan Lake.

“The Cowichan is home to family-owned and operated wineries and grape growers who have been part of the valley for generations,” said Lana Popham, Minister of Agriculture. “They take pride in the wines they produce and recognizing their hard work, skills and growing reputation on the B.C. and international stage is overdue. They make great wine in the Cowichan from the grapes grown in the valley, and the designation both respects and promotes that.”

The Cowichan Valley has the honour of being the first sub-GI outside of the Okanagan and joins the Golden Mile Bench, Naramata Bench, Okanagan Falls and Skaha Bench in the Okanagan Valley.

“The newly announced Cowichan Valley sub-GI recognizes our unique terroir and solidifies Vancouver Island’s position as an up-and-coming wine destination,” said Blue Grouse Estate Winery owner Paul Brunner. “Bailey Williamson, Blue Grouse’s winemaker, led the initiative, but it would not have been possible without the enthusiastic co-operation of every winery and grape grower in the valley. We are proud to be part of such a cohesive group of wine lovers and look forward to being part of an exciting future.”

Tourism Cowichan’s Jill Nessell said now Cowichan can rightfully recognized as a top-quality wine-producing region.

“Wine enthusiasts can now add Cowichan as an area to explore wines produced with this unique terroir. While the award-winning wines and beautiful vineyards draw thousands of visitors to Cowichan every year, it is the extraordinary people behind the wines that create memorable wine-tasting and tour experiences for locals and visitors from across the globe,” she said.

It’s about time Cowichan is recognized for its efforts, said Miles Prodan, president of the BC Wine Institute.

“Having Cowichan Valley officially recognized as a distinct and unique wine grape growing region in B.C. is testament to the maturity of the wine growers and producers in the region,” he said. “To put it simply, when you now see Vancouver Island, Cowichan Valley, BC VQA (Vintners Quality Alliance) on a bottle, it is your guarantee that you’re sipping a wine that is 100% grown and made in this particular terroir of British Columbia.”

A new community market is coming to Langley City this weekend featuring all things local.

Langley school trustee Shelley Coburn and local business owner Brenda-Lee Hunter from The Village Work and Play Space are partnering up to host a market in the City to support local crafters and farmers.

“I really want to give the community something to enjoy in the summer,” Coburn stressed.

The market will debut on Saturday, July 18 from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. in downtown Langley City at 20471 Douglas Cres.

Having put the call out to vendors on Sunday, Coburn says there are about 15 vendors signed up so far, and more are welcome.

“It’s a grassroots, community-led community,” she noted.

Coburn and Hunter have partnered with the Downtown Langley Business Association who will be offering guests at the market a chance to win downtown dollars to spend at local businesses.

The venue includes indoor and outdoor space for vendors to showcase their offerings. Those vendors who wish to secure a spot at this weekend’s market and have their own tent and table will be charged a $30 fee, for those who require a tent and table will be charged $40.

The market in the City will feature things like fresh produce, honey and locally crafted jewelry.

Coburn will be offering her products from her line called Lucky’s LemondAid.

“Most of my products (bath salts, soaks, scrubs and cleaners) are all natural handmade with lavender and roses from my garden,” she explained. “I also will be selling fresh blossoms all from my garden… plus some recycled and up-cycled items with an eye on sustainability.”

The idea to host a market came after the COVID-19 pandemic cancelled many community events leaving local crafters and farmers with limited options to offer their products, Coburn explained.

“It’s a shame these events got cancelled,” she said.

Coburn hopes there is enough interest from vendors and the community that the market can take place each Saturday, but says they will be taking it one week at a time.

“I’m hoping it starts catching,” she said.

Vendors and those who attend will be expected to hear to Fraser Health guidelines. For more information contact Coburn at shelleyfcoburn@gmail.com.

The Fort Gallery presents Together Alone, a group exhibition exploring the impacts of quarantine and isolation as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

As people tentatively emerged from quarantine, the Fort Gallery invited artists to consider themes of connection, community isolation and the innovative ways to find ‘togetherness” while being physically alone.

The community responded enthusiastically.

This exhibition features thirty emerging and established artists from Langley and beyond presenting photographs, drawings, paintings and sculpture.

As many have spent the last months finding ways to connect even while physically isolated, the artists included in this exhibition have taken refuge in their creative practices as a way to cope with and understand our changing reality.

Some artists use the language of abstraction to describe the complex dynamics of the inner life during this time.

Other artists explore the ways that nature has provided an important refuge and escape from the monotonous four walls of of homes.

Still others, through drawings, paintings and photographs of the human figure, consider the ways that the world is re-thinking what it means to connect and be together.

Resonances of loneliness, solitude, distance and connect echo through the works in this diverse exhibition.

Together Alone runs from Friday, July 17 until August 16 at the Fort Gallery.

The gallery is located at 9048 Glover Rd.

Due to social distancing measures, short artist talks will be posted on the gallery’s social media throughout the run of the exhibition.

Lalita Hamill’s childhood exposure to visual art was limited. That was until a massive snowstorm left her unexpectedly stranded at her friend’s house for three days.

Until then, Hamill’s background was mainly music, academics, and competitive swimming – plus a degree in Philosophy earned at the University of Victoria.

“Though I was taught the skills needed to appreciate music and writing, I did not learn those same skills for visual art,” Hamill explained. “My parents would drag my sister and me to galleries when we travelled, but visual art didn’t really become part of my life until I was 24.”

With nothing to do during the snowstorm, Hamill pulled a book of black and white photos off of her shelf and drew for hours.

“I thought ‘that was fun, why haven’t I done this before’?”

Hamill began taking drawing lessons, eventually moving to Walnut Grove in in 2002.

A car accident in 2005 left her husband unable to work for four years, forcing her to become the sole breadwinner of the family.

“Within a year of the car accident, I realized that if I didn’t give my art and teaching a real shot, I would likely regret it. In short, I couldn’t not do it… I was compelled,” Hamill said. “Had the accident not happened, I doubt I would be a professional artist today.”

After taking on any art-related job she could get hands on in Langley-area and beyond, Hamill eventually facilitated art critiques for artists while teaching, painting, and exhibiting her work – all while raising three children.

Now, she has launched a new website to showcase current projects, provide insight into the artistic process, and showcase videos that will provide tips for art buyers, sellers, and artists of different stages.

“Many will be free, some art instruction videos will be for sale,” she said.

Having cultivated a broader and deeper understanding of art from the perspective of an artist, Hamill said her perspective and presentation differs from the standard approach.

“Art appreciation involves a balance between trusting our subjective, personal opinion, with an enhanced ability to identify quality work,” she said.

Anyone can join in for a Zoom session on July 18, which will act as a free art assessment and critique at 10 a.m.

Spots are limited to 15 for artists submitting work and 10 for art appreciators from the general public.

“At the start I will provide a painting – historical, my own, or a students – to demonstrate the assessment process,” Hamill said.

The session will be recorded and portions will be posted on YouTube as examples for others to see. Those participants who do not wish their face to be seen can turn off their video.

Artists will be given information about how to send Hamill two images 72 hours in advance.

Registrations close 48 hours ahead.

“I hope people will come away from my videos and projects feeling inspired to learn more about visual art,” Hamill noted. “I want to help people become comfortable, capable, and empowered to speak about visual art, to choose artwork to purchase, to paint quality work, and to appreciate art for ourselves.”

Hamill advised followers to keep an eye out for new classes, videos, and projects in the coming weeks.

Langley resident Kyla Steele has a shot at being Maxim Magazine’s 2020 cover girl. (Kyla Steele/Special to the Langley Advance Times)

Kyla Steele is a 26-year-old Langley resident who works full-time at St. Leonards Family services with high risk youth.

Steele is a full-time college student, set to graduate Criminology in October, and currently lives is a basement suite with her two “fur-babies.”

Steele is also one of the top contenders in the world right now to possibly grace the cover of Maxim Magazine as part of a 2020 contest.

”I have been modelling for fun since I was in high school,” she told the Langley Advance Times. “It was a way for me to meet new people and to come out of my comfort zone. From there, I worked on movie sets all over Vancouver and formed new connections with people where I then started getting paid for modelling gigs.”

For Steele, it was more about getting the opportunity to meet new people, something she’s been aiming to do ever since she moved to Langley with her family from North Delta in 2013.

“I fell in love with Langley and once I moved out, I stayed; and now I am currently renting in Brookswood with my rescue fur babies, a cat and dog,” Steele assured.

The Maxim Covergirl 2020 contest started May 25, and Steele applied while at work when she stumbled upon an advertisement on her run of the mill graveyard shift.

“I had a lot of spare time on my shift, so I went for it and made myself a profile. I got accepted and was very hesitant on telling anyone. I told my family and a few close friends,” Steele explained. “I didn’t want to advertise myself for votes.”

She started off in first place of out hundreds of contestants and has remained close to the top spot throughout most of June.

People now have the power to choose the winner and can vote for Steele every 24 hours by visiting https://maximcovergirl.com/2020/kyla-4.

If Steele gets enough votes, she’ll also earn $25,000, which she hopes to spend on her parents by sending them away on a trip and donating a portion to the BCSPCA.

“Everyone who did know, was so beyond supportive to where I landed in first place in my group very quickly,” Steele assured. “I realized that I might as well go all out for this contest and bother people for votes because you can not do half a— jobs when it comes to anything in life if you want to succeed.”

Quarter-finals are from now until July 16 with 48 women in the running.

If Steele makes first place in her group, then she will move on to semi-finals – competing against three other women.

The winner will be determined August 13th.

“If I don’t win the contest, this experience has helped me grow and come out of my comfort zone significantly. In my opinion, that is a win on its own,” Steele said.

Fort Langley Artists Group (FLAG) is going ahead with their annual charity gallery, but in a virtual setting.

From now until July 31, people can peruse FLAG’s website http://www.fortlangleyartistsgroup.com/ or their Facebook page to check out local art for sale.

People can purchase 10 X 10 paintings; half of the proceeds goes to the artists while the other half of sales will support Langley Hospice Society.

Gabrielle Strauss, FLAG’s organizer, said Langley Hospice received $650 from FLAG’s charity gallery last year.

“Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the need for physical distancing, the Langley Heritage Society has made the difficult decision to keep the CNR Station closed for the season,” Strauss said.

Virtual viewing will be people’s only chance to experience FLAG’s new creative works, since the Flagstop Gallery will be closed.

FLAG artist’s work typically hangs in CNR Station and has been an anonymous gallery in the past with artists name’s written on the back of the peice so buyers don’t know until after purchase.

“Instead of mounting a theme-based show, the members of the Fort Langley Artists Group [FLAG] have chosen to showcase some of their favorite new creations online in a virtual, visual feast,” Strauss explained.

Alison Philptt, Annie Segelkin, Beverly Lawrence, Caroline Ashley, Daphne Scaman, Diane Zepeski, Ela Cholewa, Gabrielle Strauss, Kim Bucholtz, Margo Harrison, Marguerite Whelton, Patricia Falck, Robin Bandenieks, and Ursula Bolivar all contributed a variety of different pieces of artwork for the cause.

Langley Ukulele Ensemble (LUE) is still strumming away, despite COVID-19 closures; social-distance measures and lessons via Zoom have kept the local music institution going during the past four months.

Paolo Luongo, senior ensemble director, said musicians have been meeting three times a week online for virtual rehearsals and put together two virtual performances since the coronavirus pandemic began.

“One for Canada’s Nation-wide Music Monday and the other for Canada Day, with more virtual presentations to come this summer and into the fall and winter,” Luongo assured.

He said the ensemble was especially thankful to be included as a part of the entertainment that the Township of Langley presented on July 1, since most performances that occur during the summer have been postponed or cancelled.

“We highlighted some of Canada’s most well-known musical groups or artists such as B.T.O., Bryan Adams, Steppenwolf, Joni Mitchell, and Leonard Cohen – to name a few,” Luongo explained. “The virtual performance, which was put together by Luke Strahm, also included some imagery across the Atlantic, east, and west coasts of our beautiful nation.”

The ensemble is preparing to record three chapters of their most recent CD, released in October 2019 called One Love, One Heart.

“Our videographer is in the midst of putting together a video montage of highlights throughout this year’s performances. Our photographer is also doing the same in a slideshow fashion with the various moments that were captured this year prior to the pandemic hitting us in March,” Luongo explained.

It’s been a very different year for LUE; members would be regularly readying for a trip to the Hawaii International Ukulele Festival, held every summer except this one due to COVID-19 restrictions.

Former ensemble director Peter Luongo said this was the first time in 35 years that he and LUE musicians were not attending, while classes via Zoom are proving to be a challenge.

“You lose the synapses of performing together this way. Your more dynamic in a group setting and learn from each other,” he said.

While the rest of 2020 looks uncertain in terms of live performance dates and even their yearly Christmas concert, Luongo said LUE is going ahead with Uke Camp this coming August.

The 14th annual camp welcomes children grades four through seven at all levels from Monday, Aug. 17 to Friday, Aug 21.

“We’re working on drop off and pick up procedures and will have a maximum of 60 kids,” Luongo assured, noting that the number of participants would be almost half of the amount they had last year.

Registration is open and there is still space for uke instruction.

A Thanksgiving tradition that draws tens of thousands of Lower Mainland residents to Fort Langley every fall has been cancelled due to COVID.

Fort Langley’s 25th annual Cranberry Festival – always held on the Saturday of the Thanksgiving Day weekend in October – will not happen as a direct result of the pandemic, said Meghan Neufeld, the former festival coordinator and Fort Langley Business Improvement Area board member.

RELATED – VIDEO: Fort Langley Cranberry Festival rated a ‘huge success’

“This year’s Fort Langley Cranberry Festival was to take place on Saturday, Oct. 10 and would have been the festival’s 25th annual celebration,” she explained.

“Unfortunately, the desire to host the festival, even in an alternate-capacity, did not outweigh the need for public safety and regulatory compliance,” Neufeld said, acknowledging that the streets of Fort Langley are usually packed, shoulder to shoulder with festival goers for the one-day event.

Due to the restrictions on gathering sizes limiting both the number of people and number of vehicles, the BIA directors made what she described as “the difficult decision to not proceed with the festival this year.”

The Fort Langley Cranberry Festival has been running since 1996 and has grown into a highly anticipated event of significant size – with more than 60,000 people visiting the village each year for the scheduled festivities.

“While it is disappointing that the event cannot happen this year, the Fort Langley BIA has high hopes that the village will celebrate the festival’s 25th anniversary in 2021,” Neufeld said, encouraging the public to still visit Fort Langley and “explore all it has to offer.”

Conducted by Anita Comba, the choir has been releasing videos on Youtube of members performing together through technology and careful editing techniques – including recent performances of Shenandoah and Wade in the Water.

Now, just in time for Canada Day, more than 32 members joined together in a Zoom conference sporing red and singing the national anthem.

Comba sent in a recent video to the Langley Advance Times that she edited together with members singing O Canada.

The chorus is made of people in their 30s to 80s and perform at concerts in seniors homes, the Newlands Christmas Wish Breakfast, and in Fort Langley.

See familiar places with fresh eyes: book a foraging tour in Vancouver, hike to hidden lakes in Squamish, or take an Indigenous cultural tour in Whistler, for example.

Head on a Culinary Journey

Expand your repertoire of restaurants on a foodie quest. Richmond’s Dumpling Trail is a must-do for fans of juicy dumplings, wontons, and bao. Revisit your favourite Italian eateries on Commercial Drive, or cross the bridge to the North Shore’s Shipyards District and hop between up-and-coming breweries.

Plan a getaway in the Sea-to-Sky Corridor. Stop in Squamish for craft cider and casual al fresco dining. Whistler – celebrated for its lively après scene – is also a foodie haven. You can do it all: sip BC wines and slurp local oysters; tuck into decadent goodies at an artisan bakery; or sip hand-crafted cocktails. Take a food tasting tour for the full experience.

Pemberton’s farms-with-a-view offer a chance to get closer to your food than ever before. Pick fresh berries (don’t forget to snag the homemade pies and preserves), and stop by a local eatery for ingredient-driven fare.

Celebrate Art and Culture

Indigenous people have lived on this land since time immemorial and their influences are deeply woven into the cultural fabric, from sea to sky. Learn about the living culture through an Indigenous-led walking tour through Stanley Park.

There are many ways to discover (or rediscover) the rich culture and thriving art scene. Cycle through historic neighbourhoods like Gastown, hunt for colourful urban art in Mount Pleasant, and find secret coffee shops along South Granville. Or, visit one of many museums, galleries, and gardens for a moment of quiet reflection.

Gear Up for Adventure

Though Vancouver’s glittering skyscrapers inspired the nickname “City of Glass,” nature is still just around the bend. For every delicious meal savoured, there’s a bike trail to explore. For every art gallery visited, there’s a mountain to summit.

You’ve probably driven the winding Sea-to-Sky Highway to visit communities between West Vancouver and Pemberton before, but there are always new ways to experience old favourites. View the Sea-to-Sky’s volcanic peaks with a flightseeing tour, take a gondola to great heights in Squamish or Whistler, raft through voracious glacier-fed rivers, or trot through Pemberton meadows by horseback.

Squamish – typically known for mountain activities like rock climbing, hiking, and biking – is also a steppingstone to Howe Sound. Book a guided paddleboard tour or kiteboarding lesson to spend time in the fjord. Meanwhile, adventure-filled Whistler needs no introduction. BC residents and visitors alike enjoy alpine sightseeing, lift-accessed downhill riding, and lake exploration, among other activities.

Racist graffiti was discovered in a Lower Mainland park this past weekend.

At least one historical plaque in Memorial Peace Park in Maple Ridge was damaged with black marker or crayon reading “F*** Blck [sic] Lives”.

It is unclear if racist graffiti appeared elsewhere in the park.

“There was some graffiti on the bandstand and there has been the theft of some of the plaques, but the two things might not be, and are likely not, related,” said Valoree Richmond, director of parks and facilities for Maple Ridge Parks, Recreation & Culture.

RELATED: Windows broken, racist graffiti left on Okanagan home

Last week, as part of the regular maintenance of Memorial Peace Park, a staff member noted that there was some graffiti markings on the bandstand on the concrete surface, Richmond explained.

There were six markings in total.

City staff began cleaning off the graffiti on Tuesday using a power-washer and returned on Wednesday to do an overall washing of the bandstand and the surrounding site.

RELATED: Maple Ridge BIA: Tagging doubled in downtown core

General clean-ups, said Richmond are part of the regular maintenance of the park and just had to be moved forward by one week because of the graffiti.

The removal of the dedication plaques is an ongoing issue and is separate from the graffiti.

Five plaques were reported missing last November, said Richmond, and 12 went missing in January, which prompted police to open a file on the matter.

Currently staff are looking at options, in consultation with the Maple Ridge Concert Band Society, on a long term solution to recognize the contributions of donors rather than plaques that will reduce the opportunity for theft, said Richmond.

The graffiti was reported to the Ridge Meadows RCMP through their online reporting system by a Maple Ridge resident as mischief or theft under $5,000.

Early next year disc golfers in Aldergrove will have shelter from harsher elements of the Pacific Northwest climate whilst competing.

That’s because Otter Co-op stepped forward to fund a 40-foot-long, 20-foot-wide cedar pavilion costing upwards of $70,000 for Raptors Knoll Disc Golf Park.

“It’s really going to help with the finishing touches of the course,” said a founder of the course, professional player Stewart McIsack.

The enhancement was one of just 17 chosen, out of 900 in Canada, for the Co-op Community Spaces program this year, which will see $1 million given to fund projects as far west as Vancouver Island, and east to Manitoba.

CEO Jack Nicholson said the local cooperative is “proud” to be part of “investing in projects to improve communities.”

“Together, we’re helping to build into and improve our communities for today and into the future,” he said about the giving program administered by Federated Co-operatives Limited.

The pavilion will be constructed by Mission-based Artisan Custom Log and Timber Homes, which crafted a cedar kiosk and benches for the park earlier this year from a Langley Township grant.

“It will be a great addition to the disc golf course, the park and the community.” said another founder, pro player Chris Hartmann.

“It’s also a nice acknowledgement for the well over 100 volunteers, business and organizations that have put in thousands of hours and provided the funding required to create this special space.”

Located at Jackman Wetlands Park, the 38-acre parl was built atop a reclaimed landfill, now covered with soil, wildflower seeds, and trees planted from volunteers using $15,000 in capital costs from the Township.

RELATED: Pro disc golf players craft the course of their dreams, and biggest in B.C.

Raptors Knoll course went from being non-existent in 2018, to debuting as 27th in the world, said McIsack, and the only in British Columbia to make the top-50 UDisc course list.

Ranked at a 93.3 in January, the Aldergrove course has become a destination for disc golf players from across the globe, he added.

“I have no doubt that we’ll go higher and higher,” McIsack said about the ranking.

COVID-19 changes gameplay

With COVID-19 top of mind for Township officials and park founders, regulations have been changed to minimize touch points between athletes on the course.

Players that throw (putt) their discs within 10 feet of the basket (hole) now get “a gimme,” which automatically adds a “take two” points to their overall score.

This eliminates hands touching the same general area to retrieve their discs, McIsack explained.

“It’s like competitors agreeing that you’d make the shot anyways,” he remarked, instead of putting until the disc lands in the hole.

This year’s theme, “Be Kind, Have Fun, Be Safe,” is celebrating one of the oldest farm communities of the Fraser Valley similar to Aldergrove’s first fair, in 1912 – when horse, poultry, dairy, produce, and needlecraft projects were entered by local residents.

The same sort of handiwork will be considered this year with more than a dozen Langley 4-H club members submitting farm livestock and goods in competition categories.

People will be able to click on and vote for their favourite entries online in contests including: photography, baking, canning, cookbooks, educational displays, and gardening.

Fair on a ‘shoestring budget’ for 2020

The pandemic has stunted much of the usual funding, including sponsors and grants typically acquired, to put on an event of its size, explained Long.

So along with going virtual to ensure fairgoers are social distancing, organizers are selling pre-ordered fair merchandise to help offset the costs of this year’s event.

“We are on a shoestring budget to keep the fair alive this year,” Long told the Aldergrove Star.

Souvenirs on sale include door-opening keychains to help prevent hands from touching surfaces, and fair T-shirts and face masks designed by Aldergrove resident Tami Quiring.

The land border between Canada and the United States will remain closed to non-essential travellers for at least another month, into late August.

Canadians are contemplating staycations or undertaking tourism within our own borders – but many have relatives, friends, even second homes in the United States. Eventually, many of us expect to return to the States for a visit of some kind.

Even once the border is open, when do you think you’ll feel comfortable enough with the COVID-19 situation to visit south of the 49th parallel?



Assuming the border opens this year, when do you think you will feel comfortable travelling to the U.S. again?

Dear Editor,

Today I received the $300 Covid Seniors Benefit. I’m not a wealthy person but my Wife and I get by. We didn’t expect this extra money.

There are a lot of folks in our community who could use this money more than us. We decided to donate this money to Sources Food Bank in Langley. They can turn $300 into $900 worth of food. They are serving over 600 of our neighbours with five locations in the Langley and Aldergrove areas.

I urge all seniors who can get by without this money to pay it forward to Sources Food Bank in Langley. It will make you feel better and help Sources feed our neighbours.

Sources say Canada and the United States are likely to agree to extend their mutual ban on non-essential travel between the two countries for another 30 days.

The Canada-U.S. border has been closed to so-called “discretionary” travel like vacations and shopping trips since the COVID-19 pandemic took hold of the continent in mid-March, an agreement that’s set to expire July 21.

Officials familiar with the ongoing talks, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss matters not yet public, say another extension until Aug. 21 is all but inevitable.

ALSO READ: B.C. Indigenous groups share impact of border closures

News of the likely extension, initially reported by the Globe and Mail newspaper, comes with COVID-19 resurgent in the U.S., particularly in southern states where businesses reopened early and the wearing of face masks has become a partisan issue.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau hinted at the possibility Monday after a phone call with U.S. President Donald Trump.

Trudeau says Canada is closely monitoring what he calls a “constantly evolving” situation, but won’t say whether officials have discussed extending the border restrictions beyond the standard 30-day window.

The board of directors of the Murrayville Hall are passing on condolences to residents of Langley who have lost loved ones during COVID-19 and have been unable to celebrate their lives.

Board member Randall Bowcott said they have decided to offer up the space to help people who may not have been able to hold a service during pandemic restrictions.

“We would like to reach out to those impacted so greatly by offering the use of Murrayville Hall to hold your celebrations of life [or] memorial services for your loved ones by forgoing the usual rental cost of $300 – replacing it with a donation of your choice and ability,” Bowcott said.

People can now book the hall for free for funeral-related services and donate any amount they choose to any charity they wish in lieu of a fee.

The maximum number of people that the hall holds is normally 200 people, but gathering restrictions prohibiting 50 people or more would still be in effect.

“Everything must be socially distanced,” Bowcott assured.

The Murrayville Community Hall is important for its historic and cultural values. Built in 1928 by volunteers, it replaced the original community hall that burned down in 1924.

Amenities include 20 round tables, 24 rectangular tables, 130 wooden chairs, and 60 upholstered chairs, plus two four burner gas stoves with ovens.

The refundable damage deposit would still apply for facility rentals.

“We are offering this opportunity Monday through Thursday from July 14 to October 29, 2020,” said Bowcott, though he noted that the board will be strictly following the rules outlined by Dr. Bonnie Henry.

“We’re flying by the seat of our pants here and anything can change,” he said. “While we’d like to give people a guarantee, we can’t make any promises because of COVID-19.”

People can contact hall manager Trevor Broad at 604 506-8729 to participate or require further information or visit http://murrayvillehall.ca.

Murrayville Hall is located at 21667 48 Ave.

“The Murrayville Hall board of directors hopes that this will bring some comfort to our community during these difficult times,” Bowcott said.

“Last Saturday’s pink flag display on Christ Covenant Church’s lawn was a sobering memorial for the victims of sex selective abortion,” said Elyse Vroom, one of the events organizers.

Held annually to spotlight opposition to sex-selective abortion, participants placed 1,000 pink flags up on the lawn of Christ Covenant Church 6866 Glover Rd.

“We had great, enthusiastic local volunteers who were passionate about this issue and helped with set-up and take down as well as monitoring the flags throughout the day,” she explained.

The location was right off Glover Road, which Vroom said, with its high vehicle traffic, meant many slowed down to read the signs or to honk and wave.

“Those who stopped by were able to sign a petition in support of MP Cathay Wagantall’s Bill C-233, the Sex Selective Abortion Act,” Vroom added.

The bill would make it illegal to have an abortion based on the predicted sex of the pre-born baby.

“In a country that values equality of the sexes, a law against sex selective abortion is something we can all support,” Vroom said.

Lilies have always made their presence known in a perennial bed – tall, elegant flashes of varying colour, some with fragrance – but most needing a little support if not in full sun.

Years of breeding in Holland with lily bulbs has resulted in several new varieties through the last few years that offer the home gardener shorter, more compact varieties that require no support or staking – just plant them and enjoy.

One strain of lilies has become very popular with us – the Longiflorum Asiatics – new crosses developed between the Asiatic lilies and the old fashioned Longiflorum lilies.

This line of breeding has resulted in lilies with very strong stems and larger than usual blooms.

For the past few years, we have enjoyed these tall, strong lilies in our gardens, but this year we were thrilled to discover new dwarf varieties.

RELATED: So many new gardeners – hopefully a new trend

Not only do these hybrids have the same thick strong stems as their taller counterparts, and larger blooms, but they require no support whatsoever and the colours are stunning.

Two of the best we have ever seen are Summer Sky, a lovely deep pink with subtle yellow and white markings; and Summer Snow, with her huge white flowers that make other nearby plants just pop.

The Asiatic lilies have a nice big collection of dwarf varieties – this year we are loving Tiny Epic – with its very dramatic purple eye pattern.

In the spectrum of Oriental lilies, the best dwarf during the past two years has been Garden Party – a big white flower with red and yellow markings.

Whether planting tall or short lilies, just remember that they enjoy well-drained soil and lots of sunshine.

Be sure to feed them a well-balanced, slow-release fertilizer in late April – when they are about three to four feet tall; and then feed again with a high phosphorus fertilizer (something like a 3-15-6) when they are in bloom.

READ MORE: Prescribing a little gardening therapy

This will help to replenish the bulb in order to produce even more flowers next year. When blooms are finished, just cut off the spent flowers at the top and allow the rest of the foliage to turn brown naturally – this also feeds the bulbs.

You can also grow in containers but be sure to have lots of perlite in the potting mix for drainage as they do not like to sit in a lot of moisture through the winter.

Lilies are so easy and can give years of enjoyment throughout the summer – just plant the right varieties for your space.

And that’s just the landscape. There is a rich history here, too, from the Indigenous peoples whose stories, traditions, and stewardship of the land span millennia, to the ranchers, gold prospectors, and adventurers who braved unknown wilderness to traverse rough terrain and uncharted waterways.

Challenge yourself to try something new and experience some of BC’s history this summer through guest ranch stays, cultural tours, museum visits, guided trips into the backcountry, and more.

Drive Through Historic Gold Rush Country

Follow in the footsteps of 1860s Gold Rush prospectors and see how the mighty Fraser River shaped life in these parts. From Kamloops, head west toward Lillooet and “Mile 0” of the historic Cariboo Wagon Road. Visit sites ranging from preserved road houses to ghost towns and connect with locals in small towns along the way. Travel as far as Barkerville Historic Town, which brings this era to life with a restored townsite and costumed interpreters, and en route discover a vital Indigenous culture that dates back thousands of years.

The quintessential guest ranch experience awaits in the Cariboo and Chilcotin. Blake Jorgenson photo.

Stay at a Guest Ranch

If you’ve dreamed of long trail rides through peaceful pastures or into meadows bursting with wildflowers, consider a stay at one of BC’s many guest ranches, most of which are found in the Cariboo and Chilcotin. The quintessential guest ranch experience is, of course, riding the range, but when you need a break from the saddle, the possibilities are many. Whether you’re looking for a true cowboy experience (think: corralling livestock or mucking out stalls) or something a little less rugged (a day at the onsite spa, anyone?), you’ll find freedom and adventure in the wide-open spaces.

Cast a line in calm lakes and fast-moving rivers, hike into the mountains for expansive views, or stick close to the ranch – and to the cowboy theme – with wagon rides, lasso throwing, and, of course, tall tales around a campfire under a clear, starry sky.

Find Adventure in the Wild

With wide-open spaces come wide-open opportunities for adventure. The lakes and rivers of BC’s interior beckon with more places to fish than you can experience in a lifetime. There are calm waters for paddling – including multi-day wilderness canoe routes – and there are stretches of thrilling whitewater for adrenaline junkies. You can fly into the backcountry for some hardcore hiking and mountain biking from an alpine basecamp or saddle up for an off-the-grid horse-packing trip. Whichever option you choose, keep your camera close as you’re very likely to spot some of BC’s four-legged residents along the way.

Two local teenagers are hoping to show their support to kids at Langley Memorial Hospital by putting their creativity to work this summer.

Alice He and Amy Yim will be entering Grade 12 at R.E. Mountain Secondary this fall, but before their senior year they plan to make a delivery of handmade felt toys to the kids at the local hospital to spread some cheer.

“Our goal is to encourage children by showing them that we care about them, and are here to support them,” said He.

The pair of 17-year-old teens have started an Instagram page called “feltstuffies” where they display their creations and provide tutorials for others.

The felt creations range from animals like a pig, whale and an owl or food-shaped ‘stuffies’ like a donut or watermelon slice.

He says it can take up to 30 minutes for her to complete a simple pattern or up to 45 minutes to complete something more challenging.

“We encourage everyone to use their creativity,” she said.

He gets most of her inspiration by drawing out patterns and browsing Pinterest.

The teens hope other students connect with them during the summer to contribute handmade felt toys to the delivery scheduled for September.

Each felt toy must be individually wrapped. For more information visit the pair’s Instagram page at instagram.com/feltstuffies.

In a July 10 press release, the Fraser Valley Heritage Railway Society (FVHRS) announced they will remain closed for the next month and a half.

“The board has decided not to open to the public during July and August this year, due to the uncertainty surrounding the increased activity under level 3 of the RestartBC protocols,” wrote FVHRS board chair John Sprung. He noted many of the society’s volunteers fall into the highest risk category for COVID-19.

Sprung said they’ll reassess their options in mid-August and decide then whether they’ll open up Cloverdale Station in September.

“Our priority throughout this challenging time is to provide a safe environment for our volunteers and the public,” Sprung said. “The Fraser Valley Heritage Rail Society will continue to provide a rich and entertaining heritage experience and plan for the future as part of B.C.’s railway heritage.”

Sprung explained the FVHRS will continue internal functions during the summer, such as continuing restoration work on BCER 1231 and on the Clayburn mine carts and locomotive. They will also keep up on rolling stock maintenance and upgrading the building and grounds. Previously scheduled operator training will also continue.

Sprung added the FVHRS will celebrate its 20th anniversary in 2021.

“We look forward to welcoming you back to continue with us on the heritage railway journey through time.”

Calling it a milestone for the heritage railway society, Sprung said celebratory events are being planned for weekends throughout the 2021 season.

“Much has been accomplished since 2001 when we started. There is a great deal more to look forward to as we move forward and complete the vision.”

(Langley Advance Times file)

Willowbrook Walking Club members are, once again, making their early morning circuit of the Langley shopping centre.

Shut down because of the pandemic, the club has reopened with restrictions to maintain social distancing by requiring walkers to stay at least six feet apart.

Club coordinator Dixie Platt said since most club members walk by themselves anyway, it isn’t a hard rule to enforce.

After a three-month shutdown, walking was allowed to resume late last month, said Platt, a Langley City resident who has been walking at Willowbrook for 11 years.

READ ALSO: On track for fitness

Most people in the club appear to have returned, with the number of people exercising ranging from 10 to 15 a day, Platt estimated.

She didn’t notice any new faces from the other indoor walk tracks in Langley that remain closed.

“A lot of people walk outside, now that the weather is better,” she surmised.

In May, most of the businesses at Willowbrook reopened under provincial phased-recovery guidelines, with some operating under reduced hours or open only select days of the week.

Willowbrook Shopping Centre is located at 19705 Fraser Hwy., and walkers can register with the club by phoning 604-530-4492. or visiting the concierge desk. It costs $10 a year.

Three other Langley locations that were offering indoor walking before the novel coronavirus forced widespread shutdowns remain closed.

At the Langley Events Centre, the walking track remains closed, according to the facility website.

All Township recreation centres, arenas, pools, fitness centres, gyms, meeting rooms, and the Langley Centennial Museum are still closed, the municipal website states, including the walking track at the Aldergrove Credit Union Community Centre.

READ ALSO: Langley City re-opens Monday to limited weight room and fitness classes

While Langley City has announced it was re-opening some fitness facilities at the Timms Centre effective Monday, July 13, it required pre-booking and did not appear to include the walking track.

While the weight room will be open to users, and indoor fitness classes will resume, people must pre-register in advance for classes and time slots. No drop-ins are allowed.

Organizer Ken Johnson pulled out of the Highland Village parking lot to lead more than 200 vehicles on a return road trip to Harrison from Langley City on Sunday, July 12 to raise money to help families battle cancer (Dan Ferguson/Langley Advance Times)

Langley City resident John White has been a fan of classic British Jaguar sports cars ever since he was a kid growing up in Epson, England.

On Sunday morning, July 12, White was at the wheel of his gleaming 1997 aquamarine Jaguar convertible, one of more than 200 vehicles that showed up for the third annual Brogan’s Diner Fight Against Cancer Car Show.

While he waited for the starting signal, White explained how he doesn’t ever plan to sell his car, and how restoring it required work on the engine, transmission and suspension, among other things.

“It wasn’t beautiful when I bought it,” White remarked.

This year, thanks to COVID-19, organizers of the annual fundraiser decided against holding a car show in the Highland Plaza mall parking lot where Brogan’s is located, changing it into a four-hour ride from Langley City to Chilliwack and Harrison, and back.

Organizer Ken Johnson had been worrying about the weather, noting people who have gone to great lengths to restore old cars to better-than-mint condition tend not to take them out in the rain.

While there were a few clouds, Sunday was dry and warm, and almost all the convertibles arrived with their tops down.

“It looks like there is a heaven for us,” Johnson smiled.

A total of 225 cars were lined up in the plaza parking lot by the time the cruise got underway, and other cars joined in along the route to boost the total to an estimated 275.

It was the best turnout yet for the event.

“We had a great day,” Johnson told the Langley Advance Times.

Next year, he expects there will be another ride, followed by a car show the following day if the pandemic has lifted.

READ MORE: Ride for cancer in Langley will take place Sunday, despite COVID-19

Cancer is a personal issue for Johnson, whose wife Theresa is a cancer survivor.

He lost one of his best friends to cancer as well, and several other friends are battling the disease.

“We’re trying to help any way we can.”

Money raised by the ride will go to two people battling cancer who were nominated by readers of the car show Facebook page, a five-year-old girl, and a 27-year-old mother of four, both Langley area residents.

In the first year, the car show raised $3,700 that was distributed to three local families.

The second annual Brogan’s Diner Fight Against Cancer Car Show raised $2,900 for the cause.

This year, contributions reached a new record of $6,272, thanks in large part to a $4,000 donation by the “mister Blake Foundation” established by Vancouver-based singer Blake Elliott Jr. (who prefers to go by mister Blake) a former teen pop star who was part of “Mr Blake and the Crestwoods” a Canadian group who took their name from the Richmond telephone exchange name and had a chart-topping hit with their version of “ I Only Want To Be With You.”

“It’s from my music royalties,” Blake elaborated, after arriving in a classic Cadillac convertible to take part in the ride.

He said the foundation has distributed more than $500,000 in donations to various worthy causes over the years, including the Happy Herd farm sanctuary in Aldergrove, Diabetes Canada, CKNW Orphan’s Fund, and AIDS awareness charities, to name a few.

Donations to the Langley campaign can also be made at the GoFundMe page for Brogan’s Fight Against Cancer Car Cruise or by e-transfer.

Langley School District Foundation (LSDF) is offering a selection of garden statues, fountains, outdoor decor, and water features to support their Food For Thought Program and feed hungry Langley Students.

When the coronavirus put a stop to in-person classes, the foundation’s food programs aimed at helping lower income families have snacks and meals had to adapt to new methods.

Susan Carins, executive director of LSDF, said they are spending more the $32,500 every week with a commitment to continue on with the program until September and maybe even beyond.

The foundation is helping out 650 Langley families through the program, offering gift cards to grocery stores such as Save-On-Foods every week.

Cairns said $350 gift cards have been handed out to each family to help them during the summer along with coupons to get farm fresh eggs.

Rotarians recently presented $17,000 to the Langley School District Foundation on behalf of the Aldergrove Rotary Club last month while other donations from community members and sponsors have poured in.

Cairns said the foundation is still in need to meet their goal, hence the sale of outdoor items happening now in a fundraiser called “Statues of Limitation.”

Donated by Western Water Farms, a Langley outdoor pond and supply shop, the array of items for purchase can be found at www.langleyschooldistrictfoundation.com/events.

“Western Water Farms are a regular supporter of ours and they donated $6,000 worth of fountains that are really beautiful,” Cairns said. “They let us come in and choose what we wanted so we had a shopping spree.”

The items were meant to be prizes at the LSDF’s annual golf tournament, but with that event cancelled, Cairns said they decided to hold a summer sale.

Each fountain or ornament is listed at 30 per cent off of wholesale prices and one hundred per cent of the proceeds will be going to the Food For Thought Program.

All products are listed and purchasable online – there are twenty different models to choose from.

“They are high quality and meant for office or residential gardens,” she said. “They are very peaceful and I love them.”

Socially distanced pick up days for the fountains will occur on July 30 and 31 at Glenwood Elementary, 20785 24 Ave.

If people are interested in donating directly to the program, they can do so online at www.langleyschooldistrictfoundation.com on the Food for Thought page.

People can also send cheques to Langley School District Foundation, 4875-222nd Street, Langley, BC V3A 3Z7.

Para Space Landscaping spent a day fixing up the yard of nurse Nizbeth Ali as part of its contest to honour frontline workers. (Para Space Landscaping/Special to the Langley Advance Times)

Nizbeth Ali is a Langley Memorial Hospital nurse who is also homeschooling her children.

Life during a pandemic isn’t leaving her much time to worry about the yard.

Burnaby-based Para Space Landscaping recently stepped up to help her and six other frontline families with their yard work.

“They did an amazing work putting new grass on my front lawn, cleaned up my front garden and added edging to it. They also pruned trees around the house that needed it. It took them about eight hours or so,” the Willoughby resident said.

The company announced the contest recently on social media as its way to help frontline workers.

“I was very excited to have the chance to work on this project,” said project manager Emerson Dico-Jekot. “With the recent demands and expectations for all types of frontline workers, many of us on the team felt the need to give back in any way we could. Since landscaping can be quite demanding physically, as well as a large time commitment, we thought it would be a great area to provide relief to those dedicated frontline workers.”

Para Space allowed friends and family to nominate frontline workers.

“We reached out to everybody who was nominated,” explained Para’s marketing coordinator Catherine Deacon.

Of the nominees, seven were able to work with Para Space to have the free work completed.

“Their kind gesture is much appreciated and it definitely made me feel appreciated of what I do as a nurse,” Ali said.

Most of the projects were able to be completed in one day and ranged in size right up to full-yard spruce ups. They wrangled unruly shrubbery, cleaned up weeds, pruned trees and bushes, and helped provide peaceful greenspace for the frontline workers.

“The smallest one we did was somebody’s deck,” she said.

The company spent between $750 and $1,000 on materials.

“It made a huge difference as I had been wanting to work on my yard but never got the time since my husband and I both work full time and trying to homeschool my eldest along with my youngest,” Ali said. “They were both home since March as we were not sending them them to daycare or to grandparents for babysitting due to my high risk work since I work at the hospital. They simply made things a little easier by alleviating some stress of not being being able to maintain our yard.”

Legion president Doug Hadley handed over a $1,000 cheque to Parkside elementary principal Lynn Fairley on school grounds the morning of Tuesday, July 7. (Special to the Aldergrove Star)

Aldergrove legion is helping Parkside elementary school expand its literacy program so that students in all grades, not just primary, can receive books to take home come September.

Legion president Doug Hadley handed over a $1,000 cheque to Parkside principal, Lynn Fairley, on school grounds Tuesday morning.

“If a child can read, they can do anything,” emphasized Fairley, who spoke of the program which aims to tackle illiteracy and empower students at home.

“When I arrived almost four years ago as vice-principal for Parkside, I began to collect data on reading levels for students,” Fairley retold.

“The data was a little alarming with 70 per cent of students yet to meet grade-level expectations by Grade 3.”

In years since, Parkside has ramped up its Home Reading program, which sees free books go home with students and read with parents as homework.

The school’s goal is to see Parkside’s Grade 5 students graduate while meeting grade-level reading expectations.

Illiteracy in Aldergrove might come as a surprise for many, Fairley acknowledged.

“We have a fair number of illiterate families. In fact it’s generational in some of our student groups,” she said.

“But we want parents to start to read too with their child, and feel successful.”

Money donated by the legion will be used to kickstart the creation of book bins for intermediate students – in Grades 4 and 5 – to grab good reads from.

“We have some home reading books for our primary students (approximately 300 children) which are quite old,” continued Fairley.

Unfortunately, some books do not get returned back to the school.

“But we do not have any home reading books for intermediate students to take home,” the principal said, in regards to approximately 200 students at Parkside.

The intermediate book bins were slated to get built during spring break but the COVID-19 pandemic halted the program’s expansion.

Books exchanging hands was a potential carrier of the virus, Fairley said.

Now the goal for Grades 4 and 5 to be taking home books is September, when a new school year begins.

Home reading sees families spend 20 to 30 of quality reading time together each night, Fairley said.

In addition to the program, during the regular school year, Parkside parents come into their child’s class and volunteer to read with students.

“Our goal for our students is to be literate so that they feel empowered to achieve anything they set their minds to,” Fairley committed.

Longtime Langley resident William “Bill” Cutress passed away on July 2 at the age of 100.

Born in Calgary, Alta, Cutress served in the Royal Canadian Navy for the duration of the Second World War, working on mine sweepers on the Atlantic Ocean.

He later moved to Burnaby, eventually moving to Langley with his second wife Molly Hill-Tout and joining Aldergrove Legion Branch 265.

Cutress celebrated his 100th birthday on May 8th amid COVID-19 restrictions, but was treated to a celebration outside of his balcony at Harrison Landing.

Dressed in his legion uniform, members of the Aldergrove branch presented Cutress with a 75 year pin alongside a drummer and piper.

More than 15 well-wishers gathered to sing Happy Birthday to the centenarian from across the facility’s fence.

According to his obituary, Cutress was active in the legion, the chiefs and petty officers, the oldsmobile club, and the Vancouver Maritime Museum.

He is survived by three daughters, two step-daughters, one son, six grandchildren, and eight great-grandchildren.

Daughter Linda Dunaway said the Aldergrove legion lowered their flag to half mast upon hearing of Cutress’s passing.

A Celebration of Life will be planned and announced at a later date.

Big Brothers Big Sisters Langley is holding a Survivor-themed fundraiser online. (Big Brothers Big Sisters Langley/Special to the Langley Advance Times)

Outwit? Outlast? Outplay? Not when it comes to Big Brothers Big Sisters of Langley’s rendition of Survivor.

Instead, participants can sip, support, and survive in a virtual fundraiser to raise proceeds for local children and youth.

Mackenzie Gaytmenn, communications coordinator with Big Brothers Big Sisters of Langley, said the agency has certainly seen a financial decline as a result of the pandemic.

“We recently made the difficult decision to cancel our Golf For Kids Sake tournament, which is our largest fundraising event of the year,” Gaytmenn said. “While we are disappointed that we will not be able to host everyone out on the course this year, we still wanted to offer an opportunity for our supporters to put together a team, have some fun, and support a great cause.”

Inspired by the popular reality show, teams of four are invited to test their luck over the course of 10 days to win the grand prize – a BC Liquor Store Gift Card (or equivalent cash value) depending on the number of teams participating.

Second place prize are growlers and fills from four local breweries, brewery swag, and dinner vouchers for an entire team.

Third place prize is a Dead Frog Brewery tasting tour and four free admissions to Langley Exit Room.

Each day, names will be drawn at random and these participants are then eliminated from the competition.

Teams are not eliminated until every team member has been drawn and removed from the running.

“Immunity Idols“ are available for purchase with registration – a $50 redeemable chance to get back in the game.

A team’s immunity idol can be redeemed only once in the competition when a team member is eliminated in the draw.

The team captain must confirm with Big Brother’s Big Sisters when they would like to redeem the immunity idol.

The contact-free fundraiser is being held virtually due to COVID-19, but programs facilitate through Big Brothers Big Sisters are continuing in different capacities.

Matches are currently not able to see each other in person, but mentors are still engaging virtually in order to provide support and friendship for children.

The 11th annual Langley Eats Local event will celebrate the abundance of food and produce from the Lower Mainland with a lineup of local vendors and activities for the whole family.

Amanda Smith, agriculture program coordinator with Langley Environmental Partners Society (LEPS), said people can explore the diversity of what is produced in Langley and nearby, from vegetables to breads, cheeses, berries, wines and more.

“This year, LEPS has planned a whole month of eating local, starting with the kickoff, a take-home dinner and a movie event on July 30, and activities wrapping up by August 27,” Smith said.

Back again is the Eat Local Challenge to take place August 9 to 15, and the Farm Gate Passport Program.

“Participants in the challenge pledge to source as much of their food as possible from local producers for one week, and can use the passport for added inspiration,” she added.

READ MORE: Langley Eats Local challenge wraps up with the help of local farmers

If committing to eating local for seven days seems too much, this year’s passport will feature 15 local farms and businesses and will take place the entire four weeks of the event.

“You may find yourself visiting your local turkey farm, and possibly grabbing some cider while enjoying your staycation this summer,” Smith advised.

LEPS peppered the next month with mini events;

• the kickoff take-home dinner and a movie with Chef Adrian Beaty and the Fraser Valley Cider Company on July 30

• a historic, socially-distanced lunch gathering at the Michaud House

• a surprise video feature in celebration of the Blackberry Bake off Cookbook launch

“Join us to celebrate our local farmers and food producers who care for this delicious array of ingredients, from the fields of Langley to your plate,” Smith added.

To sign up for the Eat Local Challenge, passport pick up locations, or questions, people can contact agriculture@leps.bc.ca or call 604-546-0337.

Langley City shared news that is sitting well with some local fitness fan.

Starting Monday, limited services are returning to Timms Community Centre.

The centre was shut down to the public, among other recreational and community facilities, back in March due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Now, as the province begins to re-open in Phase 3 of the Restart BC plan, the city is looking at ways to re-open some of its operations, including its recreational amenities, said Mayor Val van den Broek.

Next week, that will mean restricted access and limited programming will be provided within the centre’s weight room and indoor fitness classes, the mayor announced.

“The City of Langley looks forward to welcoming the public back to some of our facilities in a progressive manner, which will include a multi-phased approach,” van den Broek said.

RELATED: Tennis courts, bike parks set to re-open in Langley City

Timms Community Centre and the nearby Douglas Recreation Centre will remain closed to the public, she emphasized.

There are still no drop-ins allowed.

However, the weight room will be open to users and indoor fitness classes will resume. But, people must pre-register in advance for classes and time slots.

Participants may register online through the City’s reconnect platform or by calling Timms Community Centre at 604-514-2940, or Douglas Recreation Centre at 604-514-2865.

To review the weekly fitness schedule, people can also visit langleycity.ca.

“Langley City council will be considering re-opening more services and programs for residents to enjoy, and the City asks for your patience and understanding as we work to implement changes gradually and cautiously in order to prevent further spread of COVID-19 virus,” van den Broek said.

For access to these specific services, Timms Community Centre will be accessible through the north entry only.

For the most up-to-date information, residents are encouraged to visit the municipal website regularly at langleycity.ca/COVID-19, follow Langley City on social media (Facebook and Twitter) for updates.

Langley was one of several sites across Canada where elite runners competed in the Virtual 10K. Now other Canadians have a chance to see how they would do in the Beat the Champ contest. (Justin Kent Tweet)

Championship distance runners took to the pavement for virtual 10 kilometres runs along the Fraser River in North Langley and Abbotsford to mark the nation’s birthday.

Virtual races by elite athletes took place in communities across Canada in a special event organized by Run Ottawa. COVID-19 has resulted in the cancellation of sports competitions.

“COVID’s certainly been tough, we all miss competing a lot but the virtual 10k champs were a fun opportunity to be competitive in a socially distance appropriate manner,” said Rachel Cliff.

Now that the elite athletes have had their turn, Run Ottawa would like other Canadians to lace up in the Beat the Champ competition. This open competition invites runners to beat the 2020 Canadian 10K Champions’ times: Justin Kent with 28:52 (for the men) and Natasha Wodak with 32:41 (in the women’s run).

The women’s winner was Surrey-born Wodak who ran in North Langley and Abbotsford on July 1. She won the 2020 IAAF World Championships in the 10,000 metre race in January and the same distance race at the 2019 Pan Am Games in Peru.

Also running in Langley was Rachel Cliff who came in second among the women taking part. She’s ranked 30th in the world in the women’s 10,000k and is on the national team.

She was pleased to be able to run competitively.

“My last competitive race was the Houston half marathon back in January,” she explained.

The runners are no strangers to Langley streets.

“We ran along the river in Langley, because it’s a nice flat course with minimal traffic. I typically focus on the marathon… and my coach holds some of our long workouts in Langley – nice open roads that are ideal for locking into a pace. You can go for miles uninterrupted: we don’t have much like that in Vancouver,” she said.

Justin Kent was another nationally ranked athlete who took the top spot in the 2019 Vancouver Sun Run and decided to do his run along the banks of the Fraser River through Langley.

”A privilege to be able to ‘race’ during these times,” he posted after achieving a personal best time, despite the slippery wet road conditions.

Word that a phased-in return to play has been approved was welcome news for the Langley Rugby Club, which, like all rugby organizations in B.C., has been idled by the coronovirus pandemic and the need to maintain social distancing.

On Tuesday, July 7, BC Rugby, the provincial governing body of the sport, released their ‘Return to Rugby’ plan and announced existing restrictions would be eased, very slightly.

There are five phases to the plan, with phase two launching with the roll-out of the plan.

Maximum rugby gatherings will go from 10 to 50 people, and total time allowed at rugby events will be extended from 45 to 60 minutes.

Inter-club or contact activities are still banned, and physical distancing of two metres must be maintained at all times, with rugby balls as the only permitted shared equipment.

The next phase, expected to begin in September, would see some “small-sided, non-contact games” within clubs and additional shared equipment, the announcement detailed.

Players would be allowed “brief, limited breaches” of social distancing, getting within one metre of each other.

Regular full-contact play is not expected until there is an effective treatment or vaccine for COVID-19.

“Rugby is coming back but it’s up to all of us to make sure it’s brought back in a safe and responsible manner,” said BC Rugby CEO Annabel Kehoe.

“While we won’t be returning to full-contact rugby for the foreseeable future, we’re excited to support clubs delivering modified training before progressing to non-contact rugby, like touch and flag rugby.”

Langley Rugby Club chair Brian Anderson said the club will be reviewing and implementing the new rules.

““It might not be the sport as we know it,”” Anderson told the Langley Advance Times, noting the restrictions on full-contact are a big change for a sport known for its physicality.

Older players, especially, may find it hard to break full-contact habits, so Anderson expects the initial return to the field will probably involve younger players.

“We’ll focus on player development at the younger ages, because they’ll probably respect social distancing,” Anderson commented.

He doubts there will be any kind of competition against other clubs in 2020.

“We won’t be playing this year,” Anderson predicted.

“That was my gut feeling.”

He was optimistic about the long-term prospects of the non-profit club, which celebrated it’s 50th anniversary last year.

“We’ll make it through, but there will be some skinny times,” Anderson commented.

Unlike many clubs, Langley Rugby happens to own it’s own playing field, at 21280 Crush Crescent, unlike other clubs which have to pay to play.

“We are fortunate that we own our own grounds.”

Since the Langley Rugby Club was founded in 1969 , it went on to purchase and develop the playing field that has been the club home for almost 30 years.

Before the pandemic hit, the club ran several teams including minis (5 years and up), junior boys and girls, women, and two squads of senior men.

Over the years, Langley Rugby Club has won several league and provincial championships and many Langley Rugby players have gone on to play for regional, provincial and national teams.

The club motto is “Respect All, Fear None, Expect Victory.”

Under the BC Rugby plan, clubs will be required to complete the World Rugby COVID-19 courses and appoint one or more COVID-19 Safety Coordinators.

Until further notice, BC Rugby will require participants in any in-person rugby session to complete an attestation that they do not have COVID-19 and have not been in contact with a confirmed or possible case within the previous 14 days.

Formally known as the British Columbia Rugby Union, BC Rugby is the governing body for the sport in British Columbia and represents over 7,500 individuals in 60 member clubs and associations in the province.

Instead, on Sunday afternoon, July 5, Jay was viewing the action from the parking lot behind the outfield, and regretting leaving his binoculars at home.

“I’ve had my bum parked on that bench 25 feet away from the action many times,” Jay recalled, smiling, describing the parking lot viewpoint as “the cheap seats.”

It was one of the first practices by the team since the novel coronovirus forced a lockdown of most sports, and it took place under restrictions that kept fans out of the stands and the players well separated.

It was an opportunity to show their stuff to a Team Canada scout, who spent much of the workout positioned behind the mesh netting of the batting cage, looking to add some talent to the national team.

Pierce, who plays for the Junior Blaze, was called up to the senior team for the event, his father recounted.

“He got the call a couple of days ago.”

Pierce is aiming to follow in the footsteps of his stepbrother, Jon Bauer, a Blaze pitcher who parlayed his athletic talents into a “full-on scholarship” to a U.S. university, Jay explained.

“[Jon] was never drafted [by a major league team] but he got an education out of it,” Radke remarked.

On the field, Blaze general manager Doug Mathieson was pleasantly surprised by the players’ commitment to maintaining a safe distance.

“I thought it would be like herding cats,” Mathieson told a Langley Advance Times reporter.

Mathieson is hoping the team will be able to open up their practice sessions a little more in the near future, possibly in about a week, but that will depend on what the health authorities say.

While there won’t be a traditional ball season, the club may continue summer session until August, instead of the traditional July stoppage.

“If we get the green light, we’ll play exhibition game schedules,” he added. “If we further get a green light, we’ll probably do some September tournaments but that’s all speculation at this point. We’re just going day by day and see what we can do.”

More sports have resumed in the U.S. which is seeing record virus spread.

“We don’t need that,” Mathieson commented.

Langley Blaze is willing to wait for the health of players, coaches, and families.

While there won’t be a traditional ball season, the club may continue summer session until August, instead of the traditional July stoppage.

If they get the green light, the Blaze will play an exhibition game schedules, Mathieson added.

This leaves little time to prepare for the health and safety of our neighbourhood especially the vulnerable school children.

Now the 216th Street Corridor Study has closed, what are the plans and when will they be implemented? I remind you that (per the Ministry of Transport) this interchange is the only example of its kind in all of Metro Vancouver – that being a freeway interchange funneling into a peaceful family neighbourhood. I would appreciate a timeline re: the plans to ensure safety.

• READ MORE: Fort Langley association tries to get trucks out of the village

As you know the ministry will be installing signage on Highway 1 to ensure only local trucks can use 216th Street North. Is there a plan in place to ensure bylaw officers ticket any offending trucks? I believe it is very important to set the tone at the opening. Please advise?

School will be reopening soon. Therefore what plans are in place to ensure the children are safe at L’ Ecole de Voyageurs and Topham Elementary? (As you know the posted speed is presently 50 km). Speed abatement like North Otter which as you know is also an arterial road? Crossing guards? Many municipalities have paid uniformed staff for this purpose. Please advise.

What plans are in place to stop traffic shortcutting through Forest Hills subdivision? Will there be speed humps by the park on 86 A Avenue? Crosswalks? Please advise.

This needs to be in place before Aug 31.

I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible. People in our community are concerned. As you are aware a family dog was struck and killed on this road. As well, a little girl on a bicycle was nearly hit by a car. It was a very close call and there was vehicle damage. These two happened some time ago with regular traffic. Let these two disturbing events serve as a warning.

Keep our children safe.

Linda Nash, 30 year resident Forest Hills

Heinz Patzke, 85, and his wife, Sheila, in their younger years. Sheila is now a resident of Langley Lodge but Heinz express upset with a recent incident. (Patzke family/Special to the Langley Advance Times)

Dear Editor,

[Re: Man says wife assaulted at lodge, July 2, Langley Advance Times]

In response to several statements that were written in the story, Langley Lodge is not “at odds” with Mr. Heinz Patzke.

The term “assault” used in the story’s headline is factually inaccurate.

There have been regular conversations with Mr. Patzke, Mrs. Patzke, and care managers during our outbreak.

Our conversations have always been reasonable in nature and respectful by all.

We have been supportive of the situation that Mr. Patzke and his wife have found themselves in.

Unfortunately pandemic restrictions are the cause of temporary delays in implementing options that are acceptable to Mr. and Mrs. Patzke.

Individuals who are living with dementia live in all home areas of Langley Lodge, and it is not realistic that there will be a unit where Mrs. Patzke can “get away” from people with dementia.

RELATED: Langley Lodge’s deadly outbreak declared over

Many residents in long-term care homes have dementia, a broad term for a range of neurological disorders affecting memory and cognitive function.

I shudder at the term “senile” applied by Mr. Patzke in reference to the respected elders who reside on the fourth (and other) floors. The term is no longer commonly used, due to the implied negative connotation about persons, particularly seniors, who suffer from a diagnosis of dementia.

The Patzkes situation is a human story of hardship and compassion for a couple who have been separated by COVID-19 since early March.

RELATED – PHOTOS: Frontline crew at Langley Lodge thanked with songs and soup

It has been a long time in isolation for all of our residents, without the opportunity to see their loved ones.

There have been personal and emotional sacrifices required by our residents during this period of social isolation.

Now that our outbreak is over, and visitation will start in July, there is hope for the Patzke’s and other families to re-connect with their loved ones.

Efforts are underway to get this started in Langley Lodge as soon as possible.

Dr. Henry advises us to “be kind”, and remember that we are all in this together.

Debra Hauptman, chief executive officer, Langley Lodge

Langley Township has unveiled the expected cost-per-household required to hit local carbon dioxide reduction targets during the next 20 years – $130 per year.

That’s a pretty decent price.

I’m not saying that it isn’t a decent chunk of change. As an increase in property taxes, it would be a fair bit. But if you’d like to think of it in a different way, it’s about 35.6 Starbucks grande lattes, or 5.7 medium pizzas a year.

Better yet, consider the cost of not acting.

The upfront cost of fire insurance and car insurance and home insurance is a lot, too, but you don’t see anyone sensible suggesting that you should go without them.

So let’s consider the costs of doing nothing about climate change.

How much would it cost the Township if the Fraser River overtopped the dikes around Glen Valley and Fort Langley and flooded low-lying areas?

I’m pretty sure that repairs to roads, sewers, water mains, bridges, and other vital infrastructure would cost a pretty penny. Not to mention the cost of evacuating everyone from Fort Langley – which was an island during the 1948 floods.

How about the cost to Langley farmers in agricultural failures if the weather becomes ever more unpredictable?

What will it cost rural landowners if parching summers cause excessive draw on local aquifers and wells run dry?

Some of those costs would fall to the Township, and thus be borne by every taxpayer. Others costs would fall harder on individual property owners.

Climate change mitigation is an insurance policy. We’re already seeing the impacts of climate change, and we’ll keep seeing them. But if we and our neighbours, our provinces, our federal government, and our fellow nations work together, we can save a lot of money.

It’s save now, or spend tomorrow.

An Angus Reid poll in June showed that 59 per cent of Canadians were in favour of some variation on a basic income.

A Parliamentary Budget Office (PBO) study released this week showed that the cost of a basic income of $16,689 per year ($24,027 for couples) would cost Canada between $47.5 and $98 billion for the last six months of the fiscal year.

And of course, a lot of us have now had experience with an emergency basic income – a huge number of households have at least one member who’s been on the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB).

A basic income would be a huge change for millions of Canadians. Right now, welfare and disability cheques in most provinces are pathetically low – $760 in B.C.

A basic income of $1,500 to $2,000 would change people’s lives dramatically. It would ease fear, provide stability, allow for people to plan for the future.

It would also very likely force a long-overdue reckoning.

There’s dignity in providing for your family. There’s dignity in working hard so your kids will have a better life than you had.

But there’s no dignity in working two or three jobs to just barely keep treading water. There’s no dignity in taking any job, even one you hate, because the alternative is eviction, a missed payment on the power bill, or a trip to the food bank.

There are a great many jobs in our society that don’t provide enough income, or enough hours, to give people the basics. People take those jobs because they need the money, because welfare and other support programs are usually much, much worse.

I’m going to keep saying this over and over again – if people only want to work for you because the alternative is poverty and unemployment, you might have a bad workplace.

What if there wasn’t a need for people to take any job? What if UBI was better, and they could just… not?

Well, a lot of employers would have to re-think how they run their businesses. They might have to offer more money, longer shifts, better schedules to attract workers.

“But what if they don’t work at all?” you might say.

Okay. Fine. Sounds good to me. If the options are “everyone gets a dignified life and some choose not to work” or “many, many people are terrified of losing their jobs” I’ll take option A.

But I don’t think most people would choose to do nothing.

Personally, I think we’d unleash a lot of potential for better things. For parents to spend more time with their kids rather than rushing back to careers. For seniors to enjoy retirement a few years earlier. For people to go back to school, to learn new trades, without piling up debt that can take decades to pay off, and to start businesses of their own.

An economy that provides dignity for everyone is better than one based on fear.

Dear Editor,

Recently, I went out to Campbell Valley Park for a walk and some fresh air.

First, I would like to commend the park on its COVID-19 precautions – lots of signage, one-way paths, etc.

While crossing the bridge at the end of the park near 16th Avenue (which is one-way) I encountered a group, which I would assume were grandparents and their grandchildren coming towards me.

I kindly pointed out to them that they were going the wrong way and the response was, “We know. We have a favourite place to feed the birds.”

• READ MORE ON COVID-19: Langley woman asks if society can hit the reset switch

I left it at that but thought what makes some people think they are so entitled not to follow the rules and how do they expect their grandchildren to grow up to respect others when they see this behaviour?

By the way, there is no way to accidentally go the wrong way as there are big signs and a barricade blocking the way.

Be kind, be calm, be safe.

Dear Editor,

Why did the government cut funding to 16 independent distributed learning (IDL) schools, educating 12,000 to 15,000 students.

For the last eight years IDL schools have received 63 per cent of the funding allocated to their public distributed learning counterparts. This funding cut for IDL schools was passed by cabinet and not debated or approved by the legislature.

Independent distributed learning schools – and independent schools in general – are an integral part of British Columbia’s education system.

These funding cuts affect some of the most vulnerable students with mental, physical, or emotional challenges.

John Horgan and the NDP had no plans to reduce funding for independent schools before last election, yet cut the funding anyway. He broke his promise.

With regard to the article in the Langley Advance Times of Thursday, July 2 [Fort Langley principal apologizes as blackface picture re-surfaces 13 years later], I did want to express my thoughts regarding the whole issue of ‘blackface’ which occurred more than a decade ago.

I think it is unreasonable and unfair for people to stand here now and look through the lens of 2020, and criticize someone for something which was done 14 years earlier when no one gave the behaviour a second thought at the time – including many of those who are now wagging their finger in disapproval.

Anyone who was a mature adult in 2006 knows that times were different then, with very little feedback coming from minority groups about how they felt by some of the things which were being done at that time.

Many of the things that Caucasians did were not done with malicious intent. Had we known that what we were doing was hurtful and demeaning, I believe that we would not have continued to do them.

Why would we think ‘blackface’ was hurtful or demeaning if we, as Caucasians, wouldn’t be hurt by a non-Caucasian doing ‘whiteface’?

Now that Caucasians are aware that certain behaviours or practices are hurtful, criticism is only justified if the behaviour continues going forward.

There are numerous things from history that were not acceptable by today’s standards, whether it was related to ethnicity, male vs. female, or even treatment of children. Many of those issues are gone or there have been improvements. People spoke up. People have been educated.

Let’s move on and work at continuing to improve things for everyone, rather than blame or punish people for behaviour which had been acceptable for the times.

[RE: Controversy over MLAs buying ads in Langley magazine that opposes trans rights, June 30, Langley Advance Times online]

Mr. Wilkinson and members of the Liberal caucus, I was very disappointed by your apology today.

Because you dared to advertise in a Christian publication – that is a reason to apologize?

You have been bullied and you have surrendered.

The LGBTQ community will call us homophobes and accuse us of the very actions they are taking to persecute and bully us for our beliefs and our faith.

And the destruction of our families and our society as we have known it, is happening and we have closed our eyes.

The distraction of COVID, Climate Change, riots, and “racial inequality” are not the real problems we face.

The real problem is a lack of will to stand up for moral values, to love and respect all people equally, and have the courage to stick to our moral values, while loving and respecting those who accuse and persecute us.

UNRELATED LETTER: In troubling times, it’s nice to share the positives

I am not condemning the LGBTQ community nor do I judge or persecute them; they too are my brothers and sisters.

The attacks by the LGBTQ community, and those who have a “progressive” agenda – stealing the minds of our children in our schools; the purposeful and treasonous attacks of extremists both “right” and “left” on our values and religious ideals; and especially the consistent attacks on our families and Family values – are leading to destruction.

The Communist Manifesto states that the communist goal is to destroy the family, the church, and the state.

We are in crisis, and I pray that you will stand up for all our freedoms in this province and not exclude religious people.

That is what your apology today did. That is persecution of those who have Christian, or Jewish, or Hindi or Islam values – which are strong healthy families, which will lead to a strong healthy society.

I hope you have the courage to respond to all the people of British Columbia.

The city will hold a hearing Monday to gather input on seven proposed cannabis retail outlets. (Black Press Media files)

If you want to tell council how you feel about seven proposed cannabis stores, Monday will be your last chance to do so.

The city will hold a hearing Monday to help them decide which four proposals will receive the green light – and which three will be denied. Written submissions are also being accepted, but the deadline closes at noon on Monday.

The city accepted applications for three months this spring, and seven proposals made it through staff’s vetting process.

One application is from the BC Liquor Distribution Branch to operate a government-owned BC Cannabis Store at Highstreet Shopping Centre.

RELATED: Abbotsford looks to charge aspiring legal cannabis sellers large fee to apply to open store

RELATED: Half the pot-shop applications in Abbotsford will be rejected

The other six applications are all private proposals to operate stores. They are:

Honeycomb Cannabis at Meadow Fair Plaza (31940 South Fraser Way) in the Clearbrook neighbourhood.

Meta Cannabis Supply Co. at Clearbrook Town Square (32500 South Fraser Way) in the city centre.

A Little Bud at West Oaks Mall (32700 South Fraser Way) in the city centre.

Sweed Cannabis Store at Sevenoaks Shopping Centre (32900 South Fraser Way) in the city centre.

This is Cannabis at Abbotsford Village Shopping Centre (2070 Sumas Way) at the intersection of Sumas Way and South Fraser Way.

Muse Cannabis Store at Parallel Marketplace (1920 North Parallel Road) in East Abbotsford.

The seven locations are located at seven of 10 sites pre-zoned last year to permit cannabis sales. (One proposal didn’t make it to public input stage because it was for a location not zoned for pot distribution.)

Council has already voted to initially restrict cannabis sales to just four locations.

The public will be able to speak at Monday’s hearing, but can also submit their thoughts in writing to cityclerk@abbotsford.ca, or by mail. All submissions are public records.

Monday’s hearing won’t be a formal public hearing. The city has tasked staff with completing “a full and comprehensive evaluation of the applications” based on criteria already set out. That, along with summaries of the public’s feedback, will be presented to council before it makes a final decision.

Public hearings are being managed to abide by two-metre physical distancing and the 50-person limit on public gatherings. That means that those who speak may not be able to attend the full meeting in person. The meeting can be viewed online, however, at letstalkabbotsford.ca/council-hearing-cannabis.

Sportfishing groups are calling for “respect and consideration” on the Lower Fraser River as a pilot fishery by a local First Nation gets underway.

Semá:th (Sumas) First Nation has been authorized to conduct gill-net fisheries to catch chinook salmon for food, social and ceremonial (FSC) purposes.

Nets will be in the Vedder River from the confluence of the Sumas and Vedder rivers, to the Keith Wilson bridge from now until the end of August.

“We are hopeful that respect and consideration will be evident on the river for all fishers,” according to the news release July 15 from the Fraser River Sport Fish Advisory Committees, B.C. Federation of Drift Fishers, Fraser Valley Salmon Society, and Fraser River Sportfishing Alliance.

The fishers will use eight-inch gill-nets that will be highly visible and marked with buoys.

Anglers, boaters and other river users who spend time the Vedder canal are being asked to be aware of the fishery, and to give the fishing activity a wide berth.

“I think we are in sensitive times when it comes to fishing and fish management,” said Dean Werk, president of the Fraser Valley Salmon Society.

Plummeting numbers of returning Fraser Chinook is creating concerns, he said. At the same time there is a desire to see a harmonious atmosphere maintained on the river with respect shown for this attempt to renew a traditional fishery, he said.

“The future viability of these fish are at stake,” Werk said. “Providing information to the general public in this way we hope will go a long way toward ensuring safety on and off the river.”

The pilot fishery will be monitored and catch results will be provided to DFO and to the Semá:th for their own data-gathering and research.

Semá:th officials are also asking for the co-operation of other river users as they prepare for the fishery, according to a news release from leadership and members.

The pilot project is the chance for the community to renew a fishery in the historic waterway, which is a remnant of Sumas Lake drained in 1924 to create land for agriculture and settlement.

Dwindling salmon stocks, limited fishing openings, and the impacts of the Big Bar landslide all contribute to why this fishery is needed to feed the community and collect data on the resource, they said.

Fishers will use eight-inch gill nets to selectively target chinook to avoid netting any co-migrating salmon from stocks of concern like Cultus or Chilliwack Lake sockeye. Other selective gear such as tangle tooth nets and more might be tested as part of this pilot project.

Hockey Canada has added Mission’s own Gage Goncalves to the roster of their National Junior Team Sport Check Development Camp.

Goncalves and 16 other WHL players will participate in the virtual camp from July 27 to 31.

“Putting on those colours will definitely be a big step for me.” Goncalves said in a July 15 social media post. “I just want to thank my mom and dad … for putting their lives on hold to let me pursue my dream.”

Goncalves had a successful season with the Everett Silvertips in the Western Conference of the WHL’s U.S. Division. He appeared in 60 games and racked up 33 goals and 38 assists.

Goncalves is currently ranked 80th by NHL scouts and is eligible for the 2020 NHL Draft.

The 2020 World Ice Hockey Junior Championships are set to return to host cities Edmonton and Red Deer in December.

The Sumas First Nation is working with the federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) to pilot an eight-inch selective gill-net fishery in the traditional territory of S’olh Temexw at what is currently known as the Sumas/Vedder River in Abbotsford.

The Sumas First Nation is requesting cooperation of recreational and water users in the area to take actions to avoid the gill nets, which will be marked with buoys from now until Aug. 31.

They say that due to declining salmon abundance, limited access to the Fraser River, and the effects of the Big Bar landslide, the harvesting of salmon on the Sumas/Vedder will provide some of the annual needs of the community.

RELATED: Sumas First Nation signs declaration in Abbotsford

Sumas First Nation says the use of larger eight-inch mesh will selectively target chinook salmon while avoiding smaller bodied stocks of concern to pass through such as Chilliwack and Cultus Lake sockeye.

They say that other selective gear such as tangle tooth nets and other methods will be considered as part of this pilot.

The Sumas First Nation leadership and members say they are embracing the opportunity to renew a former fishery that will be conducted in the Sumas/Vedder system, which is a remnant of the Sumas Lake that was drained in 1924.

The harvest will be specifically for food, social, and ceremonial needs of the community – a constitutionally protected right – and to collect necessary data and information on the 2020 status of the terminal salmon run.

The selective fishery will be monitored daily by the Fraser Valley Aboriginal Fisheries Society, which will share the data with Sumas First Nation and DFO.

DFO Conservation and Protection and the RCMP have also been invited to participate and provide presence during the fishery.

One of Chilliwack’s oldest homes is being saved from demolition, and will be moved in August.

The house currently resides at 46239 Hope River Road, on a large property that is scheduled to be developed into a townhouse complex by Chilliwack’s Richlane Builders.

“Richlane said, ‘Well, if someone can move the home, that’s fine and they can have the home for free,” said Heritage Chilliwack Society president Laura Reid. “It just happened to be that the people who are moving the home have a property that’s not far away.”

From where it sits now, the home will be relocated to nearby Riverside Drive, which is just on the other side of the Hope Slough.

“The 110-year-old house has been lifted off its foundation and currently rests on wooden blocks awaiting its move. (Eric J. Welsh/ The Progress)

“The further away, the more cost there is to relocate a home,” Reid noted. “It just happened to work out quite well.”

The house was built in 1910 by Thomas Gibbens, who came west from Saskatchewan in 1907, accompanied by his younger sister Lydia.

According to a historical account written by Reid and posted online at royalhotelchilliwack.com, Gibbens constructed several homes in Chilliwack.

“This grand home contains many of the architectural details found in typical craftsman homes, such as a partially inset /partially projecting front porch, an overhanging second story, square porch columns and balusters, wide overhanging eaves and exposed rafters as well as double hung windows,” Reid wrote.

Gibbens passed away in 1949 at the age of 91, and his niece Edna sold the house soon after.

If you look at it now, the home is sitting on blocks. If you crouch down, you can see clear through to the other side. There is a sign on the door that says, ‘No copper. No tools,’ indicating the house may have been targeted previously by thieves.

Reid hasn’t been able to look inside, but she recalls marveling at the pristine shape of the exterior.

“A sign posted on the front door of the home indicates it’s had unwelcome visitors during the time it’s been vacant. (Eric J. Welsh/ The Progress)

“I’d be really curious to see what kind of details are inside, but before any of this happened, it was a really well-kept home on a beautiful property,” she said.

While this house is being saved, other homes of its kind haven’t been so lucky. Reid guesses only 15 houses in Chilliwack carry the ‘heritage’ designation that keeps them safe from demolition. The Hope River Road home didn’t have that, and if not for the intervention of people wanting it preserved, it could have easily ended up a pile of sticks at the dump.

“It’s totally voluntary for home owners to do that and keep their heritage homes for future generations,” Reid explained. “These homes can’t be replicated today due to the craftsmanship that’s in them and the cost involved in trying to duplicate that. In addition to that, they’re a connection to the people who lived back in 1910, came here from wherever and left their mark on this community.”

Jennifer Kuiken, with husband Eric, has started a petition urging the provincial government to assist with coverage for in vitro fertilization. (Submitted photo)

An Abbotsford woman has started a petition to get in vitro fertilization (IVF) covered – at least in part – by the provincial government.

Jennifer Kuiken said she started the petition due to the prohibitive costs of IVF – around $20,000 each time – for couples who are having difficulty conceiving.

She said she and her husband began trying to conceive a family in 2016, but due to abnormalities with the embryos/fetuses, they have suffered through six miscarriages.

“Recently, we’ve had to explore other avenues in hopes of becoming parents,” Kuiken said.

She said this has had led to them considering private IVF. The couple are both employed, but neither of their extended medical plans nor the provincial Medical Services Plan cover any of the costs.

ALSO READ: In limbo: Leftover embryos challenge clinics, couples

Kuiken’s petition on change.org has so far reached almost 1,800 signatures towards her goal of 2,500.

Her petition states that one in six couples experience difficulties conceiving, and most are not financially able to consider IVF.

“Because of the lack of support from our government, IVF has become big business, and B.C. couples like us are travelling to find access to affordable IFV solutions every day,” the petition states.

Kuiken said the World Health Organization recognizes infertility as a medical condition, and four other provinces – Manitoba, New Brunswick, Ontario and Quebec – offer government support for IVF.

She would like coverage to extend to B.C. and, eventually, all of Canada.

“Not everyone wants to be a parent, but those who do should have access and options available,” Kuiken states.

The province’s police watchdog is investigating after a man was seriously injured in late June after Abbotsford police officers shot him with a “less lethal firearm” and deployed a police dog.

The incident took place around 7:30 p.m. in the evening of June 28. Officers were called to a report of a man with a gun at a home in the 2000 block of West Railway Street, the APD told the Independent Investigations Office (IIO) – the public body tasked with probing police incidents in which someone is seriously hurt.

According to a release from the IIO: “Upon arrival, officers contained the area and engaged with the man. During the interaction, a less lethal firearm and police service dog were deployed, and the man was taken into custody.”

The IIO says the man was taken to hospital, where he was found to have sustained “serious but not life-threatening injuries.”

Anyone with information on the incident is asked to contact the IIO Witness Line at 1-855-446-8477.

The incident came a little more than a month after a second arrest that resulted in the IIO’s involvement. Police had injured a man during a takedown on May 21. The IIO were called into investigate, but in late June declared that it was dropping the matter because he did not suffer “serious harm.” The IIO only investigates incidents resulting in serious harm or death, regardless of wrongdoing. Other complaints or cases of potential wrongdoing are handled by the Office of the Police Complaints Commissioner (OPCC).

Several children had a negative reaction to something at the park. RCMP are investigating. / Carli Emary Facebook Photos

The spay park at the Mission Leisure Centre has been shut down after an incident this morning (July 14) left several children with sore eyes, burning lips and even burns on their face.

Mission Fire Rescue Services and BC Ambulance Services were called to the scene after several children began to cry and complain of a burning pain.

Colleen Draganov was at the park with her children when the incident occurred.

“One of the girls that we were with started crying and she couldn’t open her eyes. Her mouth was stinging and her eyes were stinging. She now has burns on her face.”

A few moments later, Draganov’s daughter began to cry.

“She’s four and she’s crying because her lips are all swollen and red … Then kids just started to come towards us, maybe four or five more.”

They all had similar symptoms.

Draganov called 911 and emergency crews arrived and treated the children.

Carli Emary was also at the park with her two children. Her six-year-old, William, was the first child to begin crying.

“He came out of no where, screaming and covering his eyes. I thought he had been stung by a bee at first, but no, he said ‘it burns, it burns’ and I started to hear other kids screaming,” said Emary.

Staff at the leisure centre offered what assistance they could until the paramedics arrived.

Emary’s son William was taken to hospital, but later released.

“It scared him. He though he was dying at first and then thought he was going blind. I had to calm him down.”

While the cause of the incident is unknown, Emary believes it was pepper spray.

“I got it in my mouth after touching him and I’ve been in a crowd that has been pepper sprayed and it’s the exact same feeling.”

Maureen Sinclair, director of Parks, Recreation and Culture said at this time they do not know what caused the incident.

“The spray park has been closed down at least for the day. Staff are cleaning everything up because it appeared that something was being passed from child to child,” said Sinclair.

“We don’t know what the cause of it was, but we’ll test it and retest it and run it in the morning and make sure everything is OK.”

The Mission RCMP were also called and are investigating.

According to a press release, the Mission RCMP are currently working with the District of Mission to determine the origin of the substance. The District conducted a test of the water shortly after the incident was reported. No irregularities were found in the water, including the chlorine levels. The Mission RCMP Victim Services team has been engaged to reach out to those affected.

“At this point, we can’t confirm what the substance is. We are currently looking at all avenues including engaging our Integrated Forensic Identification Services to identify the substance and it’s origin,” said Corp. Nathan Berze.

The Mission RCMP are requesting that if anyone has any information about this incident, to contact them at 604-826-7161 or report anonymously through Crimestoppers at 1-800-222-8477 (TIPS) or online at SOLVECRIME.CA.

The RCMP has issued a warning about scammers posing as Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) employees.

The con sees a potential victim receiving a phone call from someone claiming to be a representative of the CRA. The caller accuses the victim of owing tax money and applies pressure for immediate payment. If challenged, the caller becomes aggressive and threatens the victim with arrest.

“We are experiencing a rash of such complaints across the Upper Fraser Valley,” said RCMP spokesperson Cpl. Mike Rail. “The thieves are convincing, but we remind everyone that CRA officials do not demand personal information, payment by pre-approved credit card, gift card or threaten arrest over the phone.”

Rail offers simple tips to protect yourself from tax fraud, starting with simply hanging up the phone.

He also recommends speaking to a relative or someone you trust before making any payment. To verify whether an actual CRA agent called you, dial 1-800-959-8281 for individual concerns or 1-800-959-5525 for business-related calls.

By 3 p.m. he had completed the trek 19 times.

Aldergrove resident Kaden Van Buren trekked up and down the Abby Grind 19 times on his 19th birthday Saturday, July 12. He was accompanied throughout the day by trail runners he’d met on previous hikes.

To ring in his 19th birthday Saturday, high school graduate Kaden Van Buren completed the Abbotsford version of the Grouse Grind – 19 times.

The Aldergrove teen started at midnight, to cover more than 68 kilometres of steep ground on the Glen Ryder Trail on his day off work from Newlands Golf Course.

By 3 p.m. Van Buren had trekked up and down the steep face of the Abby Grind for 15 hours straight, cheered on by “Rise and Grinders” he’d met previously on the hike.

To those who know the now-19 year old, the feat was baffling.

Just a year ago Van Buren could barely make it out of bed, let alone manage a continuous ascent and descent of more than 15,000 metres in one go.

RELATED: 96-year-old woman scales B.C. Butte with help of family, friends

Two years ago Van Buren was diagnosed with a form of arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, as well as Crohn’s disease.

His conditions gradually worsened until August 2019, when he found himself immobilized by pain in his joints. He was in and out of doctors’ offices and hospital emergency rooms.

“It hurt to sleep,” he said, mentioning a number of medications he tried to relieve his agony.

Close family friend Teresa Penner admitted she was unsure whether Van Buren was going to make it another year after watching the teen struggle with stairs at the Chief Sepass Theatre, where he photographs for LifeApp community events.

To hike out in nature had become a far-off dream, one Van Buren tried to keep alive as an amateur photographer with more than 29,000 followers on Instagram.

“I couldn’t hike for the longest time. I’d get up and walk shorter walks on flat ground, and take photos from there. But it was still so painful,” he said.

“What kept me going while in crutches was the hope of being able to chase my dream of landscape photography one day,” he shared.

“Hope – that was the biggest thing. To find a passion for something. That kept me going.”

Along Van Buren’s journey back to health, he discovered dual passions for trail running and cycling, too.

It was a combination of treatments that allowed him to get up and move again.

After putting himself on a strict diet and spending hours each day exercising to improve his condition, the teen promised himself if he ever got better he wouldn’t take for granted the ability to run or walk.

A biologic medication, adalimumab, helped him regain his strength to the point of something “freakishly unbelievable,” Penner remarked.

“Once I started feeling a lot better it made me so grateful,” Van Buren said.

“It’s the best feeling ever. I have a new perspective on life after being able to walk around and run freely again. It made me want to push myself and see how far my body can go.”

Van Buren’s next goal is to top the fastest recorded completion of the Abby Grind, which currently stands at 27 minutes (up and down).

So far, Van Buren’s personal record is 29 minutes.

“This weekend or the next I’m going to beat that time,” he said.

Nowadays, with physical exercise, Van Buren only feels slight twinges from the arthritis in his right hip.

Though in comparison to last year, the active teen said “it’s nothing bad.”

The cool, wet weather has done a number on the 2020 corn crop. (Jenna Hauck/Progress file)

The cold and wet weather so far this summer has not been kind to corn growers.

Right now farmers across the Fraser Valley like Ian Sparkes are just waiting for some solid sunshine to help their crops reach peak maturity.

“Farmers have a lot of variables to deal with, but the one thing they can’t control is the weather,” Sparkes said.

He remembers a “good shot of weather” around planting time in his Agassiz and Chilliwack fields but it’s been cold and wet since then.

That meant a late start.

The corn has been ready the last couple of years between July 5 and July 12. But here it is July 14 and the famous Chilliwack corn is still “not filled out enough” for the farmer’s liking to risk picking it.

“We walk through the fields every single day, and the corn looks great. But if I pick it early, it means we leave so much behind.”

Ideal temperature for corn is 32 degrees Celsius, he said, not 10 or 20 degrees. So they’ve been keeping busy in the meantime, picking other crops and getting the signature green and yellow corn barns ready to go in Chilliwack, Abbotsford, Agassiz and Vernon.

He’s got orders and sales pending.

“They want it now!” Sparkes said.

They just keep telling folks, “Another five days…” and hope for some warmer days to come. They have their sights set on July 20 as a target.

“There is lots coming!” he concluded.

The Richmond RCMP is asking for the public’s assistance to help locate a missing 35-year-old man.

Shawn William Johnson was last seen in Chilliwack on June 30, 2020 near the 9000-block of Main Street in the downtown area, according to a July 11 press release.

Johnson is described as a Caucasian male; 35 years old; 180 centimetres tall (5’10”); with a slim build; brown or auburn hair; and blue eyes.

Mounties say Johnson may be driving a Grey 2001 Nissan Altima with a damaged rear window. The licence plate is KA6 O3N.

This the second time a Lower Mainland police detachment has reported Johnson as missing in the last two months. On June 6, 2020, the New Westminster Police sought assistance to find Johnson who had last been seen on June 4 in that city.

At that time, police said Johnson was in need of medication and described him as a “high risk” individual, he was located several days later.

Anyone who sees Johnson is asked to call police. The Chilliwack RCMP detachment number is 604-792-4611.

Less than a week after a large police presence descended upon Ryder Lake, VPD investigators returned to a site near the Eagle Landing shopping centre Saturday, and had an area taped off.

“VPD investigators located an area of interest in relation to the double homicide and were on site searching for evidence,” confirmed Cst. Tania Visintin, a VPD media relations officer. “The search has been completed. There was no risk to the public.”

Dennis Wragg (72) and Paul Tonks (68) were found dead inside a home near Commercial Drive and East 11th in Vancouver, just after midnight last Tuesday.

A light-coloured minivan was connected to the killings and it was found dumped in Chilliwack’s Ryder Lake area. From there the VPD tracked suspect Joseph Holland (43) to a campground in the Village of Harrison Hot Springs.

He was arrested Wednesday night and immediately charged with two counts of murder and one count of attempted murder with a firearm.

A fishing trip helped an Abbotsford man lure in $1 million.

Kenneth Giffen decided to purchase a Lotto 6/49 ticket at the Highways 7 and 9 Esso Gas station near Agassiz while returning home from a fishing trip.

He then found out he won in the June draw while sitting in a car wash on the day before Father’s Day.

“At first, I thought it was only a $1,000 win, but I thought (I saw) a lot of zeros so I checked it again,” he said. “I was pretty anxious while I waited to get out of the car wash. My first thought was my wife and family — I wanted to be able to share the moment with them.”

He let his wife and children know shortly after the big win, but admitted he’s still trying to process the whole situation.

“I’m excited but it hasn’t soaked in,” Giffen said. “It’s really about spending more time with my wife and daughters. It’s the freedom to know it’s going to help with their future.”

So far in 2020, B.C. lottery players have redeemed more than $72 million in winnings from Lotto 6/49.

The victim of Abbotsford’s latest homicide was identified last year in court documents as an alleged “crime boss” who was believed to be smuggling cocaine into Canada from the U.S.

Karmjit “Jazzy” Sran, 43, was shot dead Friday night at around 8 p.m. in the 2700 block of Lucern Crescent in Abbotsford.

The Integrated Homicide Investigation Team (IHIT) released his name Sunday night, and said Sran was known to police and that the shooting had “all the hallmarks of a targeted hit.”

The Abbotsford News reported in July 2019 that Sran had applied to the courts to be released from prison while he awaited a hearing on whether he should be extradited to the U.S. to face charges there for conspiracy to traffic in cocaine.

Sran had been in prison since April 24, 2019, but the courts denied him interim release the following month. There are no court documents indicating when, or why, he was later released from prison.

RELATED: Alleged Abbotsford crime boss loses bid for jail release while awaiting extradition hearing

Sran was arrested following an undercover investigation that started after a truck driver was arrested in November 2013 at the Sumas, Wash. border crossing when 19 kilograms of cocaine was found in his vehicle.

That man, who later became a cooperating witness with U.S. investigators, stated that he had intended to smuggle the drugs into Canada. The truck driver said he was working for two organizations, one of which had a boss he knew as “Jazzy,” the ruling states.

Sran, who worked in the construction industry, went by the names Jazzy or Jessi.

The witness offered to introduce Jazzy to a Homeland Security agent who was working undercover as a drug trafficker.

According to court documents, that officer and Sran had four face-to-face meetings in February and March 2014, when they discussed the purchase and smuggling of cocaine into Canada from the U.S.

During that time, three transactions took place involving supposed cocaine in the amounts of 19, 12 and 10 kilograms with a total street value of around $2 million.

But unknown to Sran, the product consisted of both sham and actual cocaine, according to the documents.

The documents state that Sran entered the U.S. on Nov. 12, 2013 and Feb. 28, 2014. During the transactions, he referred to himself as “the boss.”

The U.S. requested the extradition of Sran, and the courts issued an extradition warrant in April 2019, at which time he was arrested.

During the hearing to seek Sran’s interim release, his lawyer argued that there was no evidence that Sran had been involved in any criminal activity since 2014.

However, the judge denied his released, saying she believed that Sran had access to “large sums of money” and posed a flight risk.

Prior to his arrest, Sran was living in a home in Abbotsford with his mother, wife and four-year-old son.

Investigators are asking for dash-cam video from drivers who travelled along the following routes in Abbotsford between 7 p.m. and 8:30 p.m. on the evening of Friday, July 10:

• Taylor Road between Mount Lehman Road and Ross Road

• Ross Road to 56 Avenue

• 56 Avenue (becomes 58 Avenue) to the 264 Street exit in Langley

Another ridesharing company has moved further east into Pitt Meadows, Maple Ridge, and new sections of Langley today.

On Thursday, July 9, Lyft announced the expansion of service, claiming to hear from both riders and drivers that there’s a “significant appetite” for the service not only in these communities, but also in eastern Langley, the Belcarra area, Lions Bay, and Bowen Island.

Pitt Meadows Mayor Bill Dingwall and Maple Ridge Mayor Mike Morden both said they’re keen to see the additional transportation option available for local residents.

“Pitt Meadows residents have been eagerly awaiting ridesharing in our community, and I’m pleased to say that day has come with Lyft now launching here,” Dingwall said.

“Ridesharing helps to reduce impaired driving by providing a safe and convenient way home. It is also yet another transportation option for residents to travel and a welcomed service to our city,” added the retired Mountie turned mayor.

As B.C. continues to re-open amid COVID, Metro Vancouverites are more inclined to explore the area again, believes Ted Lee of Tourism Vancouver.

RELATED: Uber to apply for ride-hailing licence in B.C., will operate in Lower Mainland

And that’s been substantiated, Lyft’s B.C. general manager Peter Lukomskyj.

Since the beginning of Phase 2, he said the company has seen rides to restaurants and bars increase by more than 500 per cent and trips to public transport and ferry terminals double, indicating people are looking to move around the region, Lukomskyj said.

“At Lyft, we’re thrilled to become the first rideshare company to serve all of Metro Vancouver. While we’re all staying closer to home this summer, we have an opportunity to really explore what our region has to offer. We’re looking forward to being a reliable, responsible, and convenient way for all Metro Vancouverites to move around our beautiful backyard,” he added.

“It’s great to see another transportation option for our citizens being launched today,” Morden said.

“Our council has been committed to ensuring that rideshare companies are able to operate with the collaborative regional approach to licensing. Congratulations to Lyft for this exciting announcement.”

Riders and drivers must self-certify that they will wear face masks throughout the ride, are symptom-free, and will follow health officials’ guidance related to COVID-19.

For more information, including inquiries about becoming a driver, people can also visit the Lyft website.

877,877,1344,abbynews,https://www.abbynews.com/business/b-c-highway-widening-job-reduced-costs-still-up-61-million/,"B.C. highway widening job reduced, costs still up $61 million – Abbotsford News",'Tom Fletcher',2020-07-06,"The Trans Canada Highway at Salmon Arm is subject to the latest of a long series of widening projects extending to the Alberta border. (B.C. transportation ministry)

The B.C. NDP government’s union-restricted road construction program is sparking new questions about a steep increase in costs, even as a section of Trans-Canada Highway widening work has been significantly scaled back.

Widening the Trans Canada Highway east of Kamloops is one of three major projects the NDP government designated for what it describes as “community benefits agreements.” They restrict the workforce to 19 mostly U.S.-based construction trade unions under a 336-page agreement with a new Crown corporation created to administer it. The others are replacement of the Pattullo Bridge at Surrey, and the Broadway subway extension in Vancouver.

The latest contract to be let under the agreement is for a section of Highway 1 at Salmon Arm, announced in June at a budget of $185 million, including $31 million from Ottawa. The announcement by Transportation Minister Claire Trevena explained the reduced size, three-year delay and $61 million increase in costs was because the 2016 project was completed without sufficient engineering and local engagement work.

Kamloops-South Thompson MLA Todd Stone, the former B.C. Liberal transportation minister, said the work was done by 2017, including consulting the Neskonlith Band. Questioned on the project by Stone and Shuswap MLA Greg Kyllo, Trevena said there is still no agreement with Neskonlith to proceed with a large portion of the widening.

Stone said the 9.9 km project has been reduced to 4.9 km, “with a two-lane section stuck in the middle between Hoffman’s Bluff and Chase West,” and elimination of an underpass.

“These massive cost overruns and project scope reductions are the direct result of the NDP delaying these projects for upwards of three years, on top of additional costs in the millions of dollars resulting from the NDP’s imposition of community benefit agreements requiring projects to utilize labour of one of 19 NDP approved unions,” Stone told Black Press July 6.

Trevena said agreement with Neskonlith is needed for the federal share of the money to be provided, and other costs were affected by a “hot market” for construction, up until the COVID-19 pandemic had broad effects on the economy.

“I think what we have now is the realistic budget,” Trevena said.

A tight construction labour market and high prices for steel and asphalt were also cited in the 35-per cent jump in cost for the first contract awarded under the union agreement, east of Revelstoke.

Trevena noted the first Salmon Arm contract went to a Kamloops-based company, and said the new union structure ensures more local, female and Indigenous people being hired as apprentices. That claim has been a source of bitter dispute with newer unions and non-union construction companies, who say they employ 85 per cent of people currently working in construction trades.

Premier John Horgan and the B.C. and Yukon Building Trades say it’s the completion of apprenticeships that is most important, and traditional building trades have an edge there.

RELATED: Contractors picked for Pattullo Bridge replacement

RELATED: Cost jumps 35% for Revelstoke widening section

The new Crown corporation, B.C. Infrastructure Benefits, controls payroll, union dues and benefits for designated public projects. It diverts an additional 25 cents per hour worked to a new union organization called the Allied Infrastructure and Related Construction Council of B.C., and another seven cents per hour to building trades union funds for health and safety.

Non-union or independent union-affiliated companies can still bid on projects, but their employees are required to join one of the designated international unions within 30 days of starting work.

When the $1.38 billion contract to build a new Pattullo Bridge was awarded in January, Trevena acknowledged that the union-only deal would add about seven per cent to the cost. The 83-year-old four-lane bridge is being replaced with another four-lane bridge with added pedestrian and bicycle lanes, and a new off-ramp to Highway 17, the South Fraser Perimeter Road.

An Abbotsford resident has released a book of poetry that she says is dedicated to anyone who has ever questioned their worth.

Saniya Kaushal, 19, says the emotion behind her book “you are not ugly” has been years in the making.

“I have been called ugly more times than I can remember, in addition to being labelled with many other hurtful words. Unfortunately, I have heard others be called even worse,” she said.

Kaushal said she wants to raise awareness about the damage that can be caused by thoughtless behaviours such as insulting appearances, weight-shaming, condescending behaviour, and making racist or homophobic comments.

She said she has built herself back up to love herself more, and her book is an attempt at building up others too.

Her collection of poetry is divided into three parts – feel, listen, and overcome. It covers themes of bullying, name-calling, racism, mental health, judgments, and self-esteem.

Kaushal was born in England and raised in Abbotsford. She will soon begin medical school in Ireland.

Her collection of poetry is available as a paperback and e-book worldwide. It can be purchased on Amazon, and the link is also available through her website saniyakaushal.com.

An Abbotsford musician has released his fourth solo album, and this one is entirely instrumental.

Liam Pasiciel, 21, said he released Planet of Creation to showcase that he can play different kinds of music other than metal.

Pasiciel’s previous releases focused on his love of “power metal.”

He said the tracks on Planet of Creation were inspired by him wanting “to do justice to the place that we live.”

“We truly live on an incredible planet, and I’ve always been at peace during stressful times just looking around and taking it all in, and I hope that my music off of this album will trigger that same feeling in others,” Pasiciel said.

He said his creative energy was “pushed to the limit” on the album. Pasiciel wanted to make listeners feel like they are in the location that the song is describing, and he spent a lot of time studying different genres of music to capture that feeling.

Pasiciel, who performs under the band name Magnesium, also released official backing tracks for each song so that other musicians can improvise or create whatever they want using his songs as the base.

Among the tracks on the album is country-style guitar in Forest, and “some really clean background dynamics” in Oceans and Space.

Mountains is the finale, featuring lots of brass, choir and synth “to make it sound as big as possible, just like real-life mountains.”

“The track ends with an energizing sequence of power metal, coming full circle with my other music,” Pasiciel said.

Because his bedroom serves as his studio, Pasiciel said he feels fortunate that he is able to continue making music during the COVID-19 pandemic.

“It’s during times like these that we have to remember how much of a blessing it is to be able to express ourselves on the inside when we can’t show it on the outside,” he said.

Pasiciel previously attended Visible Music College in Memphis, Tennessee for a year, majoring in guitar.

He first started playing at the age of 11, and grew to love power metal when he began taking lessons at age 14.

Pasiciel’s first album was Forging the Armory in which he played piano, lead and bass guitar, as well as singing. He also made Guardian Dreadnought and Breakthrough before Planet Creation.

The four albums are available on all streaming music platforms.

An inmate serving a life sentence for his part in the 1969 slaying of two men in Ottawa died at Abbotsford’s Pacific Institution on July 13.

David Brault has been serving time for two counts of non-capital murder, two counts of sexual assault and “other offences” since his arrest over 50 years ago, according to a July 17 news release from Correctional Service Canada.

CSC said Brault’s next of kin have been notified of his death.

A story in the Ottawa Journal, which stopped publication in 1980, says Brault was 24 years old in 1969 when he and another man pleaded guilty to the shooting deaths of Gerald MacDonald of Ottawa and Michigan resident Kenneth Vallee.

Brault told the court he became angry after being passed dangerously by two cars on an Ontario highway and after he chased each vehicle down, he and his friend shot both men.

Canada West announced on July 15 that via a vote of all 17 members that conference competition will proceed this fall.

Whether the championships are ultimately staged is contingent on health and safety considerations across Western Canada, as British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba continue to manage COVID-19 in their respective provinces.

The CW Golf Championships, hosted by UBC Okanagan in Kelowna are scheduled for the Okanagan Golf Club, Oct. 2 to 4.

Canada West had previously announced on June 8 that all first term team sports – soccer, football, field hockey, and rugby 15s – wouldn’t proceed, and that all two-term sports – basketball, volleyball, and hockey – would start no sooner than January 2021 with reduced schedules. A decision on the commencement of two-term sports and second term championship sports – including wrestling – will be made no later than Oct. 8. Of the sports listed, UFV competes in soccer, basketball, volleyball and wrestling.

Golf has weathered the COVID-19 pandemic better than most sports, as an outdoor activity where physical distancing is relatively easy to maintain. Golf courses have been able to remain open in B.C. during the pandemic, with modifications.

“I’d like to thank our COVID-19 Task Force along with the scheduled hosts of our fall championship sports for the work that went into informing today’s vote,” stated CW President Clint Hamilton. “While we are disappointed that cross country champions won’t be crowned this fall, we will proceed optimistically with plans for the CW Golf Championships and remain hopeful for delivering swimming in the second term.”

Abbotsford and Mission’s non-profit shelter, SARA for Women, received a large donation from Shoppers Drug Mart as part of the store’s 19-year-running Growing Women’s Health campaign.

Every year, associate-owners and their staff choose a local women’s organization to donate to.

On June 3, a cheque for $22,999 was handed over to SARA for Women staff by Mission’s store owners, adding to a over $40 million total raised by Shopper’s Drug Mart since 2001.

In late 2019, four store owners – Mission’s Sumit Manchanda, and Kiran Basran, Kuljeet Thiara and Shenaz Singh of Abbotsford – chose SARA for Women as this year’s benefactor.

“SARA for Women wants to thank the owners, staff and customers of the four Shoppers Drug Mart stores for their generous support,” reads a news release from the non-profit. “The group raised funds through a very successful pub night at Abbotsford Town Hall as well as collecting generous donations from their customers and staff in their stores.”

SARA for Women also operates the Fronya Thrift Boutique Shop to fund their social intiatives. The store, located on 33173 First Avenue in Mission, donates all the profits into local programs that support women and children.

“It is a delightful thrift store with a boutique attitude offering high quality, gently-used women and children’s clothing, shoes and accessories. Everything in the store is fully checked and safely handled with COVID-19 guidelines, and are accepting donations,” reads the news release. “Fronya is also a proud host offering an integrated training program to help women re-enter the work force, or to gain work experience.”

Fronya (meaning free spirited independent woman) is a name taken from the women’s collective who founded SARA for Women in 1975.

Whether you travel by floatplane or a ferry, a stunning journey is the icing on a decadent (coastal) cake.

Rugged Coastal Landscapes

No matter how many times you experience it, the dramatic coastal scenery stirs the soul. Capture a collage of moments: misty mornings overlooking rocky shores, dewy strolls through ancient rainforest, and sunset beach strolls, to name a few.

Depending on where you choose to explore, find the tranquility of protected waters or the energy of untamed surf beaches. The remote inlets and plunging fjords of the Sunshine Coast beckon to be explored by kayak, boat, or paddleboard. Tip: take a guided ocean tour to access little-known areas. Or, hop on the ferry to Campbell River on Vancouver Island, where you can head out with an experienced fishing charter and find out why it’s known as “the salmon capital of the world.”

On the mainland, enjoy peek-a-boo views of the ocean as you hike along the Sunshine Coast Trail among towering giants shrouded in lichen. On Vancouver Island, explore the coast along the Juan de Fuca Provincial Park in the south or stroll the eastern shores of Rathtrevor Beach Provincial Park near Parksville.

Laid-back West Coast Culture

Celebrate a world of contrast, from sleepy seaside towns to buzzing cities. With every visit to the coast, you’ll discover a new gem — a funky coffee shop, a new brewery, a colourful art gallery, or a beachy boutique selling locally-made artisan goods.

The burgeoning coastal culinary scene isn’t just reserved for cities like Victoria and Nanaimo. Head on a foodie adventure to the Cowichan Valley or Salt Spring Island to sample farm-fresh ingredients and craft provisions. Or, try Indigenous-inspired cuisine in Port Hardy.

Lively Resident Wildlife

If you haven’t had a chance to experience the wilder side of BC’s coast, there’s still time. Take a whale-watching tour to see orcas surge through calm waters and listen to the cacophony of sea lions shouting from their rocky perches. On shore, you might glimpse grizzlies, black bears, wolves, and deer as they slink across the land.

Venture on a cultural wildlife tour with an Indigenous guide to gain a deeper connection to the coast and the First Nations people who have been stewards of this land for thousands of years.

An alleged drug dealer was arrested in Chilliwack thanks to an eagle-eyed RCMP officer on Wednesday.

In the late morning of July 15, RCMP officers saw a man making “hand-to-hand illegal drug sales” in the 46000-block of Yale Road and quickly arrested the 58-year-old Chilliwack man, Mounties said in a release Friday.

Police seized drugs believed to be fentanyl, as well as cash and evidence consistent with the sale of illegal drugs during the arrest.

The arrest was made by a Chilliwack Community Response Team (CRT) officer.

“CRT provides pro-active uniformed deployment to emerging community and public safety issues,” said RCMP spokesperson Cpl. Mike Rail. “The team focuses on an increased police visibility and response.”

RCMP later released the man from custody, and a report has been sent to the Public Prosecution Service of Canada for its assessment of Controlled Drug and Substance Act charges.

RCMP remind everyone who witnesses anything they believe to be suspicious in nature to contact the Chilliwack RCMP at 604-792-4611 or, should you wish to remain anonymous, call Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-8477 (TIPS).

Chilliwack Chiefs great Jordan Kawaguchi will wear the captain’s C for the University of North Dakota Fighting Hawks next season.

The Abbotsford product was voted into the role by his teammates, who were on the ice Monday for an informal skate at the Ralph Engelstad Arena. Kawaguchi wore the alternate captain’s A last season, and his breakout performance on the ice made him a logical candidate for the promotion.

Gooch posted 15 goals and 45 points, 16 more than the next highest-scoring Hawk. He earned All-American status and made the final three for the Hobey Baker Award, given annually to the top player in NCAA men’s hockey. His team had the fourth best record in program history (26-5-4) when the 2019-20 season was halted by COVID-19.

Kawaguchi is the first UND captain to hail from British Columbia since Powell River’s Brad Bombardir led the team in 1993-94.

The 23-year-old forward bypassed National Hockey League opportunities to return to the Fighting Hawks in 2020-21. This will be his fourth campaign.

Kawaguchi played in Chilliwack from 2013 to 2017 and captained the junior A club in his final season.

A local group has restarted its carpet bowling get-togethers three times a week in Abbotsford.

Carpet bowling runs every Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 1 to 3 p.m. at Garden Park Tower, 2825 Clearbrook Rd.

The cost is $1.25. Organizers say physical-distancing measures will be in place to ensure everyone’s safety.

Carpet bowling is similar to lawn bowling. Players throw their bowling balls to a smaller target ball called a “jack.” Each team of four to eight players has four bowling balls, and there are two teams per carpet.

The object of the game is for each team to get their bowling balls nearest to the jack to gain points.

For more information, call Helen at 604-853-2600.

The Abbotsford Police Department (APD) has completed the restoration of a vintage police cruiser named in honour of the late Insp. Carol Powell.

“Carol” is a 1965 Chevy Biscayne that was located in Spokane, Wash. and transported to Abbotsford early this year.

Over the next several months, APD officers and several community partners volunteered their time to restore the vehicle in celebration of the department’s 65th anniversary this year.

The department operated as the Matsqui Police Department for 40 years and then 25 years as the APD, after the communities of Matsqui and Abbotsford amalgamated to become the City of Abbotsford.

The project was done in partnership with the Abbotsford Police Foundation, a charitable organization that funds APD programs and projects not covered by its operating budget.

RELATED: Meet ‘Carol’: Vintage cruiser being restored by Abbotsford Police

The cruiser has been named for Powell, who recently passed away after a battle with cancer, in keeping with the tradition of vintage vehicles commonly being named after a significant female figure.

Powell served Vancouver and Abbotsford for 34 years and dedicated much of her spare time to the City of Abbotsford and the APD.

She and her husband, retired sergeant Mike Powell, dressed up each year as Santa and Mrs. Claus to visit sick children, and hosted many of the APD’s Halloween parties for kids.

Powell eagerly watched the restoration of the car, but died just prior to its completion. Her family joined the APD at the unveiling on July 9.

Sgt. Chris Nightingale was the project’s main coordinator.

“We would like to thank the Abbotsford Police Foundation, numerous community donors and countless others who have had a hand in making this project a success,” he said at the event.

The cruiser will be on display at upcoming community events.

One of the Fraser Valley’s most pup-ular dogs has passed away.

The last story was in March of last year, when he announced his retirement. He passed away on June 26, 2020, at the age of 16. The news of his passing was announced a few days ago on his own Facebook page, which chronicled his important life as a therapy dog.

It was written as a farewell and a love letter, from the viewpoint of Mac himself, “meant for the heart of each and every one of you.”

“My body is tired and although I love life, it’s time to let go these trappings of age which have begun to weigh me down,” the post reads.

READ MORE: Mac the therapy dog gives comfort to wildfire evacuees

On his Facebook page, his handler Dawn Holt is referred to as MomBoss.

Holt, a UFV counsellor, is registered as a clinician with the Provincial Emergency Health Services, and Mac was registered with PADS (Pacific Assistance Dogs Society). The duo went to Kamloops in 2017 to help comfort victims of wildfires there.

But most of their service was at UFV, and the farewell letter was written to those who knew and loved Mac deeply.

“I want you to truly know, just how much you have given to this great golden life,” it reads. “For every moment of connection, unconditional love and encounter, I gave you a piece of my heart. You might think that after all these years, my heart would be depleted. But no. For every piece of my heart that was given away, I received at least one in return. Because love has no beginning and no end and as long as you let that love in, you need never feel empty.”

The one-and-only Dolly Parton has been popping up around Chilliwack over the past while.

She isn’t saying much, but that big, bright smile has been seen at the Jinkerson Stairs, in local stores, and even on a popular Facebook page. And everywhere she goes, she’s reading a children’s book.

That’s because this Dolly is actually a life-size cut-out being used to promote Imagination Library, an early literacy program headed up by the infamous country star herself. And since she can’t make it to the thousands of communities across North America that have an affiliate, the people at Imagination Library Fraser Valley decided to have some fun.

They moved her around town to help promote the program, and especially to encourage people to donate during a local Christmas in July campaign.

Bradley Gionet joined the advisory committee for the Imagination Library Fraser Valley a few months ago. He is also the brains behind Coronaoke, which encouraged people to share songs of themselves singing while in isolation. He had been looking for ways to boost the collective community spirit, as well as support struggling local businesses and organizations.

During the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, Gionet decided to spread the joy of giving by launching a community-wide Christmas in July campaign.

READ MORE: Imagination Library celebrating one year with fundraiser

“After a difficult year for so many, I decided we needed two Christmases,” he says. “I have three asks. Honour your family Christmas traditions. Shop in real local brick and mortar businesses for any gift giving or personal purchases. Support local charity or not for profit initiatives as you are able.”

The Imagination Library Fraser Valley currently has 64 kids on the wait list to join the program, which gives them free books once a month. The cost to fund the waiting list is $7,300, and they are hoping to raise $15,000 this year.

The Dollywood Foundation covers the infrastructure costs to support the program (book selection, negotiating printing costs, planning, allocation and book distribution etc.). Local affiliates are responsible to fundraise for the cost of books and shipping (our average cost is $3.55 per book including postage).

“We have noticed an increase in applications across the country since COVID-19 took hold,” says board member Brian Martin. “We believe this is because traditional elementary education has been thrown into turmoil, with plans uncertain for a full return in the fall. Parents are looking for additional ways to occupy their children and suspect a return to traditional activities – like reading – are gaining traction.”

Research has shown that participating children are better prepared for kindergarten when they are read to on a regular basis, he adds. That leads to better success in early grades, and so forth.

“It’s a long game strategy to provide all kids with the opportunity to rise above their circumstances if they come from a less advantaged household,” Martin says.

Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library Fraser Valley provides free books for children from birth to 5 years old. Every month, an age appropriate book will arrive instilling excitement around reading and learning. One of the books given away in the past was Counting on Snow by local author and illustrator Max Newhouse.

Locally, they cover Hope through Chilliwack including Harrison, Agassiz, Rosedale, Cultus and Sardis.

Donations can now be accepted online here: https://imaginationlibrary.com/ca/affiliate/BCFRASERVALLEY/

Discover glacial valleys, soaring mountain peaks, and wildlife parks – the kind of sweeping landscapes that adventurers aspire to witness.

Regardless of how far from home or enormous these parts may appear, the wilderness in BC’s north is as inviting as it is untamed. You’ll feel right at home when you arrive, and will leave with a new understanding of just how deep BC’s beautiful backyard goes.

Ways to Explore the Vast, Wild North

Tour by car or RV along key corridors like the scenic Route 16 through Smithers and Terrace, forest-lined Highway 37, or the historic Alaska Highway. Or, link them all for the ultimate northern circle route.

Edged by jaw-dropping scenery, Prince George is a great place to stay a few days and get a taste of life in the north. Meet the locals and enjoy a glass of fruit wine at BC’s northernmost winery; walk amongst 300-year-old black cottonwoods and view tree bark carvings in Cottonwood Island Park. Discover secluded waterways of the Omineca with a guided fishing charter.

For a more direct route from the south, fly direct to Terrace or Prince George.

Enjoy Heart-Pumping Adventures Along Route 16

Give your northern adventure a theme and go on a fishing, rafting, mountain biking, or hiking road trip along Route 16. Head west from Prince George and spend a few days in towns like Terrace, BC’s up-and-coming mountain biking hotspot. Set up a home base in Burns Lake or Smithers and explore the dozens of lakes and rivers in the area – full of healthy populations of rainbow trout and char, so don’t forget your fishing licence! Visit the Hazeltons and the ‘Ksan Historical Village, Campground and Museum to honour generations, past and present, and immerse yourself in 8,000-year-old Indigenous history.

Explore Big Nature East of the Rockies in “The Peace”

Carved by water and wind over thousands of years, mountain ranges give way to valleys and prairie skies east of the Rockies along the Alaska Highway (Highway 97) – an area affectionately dubbed “The Peace” by locals.

This historic route leads you to old settlements like Fort St. John and “Mile 0” of the Alaska Highway at Dawson Creek. Tumbler Ridge, one of only three Global Geoparks in North America, is another must-visit; see dinosaur trackways and fossils and appreciate just how far travel in BC can take us, in both space and through time. Continue onward to Fort Nelson and explore Stone Mountain and Northern Rocky Mountains provincial parks and make a stop at the picturesque Muncho Lake.

Career Paths for Skilled Immigrants, in partnership with the Training Group at Douglas College, hosts its first Virtual Career Panel for current and potential clients on Thursday, July 16.

The panel runs from 10 a.m. to noon at Archway.ca/CPSI.

Professionals from a range of fields – including marketing, IT, language instruction, social services and human resources – will speak to newcomers on pursuing careers, making professional connections and having their credentials recognized in Canada.

Several of the speakers are immigrants who have experienced first-hand the challenges that newcomers face when they arrive in Canada and want to pursue the same line of work they studied for and worked in, in their country of origin.

Newcomers can also learn more about the support available to them through the Career Paths program.

The Career Paths for Skilled Immigrants program at Archway Community Services in Abbotsford helps newcomers find employment related to their former careers.

Program coordinator Mary Finch said it’s designed to break the stereotype of doctors driving taxis, and provides newcomers with one-to-one support, financial assistance and training by employment counsellors.

“Our program is unique; we help individuals take the steps to obtaining meaningful employment using their experience or training abroad,” Finch said.

“The barriers newcomers face can be financial or sometimes it’s just a lack of awareness of the Canadian working culture that stops them from getting hired.”

The Virtual Career Panel event is free but registration is required at Archway.ca/CPSI.

Funding for Career Paths is provided by the provincial and federal governments.

Pre-sales have been launched for a new book about Abbotsford’s history.

Abbotsford – A Diverse Tapestry will be released this fall and is about the people, cultures and events that have inspired and shaped the city.

The cost for the softcover book is $29, and it is being released in conjunction with the City of Abbotsford’s 25th anniversary celebration of the amalgamation of the districts of Abbotsford and Matsqui.

Kris Foulds, curator of historical collections at The Reach Gallery Museum, said the group putting the book together is proud to bring forward these stories, particularly ones that have been left out of history books.

“Little did we know when we first started this project several years ago how relevant and important it would be in the year of its release, in 2020, due to a heightened awareness of systemic racism and desire to center marginalized communities within the city,” she said.

ALSO READ: Three exhibits at The Reach Gallery in Abbotsford are open again

Abbotsford – A Diverse Tapestry presents some of the many histories and biographies of the people that make up the diverse social and cultural tapestry of Abbotsford.

The book shares different perspectives on city history with the intent of celebrating and strengthening community relationships through awareness.

Written in the midst of a time of powerful social change, Foulds said the authors hope this work contributes to the kind of education and learning that may ultimately nurture empathy and unity, thereby supporting us in being the best neighbours we can be to one another.

Pre-sales can be processed at The Reach Gallery Museum at 32388 Veterans Way. Videos of book readings and promotion can be viewed on the City of Abbotsford website, through their Canada Day promotions at abbotsford.ca.

Copies of the print art from the cover will also be available for $29.

Profits from the book will be donated to the Abbotsford Community Foundation, specifically for at-risk youth.

The virual event takes place on July 25 and 26 at msbike.ca, replacing the annual group rides, including the MS Bike Fraser Valley Experience which travels through Langley and Abbotsford every summer.

The weekend-long virtual event brings together participants to share their stories and connect with one another. Participants raising money for the cause can choose when and how far they ride througout the summer.

This year’s Virtual MS Bike will have weekly challenges such as the fastest kilometre and longest ride, event weekend distance goals of 40 to 200 kilometres, and a a virtual ride across Canada (7,117 kilometres).

Typically, the MS Society of Canada and the MS community come together each summer to hold MS Bike events across the country to create awareness and fundraise.

Pamela Valentine, president and CEO of MS Society of Canada, siad it’s important to continue to find ways to connect as as a community and to support one another.

“The current health crisis has impacted all Canadians, and for those affected by MS it’s another uncertain and unpredictable concern on top of an already challenging disease. The need for information and resources for people affected by MS is as important as ever, which is why we must continue our efforts to support the MS community and fund critical research,” she said.

An Abbotsford recycling depot is among those across the province taking part in a six-month pilot program through which people can take in alcohol and non-alcohol beverage cans without having to separate them from one another.

Moe’s Bottle Depot at 2625 Gladys Ave. is among the Return-It depots participating in the program.

Aluminum alcohol cans are the responsibility of and covered under the Brewers Recycled Container Collection Council (BRCCC) and Brewers Distributor Limited (BDL) recycling system.

Only some Return-It depots have a BRCCC/BDL license to manage alcohol containers.

Currently, when consumers visit a Return-It depot and recycle their aluminum beverage containers for a cash refund, they need to separate their alcohol and non-alcohol aluminum cans because this material is managed by two different stewardship agencies.

RELATED: B.C. Return-It to double recycling deposits for pop cans, juice boxes

Only about half of depots have a BRCCC/BDL licence and can provide consumers with a full 10 cent deposit refund per can.

However, since consumers still bring and expect to return their aluminum alcohol and non-alcohol cans at the same Return-It depot for recycling, these small business owners still accept the aluminum alcohol cans but do not have the same financial resources to provide the consumer with a full deposit refund.

As a result, consumers may receive a partial deposit refund to cover the depot’s costs for the handling of these containers. (This is also the case for the Return-It Express system, in which customers can drop off bags of unsorted beverage containers and have their refund deposited into an account.)

Now, customers at participating depots in the pilot project no longer have to separate those cans and will receive the full 10 cent refund per can.

Visit return-it.ca/nosortingcans for a list of the initial participating locations. The list will continually be updated over the coming weeks.

Starting this fall, Return-It plans to implement a 10-cent unified deposit for all beverage containers, regardless of size.

The not-for-profit organization will also be partnering with the Salvation Army to expand Return-It’s textiles collection program to safely drop off used clothing for recycling.

Bewildered, Georgina Onstine looked up at her care aide at Menno Home in Abbotsford and wiped away the tears as they rolled down her cheeks. After several weeks of lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Onstine had just seen her son, Allen, on TV.

“She was thrilled to talk to her son,” said Menno Place recreation staff member Vera Beerling. “He was so big on the screen and she commented on his wrinkles and grey hair. ‘You’re old!’ she exclaimed!”

Beerling connected Onstine and her son via Zoom through Menno Place’s new video conferencing program launched in April.

Since the lockdown began in long-term care homes across B.C. in late March, no visitors have been allowed in Menno Home and Hospital, leaving the 350 residents and their family members longing for conversation and a glimpse of one another. (Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry announced on June 30 that in-person visits will soon resume with strict protocols, including one designated visitor per resident.)

RELATED: B.C. to start allowing visits to senior care homes

In the first three days of the program, 87 calls were facilitated. Since then, over 700 video connections have been made between residents and loved ones.

“It’s what we hoped for and more,” Beerling said. “It’s been wonderful to see our seniors engage with their families.”

Families have expressed their gratitude for this connection amidst a difficult and uncertain time.

“I felt such joy to see and hear my dad,” said Nuria Rivera after her Zoom call with her father, Antonio Casas. “Thank you for working on new ways to help us keep in touch with our loved ones. You all are my heroes!”

Menno Place’s Zoom program allows for one 15-minute Zoom call per resident per week. There is capacity for 10 calls per day in each of the seven units at Menno Home and Hospital.

RELATED: Five Menno Place teams recognized for work during pandemic

Family members are able to book their calls through a simple online process at the Menno Place Family and Friends Website.

The Zoom program has also allowed friends and family members who live at a distance to connect with their loved ones. Many out-of-province and international calls have been facilitated.

“Dad’s spirits were lifted as he was able to see all of our faces from Saskatchewan to Texas to Squamish to Kamloops and the Lower Mainland. It was awesome!” a family member commented online.

“I live in the UK so visits are not possible,” said another. “Therefore, Zoom calls are a godsend. I want to thank the Menno staff for their care of my sister and for setting up the Zoom call system, which is working, overall, very well.”

Of course, as many in this season of virtual connection have experienced, technical glitches happen, including bad wifi connections, and audio and video issues. But on the whole, families and residents have shown patience and gratitude for this opportunity to connect, Beerling said.

Menno Place’s manager of recreation and volunteers, Joanne Sweeney, said she is grateful for the opportunity to connect residents and their loved ones at this challenging time.

“When Menno Place made the difficult, but necessary, decision to lock down the Home and Hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic, we were aware how hard it would be on both residents and their loved ones,” she said.

“We needed to be innovative in how we provided programs and connections, but still keep the residents safe. I have a strong and compassionate team that worked alongside Menno Place communications and tech staff to make this Zoom program happen. We are thrilled to be able to serve our seniors and their loved ones in this way.”

The Menno Place Zoom program will continue throughout the lockdown, with hopes to extend it into the future.

A man who is battling cancer has been painting rocks with inspirational thank-you messages for front-line workers in Abbotsford.

Dale Leguerrier has been battling stage 4 colon cancer for almost three years, and has been living at the Abbotsford Hospice Society’s Holmberg House for the past three months after being transferred there from the palliative care unit at Abbotsford Regional Hospital (ARH).

Leguerrier’s sister, Julie Niessen, said the cancer is spreading to the rest of his body, and every day is a “painful struggle.”

But she said he has been grateful for the compassion and empathy shown by doctors, nurses and other staff at ARH and Holmberg House.

As a thank you, Leguerrier began painting rocks and placing them in the flower beds at the hospital’s staff parking lot.

“He thought that if a staff member was having a bad day maybe one of his rocks would make them feel a little bit better and let them know they were loved and appreciated,” Niessen said.

Leguerrier has now placed the rocks all around the hospice and serenity garden, made rocks for Holmberg House staff, and painted “teddy bear” rocks for kids who have lost a special person in their lives.

His daughter Katrina has also helped paint many of the rocks.

To date, more than 200 rocks – and counting – have been painted with whimsical, humorous and touching messages.

“The doctors, nurses and staff risk their lives every day to help us, and my brother is trying, in a small way, to make them feel appreciated for the work they do,” Niessen said.

Abbotsford’s Cole Brandsma has received a prestigious invite to Volleyball Canada’s U21 men’s virtual training group.

The 2019 Abbotsford Christian Secondary grad will join 26 other players from all across the country at the virtual camp, which aims to prepare the program to further connect, educate, and continue the development of the selected athletes as Canada looks towards World Championship qualification in 2021.

The athletes will be engaged through various sessions in July and August including support from Team Canada staff on technical, tactical, physical, and mental skill development.

Brandsma finished up his first year with the UBC Thunderbirds men’s volleyball team earlier this year, with UBC finishing third in the Canada West with a record of 17-5. The Thunderbirds eventually fell in the Canada West semifinal to Alberta back in March.

He is a gold medal winner at both the U16 provincial club level and at the 2016 BC Summer Games with the Fraser Valley team. Brandsma also has a U18 club provincial silver medal and a national bronze.

He is also a three-time provincial high school all-star, a three-time ACS male athlete of the year, and was named to the Abbotsford Sports Wall of Fame. He also helped lead ACS to a provincial silver medal in volleyball.

“While every coach and athlete would love to be in the gym, we recognize the significant challenge we all are facing during the pandemic. It is critical that our coaches and athletes continue to develop athletes through high performance pathways toward the men’s and women’s indoor national teams,” stated Dawna Sales, Director of Athlete and Coach Pathways for Volleyball Canada. “To work with world-leading professional staff that traditionally wouldn’t be available in July to our youth and junior athletes is just one of the opportunities to extend our programs.”

915,915,1382,abbynews,https://www.abbynews.com/sports/canadian-elite-basketball-league-to-use-elam-ending-in-summer-series/,Canadian Elite Basketball League to use Elam Ending in Summer Series – Abbotsford News,'Eric Welsh',2020-07-06,"The Canadian Elite Basketball League has shown itself to be open to innovative ideas, and that trend will continue when the second-year circuit tips off its Summer Series later this month.

The seven-team 15-day tournament begins July 25 and will include the ‘Elam Ending’ in all 26 games.

The concept caught the attention of hoops fans at the most recent NBA all-star game. Created by Ball State University prof Nick Elam, the end-of-game rule takes away the score clock inside the final four minutes, replacing it with a target score.

At the first stoppage of play at or under four minute mark of the fourth quarter, timed play ends and a target score is set, equal to the leading team’s score plus nine. For example, if Abbotsford’s Fraser Valley Bandits lead the Edmonton Stingers 77-71 at the stoppage, the target score after adding nine points to the Bandits’ total is 86.

The first team to reach the target score wins the game.

Only two timeouts per team can be used during untimed play, with Elam striving to eliminate the lack of flow that comes from intentional fouling, seemingly endless timeouts and rushed possessions.

“I am excited about the CEBL’s bold vision to implement the Elam Ending, and to be the first to do so in FIBA play,” Elam said. “Whether at the NBA All-Star Game, TBT: The Basketball Tournament, or countless grassroots-level leagues and events throughout the basketball world, the Elam Ending continues to prove its ability to preserve high-quality, fluid, and intense play all the way through the end of the game.”

CEBL commissioner Mike Morreale is excited to see the Elam Ending in action.

“The Elam Ending ensures that every contest ends on a winning basket,” the basketball boss said. “We will have 26 heroes for all 26 of our CEBL Summer Series games. It greatly enhances the viewing experience for fans, and the game experience for players and coaches.”

The CEBL Summer Series sees the Bandits tipping off against Edmonton, Ottawa, Hamilton, Guelph, Saskatchewan (Saskatoon) and host Niagara at the Meridian Centre in St. Catharines for a round robin competition leading to a playoff bracket and title game.

(Sport Abbotsford photo)

Sport Abbotsford wants the City of Abbotsford to reconsider its decision to close the Centennial Outdoor Pool for the summer.

The association, which represents dozens of local sports organizations in Abbotsford, stated that the pool is an important venue for many local families and will only push the capacity of other nearby venues which will be opened.

The City of Abbotsford announced the decision on June 17, stating high operation costs and residents’ desire for an indoor pool to be opened led to the move.

The pool is also the home of the Abbotsford Whalers aquatic club, which has a history of over 50 years of summer swimming. The Whalers stated on their website that the city has offered the club some pool time at the Matsqui Recreation Centre in August. They recently launched a survey to gauge the interest in this offering.

RELATED: Abbotsford’s Centennial Outdoor Pool will not re-open this summer

Scott Johnson, a former president of the Whalers, said that zero consultation was made between the city and local community groups like the Whalers. Families involved with the Whalers now do not have a local venue to train and compete in.

“We understand the challenges the city faces during this time, solutions have been created at the provincial level to allow safe swimming activities,” he stated in a press release. “It is happening in towns across the Fraser Valley and B.C. but these opportunities can’t even happen in Abbotsford because local groups have been denied the opportunity to even try. Once again, decisions about our facilities are made without consultation with community groups. Again, as a parent, to meet the interests of our children we need to follow the roads that leave Abbotsford.”

The decision has also been criticized because many other municipalities have decided to open their outdoor pools. Facilities in Langley, Delta, Surrey, Agassiz and Vancouver will all be opened up this summer. Sport Abbotsford stated that the closure is further evidence that the City of Abbotsford lags behind other municipalities in sports and recreation offerings for residents.

“This pool closure is another example of the City of Abbotsford prioritizing finances over families, and focusing on revenue instead of recreation,” stated Josh Reynolds, Vice Chair of Sport Abbotsford. “This pool serves thousands of residents over the summer months, and is a safe summer activity as the province continues to re-open. We hope the city reverses course here and opens the pool.”

Sport Abbotsford wants the pool to be open as soon as possible, and a petition supporting the pool opening has been started, and will be sent to Mayor and Council next week.

The petition can be found by clicking anywhere in this sentence.

The petition, which began on July 1, currently has 195 signatures.

917,917,1384,abbynews,https://www.abbynews.com/sports/ufv-cascades-mens-basketball-signs-pair-of-players/,UFV Cascades men’s basketball signs pair of players – Abbotsford News,'Ben Lypka',2020-07-05,"The University of the Fraser Valley Cascades men’s basketball team announced the addition of two more players earlier this week.

The club inked forward Aidan Wilson and guard Jake Willemsen, and new head coach Joe Enevoldson’s initial recruiting class now stands at eight players.

Wilson, a Burnaby native, has excelled at both the high school and college levels.

In 2017-18, his Grade 11 season, he helped the Burnaby South Rebels win the B.C. 4A high school crown. Two years later, as a freshman at Douglas, he was part of a Royals squad which won the Pacwest conference title and was ranked No. 1 in the nation heading into the CCAA national championships, which were ultimately cancelled due to COVID-19.

Last season, playing limited minutes on a veteran-laden Douglas team, Wilson averaged 5.1 points, 4.3 rebounds, and 0.7 blocks in 12.2 minutes per game, on his way to Pacwest all-rookie honours.

“He’s a big-time recruit for us, both in the short term and in the long-term,” Enevoldson stated. “His ceiling is quite high, and he makes plays that contribute to winning basketball. He’s a very good athlete at 6’10”, he can really run the floor, and he has great timing blocking shots. His per-40 stats were off the charts for us last season. The physicality of the U Sports level will be a challenge, but I think he’ll be up to it. We’re looking for big things from him.”

Willemsen, a Tsawwassen native, spent the past two years with the Lane Titans, a powerhouse U.S. junior college program. As a sophomore, he averaged 9.9 points while shooting a scorching 42.9 per cent from beyond the arc on a high volume of attempts (6.2 per game).

During his prep career, Willemsen was selected to the B.C. 4A all-star team in 2018 as a senior, and was part of Team B.C. at the Canada Summer Games.

“Jake was top-10 in the NWAC (Northwest Athletic Conference) in three-point shooting percentage, and at a high volume, so he can really shoot it,” Enevoldson noted. “Shooting was something we needed to address, and that’s what he can do for us. He’s a bigger, stronger guard, and he’s got some good post-secondary experience. He played on a Lane team his first year that had four or five Division I prospects and a coach (Joe White) who went on to Idaho State. Then last season, he shot the heck out of it and averaged close to double figures. We think he can help us from Day 1, and we’re looking for him to make an immediate impact.”

The decision on whether or not there will be U Sports basketball in January will be made by Oct. 8.

The Vancouver Pride Society says the BC Liberal Party is no longer welcome at the annual pride parade unless it expels Chilliwack-Kent MLA Laurie Throness from caucus or, at the very least, removes him from his role as Child Care critic.

The move Thursday came a day after NDP MLA Spencer Chandra Herbert similarly demanded Throness be ousted from caucus for his advertising in a Langley-based conservative Christian publication that frequently publishes homophobic and anti-LGBTQ content.

Throness was one of 14 BC Liberal MLAs who spent thousands of taxpayer dollars to advertise in the magazine. After the practice came to light, a number of MLAs apologized. In a Tweet on June 30, party leader Andrew Wilkinson himself said “there is no room in the BC Liberal Party for homophobia, transphobia, or any other form of discrimination. Going forward, we are taking immediate steps to ensure our advertising decisions reflect those values at all times.”

Throness, however, doubled down and said the magazine aligns with his “Biblical Christian” values.

The magazine has published articles critical of SOGI-123 in schools, one article called medically assisted dying “barbaric,” and an October 2019 piece in the same edition as a BC Liberal ad criticizes a proposed ban on conversion therapy.

• READ MORE: NDP wants Chilliwack-Kent MLA removed from BC Liberal caucus for alleged homophobia

Several others BC Liberals, including Chilliwack MLA John Martin, who advertised in the publication, have been silent.

Asked to comment on the situation by The Chilliwack Progress, Throness declined.

The Vancouver Pride Society threat to kick the BC Liberals out of future pride parades came Thursday in a letter to the party. While Wilkinson implied the party would no longer advertise in the publication, Throness seemed to defy his leader.

“This is incredibly concerning as it suggests that the BC Liberal Party, and caucus, are at the very least tolerant of homophobia and transphobia,” the Pride Society’s statement said.

“At a time when the federal government is exploring not just banning, but criminalizing conversion therapy it is shocking that we are having to hold the BC Liberal Party to account for the actions of one of their members.”

• READ MORE: VIDEO: Liberal bill outlaws conversion therapy for kids, non-consenting adults

Conversion therapy is pseudoscientific practice that aims to turn LGBTQ people straight.

“Conversion therapy is premised on a lie, that being homosexual, lesbian, bisexual or trans is wrong and in need of fixing,” Justice Minister David Lametti said in March after tabling the bill to ban the practice in the House of Commons.

In the statement from the Vancouver Pride Society, it said they use a “parade entrant matrix” that all entrants are scored against.

“These recent events have led us to re-score the application and find that the BC Liberal Party no longer meets the minimum requirement for participation.

“Vancouver Pride has requested that MLA Throness be sanctioned and that action minimally include removal from their role as Child Care Critic but ideally, expulsion from caucus. We encourage the BC Liberal Party to take the necessary action to make it clear to all that their organization does not tolerate homophobia and transphobia.”

An RV went up in flames in a suspicious early-morning fire in Chilliwack on Friday.

Around 5 a.m. on July 17, the Chilliwack Fire Department was called to the 50000-block of Yale Road where they found a recreational travel trailer fully engulfed in flames.

Crews from Halls 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 responded and quickly went to a defensive attack to stop the fire from damaging other buildings on site.

The RV sustained major damage as a result, and the fire is believed to be deliberately set. It is under investigation by Chilliwack Fire Department and RCMP.

There were no civilian or firefighter injuries.

An alleged drug dealer was arrested in Chilliwack thanks to an eagle-eyed RCMP officer on Wednesday.

In the late morning of July 15, RCMP officers saw a man making “hand-to-hand illegal drug sales” in the 46000-block of Yale Road and quickly arrested the 58-year-old Chilliwack man, Mounties said in a release Friday.

Police seized drugs believed to be fentanyl, as well as cash and evidence consistent with the sale of illegal drugs during the arrest.

The arrest was made by a Chilliwack Community Response Team (CRT) officer.

“CRT provides pro-active uniformed deployment to emerging community and public safety issues,” said RCMP spokesperson Cpl. Mike Rail. “The team focuses on an increased police visibility and response.”

RCMP later released the man from custody, and a report has been sent to the Public Prosecution Service of Canada for its assessment of Controlled Drug and Substance Act charges.

RCMP remind everyone who witnesses anything they believe to be suspicious in nature to contact the Chilliwack RCMP at 604-792-4611 or, should you wish to remain anonymous, call Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-8477 (TIPS).

The ongoing pandemic means the Fraser Valley British Motor Club’s Classic Car Show won’t be held in 2020.

The club had been planning to hold the car show on June 13 of this year but unfortunately due to COVID-19 it had to be cancelled, said Bruce Webster, one of the organizers.

Just like last year, the club is still trying to help raise funds to benefit the Chilliwack General Hospital, so the event has been tentatively re-scheduled for June 12, 2021.

The Classic Car Show was held at UFV for the first time in 2019, to allow car enthusiasts and collectors to showcase their plate eligible cars. It was also the first time in 25 years that the FVBMC event doubled as a fundraiser for Chilliwack General Hospital.

They had 170 cars on display on Caen Avenue in 2019. Based on the response after last year they had been expecting 25o to 270 might show up for 2020 before they had to cancel.

So interest is growing in the classic car show that was held at Minter Gardens for many years to show original, classic cars with no hot rods or modifieds allowed.

“We are still hoping our supporters will support the hospital in the interim,” Webster said. The funds going to CGH will be used replace aging equipment and technology.

See more photos at the end of the story. (Jenna Hauck/ The Progress)

The newly installed bike lanes on Broadway Street being welcomed by Chilliwack’s cycling community are causing quite a stir with residents.

Some are calling the freshly painted green-and-white lanes “confusing” and “stupid” as the lines zigzag along the length of Broadway.

There is a lot to take in driving the 2.3-kilometre stretch of the road. There are bike lanes both northbound and southbound, new parking areas on the west side, plastic bollards, plus the existing bus stops.

“The new bicycle lanes may present a bit of a learning curve for drivers, but we will do our best to help with this transition through public education and signage,” said councillor Jeff Shields, chair of the Transportation Advisory Committee for the City of Chilliwack.

It’s the southbound lanes that some residents have been saying are confusing, as the bike lane switches from being right next to the curb to beside the lane of traffic.

The width of Broadway is not consistent, so in some spots the placement of the southbound bike lane moves, like where bus stops are located.

Where the road was wide enough, the city wanted cyclists to be able to pass a stopped bus, and at the same time folks can get off the bus onto the sidewalk without having to cross the bike lane, said city engineering staff.

Where this was not possible, broken-line marks were put in the bike lane so that on the off chance a bus arrives while a cyclist is approaching, the bus can pull to the curb but the cyclists will have to stop and merge into the vehicle travel lane if it is safe to do so in order to pass the bus, city staff said.

The bike lanes on Broadway are part of the city’s Cycle Vision Plan, specifically the Airport-Broadway corridor. They provide buffered and protected on-street bicycle lanes to connect Chilliwack Proper with the cycling network.

READ MORE: Cycling network set to expand in Chilliwack

Buffered and protected bicycle lanes have additional painted lines and/or plastic bollards giving cyclists extra space between parked vehicles and traffic.

Buffered bicycle lanes will also be installed from the south end of the Valley Rail Trail along Britton Avenue and Spruce Drive to the neighbourhood bike route on Wiltshire Street. Protected bicycle lanes will be installed along the curve on Sheffield Way.

“When Chilliwack’s Cycle Vision Plan was developed in 2017, it included extensive community consultation, which demonstrated a strong desire by participants to safely share the roads through the development of more safe bicycle facilities,” Shields said.

Residents have also said there’s a problem with the new parking areas as they’ve been placed right in front of some driveways.

Broadway Street resident Janet MacNeil said within the first week she already had a number of people park in front of her driveway.

People pull into the parking space in front of her home and sit there for a while as they try to figure out where they are allowed to park, said MacNeil.

Many parking zones throughout the city cross people’s driveways, and drivers know that they aren’t to park in front of someone’s driveway. The only difference here is that the parking lane is offset from the curb, said engineering staff.

The city has put up educational signs to show residents where to park beside the bike lanes, plus letters were sent to all residents on the street explaining how to park.

MacNeil said the signage in front of her home is not in the ideal spot as it’s only located at the end of the designated parking area, not the beginning.

The project is not 100 per cent complete and is expected to be finished this week.

“I know the new bike lanes are a big change for the neighbourhood and I hope that we can help residents become more comfortable with this transition,” Shields said. “We are committed to providing safe bicycle lanes for the cycling community in Chilliwack and believe these lanes will help provide a safe way to share our roads.”

If a driveway is blocked, call the city’s bylaw office at 604-793-2908, or the RCMP after business hours, 604-702-4611.

946,946,1413,theprogress,https://www.theprogress.com/news/ndp-wants-chilliwack-kent-mla-removed-from-bc-liberal-caucus-for-alleged-homophobia/,NDP wants Chilliwack-Kent MLA removed from BC Liberal caucus for alleged homophobia – Chilliwack Progress,'Paul Henderson',2020-07-15,"Chilliwack-Kent MLA Laurie Throness’s unapologetic support for a Christian magazine that runs anti-LGBTQ articles has led to a request by a prominent NDP MLA to have him removed from the BC Liberal caucus.

In a letter sent to BC Liberal leader Andrew Wilkinson Wednesday morning, NDP MLA Spencer Chandra Herbert said if Throness is not removed from caucus, at the very least he should be removed from his role as opposition critic for the Ministry of Children and Family Development.

“Your Critic for the Ministry of Children and Families Laurie Throness went to media and insisted he will not stop advertising in this homophobic magazine,” Chandra Herbert wrote to Wilkinson. “He then defended an article supporting conversion therapy, as long as it didn’t include kidnapping or wasn’t too ‘coercive.’

“Sit with that for a second: the MLA you’ve put in charge of child care and supporting vulnerable children believes there is a place for conversion therapy.”

Chandra Herbert says it’s been 12 days since the leader tweeted that such views had no place in the BC Liberal party, yet Throness has defied his own party.

“If there is no room for homophobia and transphobia in your party, you will eject Laurie Throness from your caucus. Failing that, you will act and remove this MLA from his role as Children’s critic.”

See below for the full letter.

The controversy started when it came to light that Throness and several other MLAs, including Wilkinson, used taxpayer dollars to advertise in “The Light Magazine,” a Langley-based Christian publication that frequently runs articles that express antipathy towards the LGBTQ community in various ways.

At least three MLAs expressed dismay and apologized when they were asked about the advertising in the religious publication. Party leader Wilkinson similarly backed away from the advertising, suggesting in a Tweet there was no room for homophobia, transphobia, or any discrimination in the BC Liberal Party.

There is no room in the BC Liberal Party for homophobia, transphobia, or any other form of discrimination.

Going forward, we are taking immediate steps to ensure our advertising decisions reflect those values at all times. — Andrew Wilkinson (@Wilkinson4BC) June 30, 2020

BC Liberal MLA Todd Stone apologized for his constituency office’s connection to the magazine, and made it clear he did not support its messaging.

Several others, including Chilliwack MLA John Martin, who advertised in the publication, have been silent.

Throness, however, doubled down and told CTV News Vancouver that he will continue to advertise in the magazine as it aligns with his “Biblical Christian” values.

“Biblical Christians follow their Lord in their sexual practice. They don’t attack other people, they don’t condemn other people, because Jesus did not condemn other people,” Throness said.

“They withdraw from sex outside of a marriage between a man and a woman. That has nothing to do with intolerance, it has everything to do with following their conscience and following their Lord.”

And while he said one article in the magazine he supports is against “coercive conversion therapy” – kidnapping LGBTQ individuals to make them straight – he opposes a bill that would prevent conversion therapy because it “infringes upon Canadian freedoms” such as the “freedom of religion.”

Throness declined to comment on the matter when contacted by The Chilliwack Progress.

NDP MLA Spencer Chandra Herbert’s full letter to BC Liberal leader Andrew Wilkinson on July 15, 2020:

Leader of the Official Opposition,

Two weeks ago, we learned that the BC Liberal caucus spent thousands of public dollars advertising in Light Magazine, a publication that promotes homophobic, transphobic, and extreme anti-abortion views.

On behalf of my colleagues in the BC NDP caucus, I am writing first to thank you for your new commitment to ensure ‘there is no room in the BC Liberal Party for homophobia, transphobia, or any other form of discrimination.’

As you know, in the past I have expressed deep concern about anti-LGBTQ views from MLAs in your caucus. I remain concerned, and am writing to ask you for action.

Since your statement, some of the BC Liberal MLAs who placed ads apologized, and I thank them for acknowledging the harm caused by homophobic and transphobic practices like conversion therapy. Most did not. You committed that none of your MLAs would support this magazine again. But words are easy. Action is what counts.

Your Critic for the Ministry of Children and Families Laurie Throness went to media and insisted he will not stop advertising in this homophobic magazine. He then defended an article supporting conversion therapy, as long as it didn’t include kidnapping or was too ‘coercive.’

Sit with that for a second: the MLA you’ve put in charge of child care and supporting vulnerable children believes there is a place for conversion therapy.

Again – conversion therapy is a discredited, abusive practice where LGBTQ people are taught to hate themselves and convert to something they are not. It leads to self-harm, depression, and suicide. It is discriminatory. It is homophobic. It is transphobic. No science supports this abuse, and neither should the BC Liberal party’s lead on children and family issues.

It’s just the latest in a series of anti-LGBTQ views your MLA has shared:

– He refused to support adding gender identity or expression to the list of protections in the B.C. Human Rights Code.

– He has criticized SOGI 123 and claimed it would cause ‘mental health issues’ and ‘self-harm.’

– He defended Chilliwack School Trustee Barry Neufeld, calling him ‘a really great and good person’ after he was widely criticized for comparing gender transitioning to child abuse.

Beliefs like this should have no place in a political party – but even less so in the MLA you have entrusted with the well-being of vulnerable children.

It has been 12 days since your MLA defended conversion therapy and indicated that he will defy your direction. I have been disappointed to see no action from you during that time.

If there is no room for homophobia and transphobia in your party, you will eject Laurie Throness from your caucus. Failing that, you will act and remove this MLA from his role as Children’s critic.

I look forward to your response.

Sincerely,

Spencer Chandra Herbert

MLA, Vancouver-West End

The 16-unit supportive housing building for youth, seen here on Tuesday, July 14, 2020, is located at 46003 Mellard Ave. in Chilliwack. (Jenna Hauck/ The Progress)

New supportive housing for youth is opening this fall just off Young Road in downtown Chilliwack to give some young people a chance at a bright future.

It’s the next critical piece in the housing continuum for Chilliwack with this project offering housing specifically geared for youth who are experiencing homelessness — or at risk of it.

“Young people in our province should always have a safe and secure home,” said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing.

Many of the new residents who’ll be moving into the smart-looking building will be coming out of situations of abuse, poverty, exploitation and drugs.

The 2017 FVRD Homeless Count findings revealed that 50 out of the 221 people in Chilliwack who self-identified as homeless were youth under the age of 19. That means homeless kids accounted for 22 per cent of the 2017 total. Even worse young people made up 44 per cent of the total in the 2014 Homeless Count snapshot.

That high proportion of homeless youth is unique to Chilliwack in the Fraser Valley.

The residents of this new housing will get wrap-around support services and at least two staff members will be on site 24/7. The project was funded by the Province of B.C. with partners City of Chilliwack and Cyrus Centre, the service provider.

“Cyrus Centre is thrilled with the purchase of the Mellard Avenue property and recognizes this would not have been possible without the support of BC Housing, the mayor, council and City of Chilliwack staff,” said Les Talvio, executive director of the Cyrus Centre.

Located at 46003 Mellard Ave., the just-renovated building features eight one-bedroom suites and eight two-bedroom suites, each with its own washroom, kitchen and laundry facilities, for a total of 16 units. With only five beds at the existing Cyrus Centre in Chilliwack, the 16 additional new suites will make a big difference.

“Once again, Chilliwack is setting the standard for other communities to follow,” Talvio said. “This property will allow for youth to overcome barriers to housing and develop the skills necessary for success.”

Cyrus Centre is a proven housing provider in the non-profit sector in Abbotsford and Chilliwack, and will run the new housing facility, providing meals, clothing, advocacy, schooling, counselling and life-skills training.

The building was purchased for $3.89 million by the province through the Supportive Housing Fund. The City of Chilliwack chipped in $450,000.

“Chilliwack’s Homelessness Action Plan first identified the need for additional supportive youth housing in 2016, recognizing that youth experiencing homelessness are some of the most vulnerable members of our society,” said Ken Popove, mayor, City of Chilliwack. “We are pleased to support the province’s investment in our community and look forward to seeing the building open to its new residents.”

The building has been beautifully renovated with modern finishes. It has a shared kitchen, dining area, storage and amenity space, and a dedicated supportive services suite for on-site staff.

People living in the building will range from 16 and 24 years. Residents will apply through the Ministry of Children and Family Development or be self-referred. They won’t be required to be receiving services from the ministry to qualify.

“This new housing for youth is an important step to help them achieve their dreams and build the future they want and deserve,” said Katrine Conroy, Minister of Children and Family Development. “Ministry staff will be on hand to help youth access the resources they need and provide them with the right tools and supports so they can get back on their feet.”

Chilliwack resident Ben Stewart captured a remarkable image of the now famous Neowise comet from a dike along the Fraser River last week.

Stewart said it was at 2:45 a.m. on July 11 when he took the photo of the comet with his camera pointed north towards Harrison Hot Springs.

The comet, which is formally known as C/2020 F3 (NEOWISE), was discovered this year on March 27 by the NEOWISE Space Telescope.

Photos of the comet, which is visible to the naked eye, have been shared from all over the world.

• READ MORE: Once-in-a-lifetime comet photographed soaring over Abbotsford

Comet Neowise is a retrograde comet, meaning it orbits around the solar system in the opposite direction of the rotational axis of the Sun and planets.

NASA says the comet is about five kilometres across, and its tail is caused by its very close orbit around the Sun, heating its outer-ice layers and releasing gas and dust in a tail of debris.

Neowise is expected to remain visible throughout July, and orbit closest to Earth on July 23 at a distance of 103 million kilometres away, according to NASA.

951,951,1418,theprogress,https://www.theprogress.com/news/popkum-fire-chief-urges-caution-after-saturday-rescue-from-bridal-veil-falls/,Popkum fire chief urges caution after Saturday rescue from Bridal Veil Falls – Chilliwack Progress,'Emelie Peacock',2020-07-14,"The waterfall at Bridal Veil Falls Provincial Park is a popular photo spot, yet neighbouring Popkum Fire Department chief Walter Roos urges people to obey the signs and stop at the viewpoint as several rescues have to be done from the falls each year. Jenna Hauck/ The Progress

After an 11-year-old boy was rescued from Bridal Falls over the weekend, fire chief with the Popkum Fire Department is urging people to be careful when hiking to the falls.

Walter Roos said 10 members of his 20-member fire department responded to a call Saturday around 4 p.m. to help the ambulance service get the boy from the bottom of the falls to a waiting ambulance. Also on scene were the Kent Harrison Search and Rescue team, the RCMP and the BC Emergency Health Services – an estimated 25 people responding.

The boy reportedly tripped and fell backwards at the falls, about 25 to 30 feet down an embankment. He suffered a head injury but was alert, according to the crews on scene Saturday.

The fire department has specialized equipment for this very task, as they receive around three calls per year for rescues at the provincial park just off of Highway 1 between Chilliwack and Hope.

This time it was a straightforward response, Roos said, involving getting the patient ready for transfer, putting them onto a stretcher with wheels on the bottom, and ferrying them down to the bottom of the hiking trail. All-in-all it took around 45 minutes he said, as the boy was located at the lookout point of the falls.

The boy was stable when he was put into an ambulance, Roos said. Spokesperson with the RCMP in the upper Fraser Valley Cpl. Mike Rail said the boy was taken, with cuts and bruises, to hospital for precautionary measures.

Some rescues are significantly harder Roos said, involving local search and rescue teams performing rope rescues.

Follow signs, fire chief urges hikers

Roos said despite the falls being a relatively easy hike, it is very important to be prepared and adhere to the signage posted. This includes a warning sign at a lookout point below the falls, informing people not to proceed past the sign.

“Bridal Falls is gorgeous, but it’s gnarly. It’s always wet of course because of the spray,” he said, adding sometimes people hike with the wrong footwear. “They climb in flip flops, sandals, they do some rock climbing there with that on. There’s a fair amount of injuries because of that.”

City of Chilliwack officials are keeping a close eye on the RCMP unionization process knowing there could be future budget implications.

“We have been following the developments related to the unionization of RCMP members and know that this will impact our RCMP contract once an agreement is reached,” Mayor Ken Popove said.

It is not known when a collective agreement for rank-and-file Mounties will be finalized, according to an update from the Union of B.C. Municipalities (UBCM), but local governments have been advised to budget for anticipated increases ahead of time.

“We have been cautious with future estimates as we do not want to create tax increases that may be premature at this time,” Popove said.

Current practice at city hall is to budget incremental RCMP contract increases into the financial plan in anticipation, and to place any contract savings aside in reserve to help offset costs of future outcomes. There has also been a “pay-as-you-go” fiscal philosophy at Chilliwack City Hall for several administrations now.

“We will continue to watch for new developments and will make necessary budgetary amendments during our financial planning process,” Popove added.

The UBCM has been advocating for local government input into the bargaining process for RCMP members. Negotiations have been ongoing between the federal Treasury Board, and the National Police Federation (NPF), which became the bargaining agent representing RCMP in 2019.

While specific details around bargaining have not been released, “pay, resource levels and benefits” have been identified by RCMP as high priorities.

“While RCMP National Headquarters has instructed Divisions to project a 2.5 per cent per year pay increase retroactive to January 1, 2017, the current comparator police universe salaries suggest this annual projected rate is insufficient,” according to the UBCM release. “As such, local governments that utilize RCMP services are being advised to set aside additional funds in anticipation of higher costs, most notably increases to RCMP member remuneration.”

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was expected that a collective agreement would be signed in 2020.

The most recent RCMP member pay package expired on January 1, 2017, with local governments advised to hold budget savings in reserve for when a new pay package and/or contract is finalized, according to UBCM documents.

RCMP officials have estimated an annual member pay increase of 2.5 per cent, although rates and provisions of a contract could increase the retroactive pay impact beyond RCMP estimates.

Though the traditional Festival of the Arts is canceled for this year, the Festival Society has planned a number of cultural events for the near future, beginning with Will’s Jams in honour of the Festival Society’s annual Children’s Day.

There will be three shows on July 15 on Maple Street in Harrison Hot Springs at 11 a.m. , 12:30 p.m. and 2 p.m. Only 50 people will be allowed at any given gathering, which also accounts for the band, crew and volunteers, so space is limited to an audience of 35. Tickets are $6.

On Saturday, July 18, learn the secrets of traditional drum making from Darren Charlie of the Sts’ailes First Nation. The class takes place outside Memorial Hall in Harrison Hot Springs.

Charlie’s class will allow participants to create their own drum; the cost of admission depends on the size of drum you wish to make. Prices range from $37 to $182 for drums anywhere from seven inches to 20 inches.

This event will be physically distanced per provincial health guidelines related to COVID-19 and pre-registration is required.

As far as either event is concerned, anyone feeling sick or experiencing symptoms of COVID-19, including coughing, sore throat, fever and shortness of breath, is asked to stay home.

The Harrison Festival Society has had a successful summer so far, given the extreme circumstances brought on by the pandemic. The July 11 concert featuring Bentall Taylor Ulrich – the first of the summer – sold out within 14 hours of announcement.

“We then started to take down names for a wait list,” the most recent statement from the Festival Society reads. “When that list got as big as a full show, we added a third show and most of the tickets went to the people on the wait list. So with only one email and one Facebook post, we have three sold-out shows within just a few days.”

The BTU concert was professionally filmed and will be available soon through the Festival Society’s website.

Will Stroet of Will’s Jams performs interactive rock and pop songs with plenty of kid-friendly wordplay and catchy choruses. His work is famous CBC Kids, Universal Kids TV and children’s music as a whole, spreading positive messages like loving bike riding, cheering for libraries and making a strong case for vegetables.

Stoet is a JUNO nominee and recently released his 10th album, Rocks and Roots, which is nominated for a 2020 CFMA and WCMA. Rocks and Roots celebrates the natural world, outdoor activities and trying new things, hailed as “a masterpiece of creativity and fun, further cementing Will as the ultimate star of children’s rock ‘n’ roll.”

(Chris Woods)

People will once again be allowed to visit the O’Connor Group Art Gallery at the Chilliwack Cultural Centre, but only a handful of folks will be allowed in at a time.

After being closed for more than three months, the gallery doors will open today (July 8) for ‘Sandstorm,’ an exhibition by Chilliwack-based artist Chris Woods whose hyper-realistic work takes a look at the original Star Wars trilogy through the eyes of the antagonist Darth Vader.

The huge paintings in this famed series are based on screen captures from the genre-defining sci-fi action films.

Woods goes beyond the ‘good-guy, bad-guy’ Hollywood dichotomy by turning the narrative of the Star Wars trilogy inside out and exploring the idea that Vader’s history of personal trauma, isolation and abuse stands at the root of an adult who never truly had the chance to choose good over evil.

The re-opening of the gallery will limit patrons to five at a time to ensure proper physical distancing. Face masks covering both nose and mouth must be worn at all times by anyone entering the Chilliwack Cultural Centre, and enhanced operating protocol must be followed.

Many of Woods’ other paintings depict his immediate environment: close friends and the consumer landscape composed of malls, fast-food restaurants and 7-Elevens that surrounds them. He uses his friends as subjects, painting them against a backdrop of belligerent branding, pop-culture symbols, and omnipresent advertising.

Woods has exhibited 18 solo shows since 1988, and appeared in numerous group shows in Canada and the United States. His work is held in numerous public and private collections worldwide, and has appeared in Naomi Klein’s book No Logo as well as magazines like Saturday Night and Adbusters.

Sandstorm will be on display in the art gallery from Wednesday, July 8 to Friday, August 17. Gallery hours are from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., Monday to Friday (closed on holidays). Admission is free.

Joanie Loves Chachi is a three-piece band of high school friends that was formed in 1996. Their sound blends irresistibly catchy melodies with fist-pumping, foot-stomping rhythms.

As with many bands, releasing an album amid the COVID-19 pandemic was a first for them.

Despite the dampening effect that the pandemic has had, they are experiencing some success on the North American College Radio Charts, debuting in a few top tens including number one in Glasboro, New Jersey, said Dean Young, one of the founding members.

The band is looking forward to playing live gigs again.

“We have a few other things going on right now as we are ramping up for release shows, anxiously awaiting the lifting of gathering restrictions to determine when and where those will be,” Young said.

During the early 2000s Joanie Loves Chachi caught the attention of music supervisors for the Space Channel series Alienated and as a result, some of their music from their first album ‘Please Keep Of The Grass’ was used in a few episodes of the show.

My Brother’s Karate was recorded at Raincity Recorders in Vancouver and was produced by Jesse Gander.

You can purchase a digital download of the album on Spotify, Google Play, Apple Music, iTunes and Deezer.

(Submitted/ The Progress)

It was a sight to see.

A half dozen volunteers rolled countless clothing racks down a downtown Chilliwack street, with smiles wide enough to be seen from the heavens.

It all began Friday last week, when Kathy Van Muyen, manager of the Chilliwack Mission Thriftstore II called up Auld Phillips, just a few doors down the street. They had heard the news that the iconic women’s clothing store was closing, and wanted to purchase some clothing racks.

The thrift shop had been planning to buy new ones back in March, just prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. But being closed for two months, like many organizations, they had put that purchase on the back burner.

“We had heard that Auld Phillips was closing their doors, which is sad news to the community,” Van Muyen said. “They have been an icon here in the downtown area. However with their store closing we saw a possible opportunity of acquiring some of their store fixtures.”

She was told over the phone that everything would be taken to the Auld Phillips warehouse, but they were free to come look at what was leftover on Monday.

“We were a bit disappointed at first but we were excited to see what they did have left for us to purchase,” Van Muyen said. “(On) Monday morning, a volunteer and I walked over.”

What they found when they arrived was unbelievable, she said.

They were told to take as many racks and fixtures as they needed. And the best part? They could take them for free.

“The only catch was that we needed to remove them by Tuesday afternoon,” she said. “As we walk back to our store, we are pinching each other, because we can’t believe this is real. This was an answer to prayer and is such an incredible blessing.”

By Tuesday they had rallied a small army of volunteers to move the racks from the Auld Phillips, which was on Yale and Nowell, down the street to the thift store.

“And then after store hours yesterday with the help of more volunteers we changed all the clothing racks! Our store looks amazing,” Van Muyen said.

All that is to say the popular downtown thrift store is open, newly organized and ready to welcome shoppers back.

“And we want to acknowledge Auld Phillips and thank them publicly for their gracious gift,” she added. “This was way more than what we expected and we are so very thankful to them.”

(Submitted/ The Progress)

A few lucky moviegoers will get a chance to go to a drive in right in Chilliwack.

Star Wars: Rise of the Skywalker will air on July 10 in the parking lot of Cottonwood Centre, and all the proceeds from donations gathered will go toward the Chilliwack Bowls of Hope Society.

The event is being brought to town by Fresh Air Cinema, the group that regularly sets up free movies around towns throughout the summer on their outdoor screens.

The Star Wars showing is a fundraiser, and they are asking for a minimum donation of $30 per car, for those who can afford to do so. There are only 50 cars allowed at the screening, and tickets went on “sale” through an Eventbrite page on July 2. Donations are being collected on site.

Because it is a fundraiser with limited attendance available, they are requesting that anyone who cannot use their ticket let them know as soon as possible so they can be re-released to the public.

The sound for the movie will run through your vehicle’s FM stereo. The gates will open at 8:35 p.m. and the movie will start at about 9:25 p.m.

There are social distancing rules in place, which are available on the Eventbrite page and the event’s Facebook page, called FortisBC FreshAirCinema:Chilliwack – Star Wars Rise of Skywalker.

There will be second film shown on Saturday, July 11. Onward will air at 9:25 p.m.

(Jenna Hauck/ The Progress)

Dozens of kids will stay busy this summer by assembling workshop kits, thanks to Home Depot and the University of the Fraser Valley (UFV).

On Wednesday, employees with UFV picked up more than 100 kits which will be handed out to Chilliwack kids and their families as part of their COVID-19 project called Community Craft Time, which began back in May.

The kits were donated by Home Depot in Chilliwack and include 48 seed starter planters, plus dozens of Christmas countdown calendar kits and ornament kits in the shape of a stocking.

Home Depot also donated paint, paint brushes, soil, lettuce seeds, kids aprons and other supplies for the initiative.

“It’s great for the community and great for the kids,” said Aaron Hale, store manager.

Typically, the kits are used during the store’s regular kids workshop classes which draw an average of 120 kids every month.

Now the kits are being put to use again after the in-store workshops were cancelled due to COVID-19.

The seed planters and Christmas kits will be handed out to local Indigenous families with young children, people living in The Family Centre at Ruth and Naomi’s, and participants with Chilliwack Community Services.

The Home Depot workshop kits are one of four arts-and-craft kits that employees at UFV have put together. The others were rock-painting kits, woven paper basket kits and thank-you cards for health-care workers.

The Fraser Valley Regional Library (FVRL) has been bringing virtual story times to Chilliwack for the past few months, but an upcoming one will be a lot more colourful than all the others.

In celebration of Fraser Valley Pride week (July 10 to 18) Chilliwack librarians Julie Penner and Janet Woyke have put together a pride story time and craft video.

“The library is a place of promoting diversity and inclusion of all people,” Penner said.

This isn’t the first video they’ve worked on together where Penner reads stories and Woyke teaches a craft or activity.

For the special pride video, Penner will be reading from the book What makes us unique: Our first talk about diversity. It’s a Canadian children’s picture book by Dr. Jillian Roberts.

“It’s actually very beautiful. It talks about all the different people in the world and how we all need love and we all need kindness,” Penner said. “It’s just such a nice message overall.”

The story is geared towards preschoolers, but elementary kids can also learn from it, she added.

When the story is finished, Woyke will show kids how to make rainbow-coloured friendship bracelets.

She will describe how to make three different styles of bracelets using a forward knot, a half-hitch knot and a simple braid for younger kids.

They filmed the video in the rainbow crosswalk at the University of the Fraser Valley on June 26. When Penner and Woyke reached out to UFV, not only were they happy to let the two onto university property, but they also blocked the road and provided security.

“We’re really thankful to UFV,” Penner said.

The pride story time comes on the heels of their ‘Explorytime’ project.

Penner describes Explorytime as “story times on the go” and it is part of the FVRL’s Summer Reading Club program.

READ MORE: Summer Reading Club still a go, just different says Chilliwack librarian

The first Explorytime was a fairy-themed video where Penner and Woyke got dressed up in woodland fairy costumes to read a story and show kids how to make a magic wand, fairy crown and fairy dolls.

It was filmed in the River’s Edge Fairy Village near the Vedder River and released on June 25 on the Chilliwack, Sardis and Yarrow FRVL Facebook pages as well as on the FVRL YouTube channel.

Future Explorytimes include bird-watching at the Great Blue Heron Nature Reserve and “sky-watchers” filmed at the Dark Sky Park (McDonald Park) in Abbotsford.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, FVRL has been offering virtual story times, baby times, podcasts and how-to videos for teens and adults.

Although the pride story time is not an official Explorytime video, it’s in the same style where kids get a story plus a craft in the seven-minute long video.

It’s also a great way for kids to learn about diversity, something that is near to Penner’s heart.

Her interest in the LGBTQ community came a number of years ago when she did a research project while studying at the University of the Fraser Valley around 2008. Her project was on LGBTQ elders living in seniors homes and the abuse they had suffered.

“I cried so many times. I could not believe the abuse that was happening to these older people,” she recalled.

Now she and Woyke are teaching kids at a young age about the importance of acceptance and kindness.

“It’s one of my core beliefs that all people should be free to be themselves and to love whomever they choose,” Penner said.

The pride story time video will be released on Tuesday, July 14 at 10:30 a.m. You can find it on the FVRL’s main Facebook page; the Facebook pages of the Chilliwack, Sardis and Yarrow libraries; and the FVRL YouTube channel.

There was little pomp and no ceremony (yet) this year for the graduating class of University of the Fraser Valley (UFV).

Due to COVID-19, UFV was forced to postpone its usual June convocation ceremonies.

However, UFV still recognized award winners in a variety of ways, and ensured every graduating student received their credential parchment in the mail and a special box containing a graduation cap and tassel, a Class of 2020 banner with a congratulatory message on the back from the Alumni Association, a package of seed-based confetti to match the “celebrate and grow” theme in the box and a congratulatory message from president Joanne MacLean.

Maclean and several of the academic deans made special trips to award winners’ houses to present medals.

The Governor General’s Gold Medal for top student in a master’s degree program went to Kelly Ridder of Abbotsford, who earned a perfect 4.33 GPA while pursuing her master of social work.

The Governor General’s Silver Medal for top bachelor’s degree student went to Shanna Yaroshuk of Surrey, who earned a bachelor of arts in child and youth care.

The Governor General’s Bronze Medal for top student from a two-year program went to Shelby Klassen of Abbotsford, who earned an agriculture technology diploma.

The Lieutenant Governor’s Medal went to Tsandlia Van Ry of Chilliwack, who was also the student speaker for the faculty of professional studies.

Dean’s medalists were Aisa Dobie of Abbotsford (science), Navdeep Rai of Abbotsford (health sciences), Kim Abram of Pitt Meadows (professional studies), Emily Drew (integrated studies), Hayley Ross (social sciences), and Laura Vanspronsen (humanities).

Student speakers were Owen Crocker (arts), Amy Mueller (health sciences), Tsandlia Van Ry (professional studies), Nicoline Bos (applied and technical studies) and Marcus Grymonpre (applied and technical studies).

There is no doubt the COVID-19 pandemic has affected everyone in some way.

Jobs have been lost, schools closed, gyms a no-go. And although restrictions have eased and places have reopened as B.C. has moved through Phase 2 and into Phase 3, there are still a lot of activities that we’re missing.

Sports and recreation is just one of them.

Here’s a look back at some historic images taken from 1910 to the mid-60s in Chilliwack. Some are posed sports team photos like a girls hockey team and the Coqualeetza Residential School’s basketball team. Others are action shots like the “Cultus Lake Indian Festival” (now called the Cultus Lake Water Sports War Canoe Races) and the 11th annual Chilliwack Bonspiel.

Even though these images of sporting events are more than 50 years old, they’re still very relevant today.

They’re snapshots of the things some people miss the most.

People still enjoy playing baseball with their friends, kids still get excited when they lace up their ice skates, and parents still cheer when their child scores a goal.

We’ve missed all of that and much more during the pandemic, but let’s stay positive, Chilliwack.

One day soon these photographic moments will come to life again.

The University of the Fraser Valley men’s and women’s golf teams are poised for conference competition this fall. The Canada West conference announced Wednesday that plans to stage the CW golf championships in October will proceed. The decision was made Wednesday via a vote of all 17 CW members, following recommendations from the conference’s Board of Directors, which were informed by the CW COVID-19 Task Force.

Whether the championships are ultimately staged is contingent on health and safety considerations across Western Canada, as British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba continue to manage COVID-19 in their respective provinces.

The CW Golf Championships, hosted by UBC Okanagan in Kelowna, are scheduled for the Okanagan Golf Club, Oct. 2-4.

With Wednesday’s announcement, the Cascades men’s and women’s golf programs are poised to be the only UFV varsity teams to participate in conference play this fall. Beyond the CW championships, there is a chance that the Cascades could also tee off in additional invitational tournaments against other B.C. universities.

Canada West had previously announced on June 8 that all first term team sports – soccer, football, field hockey, and rugby 15s – wouldn’t proceed, and that all two-term sports – basketball, volleyball, and hockey – would start no sooner than January 2021 with reduced schedules. A decision on the commencement of two-term sports and second term championship sports – including wrestling – will be made no later than Oct. 8. Of the sports listed, UFV competes in soccer, basketball, volleyball and wrestling.

Golf has weathered the COVID-19 pandemic better than most sports, as an outdoor activity where physical distancing is relatively easy to maintain. Golf courses have been able to remain open in B.C. during the pandemic, with modifications.

Additionally, CW announced Wednesday that plans to host the conference swimming championships at the University of Calgary will also move forward, albeit in 2021 (dates TBA). The swim championships had originally been scheduled for November 2020. It was also decided that the CW cross country championships, scheduled to be hosted by the University of Saskatchewan, will not be staged this season. The COVID-19 Task Force felt that the necessary risk mitigations – reduction of team complement, altered start, creating defined passing areas, or hosting regional championships (one B.C., one Prairie) – would too significantly impact the integrity of the championships. UFV does not compete in swimming or cross country running.

“I’d like to thank our COVID-19 Task Force along with the scheduled hosts of our fall championship sports for the work that went into informing today’s vote,” said CW President Clint Hamilton. “While we are disappointed that cross country champions won’t be crowned this fall, we will proceed optimistically with plans for the CW Golf Championships and remain hopeful for delivering swimming in the second term.”

Coach Victory Shumbusho walked around the north endzone at Exhibition Stadium, surrounded by dozens of flat multi-colored pylons, laid out to accommodate drills for a dozen or so teenage boys.

From above you can imagine it looking like a bag of Skittles spilled out on the field, but this is how soccer is adapting, to get players back on the pitch in a pandemic. There is no contact allowed, so everything is ball on foot with a focus on passing and first touches as the boys weave through and around the pylons.

“A lot of players have not been training at all because they weren’t allowed to go to a field at all, so the point of this camp is to get them outside, get them touches on the ball and build up their fitness because the season is going to start very soon,” Shumbusho explained. “Given the circumstances we’re having, we have to follow the rules of COVID and be more creative coming up with sessions that will work on the passing and dribbling. So how do you do that and still have a very effective session?

“So far it’s been good, with the coaches coming together with ideas.”

At the end of a Monday morning practice, Shumbusho had three players inside a rectangular box, moving and passing.

He said it’s a challenge keeping young players at an appropriate distance from each other, because they want to talk and socialize, but when they’re into a drill and staying at least six feet apart, he’s enjoyed coaching with a focus on technical soccer.

He said it may be a blessing in disguise having players ‘limited’ to skills drills.

“Most of the time, you train with a team and you focus collectively as a team, but with this most players are focusing on their technical ability in their own space,” Shumbusho said. “They’re developing skills they’ll need individually, and I feel when players are good individually and they come together collectively, the team is even stronger.

“The more they improve their ball control and dribbling and what I call their ‘skill bag,’ the better they’re going to be when we’re back into normal training.”

The downside comes after the practice when dozens of pylons need to be picked up.

“Normally we’d have the players do this,” he said with a laugh and a smile. “But with COVID and maybe spreading the virus, we have to.”

The Chilliwack Sports Hall of Fame and Chilliwack Ringette Association are holding a golf tournament fundraiser in August.

The Chilliwack Ringette Association and the Chilliwack Sports Hall of Fame (CSHOF) have teamed up to host a fundraiser golf tournament at the Chilliwack Golf Club August 17. Proceed from the event will be shared between both non-profit societies, which work year-round to promote sport in Chilliwack.

The Chilliwack Sports Hall of Fame recognizes and promotes sporting excellence in Chilliwack through annual inductions and displays.

The Chilliwack Ringette Association has 70 members who play, coach and volunteer.

“Working together allows our groups to pool resources and to deliver an event that goes beyond raising money for sport, but also allows us to come together as a sports community and a ringette family,” said Chilliwack Ringette president Mike Kinar. “Our association will not be able to do our usual fundraising events this season due to the pandemic, so every little bit we raise will help us continue to provide a low-cost team ice sport for the community.”

The partnership formed as both societies look for ways to engage their members during the challenging times of the pandemic.

“Golf is one of the few sports that we can participate in from a safe distance from one another right now” said CSHOF president Shannon Bettles. “Our society had to postpone this year’s induction event. The golf tournament provides an opportunity to put our volunteers to work promoting the Hall of Fame and local sports organizations. We want to help create a fun event where people can get outdoors, make memories, and support one another.”

The tournament will follow all of the safety guidelines of the provincial health officer, as well as the Chilliwack Golf Club. First tee times start at 10:30 a.m.

Registration for the tournament is available through the Chilliwack Sports Hall of Fame and Chilliwack Ringette Association websites.

Doing it in a global pandemic is doubly difficult

Starting a team from scratch in any sport is no easy task.

Doing so during a global pandemic adds an extra level of complexity that Clayton Robinson would rather not have.

But the building of the brand new junior B Chilliwack Jets goes on because it must.

On the ice, Robinson has announced several new players in recent weeks, keeping the Jets Twitter feed busy.

As he said he would, Robinson has constructed a roster that is heavy on local talent. Of the 18 skaters currently listed at chilliwackjets.com, nine are from Chilliwack, two are from Hope, two are from Mission and one apiece hail from Abbotsford and Fort Langley.

“It hasn’t been as challenging as I thought it’d be,” Robinson said. “The only difference is we haven’t been able to have an (evaluation) camp, but luckily I wasn’t starting completely from scratch.

“I had a head scout, Cam Miller, with the Nanaimo Buccaneers (of the Vancouver Island Junior B Hockey League) who followed me to Chilliwack and we’ve been able to use the information he brought with him. And we’ve definitely tried to get as many local players as we can.”

READ MORE: Chilliwack Jets to play out of Sardis Sports Complex

READ MORE: Clayton Robinson trying to get junior B team for Chilliwack

Robinson also had the advantage of having coached several of his current players a few years back at the midget level.

His first addition, via trade, was Chilliwack kid Dylan Devers.

“I’ve known Dylan since he was 15 years old,” Robinson said. “He played for me here and played for me in Nanaimo. He’s helped a lot bringing some of these local guys back together.

“A lot of it is word of mouth too with guys I’ve gotten to know in the hockey world, and I think we’ve found some diamonds in the rough.”

Off the ice, it’s been more challenging than it might usually be getting sponsorship dollars in a tough business climate.

The camp that Robinson couldn’t hold because of COVID-19 restrictions would have been a revenue generator, and it’s tough approaching business people who are busy trying to survive.

That’s why Robinson hasn’t gone all-in pursuing sponsorships yet.

“We haven’t really gotten out there too much, but people have been quite generous so far,” he said. “We’re leaving things be a little because in the first year it doesn’t matter if we make the revenue at the beginning of the year or the end of the year.

“I’d almost rather wait until things smooth out a bit before we push.”

The PJHL is a pay-to-play league, and revenue from players is a big part of the bottom line.

On the plus side, the Jets will also have advertising revenue from whatever goes on the walls at the new Sardis Sports Complex rink.

“It’s a bare building with nothing in there, so there’s a lot of work to do,” Robinson said. “Luckily for us, myself and my partners have strong ties to the community and I think we’ll do okay. I think the more we get out there, the more people know about the team and how local we are, the more they’ll support us.”

The team ran its first full practice Monday night, with 15 guys on the ice for a no-contact physically-distanced workout at the Chilliwack Coliseum, which gave Robinson a reminder of why he’s doing what he’s doing.

“It’s tons of fun and I’m loving it,” Robinson said. “It’s a job but it’s not a job, talking hockey with people 24/7.

“All of it’s like living my dream.”

The Chilliwack Golf Club and title sponsor Langley Concrete Group will host the 2020 Men’s Open golf tournament July 11-12.

The annual tourney draws many of British Columbia’s most notable players in the game year.

“The Chilliwack Men’s Open is one of British Columbia’s longest running open tournaments,” said Chilliwack Golf Club general manager Bryan Ewart. “We are very fortunate to attract such a strong field every year.

“This year’s roster includes defending professional champion John Mlikotic. John recently won the Vancouver Golf Tour Chilliwack Championship in a field which included PGA tour player Nick Taylor. It will be an exciting year with lots of up-and-coming professionals and amateurs.”

READ MORE: Nick Taylor Charity Pro-Am raises more than $100,000

READ MORE: Provincial golf championships go ahead with COVID-19 protocols

Mlikotic won last year’s tourney in thrilling fashion, holding off challenges from Brad Clapp and Bryn Parry.

Those two tied for second place, three points behind the leader.

It’s a challenging year to host any sporting event, and Ewart acknowledged there will be changes at this year’s tournament. But he believes organizers can succeed in creating something that is fun and competitive while also being safe. Among the alterations is a reduced field of 150 golfers with no caddies allowed for pros or amateurs.

Familiar features from prior years missing this year include the Friday Night Horse Race, 15th Hole Beer Garden and the Saturday Night Party.

But the tournament does include a cash skins game and a first place grand prize of $2,000.

There will be a $500 prize for the Chilliwack Golf Club pro winner.

There will be four amateur flights.

1000,1000,1467,theprogress,https://www.theprogress.com/opinion/column-an-open-letter-to-my-fellow-straight-white-males/,COLUMN: An open letter to my fellow straight white males – Chilliwack Progress,'Paul Henderson',2020-07-16,"We’ve had one hell of a run these past few thousand years but maybe it’s time to share

An open letter to my fellow white, heterosexual, males:

Boys, we have had one hell of a run.

It’s been a blast for the past 12,000 years or so since the agricultural revolution when humans started to move from hunter-gatherer societies to settling down and growing crops and mastering the art of animal husbandry.

Along the way, let’s be honest, many of us straight white males (SWMs) haven’t been super nice. We ended up with a world where – in Europe and in North America at least – we took charge, took credit the work of others, and profited on the backs of women, slaves, and indentured servants.

Decade by decade, those we took advantage of may have clawed back one tiny bit of recognition and apology after another, whether it was women, or descendants of Black slaves, or Chinese head-tax payers, or Indigenous victims of Canada’s attempted cultural genocide.

After some (not very) civil disputes in the U.S., we finally decided to free the slaves, which was pretty nice of us. Right?

We apologized to the Chinese Canadians. You’re welcome.

We also decided to let women vote and do other stuff that even incompetent white men are allowed to do.

You know: drive, sit on juries, have jobs.

As for Indigenous people? Please hold, it’s coming. (I’m told.)

• READ MORE: B.C. touts Indigenous reconciliation in protest-delayed throne speech

• READ MORE: B.C. apologizes for historic anti-Chinese laws, ‘head tax’ – 2014

The LGBTQ community? Well, we legalized sexual activity in 1969. And us SWMs listened to Frankie Goes to Hollywood in the 1980s, and watched Will and Grace in the 1990s, didn’t we? We allowed the entertainment industry to create a whole bunch of shows that included many (mostly white) homosexual (mostly male) characters.

Listen, we are not bad people. Sure we get Tasered and carded and harassed way less often than people of colour. Sure the worst of us spent decades physically bashing, emotionally torturing, and professionally oppressing members of the LGBTQ community. And some of us haven’t always treated women the way they should be treated.

But it’s not our fault, we were born this way.

White privilege? Sure, it’s pretty sweet to be born a straight white male, but many say that is not our collective fault. There has been a lot of white privilege pushback in recent days, many SWMs – others too – claim that it’s not a thing.

At the risk of being shunned by some of you, my fellow SWMs, I think it might be time we take a back seat. If not a back seat, can some of us at least ride shotgun for a bit?

No one is asking SWMs to be eliminated from the planet. They aren’t shipping boatloads of us in chains to unknown worlds, and horrific futures of permanent slavery. No one is trying to erase our culture, whatever that exactly is. But some are asking we be a little more inclusive and accepting.

While those in our SWM ranks, such as Don Cherry, accuse “you people” (i.e. immigrants of colour) of stealing from us, what is generally sought by people of colour, women, the LGBTQ community, isn’t more than we have or frankly even as much. For the past few hundred years, all “they” have been looking for is something at all.

• READ MORE: VIDEO: Don Cherry says he was fired, not sorry for ‘Coach’s Corner’ poppy rant

Recently the voices have been getting louder suggesting the scraps we threw off the side of the table weren’t enough.

Guys, let’s stop getting so defensive. “Straight pride? Male pride? White pride?” Please. That’s what the last 12,000 years has been all about.

As I said, boys, it’s been a hell of a run.

We’ve been metaphorically standing on the neck of so many people for so long that I don’t think we can cry about them scratching at our ankles, telling us they can’t breathe.

To my fellow SWMs who have been resisting, please pull the car over. Take your hands off the wheel, sit in the passenger seat and just observe, maybe listen for a bit.

It doesn’t have to be emasculating or an existential threat.

Let’s just learn to take turns.

Make no mistake, things are a lot better for the non-SWM community today than they were even 20, 100, or certainly 1,000 years ago, but clearly we still have a ways to go.

I find it hard to imagine a country without police. They save more lives than they take. They provide support to families of violence. They are usually the first ones on the scene of accidents where they deal with all kinds of horrible things most of us never see.

To tar them all with the same brush is ridiculous. I wonder what these people demanding change expect from them. I’m no angel and I’ve had several dealings with the police but I was taught to respect them and I’ve never treated them with malice.

When you’re caught, you’re caught. Give up and take your lumps.

Who are you going to call when your door is kicked in by home invaders? Who’s going to come looking for that lost child or run up to a burning car and pull an unconscious person out of it?

The actions of a few rotten eggs shouldn’t taint the actions of the brave, good-hearted and hard-working men and women that sacrifice their lives every day so that we can live in peace.

Where are all the people that police have touched their lives in a positive way? They must outnumber the ones who have nothing good to say? I have a hard time believing those people speaking negative about the police are angels and have never crossed the line between legal and illegal behaviour.

Re: “Controversy over MLAs buying ads in B.C. magazine that opposes trans rights.” Story posted June 30, 2020 at www.theprogress.com.

Dear Mr. Andrew Wilkinson, and members of the BC Liberal caucus:

I was very disappointed by the apology… because you dared to advertise in a Christian publication. That is a reason to apologize?

You have been bullied and you have surrendered. The LGBTQ community will call us homophobes and accuse us of the very actions they are taking to persecute and bully us for our beliefs and our faith.

• READ MORE: NDP wants Chilliwack-Kent MLA removed from BC Liberal caucus for alleged homophobia

And the destruction of our families and our society as we have known it is happening and we have closed our eyes.

The distraction of COVID-19, climate change, riots and ‘racial inequality’ are not the real problems we face.

The real problem is a lack of will to stand up for moral values, to love and respect all people equally, and have the courage to stick to our moral values, while loving and respecting those who accuse and persecute us.

I am not condemning the LGBTQ community nor do I judge or persecute them. They too are my brothers and sisters.

The attacks by the LGBTQ community and those who have a ‘progressive’ agenda – stealing the minds of our children in our schools; the purposeful and treasonous attacks of extremists both ‘right’and ‘left’ on our values and religious ideals, and especially the consistent attacks on our families and family values, are leading to destruction.

The Communist Manifesto states that the Communist goal is to destroy the family, the church and the state.

We are in crisis and I pray that you will stand up for all our freedoms in this province and not exclude religious people. That is what your apology did.

That is persecution of those who have Christian, or Jewish, or Hindu or Islamic values, which are strong, healthy families which will lead to a strong healthy society.

I hope you have the courage to respond to all the people of British Columbia.

Re: “Mayor recognizes we haven’t always dealt with racism well,” Progress Letters, July 2, 2020.

While research has shown that infants demonstrate an innate preference for adults of their own race, any future racist tendencies generally are environmentally acquired.

One way of rectifying this bias is by allowing young children to become accustomed to other races in a harmoniously positive manner.

Adult racist sentiments, however, are often cemented by a misguided yet strong sense of entitlement, perhaps also acquired from rearing.

Fortunately, at an impressionably young age I was emphatically told by my mother about the exceptionally kind and caring nature of our Black family doctor.

She never had anything disdainful to say about people of colour. In fact, she loves to watch/listen to the Middle Eastern and Indian subcontinental dancers and musicians on the multicultural channels. She only saw/sees what is in one’s heart.

Conversely, if she’d told me the opposite about the doctor, et cetera, I could’ve aged while blindly linking his colour with an unjustly cynical view of him and all Black people.

When angry, my (late) father occasionally expressed displeasure with Anglo immigrants, largely due to his own experiences with bigotry as a new Canadian citizen in the 1950s and ’60s.

Like mom he emigrated from Eastern Europe and didn’t resent non-white immigrants, for he realized they had things at least as bad. Plus he noticed – as I also now do – in them an admirable absence of a sense of entitlement.

Thus essentially by chance I reached adulthood unstricken by uncontrolled feelings of racial contempt seeking expression.

Not as lucky, some people – who may now be in an armed authority capacity – were raised with a distrust or blind dislike of other racial groups.

The first step towards changing our irrationally biased thinking is our awareness of it and then its origin.

But until such progress, racist sentiments must be either suppressed or professionally dealt with, especially when considering the mentality is easily inflamed by anger. For, great harm can come to those unjustly exposed to the racism, including the racists’ own susceptible young children.

Well that was a Canada Day to remember. Or to forget.

No public fireworks display. No big party. For many of us a day to celebrate something, anything even, actually would have been what the doctor ordered. For some, however, there was nothing to celebrate at.

Families did gather for celebrations on July 1, and with somewhat expanded bubbles, many joined with friends, too.

The COVID-19 pandemic has paralyzed some aspects of our lives, temporarily and permanently transformed others, and it has shifted our perspectives on a great many things.

As if trying to deal with the financial and health ramifications of the novel coronavirus wasn’t enough, we are all now facing the reality of taking a long, hard look at systemic racism in society and in our institutions.

Two giant subjects thrust upon us at the same time.

• READ MORE: Conversation about racism an opportunity to shut up and speak up

• READ MORE: COLUMN: The call for full-scale economic reopening is an argument to cull the herd

It’s easy to feel smug as a Canadian when one puts on a nationalist lens and sees how badly many U.S. states have done to (not) deal with COVID-19 in a culture of misinformation and denial. Then there is the treatment of minorities at the hands of some police in America.

So you think cops in Toronto have a problem with racism? You think Quebec’s pandemic response was bad? Take a look at Minneapolis or New York City on the former. And New York State and Texas on the latter.

But none of this is a competition and relativism is a risky game. We’ve had our own missteps in Canada, and we had a tragic lack of preparedness nationwide for this pandemic, according to some experts.

Sandy Buchman, president of the Canadian Medical Association said the country should have been better prepared and he made it clear recently in a number of media interviews that Canada had “not planned appropriately over time.”

A lack of a timely and co-ordinated response exacerbated the crisis, and continues to do so here in Canada. Yet Canadians can be easily distracted by POTUS Tweets, and clips of him complaining that too much testing was leading to too many cases.

On racism, it’s too easy to look south of the border and put your face in your palm. But every day right here in Canada on the streets and in hospitals and courtrooms and homeless shelters we see the legacy of the genocidal residential school system where the nation attempted, nearly successfully, to culturally erase the Indigenous population of this beautiful land, the land that those of use who are not Indigenous call Canada.

On the topic of COVID-19 in Canada, with a Libertarian lens, every government intervention feels like an attack on deeply held beliefs, even if the reason is to protect the most vulnerable.

On systemic racism in policing, that is a matter hotly up for debate to be sure, but that it is a debate at all is troubling.

Clearly we are doing better in Canada than they are in the U.S. on these subjects. Even the otherwise bombastic Ontario Premier Doug Ford has been almost statesmanlike as he has responded to the crisis in a way that has shocked his critics.

Politicians from opposition parties at the federal and provincial level here in B.C. have been similarly measured and mature, rarely looking to score cheap political points as the Trudeau Liberals in Ottawa and the Horgan New Democrats in Victoria do what they can to implement the recommendations by experts in public health to prevent our communities from serious infection levels as we have seen, and are still seeing, in other parts of the world.

The Conservatives in Ottawa and the BC Liberals may be increasingly critical of government, but that is their mandated role, and they have been uniquely Canadian in their restraint as those in power struggle with a pandemic the world hasn’t seen in 100 years.

It is pretty great to be Canadian and it can be agonizing to see some of the behaviour that goes on south of the border.

But we aren’t perfect, we shouldn’t be smug, we can always strive to be better.

Moving past Canada Day, let’s just say the cup is half full and, hopefully, we’ll see you on Canada Day 2021.

As we celebrated Canada’s 153rd birthday, most of us did so in a small social bubble of immediate family, and possibly close friends.

For many of us, this Canada Day was the quietest one of our lifetime; no parade, no huge celebration with live entertainment in the park, no free cake (which hurts some of us more than others).

We are now at the halfway point of 2020, a year that will go down in history as one of the most compelling years certainly of the last half-century.

Obviously, the COVID-19 pandemic has dominated the newsfeeds and that won’t change anytime soon.

It will be interesting to see how society changes, once we get past this latest health crisis.

On a more humanitarian level, 2020 has produced a long-overdue uprising from the populace, demanding systematic change for the way society treats non-Caucasians in predominantly white nations.

The Black Lives Matter rallies have brought much-needed attention to the daily struggles of visible minorities in our society.

It is important to note, however, that in order for these movements to have any long-lasting effect, the messages must continue to be heard. These changes will not happen overnight.

The feminist movement has been happening for more than 100 years, and the inequalities are still rampant throughout the world.

The LGBTQ community has been battling for equal rights for nearly as long, and there is still a long way to go.

Not surprisingly, as the liberal voice grows louder, in support of equality, so too do the voices of racists, bigots and misogynists.

The shift remains to be seen, and that shift will only happen if those in favour of change continue to speak up and speak out.

As we think about our national birthday, remember that our diversity, our multiculturalism, our kindness to others is what makes our country so great.

Be kind. Be thoughtful. Be Canadian.

Want to get back the cabinets you love? Gleam Guard offers a quick, dust-free and cost-effective solution.

You love the style of your cabinets but not the worn appearance the years of love have brought … what if they could look like new again, without the expense and disruption of a full renovation?

Not only is it possible, but it’s quicker and easier than you might think!

“We’ve had many clients over the years who really thought they would need to invest in brand new cabinets. They’re so grateful when we can have their cabinets, shelving and even furniture looking brand new again – and in just one or two days,” says Tracy Booth, owner of Gleam Guard Cabinet Refinishing, serving Nanaimo and the Vancouver Island region.

Here’s a look at how refinishing works – and how it can work for you:

Choose experience. There are various approaches to cabinet refinishing, but to ensure you get a quality finish that will last, it’s essential to choose a knowledgeable, experienced professional, says Booth, who’s been professionally refinishing cabinets for more than 30 years. Even better, Gleam Guard enjoys an A+ BBB rating! Choose value. Hiring qualified refinishing professionals means your kitchen will get back the look you love at a fraction of the cost of new cabinets, costing as little as $2,000 instead of $20,000 to $30,000, for example. Choose the right process. Beyond the technique, it’s also important to consider the potential disruption of a large-scale renovation. With Gleam Guard, the process is not only dust-free – with no aggravating dust particles filling the air and settling through the house – but the entire job can be finished in just one or two days.

The house fire happened near 76th Avenue and 184th Street around 4:40 p.m., according to a Black Press Media freelancer on the scene.

The freelancer added that crews had to fight the fire from the outside due to its “intensity.”

The Now-Leader has contacted Surrey Fire Service for more information.

More to come.

(Shane MacKichan photo)

An incident in Whalley Thursday night came to a tragic end, after a man jumped from the top of a 40-storey crane.

According to a news release issued by Surrey RCMP, it began just before 6:30 p.m., when an officer saw a man climb over a fence and into a construction site at 9887 Whalley Blvd.

When the officer called out to the man, he ran and climbed to the top of the crane, the release states.

One witness reported the man “appears to be walking around the crane, sitting, then walking, then going into the operator’s box.”

Despite efforts by multiple agencies – including the Lower Mainland Emergency Response Team, a crisis negotiator and Surrey RCMP’s Car 67, which pairs a police officer with a mental health nurse – the man jumped from the crane shortly after 10 p.m. He did not survive.

Many witnessed the tragic event, and police encouraged “anyone who may need help as a result of witnessing this incident to reach out to their health-care provider.”

“Witnessing a tragedy can be very impactful and emotionally disturbing,” Cpl. Elenore Sturko said.

Two men have been charged after an investigation of a “serious” crash in Newton in 2019.

The investigation started following a single-vehicle crash in the 6300-block of 128th Street around 1:17 a.m. on July 12, 2019, according to a Surrey RCMP release Thursday (July 16).

In the crash, police said a white BMW SUV “left the roadway and struck a hydro pole.”

A 17-year-old girl, who was a passenger in the SUV, “suffered a life-altering injury.”

The 20-year-old driver of the BMW was also taken to hospital, but had been released the same day, police said in an earlier release.

Through the investigation, RCMP stated that a second vehicle and driver involved in the crash were identified.

Vikram Singh Grewal, 19, has been charged with dangerous operation of a motor vehicle, police said. He also has a 10-month driving prohibition, RCMP added.

Pavandeep Singh Dhaliwal, 21, has been charged with dangerous operation of a motor vehicle causing bodily harm, along with a one-year driving prohibition, according to police.

Surrey RCMP said the two men are from Surrey.

“This collision resulted in a life-altering injury for a young woman, and has also undoubtedly impacted the lives of both of the drivers involved,” said Sergeant Ian MacLellan, of Surrey RCMP Traffic Services. “We want to take this opportunity to remind everyone to be a responsible road user, and avoid high-risk driving behaviour.”

At the time, Surrey RCMP said “early indications” were that speed was a factor in the crash.

The following are some of the calls police responded to in the previous week:

• July 5-6, between 11:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m., Cliveden Avenue: Complainant reported $3,000 in ice cream stolen from a refrigerator truck. Three pallets of ice cream were stolen from the back of a parked unlocked delivery truck. The truck had just been restocked and was out for deliveries.

• July 5, 7:00 p.m., 112B Street: Complainant reported theft of his “Telemate” golf clubs valued at $3,000 from the bottom of his driveway.

• July 8, 9:56 a.m., 94A Avenue: Complainant called police to report family members intoxicated and fighting inside complainant’s residence. One sibling was punched for “talking trash” and the other retaliated. One of the siblings had left the residence prior to police arrival. Both parties separated and no charges were pursued. The incident appeared to be a consensual fight between two intoxicated siblings.

• July 10, North Delta Public Safety Building: Complainant reported losing $1,500 in an online scam. The complainant advised she had a male “sugar daddy” that she met through a dating app. They had an arrangement that the complainant would provide the other party with photos of her feet in exchange for payments, but she would return a portion of the money to him. After she received what appeared to be a transfer of funds (that did not go through), the complainant returned a portion of money via an anonymous Bitcoin account. Following receipt of the bitcoin the “sugar daddy” ghosted the complainant, who then discovered all the information he provided to her was false. Victim services was offered to the complainant, who was distraught.

• July 10, 10:55 p.m., Highway 91: A concerned driver called police to report concerns over a driver traveling south bound on the Alex Fraser Bridge that may be intoxicated. Police conducted a traffic stop and noticed a distinct odour of liquor. When the constable asked the driver when they had their last drink, the driver replied, “six months ago.” The driver was given the alcohol screening device to which they blew a “fail.” The driver received a 90-day immediate roadside prohibition and the vehicle was impounded.

• July 10, 11:15 p.m., 120th Street: Police were flagged down by bystanders reporting an intoxicated male who was accusing people of stealing his cellphone. Police located the male, who was seen running and peering into an unoccupied police vehicle. When they started to speak to the male they noticed the distinct odor of liquor coming from his breath and he was slurring and staggering. Police did not believe he was able to care for himself due to his level of intoxication, so he was taken into custody with no issues and held until he sobered up.

• July 12, 110th Street: Complainant reported a male walking down the street carrying an assault rifle. Patrols located a young teenager matching the description but empty handed. The teen told officers he had been carrying his airsoft rifle around. He retrieved the rifle from the yard and he and it were returned to the custody of his mother. The teenager was apologetic, and was cautioned as to the potential implications of walking the streets carrying such an item.

• July 12, 9:35 p.m., 9500-block 120th St.: Police observed a vehicle being driven erratically at an estimated 20km/h. The vehicle stopped abruptly on a parking lot entrance ramp, then proceeded to park at a sharp angel. Subsequently, police conducted a vehicle stop only to reveal the strong odour of recently burned cannabis. The driver admitted to the consumption of cannabis three hours prior. The driver was given a standardized field sobriety test and performed poorly. He was severed a 24-hour driving prohibition. The vehicle was parked legally and the driver departed by taxi.

A Surrey man is celebrating after winning Lotto 6/49’s $1 million guaranteed prize on Canada Day.

Surinderpal Gill said he’s been playing the lottery since he came to Canada 26 years ago, adding he’ll always have fond memories about July 1.

“I checked at the self checker,” said Gill, who initially didn’t believe his ticket was a winner. “I told my son, and then I had to go to another gas station to make sure it was correct. After I told my wife, they both thought I was joking and didn’t believe me.”

He added that the win will allow him to “take a step back from work” and start his own business.

Along with starting a new business, Gill said he’ll be putting some of the money toward a new house he’s building.

Gill bought the winning ticket at the Chevron Town Pantry on 58th Avenue.

According to the BC Lottery Corporation, B.C. players have redeemed more than $73 million in winning from Lotto 6/49 so far in 2020.

WARNING: This story discusses sexual violence

Transit police in the Lower Mainland are investigating after a woman received several photos containing “extremely disturbing sexual threats” while on a bus in Surrey, believed to be from someone also riding the bus.

READ ALSO: Woman sexually assaulted, robbed near Surrey SkyTrain station: RCMP, July 11, 2020

Metro Vancouver Transit Police say the incident happened around 11 p.m. on July 14, after the woman got on a bus at the Newton Exchange.

“Shortly after sitting down, she received multiple AirDrop messages that contained extremely disturbing sexual threats. The woman did look around the bus and noticed there was about 15 other people on board,” said Const. Mike Yake, transit police media relations officer.

Airdrop is a service on Apple iPhones and other products that allows a person to transfer a file to a similar device wirelessly.

The woman targeted by the messages shared the ordeal on Facebook on July 15.

She said that “within minutes” of sitting down, she received an AirDrop image request. The image was black except for a short sentence in white which read: “I’m going to rape you.”

The woman said that she then sent a screenshot of the AirDrop request to a friend, who offered to pick her up.

Before contacting transit police, the woman said she received the request twice more.

“I text[ed] them the screenshot and an explanation of the situation. They are helpful and start asking lots of questions, and some that I don’t have the immediate answer to,” according to her post.

Yake said the woman got off the bus at a stop in South Surrey to have her friend pick her up and transit police officers met her “a short time later.”

The incident, he said, is being “actively investigated.”

Yake said he can’t go into detail regarding the specific investigation techniques, “but we do have the ability through our investigation to possibly locate individuals who were on the bus at a specific time.”

As for incidents like this, Yake said transit police “strongly” encouraged people in the Lower Mainland riding on TransLink busses to “discreetly” text 87-77-77, “whether they’re feeling uncomfortable or in a situation that they feel is going to unfold.”

By texting that number the person will then be in “direct contact” with dispatchers and officers can be sent to wherever the incident is happening.

Yake added that reducing sexual offences is “one of Metro Vancouver Transit Police’s top-four priorities, so we take incidents like this extremely seriously and it’s going to be investigated to our full capabilities.”

(Image: City of Surrey)

Surrey council has given third-reading approval to a 25-storey office tower for the southeast corner of Central City mall, at 10045 King George Boulevard.

A “virtual” public hearing was held Monday, July 13.

Council then gave its approval with no debate.

Guildford resident Richard Landale, the first speaker to address council, noted a traffic impact study indicates 473 vehicles will impact the area at a “peak-hour” period while a report has 982 commercial parking stalls.

“Obviously there is more critical information staff is withholding from council that is relevant to any decisions made by council this evening,” he charged.

He also noted 89 trees will be removed in exchange for a $12,000 contribution by the applicant to the city’s Green City Fund.

“I do not understand why this 25-storey office building is not required, under the capital amenity contribution program, is not required to pay its fair share, especially in regards to policing and fire department services,” Landale said, “which is particularly important as the building is 25 storeys high.”

South Surrey resident Ivan Scott supported the application, saying it’s the “perfect time and place” to build such an office tower.

“Office towers are very seldomly built these days with developers instead going for a residential tower,” he told council. “This shows the confidence genuine business people have in the future of Surrey.”

South Surrey resident C0lin Pronger opposed the development.

“I believe that the city should be improving Whalley as a whole rather than perpetrating its division of King George Boulevard.”

The west side, he said, is for the “well-dressed” who may never have to cross over to the east side of the boulevard.

“Developers are only building for the ‘haves’ in Surrey, so they won’t be inconvenienced when they have to visit their lawyers and financial advisors,” Pronger said.

Elizabeth Model, CEO of the Downtown Business Improvement Association, supports the project

“It’s the first commercial building in quite some time,” she noted. “It’s going to provide a huge amount of economic development, with jobs and obviously with a spin-off of all the commercial build and the businesses coming to our area.”

A street in North Delta could soon be renamed to honour the passengers of the Komagata Maru.

Raj Toor, the grandson of one of the passengers on the Komagata Maru and vice-president of the non-profit Descendants of the Komagata Maru Society, presented Delta council’s Heritage Advisory Commission with a proposal on Wednesday, July 8 to name a park, street or other civic asset in memory of the passengers of the Komagata Maru.

The society’s proposal comes almost a year after the City of Surrey renamed 75A Avenue between 120 Street and 121A Street “Komagata Maru Way” following a similar request by the society.

“It would seem appropriate to rename the Delta part of 75A Avenue from 120th Street to 114th Street ‘Komagata Maru Way’ to show that consideration of this event transcends municipal boundaries,” Toor told Delta’s Heritage Advisory Commission.

“This would be greatly appreciated, not only by descendants of the passengers and by all of the South Asian community in Canada, but by every Canadian who believes in treating all humans with dignity and respect.”

Following Toor’s presentation, the commission unanimously passed a motion endorsing the society’s request, which will be forwarded to city council, along with staff recommendations, for their consideration in the coming months.

Toor said he was pleased with the commission’s vote, noting the large South Asian population living on both sides of Scott Road/120th Street.

“The South Asian community is a very important part of Delta,” Toor told the Reporter. “The South Asian community was very important in the development of modern-day Delta, and the Komagata Maru is an important part of the South Asian community’s history and B.C.’s history and Canadian history.”

Toor said the Descendants of the Komagata Maru Society worked for more than 15 years to get apologies from both provincial and federal governments, stressing the society has never asked for any compensation for the passengers’ families.

As a result of the society’s efforts, the B.C. government apologized for the incident in 2008, followed by the federal government in 2016 and, most recently, the City of Vancouver on June 10, 2020, and several memorials have been erected throughout the region.

The Komagata Maru arrived in Vancouver from Hong Kong on May 23, 1914, carrying 376 passengers, according to komagatamarujourney.ca. Most of the passengers were immigrants from the Punjab region in what was then British India.

The hundreds of passengers, according to thecanadianencyclopedia.ca, were not allowed on shore. For two months, they remained in the waters outside of Vancouver.

“A long confrontation ensued with the passengers resisting immigration department efforts to make them leave voluntarily,” reads the website. “These efforts included limiting their communications with the outside world, blocking their attempts to take their case to a Canadian court, refusing to supply the ship with food and water except when conditions became desperate; and, at one point after a continuing standoff, attempting to take control of the ship by force with a police boarding party.”

At the time, according to the thecanadianencyclopedia.ca, the Continuous Passage regulation was in effect which meant immigration officers could “block the entry of anyone who came to Canada other than by continuous journey from their home country. Another regulation, the website adds, was that immigration officers could turn back “any Asians who arrived with less than $200, a very large sum in 1914.”

The passengers were eventually forced to return to India, but upon their return, some of the passengers were shot and killed “in an encounter with British Indian police,” according to the canadianencyclopedia.ca.

1035,1035,1502,northdeltareporter,https://www.northdeltareporter.com/news/surrey-council-rejects-motion-to-speed-up-permit-process/,Surrey council rejects motion to speed up permit process – North Delta Reporter,'Tom Zytaruk',2020-07-15,"‘More than ever cash is tight for our businesses,’ Councillor Linda Annis said

The Safe Surrey Coalition majority on council – whose members campaigned on reducing permit issuing times in the city during the 2018 election – defeated a motion Monday that sought to take that a step further.

Councillor Linda Annis’s motion asked the city’s planning department to review the city’s permitting and inspection processes and then report back to council with recommendations on what can be done to improve turnaround times to make it easier for business to get up and running as quickly as possible.

“More than ever cash is tight for our businesses,” she said.

Annis, sole member of the Surrey First slate on council, noted that there are more than 17,200 small businesses operating in Surrey, with over 2,500 more starting each year. She said that many of these businesses have negotiated rental agreements that include the first few months either rent free or at reduced rent.

“But it appears that we’re taking too long to process the permits and inspections oftentimes,” she said. “This results, often, that businesses end up having to pay rent before they are actually able to open.”

Councillor Laurie Guerra dismissed Annis’s motion as “vague.”

“The Safe Surrey Coalition campaigned on reducing permit times within the city and since being elected the turnaround time has decreased from 25 weeks to 10 weeks,” Guerra said, “and that is no small feat for this city. And staff get my compliments for efficiently implementing council’s direction.”

Councillor Mandeep Nagra agreed with Guerra.

“I think staff has done a very good job on reducing those times,” he said. “I think staff is already doing a fantastic job at it.”

Councillor Jack Hundial suggested council is looking behind, not ahead.

“Coming up to two years in our term now, we can probably stop talking about how we ran on something, because let’s look at the future, not the past,” he said.

Annis said her particular motion wasn’t targeted at residential construction but rather businesses “that are trying to get up and running with very little cash up front.

“Particularly in these times I thinks we need to be working more closely with them,” she said.

Councillor Doug Elford said he thinks staff is “already in the process of working on this.”

Staff told council the city is tracking its permitting process timelines and is currently on a positive, downward trend.

Mayor Doug McCallum praised city staff for moving quickly “on all levels.

“Because our growth is so fast it’s a constant battle to keep up,” he said.

1036,1036,1503,northdeltareporter,https://www.northdeltareporter.com/news/emergency-funding-granted-to-eight-delta-charities/,Emergency funding granted to eight Delta charities – North Delta Reporter,'James Smith',2020-07-15,"Eight Delta charities supporting vulnerable populations have received a total of $181,860 in funding from the Delta Foundation through the Government of Canada’s Emergency Community Support Fund (ECSF).

According to Delta Foundation press release, a survey conducted in April found that 80 per cent of charities in Canada were operating with decreased capacity due to the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and nearly one in five organizations had suspended or ceased their operations. The projected financial losses for registered charities in Canada is between $9.5-15.7 billion and $15.7 billion.

The federal government launched the ECSF on May 19, and the Delta Foundation is one of 177 community foundations across the country participating in the program. Through the ECSF, the foundation is providing emergency support for charities throughout Delta in partnership with Community Foundations of Canada and the Government of Canada.

“Since the start of the pandemic, charities and non-profit organizations have been leading the charge to assist those who need it most in the fight against COVID-19,” Delta Foundation president Peter Roaf said in a press release. “We know the need for funding is still significant. Delta Foundation has granted the full funding available to our community through the ECSF. There are other charities supporting vulnerable populations and we would have been glad to support them, but, unfortunately, we can’t accept any more applications.”

More than 15 charities applied for ECSF support through the Delta Foundation for various worthy causes, but, in the rapid response and rolling approval process, the following eight charities serving Delta were allocated funding:

• Big Sisters of BC Lower Mainland: $5055 for its Study Buddy program, which provides weekly no-cost tutoring and mentoring focused on school work and study skills to at-risk youth aged 7-17 from low income families.

• Deltassist Family and Community Services Society: $70,000 for the temporary North Delta Food Bank, which serves 708 people in North Delta every two weeks who, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, are experiencing homelessness, job loss, or ongoing financial struggles and no access to local food banks which have been closed temporarily.

• Little House Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Society: $10,000 for the Heart of the Youth program, which provides youth affected by substance use disorder a safe, non-judgmental online space to share their thoughts and feelings, begin to heal and develop a supportive community.

• Mamas for Mamas — Metro Vancouver: $30,000 for the Respond Like a Mother program, which helps low income mothers access the basics such as food, hygiene, housing and other essential needs.

• Options Community Services: $8,000 for the Ready to Work (R2W) program, which aims to reduce barriers to finding post-COVID employment by increasing employability among clients experiencing mental illness.

• Reach Child and Youth Development Society: $25,805 for the Virtual Autism Early Intervention Therapies program, which helps ensure that children continue to receive the support programs and services they need to reach their potential, and that families receive the tools, materials, equipment and guidance necessary to support their child’s continued development from home where in-person services are not feasible.

• Surrey-North Delta Meals on Wheels: $15,000 for the Subsidized Meals During COVID-19 Pandemic program, which helps those in the community experiencing food and financial security issues and are housebound — either due to the restrictions placed on them by the COVID-19 virus or loss of employment, are immune-compromised individuals or families, or seniors who are ordinarily not able to afford the organization’s meals.

•WINGS Fellowship Ministries: $18,000 for the COVID-19 Mental Health and Well Being Project, which provides self-help tools to support mental well-being along with a way to reduce clients’ contact with other people by providing them a grocery gift card and a way to transport their groceries.

Charities that would like to be notified if additional ECSF funding becomes available can fill out an online form here.

Charities can also explore opportunities with other ECSF funding intermediaries in the community, such as United Way Centraide Canada and Canadian Red Cross. More information about these national funders is available at canada.ca/en/services/benefits/emergency-community-support-fund.

(Aaron Hinks photo)

White Rock council this week shot down any possibility of allowing alcoholic beverages at the picnic table area in Memorial Park, citing a lack of public support for the measure, as well as potential difficulties in managing it.

At the June 1 meeting, council discussed a request from the White Rock BIA to allow liquor consumption in public places to support and enhance outdoor dining during the COVID-19 pandemic. Council had requested a corporate report identifying the waterfront park, across Marine Drive from the West Beach restaurant strip, as a potential location.

In the report, submitted to council on Monday night (July 13), staff recommended information on the measure be submitted to the COVID-19 Recovery Task Force for further input.

But council instead took the option not to proceed further with the proposal, supporting a motion from Coun. Scott Kristjanson; with Coun. Erika Johanson casting the sole opposing vote.

“I don’t think I hear from the public that we really have an appetite for this at the moment,” Kristjanson said, adding that while he would welcome hearing the task force’s views, he would likely vote against allowing liquor in the park.

Coun. Anthony Manning was among councillors who shared Kristjanson’s view that the proposal should go no further.

“We’ve seen a number of municipalities across the Lower Mainland consider this and either defeat it, or postpone it,” he said, noting that while the City of Vancouver had been initially enthusiastic, a proposal there is “still being passed around council.”

He also pointed out that while the City of North Vancouver passed a similar proposal, “they have a very different situation than we have here,” and went on to note the concerns voiced by Coun. David Chesney at the June 1 meeting.

“I, certainly, would advocate that the sensible consumption of alcohol, by adults, is fine,” Chesney had said at that time.

“But looking at the history of White Rock, it’s a party town, it’s a party destination… oh, my God, the mess we’re going to have.”

On Monday, Chesney agreed there seemed to be no significant community appetite for the move since it had been proposed.

He also pointed to White Rock RCMP input to the report which had underlined that the detachment could only favour extending liquor consumption to areas immediately adjacent to existing restaurant businesses, providing the emphasis was on liquor as an accompaniment to meals.

“Not a public drinking area, or, as the RCMP referred to it, a beer garden, which is exactly what I think this would turn into,” Chesney said.

“The picnic tables down there are being well-used, it’s a great family environment… the businesses are doing fine down there. I don’t support bringing alcohol into that mix.”

Coun. Christopher Trevelyan said he felt that while extending approval for liquor to the picnic area was a “fantastic idea” in theory, there could be no practical way of guaranteeing moderate consumption of wine or beer with meals only.

“This is a huge can of worms, very difficult to police, very difficult to enforce,” he said. “In principle I love it, but when you get to the details it’s very, very difficult to manage effectively.”

Oxley says her son sustained an allergic reaction after playing in the tall grass. (Aaron Hinks photo)

A Peninsula mother says the type of grass in a public park that backs onto her South Surrey property caused her son to go into anaphylactic shock, and the city is doing little about it.

However, city officials say staff are aware of the concern and staff are reviewing next steps.

Calla Oxley said that her son Wade was playing in Bayview Woods Park on June 28. The park is described by the city as beautiful but hidden, and is accessible from between the hedges of 13815 and 13829 33 Ave.

After approximately 15 minutes of play in the knee-high grass with his brother, Wade returned home and was showing signs of a reaction, Oxley said.

The 10-year-old told Peace Arch News Tuesday (July 14) that he had difficulty swallowing and had broken out in hives on his legs and neck.

Oxley gave her son Benadryl and rushed him to the hospital. Doctors gave Wade adrenaline and steroids.

“We were told to watch him closely for three days because there’s a phenomenon with anaphylaxis where you can relapse within two or three days,” she said.

Oxley said the doctors told her it was the tall, brown grass that caused the reaction. After her son was in a more stable condition, she called the City of Surrey to ask if someone could meet with her to discuss what could be done.

“We obviously won’t allow him to play in the park. But if it’s the tall grass and it’s mowed and not captured when it’s mowed, it’s just blowing in the wind…. we’re worried about him even being in his bedroom at night and becoming anaphylactic, because it was a severe reaction.”

Oxley said the City of Surrey sent an employee to the park the day she called. However, the woman who showed up reportedly said she was the “green grass person” and that a “brown grass person” was required.

“She said the brown grass person was on holidays,” Oxley noted.

After getting an all-clear from a doctor, the Oxleys went on a 10-day trip and returned home July 13. She said that time while they were away from the property would have been an opportunity for the city to cut and capture the grass.

“We’ve lived here for 10 years and on many occasions they’ve cut that entire park,” she said.

Tuesday, a section of the short, green grass appeared to have been cut within the last two weeks. The taller, brown grass was left untouched.

“We were told by the city that it was too expensive to cut the grass. We offered to pay for the mowing of the grass and they haven’t responded to that at all. As far as taking it out, they said it would be a long process, with community involvement, and take months and months,” Oxley said.

Oxley said the line of communication with the city has ended, and that “at this point we’re just happy to get a phone call from them.”

Monday, PAN asked to speak to somebody from the city about the family’s concern.

City manager of parks Neal Aven emailed PAN a statement on Tuesday (July 14), through the communications manager, saying that the city is taking the concern seriously and staff have spoken directly with the Oxley family.

The statement says city staff are aware the grass is the cause of the allergic reaction and that they understand that the Oxleys have taken steps to ensure their son does not come into direct contact with the grass.

“Parks staff are continuing to review potential steps, which may include more frequent moving, and will be in touch with the family this week.”

Tuesday afternoon, Oxley said she has yet to hear from the city.

Corporal Elenore Sturko said Trevor Robert McKay, 29, was brought to hospital with a gunshot wound at about noon Saturday.

“He was spoken to by investigators and, although his life is in danger, he has provided very limited information to police,” Sturko said, adding McKay has been the “repeated target of violence” including this shooting “and a previous attempted murder on January 28, 2015.

“Trevor McKay has received multiple warnings regarding his safety from police,” Sturko said. “Trevor Robert McKay is known to police and has a history of involvement with drug trafficking in the Lower Mainland. The public should be aware that they may be at risk if they interact with this individual.”

Police ask anyone with information about the shooting to contact the Surrey RCMP at 604-599-0502 or, if they wish to remain anonymous, contact Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-TIPS or go to www.solvecrime.ca.

This came before council on Monday July 13 and was approved by the five Safe Surrey Coalition members.

Councillors Steven Pettigrew, Linda Annis, Jack Hundial and Brenda Locke voted against it.

Hundial said obligating Surrey taxpayers to pay for this information “to me does not seem transparent, and at a time when transparency is key for all levels off government, including local government.

“I don’t believe we should be charging a fee for a resident to ask questions that they otherwise will not be able to obtain or really get the answers that they need for their own decision-making processes.”

Councillor Brenda Locke also voted against it.

“I think that a flat fee of $150 for an FOI request without specifying the number of pages that’s being asked for is a bit unfair,” she said. “I think transparency is already an issue, in my opinion, with this council and therefore residents are gaining insight into what we do by FOI and I think the public does deserve to know what we’re doing and so if that’s how they have to find out the information, I believe that they are entitled to that.”

Council heard that these FOI requests take anywhere from 30 minutes to eight hours to process and that the $150 fee was arrived at based on the cost of staff time, on average, to respond to these requests.

Locke asked staff if there has been an increase in the number of FOI requests over the last year and a half.

She was told the number has increased steadily over recent years and there will probably be more requests this year compared to last year.

Council was also asked to approve amendments that would “accurately reflect” city staff titles and their responsibilities.

The FOI bylaw was adopted in March 1999, under Mayor Doug McCallum’s watch. Rob Costanzo, Surrey’s general manager of corporate services, noted that many staff job titles have changed since then.

Costanzo said the city commonly receives requests for attendance records at its facilities. “These requests are typically related to personal injury claims where, for example, law firms are required to prove attendance or non-attendance of their clients at city recreational facilities,” he stated in a report.

The city had been providing these records at no cost. Costanzo said a flat fee of $150 per request will help the city recover related administrative costs and be subject to annual budgetary increases.

1041,1041,1508,northdeltareporter,https://www.northdeltareporter.com/news/surreys-first-ethics-commissioner-brings-objectivity-to-the-job/,Surrey’s first ethics commissioner brings ‘objectivity’ to the job – North Delta Reporter,'Tom Zytaruk',2020-07-14,"Vancouver lawyer Reece Harding has been piped aboard as Surrey’s first ethics commissioner, to help city council run a more open, transparent and accountable ship.

His new job is also a first for this province. Harding, 54, a resident of Port Moody, was chosen unanimously by city council over more than 30 other well-qualified candidates.

Besides advising council on matters of ethical conduct, he also has the authority to investigate complaints and recommend disciplinary sanctions to its members, with the city’s Code of Conduct bylaw, which was approved in April, serving as his guidebook.

“Remember, it’s mayor and council that mete out the sanctions,” Harding told the Now-Leader on Tuesday.

“I only make recommendations. I don’t have jurisdiction to impose sanctions, they do, on my recommendations. But my goal is to be very much positive and proactive, and to push the advisory and educational aspects of this office.”

Harding is a partner with Young Anderson, specializing in local government law, which he has practised for 26 years. He will continue to practice law with his firm while also wearing his new hat as an independent officer.

Mayor Doug McCallum, in a written statement city hall issued Tuesday, said Harding’s “comprehensive experience in municipal law, advising elected officials on responsible conduct, and conflict resolution and his high standing among his peers makes him the right person to fill this important role at the City of Surrey.”

Harding admitted he doesn’t yet have a “tremendous amount” of knowledge about Surrey.

“I know what I read in the papers,” he said. “I’m not invested in the details of Surrey now and I think that’s actually helpful and beneficial because I do come, I think, to Surrey with a bit of objectivity and I don’t have a lot of deep relationships or historic relationships with a lot of the people in Surrey so I come, I think, with my reputation. It gives me a sense of, I hope anyway, some objectivity coming into Surrey to help, to be of assistance.”

Speaking of relationships, news and social media reports concerning the mysterious nature of the relationship between Surrey’s mayor and Councillor Allison Patton, which neither have publicly addressed, has not been lost on Harding.

“I’m aware of those things but I don’t know what role if any I would be playing in that, I think time will tell when it comes to that stuff. Remember, I was advised only yesterday that I was appointed to this role,” he told the Now-Leader on Tuesday, “so I’m going to need some time to get familiar with things. But my aim is to get familiar pretty quickly, to get up to speed on matters. We’ll see what’s engaged by the process, the Code of Conduct bylaws there. It puts a formal process in place and we’ll see what that process, we’ll see how it’s triggered, and what it leads to, so I don’t think I can comment in any detail on that.”

READ ALSO UPDATE: Surrey council votes to hire ethics commissioner

Harding said the key, in his new role, is “education, education, and more education” with the Code of Conduct bylaw setting out the “overarching” duties of the ethics commissioner.

“It’s all about providing to elected officials the opportunity to be advised and assisted on understanding that role, understanding what their roles require of them,” Harding said. “One of the things in this particular Code of Conduct bylaw that I think is really bold by the city is offering the elected officials the opportunity to seek guidance from the ethics commissioner on conflict of interest concerns.”

His advisory role, Harding said, is to help council members “stay out of a problem before they get into a problem.”

Asked what her first question for Harding might be, Councillor Linda Annis replied, “My question is, sort of motherhood in a way, is how can he help the council in Surrey become the benchmark for local politics in our province?” Annis said.

“I think there’s a real opportunity there because our council has been quite fractious.”

A new poll suggests turbulence ahead when it comes to the airlines winning public support for their current COVID-19 plans. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Darryl Dyck

A new poll suggests turbulence ahead for airlines seeking public support for their current COVID-19 plans.

Seventy-two per cent of Canadians surveyed by Leger and the Association for Canadian Studies say they’re not comfortable flying since a decision by some airlines to relax their own in-flight physical distancing requirements.

As of July 1, Air Canada and WestJet both ended policies blocking the sale of adjacent seats.

The measure was seen to align with a guidance document for the aviation industry issued by Transport Canada in April to help curb the spread of COVID-19.

Among other things, the department had suggested passengers should be widely spaced when possible, though they did not make it mandatory.

Airlines, however, are required to make passengers and air crews wear masks.

Only 22 per cent of those surveyed said they’re comfortable getting aboard with no in-flight physical distancing and a requirement to wear masks.

There’s more to it to keep flights safe, WestJet said in a statement last week after critics attacked its plan.

“What makes an airplane, and the entire journey, safe is the layers of enhanced cleaning, the wearing of masks and the hospital-grade HEPA filters that remove 99.999 per cent of all airborne particles,” the airline said.

“The hygiene standards we have now are world-class and backed by industry experts.”

Critics have also previously pounced on the airlines for another move: refusing to fully refund tickets for flights cancelled due to the pandemic.

READ MORE: Canada extends travel ban for non-U.S. foreign travellers to July 31

Thousands of people have beseeched Transport Minister Marc Garneau to compel airlines to issue refunds, but he has refused, arguing that mandating reimbursements from a sector that’s lost more than 90 per cent of its revenue would cripple the industry.

But 72 per cent of those polled say they totally oppose his decision.

In lieu of refunds, the airlines have offered vouchers but the poll suggests that it may take a while before people will rebook previously cancelled trips: 85 per cent of those surveyed told pollsters they have no plans to travel outside the country by the end of the year.

The survey polled 1,517 people and can’t be assigned a margin of error because online polls are not considered truly random.

Pollsters were in the field between July 3 and 5, a historically popular few days for Canadians and Americans to be on the move between the two countries, given the July 1 Canada Day holiday and the U.S.’s July 4 Independence Day.

But the border remains closed to non-essential traffic, and the majority of Canadians surveyed said they feel it needs to stay that way. The current mutual closure agreement is due to expire July 21.

Of Canadians polled, 86 per cent said they totally disagreed with re-opening the border at the end of July, allowing Americans back into the country.

Americans seem more eager both to head north and to welcome Canadians south; 50 per cent agreed the border should re-open and 36 per cent disagreed.

The potential for cross-border transmission of the virus has been a key factor in the decision to keep the border closed. Currently, rates of COVID-19 infection in the U.S. continue to climb, while in Canada the curve appears to be on a downward trajectory nearly everywhere.

Still, the survey suggests Canadians don’t feel they are out of the woods. Thirty-nine per cent believe the worst is yet to come, while 35 per cent believe the worst of the crisis has passed.

In the U.S., 42 per cent of those surveyed felt the darkest days are ahead, 25 per cent believe the U.S. is in the middle of the worst part now while 21 per cent think that’s already passed.

Bids for close to 300 cardio machines will be sought for an online-only auction held at the Newton location of Able Auctions, at 13557 77th Ave.

Masks are mandatory for a preview on Wednesday, July 22, with the auction set for July 23 at 9:30 a.m. Details are posted at ableauctions.ca.

The commercial-grade equipment is from closed locations of Steve Nash Fitness World, Able Auctions president Jeremy Dodd confirmed.

Under new ownership, the fitness company is being restructured.

“There are somewhere between 250 and 300 pieces of equipment (for auction),” Dodd said. “Right now it’s all cardio. Strength (equipment) is going to come but not quite yet. There are different owners of the equipment, different leasing companies that owned all this.

“I’ve never seen this much (equipment) like this before, it’s an awful lot,” Dodd added.

(Story continues below video)

During the pandemic, Able Auctions encourages people to bid and make payments online.

“It’s gone really smoothly,” Dodd said. “It’s definitely a buyer’s market, you know, so there are good buys right now. As far as the process goes, it’s quite seamless and smooth doing it this way. People sign up and register ahead of time, we get going at usually 9:30 in the morning on a given day, and we go through the items one at a time and sell it all off – just like a live auction but with no auctioneer.”

(Story continues below)

Meantime, the company’s Langley location is where dozens of animatronic dinosaurs will be auctioned. On Aug. 6, Able Auctions will be selling off more than 50 life-sized animatronic dinosaurs, along with hundreds of fossils, more animatronic equipment, lighting, and speakers.

The animatronic dinosaurs include famous species such as Tyrannosaurus rex, Triceratops, and velociraptors, but also more obscure species, such as ouranosaurus, kentrosaurus, dilophosaurus, amargasaurus and a flying pterosaur, which was related to dinosaurs but part of a different lineage.

A display of all the items is scheduled for Wednesday, Aug. 5 from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., with masks mandatory, at Able Auctions’ Langley location, 19757 92A Ave.

A GoFundMe campaign is underway to fund a pricey drug to help her fight the condition. That effort is also being supported with a charity car-wash in South Surrey on July 19. (Contributed photo)

This weekend, wash your car for a good cause.

On Sunday (June 19), South Surrey auto-detailing business, Splashes, will host a fundraising car wash in support of a Vancouver family whose infant daughter Lucy is in need of urgent medical care – and one of the world’s most expensive drugs – to help stop the progression of the four-month-old’s spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).

SMA is a rare, progressive genetic disorder – Lucy Van Doormaal was diagnosed at just five weeks old – that leads to trouble breathing, feeding and swallowing, and other issues. Without treatment, SMA is likely to be fatal within the first two years of life, a news release issued by Lucy’s family states.

Lucy, the release adds, is a good candidate for a “ground-breaking new gene therapy” drug called Zolgensma, however, the one-time-only dose is not yet approved in Canada and costs a whopping $3 million.

So far, more than 41,000 people – including Vancouver-born actor Ryan Reynolds – have donated to a ‘Life for Lucy’ GoFundMe campaign, raising more than $1.8 million.

“The amount of support we have been getting is unbelievable – we are so full of hope that we will be able to reach what, at one point, seemed like an impossible goal. The momentum of the past few days has been incredible,” Lucy’s parents Laura and Scott Van Doormaal said.

Research has shown that the longer a child waits for treatment, the more irreversible the damage from this neuromuscular disorder.

“It is overwhelming to know that there is something out there that could change Lucy’s life,” said Laura.

“When you have a child, you would do anything for them. We are working around the clock to reach our $3 million goal.”

Sunday’s fundraiser at Splashes was spurred by the suggestion of a customer, who is a family friend of the Van Doormaals, car wash officials said.

“Our business gives back to a local charity each month, however, we saw this as an opportunity to host a one-day fundraiser to raise as much money as possible for this family,” explains an email detailing the event.

It’s to take place at 103-3050 King George Blvd., from 10 a.m. until 5 p.m. and will include free touchless car washes, though donations will be collected on site.

Cash, debit and credit-card donations will be accepted, with 100 per cent of the proceeds going to the family.

COVID-19 safety precautions will also be followed, Splashes staff said.

From noon until 4 p.m., Tacofino will also be on site, serving food, with a portion of those proceeds also being donated to the cause.

For one local charity, a row of clothing donation bins in Surrey helps form a financial lifeline during the COVID-19 pandemic.

BC Children’s Hospital programs benefit from the sale of items collected in orange-coloured donation bins now located at Surrey Transfer Station (9770 192nd St.), via the hospital auxiliary.

Erin Rylek, the organization’s program & volunteer co-ordinator, said the clothing donation bin program is the auxiliary’s only source of income not greatly affected by the pandemic.

The auxiliary was forced to close its thrift and gift shops, and cancel campus vendor programs and its annual silent auction.

“We partner with Salvation Army for this (donation bin) initiative,” Rylek told the Now-Leader. “The clothing being donated to the bins is recycled back into the Surrey community and is also given to local shelters, which have seen an increase of need during the pandemic.

“The Auxiliary is also a non-profit charity so community support is vital to our success in funding programs at BC Children’s Hospital,” she added. “We are so pleased to work with Emterra at Surrey Transfer Station.”

Only clothing, footwear and accessories can be dropped into the bins. The collected goods are later resold at Salvation Army thrift stores.

The funds benefit a variety of BC Children’s Hospital programs, including Fun Cart, a Treasure Chest program, music therapy, free coffee nights, and therapeutic clowns.

In March 2020, the Auxiliary to BCCH supported a funding request of $60,000 to the Heart Centre, which had an urgent need for two TEE probes, used to assess the condition of a child’s heart — how large the heart is, how well it contracts, and how the valves function, Rylek noted.

“The long flexible instrument has an ultrasound transducer at the tip and is passed through a child’s mouth towards the throat to get as close to the heart as possible. It can be moved up, down and sideways to look at different parts of a child’s heart from different angles to get the best possible view. TEE probes are used in all 200-plus open-heart surgeries performed every year. They help surgeons save lives.”

(submitted photo)

A Surrey mother’s story about adopting her two children in India is told in a new book.

First-time author Raj Arneja has self-published a memoir called “Love at First Sight: A Mother’s Journey to Adoption.”

She began writing it about two years ago, after years of telling the story to family members.

“My kids, they’d heard the story before, and they were the ones who kind of prompted me to tell the story to others, to get the book done,” Arneja said.

Now adults, Kabir and Kirti are the children of Arneja and her husband, Gurpreet, who live in the Ocean Park area.

The family operates Surrey-based Nanak Foods, and in 2016 Arneja helped open SEVA Thrift Store on Scott Road as a charitable enterprise.

The 230-page book, available on Amazon.com, chronicles the author’s 7,000-kilometre trip from Canada to India to adopt Kabir and Kirti in the 1990s.

It’s not a how-to book about adoption, it is a celebration of motherhood through adoption.

Arneja says she hopes to inspire other couples to adopt.

“The book goes into my history, because I’m born and raised here,” Arneja said. “So going to India, for me, was going to a foreign country, dealing with the bureaucracy there, looking for a child, going from hospital to hospital, all those things.

“While I was there I began to understand where my parents came from, their journey of coming from India to a new country here in Canada with no family,” she continued. “I had those same feelings in India, because the first time I went, I went without my husband because he couldn’t go at the time. This was in 1992, and there was no internet, no cellphones, it was just talking on the phone during calls that cost a lot of money. My husband didn’t even see his son until I came to Canada with him, so the book tells the story about all those experiences.”

Raised in New Westminster, Arneja opens the book with the story of her flight to Japan in 1980, at the age of 16. Scaling Mount Fuji was a life-changing moment for Arneja, who in life has been motivated by the phrase “Never give up.”

Years later, at age 24, her life looked complete.

“I loved my career, working in an office in downtown Vancouver overlooking the harbor,” Arneja writes. “I loved life with my husband, Gurpreet, to whom I had been married for two years already. We had bought a house; we had our loving families and a close group of friends nearby. We enjoyed our ability to freely travel and did so every chance we could. We took a remarkable trip to India together, where we traveled to destinations that were off the beaten path, from north to south and everywhere in between. I was ready for the next chapter of my life. I wanted to become a mom.”

While it seemed like every couple around them was able to conceive easily, for some reason Raj and Gurpreet could not.

As an alternative, they turned to adoption.

“I just wanted people to know about these experiences, to have others do what we did if they can’t conceive, because it is a good alternative,” the author says.

“It’s something new for me, and I feel like I’m exposing myself quite a bit out there, but I think it’s an important story to tell and for people to hear, especially for a young couple looking to adopt,” Arneja continued. “Sometimes people are told no, you shouldn’t, and that happens in South Asian community more often, that the family doesn’t want to adopt outside of bloodlines, but that’s one of the reasons I pushed to get this done, because it can be done. I hope I inspire other couples to do this.”

Elgin Park Secondary and UBC grad Rajiv Dhaliwal, 25, secured a permit to hike the Pacific Crest Trail last May, which starts in B.C. and travels south to California. With the coronavirus putting those plans on hiatus, Dhaliwal made the spontaneous decision three weeks ago that he would instead mountain bike 12,000 kilometres from Crescent Beach to Newfoundland.

He plans to dip his rear tire in Crescent Beach Wednesday (July 15), signalling the start of his trip, which he expects to take three months.

“My bike came in the mail literally two days ago. And my plan was to leave as soon as my bike came in the mail. So I just quit my job and I’m planning to leave Wednesday,” he said.

SEE ALSO: B.C. man cycling across Canada

Salsa Cycles agreed to supply him with a bike and Bikepacking.com agreed to support him with an adventure grant. Dhaliwal said he planned the trip at the last minute, and it’s only possible with the help of the two companies.

“I reached out to these companies on a whim. I wasn’t really expecting them to actually get behind me. As soon as they said they were on board, I said I’m going to do it. It was pretty last-minute. I’m literally just running back and forth the last couple of days trying to get gear.”

The trip marks his second long-distance bike journey. Last year, he bought a $250 bike and rode it from Banff to New Mexico.

Dhaliwal says he’ll take the Great Trail, formally known as the Trans Canada Trail. He says the trail is made of dirt and gravel, but there are sections that are linked to the highway.

“I’m going to try and use Google Earth and figure out detour routes because my goal is I don’t want to ride anywhere on the highway,” he said.

He’ll pack all of his supplies on his bike and try to camp in the backcountry for as many days as possible, he added.

Dhaliwal plans to use his Instagram account to document the trip, which can be found here, and plans to write articles about his experience.",[]

(Don Wright photo)

Rugby officially received the green light to return to the pitch earlier this month, but real games – or something resembling them – are still a long way off.

That’s the message Bayside Rugby Club president Kevin Whitmarsh took from BC Rugby’s return-to-play policy, which was released July 7 and lists a number of new rules and regulations for rugby clubs to follow as they re-engage after a months-long COVID-19-related shutdown.

Any form of tackle rugby is currently still not allowed, and even touch rugby is still forbidden, Whitmarsh said, adding that he wasn’t surprised by much in the return-to-play plan.

“Essentially, we definitely won’t be playing any sort of contact rugby until next year, and that’s what we were expecting to hear.”

Surrey Beavers’ player Paul Kelly echoed Whitmarsh’s feelings in an interview with Black Press Media earlier this month.

“It’s nice to see a plan,” he said. “But it won’t look like the sport we know until probably the fall of 2021.”

In the meantime, Whitmarsh said they’ll “make lemonade out of these lemons” and are forming a plan that would see Bayside players – at both the youth and senior levels – return to action in new formats.

One of the new regulations is a ban on activities between different clubs, which rules out games even if touch rugby was allowed. However, Whitmarsh said the junior/youth levels will focus on skill development and practice when programs return later this summer, while plans for senior teams are still being considered, but “we’re getting creative.”

One likely option for Bayside’s adult players, Whitmarsh said, would be an in-house touch rugby league, with player drafts, weekly standings and “anything else we can do to make it feel like a real product even though you’re not playing other teams.”

BC Rugby’s plan includes five phases, and Whitmarsh is hopeful touch rugby could be allowed possibly by late August, with something near contact – perhaps tackling, but without scrums – allowed to go ahead in 2021, though he admits that is “an optimistic guess” at this point.

According to the plan, full-contact rugby would only return in Phase 5 – when a vaccine or treatment for COVID-19 is available.

“Rugby is coming back but it’s up to all of us to make sure it’s brought back in a safe and responsible manner,” Annabel Kehoe, B.C. Rugby CEO, said in a news release.

“While we won’t be returning to full-contact rugby for the foreseeable future, we’re excited to support clubs delivering modified training before progressing to non-contact rugby.”

Kelly suggested that “it’s gonna be a challenge to keep players interested” without traditional games, and while Whitmarsh agreed that some players may continue to sit out – and some longtime senior players may retire altogether – he’s also optimistic that a casual fall program will bring new players out of the woodwork.

He always expects that some players will be itching to come back, and will return with vigor and renewed excitement.

“Our guess is it’ll be kind of a wash,” he said. “You can see that (enthusiasm) on our internal Facebook pages – people are itching to get back. So we think a lot of people will come back revitalized. But at the same time, there will be some people who were maybe just hanging on at the end (before the pandemic) and this may have been the last straw for them to say ‘OK, time to hang ‘em up,’” he said.

“Sometimes if you have a forced break, you fill your time with other activities and maybe you realize you like those other activities. So we’re prepared for that, but we’d love to supplement some of that lose with this trial period here in the fall that will hopefully bring out new bodies.

“Because you can’t run a successful rugby club with the same 15 people every year.”

With competitive action – touch or tackle – pushed to 2021 at the earlier, Whitmarsh also noted that it could be a good opportunity for local clubs, and the BC Rugby Union league as a whole, to adjust its competitive senior schedule permanently, moving from a fall-to-spring setup to one that begins in the spring and wraps up in the summer.

Bayside’s senior men’s coach Andy Blackburn first floated the idea in an interview with PAN back in April, citing numerous benefits, including better weather.

Whitmarsh admitted it might be difficult to get every B.C. club on board.

“This new (reality) kind of aligns with what we’ve wanted for awhile now… but it seems split 50-50 – a lot of clubs say, ‘No way, there’s no way we’ll get field space in the summer.’ So I don’t know what will happen.”

Whitmarsh was also hopeful that football – which also recently received the go-ahead to return, with a bevy of new safety guidelines – could provide a road map for rugby, considering minor football will be returning, with full contact, when the season begins on Labour Day weekend.

“Maybe football will be a great example for us. Maybe that will be the test case that makes BC and Canada Rugby happy with a full-contact product come spring. Maybe they see that there was no (virus) transfer through football and we can (return to full contact).”

Last year, Ranj Singh performed close to 220 gigs.

“And this year started off fantastic,” the Surrey-based musician said, “but then this (pandemic) came in and closed everything down.”

No question, 2020 has been a bleak year for the city’s performing artists, due to COVID-19 and the resulting lack of events to play.

In response, Surrey Civic Theatres has rolled out a series of “Digital Stage” online concerts that offer local musicians paid gigs at a time when few are available to them.

The next one, set for Friday, July 24, will feature Singh and fellow player Sami Ghawi in an hour-long showcase starting at 7 p.m. on Surrey Civic Theatres’ Facebook page and also the city’s Youtube channel.

Ghawi has performed a few of the Digital Stage concerts in recent weeks, under the banner of his FUSIONpresents brand, but for Singh it’s pretty much a new adventure in the online-gig world.

“I’ve done a few (concerts) from home, trial and error, trying to get the sound right and things working properly,” Singh said of recent attempts to enter the virtual world of concerts. “Then with Sami’s help he got me set up and I got a bit more gear for that, and now it’s pretty good.

“I type with one finger so I’m not a technical guy at all,” he added with a laugh, “so it’s been a good learning experience for me.”

• RELATED STORY, from 2016: Melodic memories for brain-injury survivors in song by Surrey’s Ranj Singh.

On July 24 the duo will perform together in the same room at Surrey Arts Centre, for an online audience only.

“We’ve been rehearsing outdoors in a park over the last month or so, with social distancing and everything, and it will be the same setup that night,” Singh explained. “It will be mostly covers, but when I do covers I usually do them quite different, and as you know Sami is a great musician so he adds a whole new flavour to it as well, so it’s been a lot of fun to play with him. It’s going to be his style mixed with my style, with a couple of originals in there too.”

Singh and Ghawi first met in 2018 at the Surrey Arts and Business Awards, although they’d been Facebook friends prior to that. Ghawi’s FUSIONpresents company later began booking Singh at the Sheraton Vancouver Guildford Hotel’s MIXT Lounge; the upcoming showcase will mark the first time they’ll gig together.

Ghawi, who has hosted the Sunday-night jam at White Rock’s West Beach bar for more than a decade, said he’s thrilled to be a part of the Digital Stage initiative.

“I’m so grateful for this opportunity from the City of Surrey that gives artists the chance to perform and entertain the public,” he said. “Being offered a platform to perform and get paid when all our scheduled shows have been cancelled overnight is a huge blessing.”

Singh is currently performing five or six gigs a month, mostly outdoors.

“I’m at Krause Berry Farms (in Langley) every weekend, booked there until September, which is nice of them,” Singh explained. “And I have a few weddings to do, which have been scaled down to 20 or 30 people, pretty much, and those were booked last year. And I’ve been offered other gigs where I’m like, “nope,” where I’m just not comfortable doing them. Like, when we’re singing, you’re spitting 20 feet in front of you, so you have to have nobody near you. We have to be careful.”

Looking ahead, in a show called “Write the Future,” the Digital Stage concert on Aug. 7 will feature Devon More and her “humble, humorous and harmonious take on the human condition in 2020,” according to an event post on surrey.ca. “Building musical arrangements for her indie rock/pop tunes from scratch, she uses a loop pedal to live-mix the electric guitar, flute, glockenspiel, and whatever else is in her long arm’s reach.”

B.C.’s SoundON initiative aims to “celebrate the power of live music” and assist those in an industry hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Billed as the first project of its kind in Canada, SoundON “brings together industry members from across the province with one common goal – to bring the province’s vibrant music industry back to life,” according to an announcement June 29.

First up is a Blueprint company-presented “FVDED Broadcast” on Saturday (July 18) from Celebrities nightclub in Vancouver, featuring music by BBNO$, Felix Cartal & Lights, Snotty Nose Rez Kids and others, with both in-person and online viewing from 6 to 10 p.m.

“All funds raised will go to supporting Hogan’s Alley, the BC Civil Liberties Association, Urban Native Youth Association (UNYA), the Greater Vancouver & Surrey Food Banks, and future SoundON shows,” notes a post at soundon.ca/fvded.

There will be a limited number of RSVP tickets available, and donations will be collected at the door. Groups of no more than six people will be admitted.

“Between the shows, you’ll be able to watch interviews and stories, with and by charity and community leaders, to raise awareness on the impact and issues around racism, civil liberties and mental health on our industry.”

Blueprint and Live Nation say they will donate $15,000 to the charity drive, with a goal of an additional $25,000 in audience donations.

The music industry in B.C. was among the first sectors to shut down due to COVID, and will be among the last to reopen.

The scenario is predicted to create “devastating consequences for the industry,” according to SoundOn planners. “Without immediate action, more than 90 per cent of Canadian independent music venues are anticipated to permanently close within the next six months.”

In early July, this year’s FVDED in the Park festival was to feature Flume, G-Eazy and Illenium as headliners at Holland Park, but the event was cancelled for 2020 and shifted to dates in 2021.

• READ MORE: Surrey’s FVDED in the Park rescheduled for 2021, new lineup to be announced.

The website SoundON.ca will fund and stream “uniquely curated content through the lens of festivals and presenters,” with the help of public funding, corporate sponsors and individual donors.

The goal is to put economic flow back into the industry.

“This will allow people to return to work as soon as possible,” organizers of the initiative say, “while sparking hope for those affected by the pandemic. The website also provides music lovers worldwide a whole new way to discover music in B.C. Amazing shows from across our province will be featured, all on one free website.”

Bands and solo artists can apply to curate shows that will be streamed on SoundON.ca.

Upcoming events include a New Forms Digital showcase on July 26, a Lightning Dust performance from Vancouver Island on July 24 and a “Symphonic Pride” concert featuring Vancouver Symphony Orchestra on July 31.

An anticipated 100 shows will be produced. While shows will be free to watch on SoundON.ca, donations will be encouraged to help fund the project.

SoundOn is presented in part with initial funding from Creative BC, the Province of British Columbia, corporate sponsors and private funders.

“This is a tale of resiliency and one we’re excited to share with British Columbia,” said Eduardo Ottoni, Producer of SoundON. “Music and gathering are at the heart of every vibrant culture, and something that gives joy to so many people. The pandemic has not only had a devastating economic impact, but an emotional one. Our aim is to be a beacon of resilience during the pandemic and beyond.”

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on the once effervescent music industry in B.C., says Lindsay MacPherson, executive director of Music BC.

“It is a pain that has been felt by so many, especially those working in arts and culture,” MacPherson said. “A group of leaders from across the industry have come together to collaborate on a way to bring back life to the sector. We have everyone from city officials, promoters, presenters, venues, production, and artists working on the project. Our aim is to be highly collaborative, in an unprecedented way, to bring our beloved industry back.”

Backers include Vancouver-based musician Dan Mangan, co-founder of Side Door.

“The open-minded and intersectional approach that SoundON is undertaking is innovative and inspiring — bridging public, private, and philanthropic stakeholders, building community and keeping the creative community afloat.

“At Side Door, we are beyond proud to have paid out nearly $250K to artists for their online shows since the pandemic started, and even more proud to witness the human connection our interactive online approach has provided to artists and audiences alike. We are thrilled to help SoundON fulfill their mission and keep art thriving during the pandemic.”

Matty Vu says he’s in no rush to again perform comedy in a club or other venue, given COVID-19 concerns, and that’s fine because his latest endeavour seems like a perfect fit for the pandemic.

The Surrey-raised Vu is among 12 up-and-coming Canadian comics featured in The New Wave of Standup series launching Friday, July 17 on the free CBC Gem streaming service.

The 10-minute sets were filmed last February during JFL NorthWest, Vancouver’s Just for Laughs comedy festival.

“I haven’t seen the footage yet, so I might be terrible and have no idea,” said the soft-spoken Vu. “I’m not even sure I’ll watch it, because I hate watching videos of myself. But I hope people watch it, and when the time comes I hope they come out to live shows because there’s no better experience than a live comedy show.”

CLICK HERE to see the show trailer.

The Edmonton-born Vu, 34, grew up in Whalley and went to Holy Cross Regional High School before studying criminology at Kwantlen Polytechnic University. He now lives in East Vancouver.

“Lover of cross stitching and the Fast and the Furious movie franchise, Matty’s ‘comedy’ style is just as indiscriminate,” a bio proclaims. “Honestly, he’s just trying his best, and hopes you are happy with it.”

Vu said he discovered a passion for performing comedy about five years ago, and has since collected video and audio clips to post at themattyvu.com.

“I signed up for a standup class one night when I was, like, drinking and online shopping, and then I just advanced from there,” he recalled. “I had fun in the class and kept going. I had full intent of just doing the class, and that’d be it… It was something I’d never felt or experienced before. Like, I never did drama in school or anything. My friends weren’t really surprised because I always joked around a lot, but they were more surprised that I was OK in front of a crowd. That’s scary for a lot of people, public speaking.”

Comedy is a side gig for Vu, who is employed in a job related to his criminology studies.

“It’s one of those things I never talk about in comedy,” Vu said. “It’s very separate. And at work I didn’t tell people about my comedy for years. They know now, now that more public things have been happening.”

(Story continues below video)

Last summer, Vu was a semi-finalist in SiriusXM’s Top Comic competition. He didn’t earn enough online votes to win, but the experience validated his decision to enter the world of comedy.

“Sometimes I feel like I don’t belong in comedy, don’t know why – it’s like that fraud complex,” he admitted.

“I love it, it’s great,” Vu added. “I get to interact with a bunch of people, make them laugh and bring joy, hopefully.”

Vu produces the comedy shows “Bloodfeud: Standup vs. Improv” and “Craft and the Furious” at Little Mountain Gallery, and also “Yellow Fever: A Comedy Show,” described as “Vancouver’s only comedy show by Asians for non-Asians (and also Asians). The show aims to break stereotypes and highlight comedy and culture.

“I’ve done shows for five years and the majority of the audiences have not been very diverse,” Vu said. “In a city that has a lot of Asian people in it, it’s weird to see audiences with just white people. There really aren’t a lot of comedy performers of colour, of Asian background, so I kind of wanted to highlight those people. I didn’t expect a lot of Asian people to come out, but it was very nice for that to happen.”

Like with other performing arts, comedy shows have been put on hold during the COVID-19 pandemic.

“There are a couple (venues) doing comedy shows again, but I am still very uncomfortable being in a crowded room, so I have no interest in doing that right now,” Vu explained. “I’ve done a few online shows — not Zoom shows but more like a friend recording me in a park and me performing to my one friend recording. That’s still fun.

“I’m OK not performing until the fall, and even if there’s a second wave or whatever, I’m OK taking a step back for even a year,” Vu added. “I’m cool with that. Maybe there’s some Catholic guilt too, about not wanting to get other people sick.”

For now, online showcases like the CBC Gem series will have to do for Vu.

“It’s a diverse group of people, which I love,” he said about the series. “That night was so much fun. There were two shows back to back. I was first in the lineup and I was very nervous, I remember that.”

In addition to Vu, the series also features Salma Hindy (“a Muslim comic from Toronto who also happens to be a biomedical engineer,” according to a news release), Yumi Nagashima (“who arrived in Vancouver by way of Tokyo”), Paul Rabliauskus (“from Poplar River First Nation Reserve in Manitoba”), Al Val (“a bold transgender comic from Toronto”), Ola Dada (“a Nigerian-Canadian raised in Fort McMurray, Alberta”), Toronto’s Cassie Cao (“a former economist turned stand-up comedian”), Vancouver’s Aaron Read (“who won JFL NorthWest’s ‘Breakout Artist of the Year’”), Calgary’s Brett Forte (“who is upset with his Millennial generation…and thinks audiences should be too”), Calgary’s Brittany Lyseng (“who swapped her elevator mechanic job for the comedy spotlight”), Vancouver standup and cartoonist Jacob Samuel and Toronto’s Kyle Brownrigg (“who was the first gay male to be awarded ‘Best Breakout Artist’ at the Canadian Comedy Awards”).

A “Drive Thru Food Truck Festival” is coming to Cloverdale Fairgrounds.

The two-day event will be hosted by Greater Vancouver Food Truck Festival on the weekend of July 18-19, from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily. Admission is free.

“We’re featuring seven of your favourite food trucks and one heck of a good time,” event organizers say in a Facebook post.

The venue is on 62A Avenue, under the wooden arches by the rec centre, off 176th Street.

The Saturday lineup of vendors will include Tin Lizzy Concessions (mini doughnuts), Mo-Bacon, Holi Masala, Lenny’s Lemons, Next Gen. Concessions (“street dogs,” fries and poutine), Ford Concessions (Steve O’s Fried Chicken) and Betty’s Greek Honey Ballz (loukoumades).

On the Sunday, vendors are Rocky Point Ice Cream, REEL Mac And Cheese, Wings Tap And Grill, Next Gen. Concessions (funnel cakes), The Truckin’ BBQ, Ford Concessions (Los Tacos Hermanos) and Lenny’s Lemons Less.

Presented by Coast Capital Savings, similar drive-through events were held at sites in Abbotsford and Langley in June, and another is planned in Chilliwack.

(Story continues below)

Festival owner/operator Jason Faria said signage directs guests to the main parking lots on site, and are then directed to the lineup of their choice. Patrons order from the food truck, and a person wearing personal protective equipment will collect their payment.

Customers will then exit the parking lot. There will not be any on-site seating, and tailgate parties aren’t permitted.

Menus and more details are posted to greatervanfoodtruckfest.com.

The Greater Vancouver Food Truck Festival (GVFTF) is billed as “the largest roaming food truck festival in Canada.”

The Conservatives say they want a criminal investigation into the Liberal government’s decision to award a $900-million contract to the WE organization. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Christopher Katsarov

By Walter van Halst

Special to the Cloverdale Reporter

In 2012, a student named Dayton Campbell-Harris asked me if I would buy a $10 Me to We water bottle so he could attend one of their upcoming events. Dayton was a good student as well as a good rugby player and since this charity professed to support student empowerment, how could I say no?

Eight years later, this charity, its fundraising arm and Justin Trudeau have all become embroiled in a scandal which has prompted federal Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion to launch the third investigation of the PM who appointed him. You can’t make this stuff up.

But beyond the nearly $1 billion “sole source” contract offered to this organization to run Canada’s summer jobs program and the $300,000 in speaking fees it paid to the Trudeau family, there is potentially a much darker side to this controversy which parents, teachers, principals and school board officials all across this country need to pay attention to. Teachers were paid as much as $12,000 each to recruit their own students by the We Charity, which raises enormous ethical issues in education.

Should teachers be recruiters, or benefit financially from their position of trust with the students whom they teach? The obvious answer is no, because doing so could create both real and apparent conflicts of interest, much like a politician or his family making extra money on the side.

SEE ALSO: Cloverdale Strong: our town in a pandemic

However, since education is a provincial responsibility and each of the 60 school districts in B.C. also set important policies within their jurisdictions, it would be prudent at this time for those in senior local and provincial leadership positions to review what safeguards they have in place.

For example, if teachers own or manage a business instead of a charity, is it appropriate for them to hire current students whom they might still be teaching? Similarly, if a teacher either owns or is paid by a club sports team, is it ethical for that teacher to either recruit or financially benefit from their own students? Clearly, in both situations either a real or apparent conflict of interest would take place.

In addition to the practice of recruiting for money, the We Charity may also have involved a more subtle but equally questionable practice: recruiting for partisan purposes or ideology.

For example, if the founders of We, Marc and Craig Kielburger, have close political ties to Justin Trudeau and the Liberal Party, that is their right, but did anyone tell the kids before they joined? And if teachers start encouraging or recruiting students to join politically active organizations, even if they aren’t paid to do this recruiting, is this really an appropriate thing to do with minors who aren’t even old enough to vote?

Of course teachers have as much right to be active in politics as any citizen, but you would think a former teacher now serving as prime minister would know better than to hold giant pep rallies full of students who might not be able to realize that a charitable event has now become a partisan one too—unless all the party leaders were invited to take part equally, which they weren’t.

Teachers should encourage students to get involved in their community, including in civic, provincial, and national campaigns, as long as the students are pursuing their own causes or parties and not their teacher’s interests or ideology and above all else, both these students and their parents have made informed consent.

Classrooms must be centres for education, not indoctrination, or in the case of the We Charity scandal, both indoctrination and renumeration.

Dangling carelessly 12 inches above our dining room floor, the still-connected electrical outlet seemed to revel in my frustration.

As a single bead of sweat dripped from my brow onto the newly installed vinyl floor, the outlet’s two three-pronged “faces” seemed to mock me, as if they were a couple of anguished emojis.

“Oh my God, we can’t believe you are struggling so much with this,” they seemed to be saying.

And they would be right.

All I was trying to do was replace the plastic outlet cover.

How hard can it be?

I had just replaced four others, including a dimmer switch, but as seems to be the rule of thumb in any project, it’s always the last one that gives you the most grief.

My inner frustration with the problem outlet took a turn for the worse when my screwdriver missed its mark, leaving a small indentation on the freshly painted wall.

It was at this point that I did what any self-respecting dad who is all thumbs around the house.

I blamed someone else.

“You see kids, this is what happens when you don’t do something right the first time,” I told my two bemused teens. “If the builder had just installed this properly, this wouldn’t be an issue.”

My wife arrived home and my rant continued, this time with a few colourful adjectives thrown in for good measure.

“Why can’t anything be built properly these days,” I vented. “You spend all this money on a townhouse and they can’t even install a (blank) wall outlet properly.”

With a simple, “I’m sure you’ll figure it out” verbal pat on the head, my wife went upstairs.

It was then that I realized what the problem was. I was simply doing it wrong. I was using the wrong holes for the screws.

Thirty seconds later, the outlet cover was replaced and I offered a silent apology to the builders who had installed the outlet properly way back in 2005.

As I meekly put my tools away, I was reminded of an angry reader, who only last week made a similar faux pas.

We had just published a special section congratulating Surrey’s grads and she was furious that we omitted her granddaughter.

“What a horrendous mistake to make. I cried when I saw that,” she wrote in a scathing email. “In the midst of a pandemic and all the ugly that is happening right now to not print her name is very cruel.

“This is a very painful experience for her, I’m sure, as it is for me as her grandmother. It is a terrible oversight on your part.”

Concerned about the omission, we looked into it and contacted the school district, who submitted the list for publication.

It turns out the grad’s name was published with her class after all – her grandmother just missed it.

“My apologies to you for my mistake,” she wrote in another email to us. “I read through the list twice and still missed it. I’m the one who needs better glasses.”

It seems we both learned a similar lesson – before lashing out and blaming others, take a deep breath and make sure the problem doesn’t lie with you.

But admitting that to your wife – well, that’s a different story.

“How did it go with the outlet?” my wife asked as she came down the stairs.

“All good,” I said, proudly pointing at my hard-earned victory.

“I figured it out.”

Some life lessons are best kept to yourself, right?

Performed behind a clear plastic curtain, live music returned to Whalley Legion on Canada Day (July 1).

As part of COVID-19 control measures, the screen separated the Springsteen/Orbison tribute band from the audience during the daytime gig.

The two-piece act features Daniel Yard (as Bruce Springsteen) and Gord Rebelato (Roy Orbison), with special guest Janice Anderson as Patsy Cline.

“It was interesting playing behind a plastic curtain at Whalley legion for Canada Day yesterday, but it was a packed house,” Yard posted to the Facebook page Live Music in Surrey BC.

“First legion in the Lower Mainland to have live music. Thanks to everyone who came out for the Springsteen/Orbison show.”

During the pandemic, with capacity capped at 50 people including patrons and staff, the Legion hall will host live bands for special events only, at a temporary location at 10767 King George Blvd.

In Newton, Brewster’s Pub is advertising a “BBQ & Band” night Saturday, July 18, featuring the acoustic sounds of Sally Melo and Jay Patterson. Tickets are $12 per person for the “Customer Appreciation Day” promo.

The pub calendar also includes a Flashback! show on July 11 and The Rhythm Method band July 25.

Elsewhere, White Hart Public House continues to showcase bands on stage at the former Hook and Ladder space, including Long Run (July 11), the AC/DC tribute band Bonnie Scott (July 18) and The Gemtones (July 24), among others.

“We want to remind everyone that we have set floor plans for all shows due to covid restrictions,” pub operators posted to Facebook. “We also have curtains between some tables for safety measures, although we will always try to give everyone the best spot — we do have to follow protocol. Safety first.”

Meantime, Surrey’s online Canada Day celebration earned 45,000 views on Facebook and YouTube Live, according to city hall.

The event marked the nation’s 153rd birthday with performances by Colin James, 54-40, Bif Naked, Alex Cuba and more, in a four-hour virtual party. Canadian hockey legend Hayley Wickenheiser hosted the two-part event, which featured a morning “Family Hour” and evening concert.

(Submitted by Shannon Bernays)

The Easter Seals Drop Zone event is returning to Surrey this September.

The annual event, which raises funds for Canadians living with disabilities, is still on despite the COVID-19 pandemic.

Easter Seals describes it as a “great no-contact event” that people can still participate in during the pandemic.

“Be a superhero to persons with diverse abilities – one of the most vulnerable groups of COVID-19,” reads the website.

“Because of people like you, we can continue to provide our community with much needed programs and services: a switch to online virtual summer camps, city adventure day camps and the reopening of Easter Seals House, now that our community is returning to Vancouver for medical appointments and treatments.”

Health and safety for participants “has and always will be a top priority at Easter Seals,” and planning for the events will be moving forward following guidelines in place by local health authorities, the provincial government and WorkSafeBC.

The Surrey drop zone event is Tuesday, Sept. 15 at Central City Office Tower, with a fundraising goal of $100,000.

People can sign up at eastersealsbcy.akaraisin.com as either a team or individual.

There is also a Vancouver drop zone on Sept. 10.

Since the first drop zone in Halifax in 2003, roughly $16 million has been raised for Easter Seals programs and services.

(Contributed photo)

A pair of new arrivals at the White Rock RCMP detachment this month won’t put more ‘boots on the ground’ in the seaside city – but the speckled siblings have certainly added an appreciated lightness to the job, says the city’s top cop.

Staff Sgt. Kale Pauls said the journey that ultimately led to a rescue operation on Thursday (July 9), began June 26 with the discovery of three seagull eggs on the detachment’s Pacific Avenue rooftop.

The find was made during maintenance efforts, Pauls told Peace Arch News Friday (July 10).

Just under a week later, the eggs started to hatch, and on July 8, “two fuzzy hatchlings were observed running around the roof.”

It’s unclear what became of the third egg, Pauls said, surmising it may not have survived.

July 9, a little drama unfolded after one of the two hatchlings somehow made it off the roof. It was found on the ground, seemingly unsure what to do with itself, after an officer noticed a parent seagull “squawking quite loud” from the rooftop, Pauls said.

“The parent bird was communicating with the hatchling, but would not go to the ground to help it,” he continued.

Animal control was contacted, and bird-rescue society officials advised that the hatchling should be returned to the roof by capturing it in a box, he said.

“The parent bird did not oppose the capture of the hatchling, possibly realizing that it was helpful. The hatchling was convinced to come into the box and was reunited with their sibling on the roof, which has an elevated ledge that acts as a fenced in playground.”

Pauls said the detachment roof “appears to be the safest place in the city for the hatchlings to avoid being prey.”

And while the adventure won’t be showing up in any police files, Pauls said it has been a nice journey to witness.

“I think the best part is that you rarely see a gull hatchling, so actually seeing these fuzzy creatures experiencing their first look a life is a nice addition to the daily operations at a detachment,” he said.

A “contactless” donation drive is happening in Surrey today.

Organized by the COVID-19 Women’s Initiative, the group is accepting donations for Lower Mainland women’s shelters and transition homes.

The Surrey drive, located at Platinum Pro-Claim Restoration (18651 52nd Ave.), runs from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.

There will also be donation drives in Vancouver (1580-505 Burrard St.) and Richmond (13880 Mayfield Pl.) during the same time.

People can also donate to their GoFundMe at tinyurl.com/ydhs9mbs.

Donations needed include toiletries, food, toys, art supplies, clothing, household items, gift cards and personal protective equipment.

Donations from Friday’s Lower Mainland drives will benefit Turning Point Recovery, Covenant House, Harmony House, Talitha Koumb Society, YWCA Vancouver, Chrysalis Society, Atira Women’s Resource Centre, Vancouver Rape Relief & Women’s Shelter, WISH Drop-In Centre and Society.

COVID-19 Women’s Initiative is a non-profit, student-led organization of medical students, physicians and community members across Canada, including Vancouver, Toronto, Ottawa and London.

According to the organization, it was started by two medical students “who recognized a need to help women are in challenging circumstances, further heightened by COVID-19.”

“There has been an increase in violent events during the COVID-19 pandemic,” the website reads. “Transition houses and anti-violence organizations have struggled during this time not only because of the increased need, but also a decrease in available resources.

“The CWI was formed to help support these organizations so that they could adequately help women and those experiencing violence. The items donated through this event will be distributed among the following organizations based on their expressed needs.”

A Bollywood-inspired class is just one of the dance fitness and yoga offerings raising funds and awareness for a local animal sanctuary.

North Delta’s Sweet Serenity Yoga and Wellness is partnering with Perfect Pastures Animal Sanctuary in Ladner for a bi-weekly outdoor fundraising event beginning this week.

Set on Perfect Pastures’ field, “Fridays at the Farm” is a four-class series that benefits the animal sanctuary while safely continuing group classes during the current COVID-19 restrictions. The outdoor program permits the Sweet Serenity community to stay active and connected while practicing in an open space.

“We’re offering two class style options: the ‘Fitness Mash-up’ — with Zumba, BollyX and Refit — and a yoga series featuring Hatha and Slow Flow. The variety makes it extra engaging and fun, and gives each instructor their time to shine,” explained Sweet Serenity owner Jenine Lehfeldt.

“Maggie [Ferguson] from Perfect Pastures is the kindest, most hard-working person I’ve ever met. She puts the animals before even her own well-being. I’m passionate about animals, too, and feel fortunate I’m able to help.”

Lehfeldt’s North Delta studio has hosted many local fundraising initiatives, including cat and bunny yoga benefiting the Delta Community Animal Shelter.

Sweet Serenity recently helped Perfect Pastures raise over $1,200 for Amaro, a rescue dog who needed medical attention for pneumonia and an enlarged heart.

Fridays at the Farm was conceived as a means to continue to support the sanctuary, which is a haven for farm animals like goats, sheep and pot-bellied pigs, as well as a temporary home for pets needing immediate refuge before moving to organizations that deal with foster care and adoption.

“Things are getting more difficult for animal rescue care, especially since COVID-19 has increased poverty in communities already in need,” Maggie Ferguson from Perfect Pastures said.

Ferguson has been based out of her Ladner farm, located at 9939 Ladner Trunk Rd., for 10 of the last 40 years she’s been helping rescue animals. For the past nine, she has also facilitated a food program aiding animals in northern B.C. communities. This year alone, she has collected and shipped 7,900 pounds of food to rescues, food banks and community support workers who in turn distribute the goods where they’re desperately needed.

“I realized northern communities weren’t getting the food support they needed, so I started collecting animal food and packaging it in bulk,” Ferguson said. “I approached Lower Mainland transport companies who go to remote areas about getting what I collect to the rescues – and the rest is history.”

This year, Ferguson’s trusted delivery truck finally reached the end of its life after 350,000 kilometres on the road. In order to continue its mission, Perfect Pastures has started a GoFundMe (gofundme.com/f/animal-rescue-food-fund) with a goal of $35,000 to purchase a replacement flat-deck truck.

Lehfeldt, meanwhile, has had to get creative since the pandemic hit, pivoting to online classes while her studio had to remain closed. On June 15, Sweet Serenity reopened the doors at 8330 112th St., but the new safety precautions needed to keep clients safe have dropped the studio’s capacity by 75 per cent.

“It’s been one of the hardest things any small business owner could have ever imagined facing, but through sheer determination and the support of our community, we have managed to stay afloat,” Lehfeldt said. “We aren’t out of the woods yet, as we don’t qualify for the majority of government assistance, however we’re determined to continue being the safe space our all-ages community needs for physical and mental health.

Fridays at the Farm kicks off this Friday, July 10 (Refit with Shilo and Zumba toning with Gabriella) and follows with classes July 24 (BollyX with Kat and Rev+Flow with Shilo), Aug. 7 (Refit with Shilo and Zumba Toning with Gabriella) and Aug. 21 (Zumba with Nadi and Rev+Flow with Shilo), weather-permitting. A Zoom link will be provided in case of rain.

Participants may attend one or all classes, and are asked to pre-register online (clients.mindbodyonline.com/asp/main_enroll.asp?fl=true&tabID=8), with a minimum donation of $44 for either four-class series.

A South Surrey senior who served in the Korean War nearly 70 years ago was thanked this week for his efforts “in restoring and preserving our freedom and democracy.”

Retired Col. Donald McClellan on Wednesday (July 8) was presented with an Ambassador for Peace Medal during a ceremony at Amica White Rock, where he has lived since last September.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, attendees were masked for the event.

Attended by Sen. Yonah Martin – who is Grand Patron of the Korea Veterans Association of Canada Heritage Unit – as well as Deputy Consul Gen. Yongwook Na (representing the Korean government), Korean War Veterans Association Western Chapter president Woo Seok Lee and McClellan’s daughter Linda, the ceremony was part of a three-year campaign that launched last month to honour the service and sacrifices of Canadians in the Korean War.

This year is the start of the 70th anniversary of the Korean War years, a news release explains. The Korean War Forgotten No More campaign will commemorate various milestones of the war, concluding July 27, 2023 – the 70th anniversary of the signing of the armistice.

The Ambassador for Peace Medal is “an expression of appreciation from the Korean government to veterans who served in the Korean War from June 25, 1950 to July 27, 1953,” the release states. It is also awarded to veterans who participated in UN peacekeeping operations until the end of 1955.

McClellan served in Korea from 1951-52 as a member of the 57th Independent Field Squadron, Royal Canadian Engineers. He was 23 years old at the time.

“We were the first brigade there,” he told Peace Arch News Thursday (July 9).

“We started planning it in 1950, as soon as the North Koreans crossed the line. The first job we had… was to guard the Han River bridge east of Seoul.

“I won’t tell you stories about that,” he continued, adding, “we didn’t have to fight it, but we shot somebody in the wrong place.

“It was a marine unit going along a north bank in the dark, and our sentry challenged and no answer… so he took a pot shot at them and he hit the fellow sitting up right of the driver and it went off his back into the driver, so he got two people with one bullet.

“We didn’t kill anybody, but it stopped them.”

McClellan said he is proud of the role Canadians played in the conflict – the first brigade group alone was 7,500 troops; in all, more than 26,000 served over the three years, and 516 died.

“I lost a couple of men who were not my friend because they were officers, and men don’t make friendships a rule,” McClellan said.

“I wear a pin every day for one of those men. It’s on my sweater, it’s a little poppy. I don’t know his first name, but his last name was Davis and he was 19 years old.”

McClellan’s 32 years of military service also included time in northern Europe after the war – for NATO in Germany and Belgium – and as a liaison officer to the U.S. army research and development laboratories in Virginia.

Martin on Wednesday spoke of how she and all people of Korean descent in Canada owe their lives to McClellan and other Korean veterans.

A proclamation presented with his medal expresses “everlasting gratitude of the Republic of Korea and our people for the service you and your countrymen have performed.”

“We cherish in our hearts the memory of your boundless sacrifices in helping us reestablish our Free Nation.”

Tavisha Kochhar, a Grade 9 student at Sullivan Heights Secondary, has made hundreds of cloth masks in recent months, selling them to raise funds for Lower Mainland hospitals and vaccine research.

Tavisha, according to the Surrey school district, started sewing the masks about two months. She sells them through her website, tavishahelpinghands.com, and then ships the masks throughout Canada and the U.S.

So far, she has made roughly 600 masks, raising $2,700 for Surrey Memorial Hospital, BC Children’s Hospital, St. Paul’s Hospital and Vancouver General Hospital.

“I’ve always been fundraising,” said Tavisha, 14. “I kept on donating, making things, selling what I made and I would use the funds collected to donate to different charities and organizations.

With the pandemic, Tavisha said she decided to make affordable masks because she saw online “that many people were selling masks for unreasonable prices and it was just so unfair to the people who don’t have jobs anymore and lost family members.”

Tavisha took a textiles course in Grade 8, learning how to sew.

In 2017, she started Tavisha’s Helping Hands to help people suffering from the B.C. wildfires. According to her website, she raised $850 by selling artwork, making pencil holders, key chains, paper weights and magnets using recycled materials.

“The environment is a really big issue,” she said. “If we’re able to make reusable masks that you could wash and keep clean for longer, it’s just so much better for the environment.”

Through her website, people can buy masks off all different designs, ranging in price from $5 to $7, plus shipping.

Over the years, she has donated $5,000 to several charities.

1071,1071,1538,northdeltareporter,https://www.northdeltareporter.com/community/south-surrey-crash-victim-honoured-by-kpu-for-determination-and-strength/,South Surrey crash victim honoured by KPU for ‘determination and strength’ – North Delta Reporter,'Nick Greenizan',2020-07-08,"A South Surrey woman who overcame long odds – and spent three months in a coma after being involved in a horrific car crash – has been named the latest recipient of Kwantlen Polytechnic University’s Honorary Alumna Award.

In 2007, a then-18-year-old Harriet Ronaghan, recently graduated from Elgin Park Secondary, was preparing to start classes at KPU when she, along with her mom and brother, were in their car when it was hit by a dump truck.

The crash left Ronaghan with a traumatic brain injury and required emergency surgery which came with just a five per cent chance of survival.

The recovery was a gruelling process, she noted.

“I had to relearn everything – to stand up, walking, talking.”

After 10 months spent in hospital relearning basic motor skills, she was sent home in a wheelchair, although she only ever used it three times.

Ronaghan wrote a book about her recovery experience, You Are My Sunshine: The Journey Through My Recovery of a Traumatic Brain Injury, which was a logical extension of the notes she was already taking as she documented her thoughts and feelings as a way to help process all that she had gone through.

She was inspired to write the book after a return visit to Royal Columbian Hospital, where she met the father of a teenager who had been in a motorcycle accident and, like Ronaghan had been, was in a coma.

“The way he thanked me and called his wife right away and told her about me – that was the moment I decided I needed to write a book. The accident was awful, but my story can help people,” she said in a KPU news release.

“Harriet is the epitome of the word Kwantlen, which means ‘tireless runner’,” said Dr. Alan Davis, president and vice-chancellor of KPU.

“She has shown that despite the adversities she’s had to face and overcome, her determination and strength has prevailed. We are proud that the KPU Alumni Association has named her an Honorary Alumna.”

Ronaghan has now recovered, but her journey is not yet over. She has a different walking gait than she once did, and her speech is slower. As well, she becomes fatigued easily.

“At the beginning, I thought I was going back to school to pursue my writing, but I realized after years of recovery and therapies that I can’t do that,” she said.

“My fatigue is too severe and that’s something I’ve had to come to terms with.”

Ronaghan, who is married and has one son – with another child on the way – has been sharing her story with others at rehabilitation centres, and in 2019 she was the recipient of the Coast Mental Health Courage to Come Back Award.

“We are so proud to confer Harriet with an Honorary Alumni award and by so doing welcome her into our KPU alumni family. Her story of strength and tenacity in the face of great adversity is certainly an inspiration to students, alumni and the whole KPU community,” said David Dryden, chair of the KPU Alumni Association.

A new book penned by a local history group explores North Delta’s past, tracing the community’s roots from the site of Indigenous fishing camps, through early settlement by European (and other) pioneers and into modern times.

The recently released North Delta History and Heritage is a labour of love researched and written by a dozen members of the Delta Heritage Society’s North Delta Advisory Group. The 190-page book offers a first-of-its-kind look at the history of the various communities that now comprise North Delta, including numerous photographs — many seldom seen before — and both single-page and pull-out maps to help readers put the past into context today.

Local historian John Macdonald, who edited the book and contributed to its writing, said readers might be surprised to learn how far back the history of the area goes.

“[When] most people think of the history of North Delta they think … it started with Annieville, and it did in a way, but it started long, long before the Norwegians got there, and of course the First Nations people have been here for thousands of years,” said Macdonald, who has written several articles about local history and authored the book Kennedy’s Trail: Past to Present.

“There’s never been a book like this on North Delta, and because of the history of Delta a lot of things tend to be Ladner-centric. That’s why I think it’s been so well received.”

The book’s initial printing of 200 copies in May sold out in just 10 days, and fewer than 75 copies remain of the book’s 300-copy second printing in mid-June. A third printing of 300 copies will be coming soon.

“We’ve had people take one, get as far as their car and come back and get another one. So I’ve started saying to people, ‘Are you sure you don’t want more than one?’” Macdonald said.

The book features several maps and aerial photographs to help readers orient themselves with the North Delta that was, and navigate the past in the here-and-now.

“There’s so much you can miss. My wife and I have driven all over Delta exploring places, but some places you just don’t notice.”

For example, people may not realize the reason 112th Street takes a turn at 90th Avenue is because the land in the area was pre-empted by early settler James Kennedy before the government survey in 1873 that laid the groundwork for the orderly grid of streets seen elsewhere in North Delta and Surrey.

“In 1861, the provincial government allowed people to go out and pre-empt land, which means driving a stake in the ground — or four stakes in the ground — and that’s what happened in Annieville. That’s what James Kennedy did and others along there, all the way from 96th [Avenue] all the way to Burns Bog.”

“The back of Kennedy’s lot became 114th [Street] at an angle, and the same with a little piece of 90th [Avenue] that jogs down to River Road there. That was the edge of Kennedy’s property, and that was where Kennedy’s Trail came up.”

Copies of North Delta History and Heritage are available for $20 (tax included) by contacting John Macdonald at johnmac609@gmail.com.

This summer, Surrey’s SuperChefs Cookery For Kids program has gone online with camps that teach kids about cooking, nutrition and sports activities.

The first virtual camps, free for children between 8 and 12 years of age, were launched on Monday (July 6).

Each camper will “attend” the camps for two weeks, and participate in cooking, nutrition and sports activities through mid-August, said Dr. Greg Chang, a local dentist and culinary educator who founded SuperChefs.

“Having been out of their regular school routine since March, campers and families appear eager to participate,” said Dr. Chang. “SuperChefs enrollment is nearing capacity – and those attending the ingredient pickup on July 5 (from outside Johnston Heights Secondary) were enthusiastic and anxious to get cooking.”

(Story continues below)

The COVID-19 pandemic prompted the shift online for the camps, now in their 12th year. Registration is done through the website superchefs.org.

The virtual format sticks to the program goal of promoting a healthier generation of youth, with added interactive polls, games and activities. It’s all based on the FACES acronym of making kids Food literate, Aware of food systems, Competent in cooking skills, Engaged in physical activity and able to Savour balanced food choices.

Former BC Lions receiver Geroy Simon, now the football club’s director of scouting, has gotten involved by creating a full-body, family-friendly workout video for the camps.

“As a former professional athlete and a father of two active children, I know the importance of keeping you and your family fit and healthy,” Simon said in a news release. “I am happy to provide tips to be a champion both on and off the field because a fit family is a happy family.”

Chang created the online program with the help of local university students, many of whom are keen to have careers in dietetics, healthcare, education and business. Two of the SuperChefs co-ordinators — Hannah Bailey and Skye Moore — have been accepted into the UBC Dietetics program in September, he said.

Dr. Greg’s SuperChefs Cookery For Kids is a non-profit arm of SuperChefs, described as an entertainment lifestyle private company.

The program receives funding from several community and corporate partners, in addition to federal agencies including the Canada Summer Job program and the federal Emergency Community Support Fund administered by the SurreyCares Community Foundation.

“SurreyCares helps facilitate that strengthening of community capacity, and we can’t say enough about the initiatives of SuperChefs Cookery for Kids,” said Michael Bose, chair of SurreyCares’ grants committee.

A Southridge School student and a group of her classmates raised more than $5,000 for frontline health-care workers this spring, with the money helping fund a meal program at Peace Arch Hospital.

Back in late March, as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was just coming into focus, 16-year-old Nora Zhu was speaking with her aunt, who works at a large hospital in China. From that conversation, she learned about how overworked the frontline workers there were, and was spurred into action closer to home.

“My aunt said doctors there were working so many hours a day, and were so tired. And in addition to self-quarantining in the hospitals, just had no time or energy to make themselves proper meals,” Zhu said.

“The conditions seemed really horrible, so I did some research and talked to some of my friends who have parents or family members working in hospitals here to see if the conditions in B.C. hospitals were similar.

“I found out that (working conditions) weren’t as bad as in China… but there were still many doctors and nurses who were self-quarantining (away from their families), they were working a lot of overtime, they were tired.”

As a way to help, Zhu decided she wanted to try to set up a meal-delivery program for front-line workers at Peace Arch Hospital, raising money and partnering with local restaurants to deliver food to busy, overworked staff.

The teen was inspired to help at PAH “on account of my family members and I have visited many times.”

After contacting the hospital, she found out that such a program had already been started by the Peace Arch Hospital Foundation, so she changed course, and decided to gather up some friends and raise money for the already-running initiative instead.

After a handful of Zoom calls with her fellow organizers, a GoFundMe account was launched, and over the next few months raised $5,605.

They were also able to bring one more restaurant on board with the hospital’s program, Zhu said.

The GoFundMe campaign officially closed June 1, and the money was sent to the meal-delivery organizers. With each meal costing between $8-$13, Zhu said their efforts were able to pay for more than 500 meals.

“About seven or eight weeks’ worth,” she said.

While the core group of fundraisers included Zhu and seven friends – Jonathan Hilton, Stanford Guo, Tatum Byrne, Alyssai Hai, Edward Cui, Coco Li, and Aerin Brown – she said there were dozens more who helped get the word out behind the scenes.

“In the end, my team and I were very proud… we were able to give back to our community,” Zhu said.

(submitted photo)

A Surrey Crime Prevention Society program that helped Melvyn Mani become an award-winning volunteer has been relaunched with funding of $150,000 through grants, sponsorships and private donations.

The organization’s Community Safety Mentorship Program pairs mentors with vulnerable youth who may be experiencing bullying or isolation.

Mani was one such teen five years ago when he first met Jerry Gunadasa, a volunteer and trained mentor with SCPS who was studying criminal justice at the time.

Both mentor and mentee sought careers in policing.

Back in 2015, Mani was struggling to fit in at high school. He ended up valedictorian of his grad class and today, at age 23, works at an electronics company and studies at Kwantlen Polytechnic University.

“Jerry was there through the rough patches,” Mani recalled. “Jerry motivated me to prepare for a career in policing and worked with me to secure a spot in the prestigious RCMP Youth Citizens Academy.”

(Story continues below video)

Mani was recently given the Pursuit of Excellence Award by Surrey Crime Prevention Society for his volunteer work in the Citizens Community Safety Watch Program.

“He’s come a long way,” Gunadasa said of Mani. “When he started off in the program he was pretty shy and timid and really closed off. It took a while for him to open up to me, and I was able to share a lot of my knowledge about policing with him.”

Surrey Crime Prevention Society announced the relaunch of its mentorship program on Tuesday (July 7).

“We are profoundly grateful for the generosity of our donors and sponsors,” said Karen Reid Sidhu, executive director of SCPS. “This program will support vulnerable youth while engaging them in activities that help them develop a sense of civic pride in their community.”

Since 1984, the volunteer-based Surrey Crime Prevention Society has backed community safety programs in Surrey. Today, SCPS has 350 volunteers, most of them university and high school students. Over the past five years, 1,600 volunteers contributed 145,000 hours toward the enhancement of community safety. More details are posted to preventcrime.ca, or call 604-502-8555.

The organization’s annual awards event for 2020 has been cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

This year’s Volunteer of the Year is Darren Brierley, who joined Surrey Crime Prevention Society in March of 2019. Since then, he has volunteered close to 350 hours of his time. “He participates in multiple programs including Citizens Community Safety Watch, Special Events and Traffic Safety,” according to a bio.

“Darren continues to demonstrate strong leadership, professionalism and has a can do attitude. He is reliable and always here to support programs above and beyond his program requirements. Darren leads new volunteers providing them with mentorship ensuring they are following proper procedures. His problem solving skills are superior and is capable of handling difficult situations that arise in his roles. SCPS is very fortunate to have such a dedicated volunteer.”

Other SCPS volunteer awards have been given to Samantha Mitchell, Kushal Patel, Amandeep Brar, Rob Gelderman, Gazaldeep Cheema, Anny Zhang, Amritvir Singh, Jasjot Sandhu, Manveer Rai and Simone Saini.

Headstone repairs have finally been completed at Surrey Centre Cemetery.

After seven grave markers were vandalized in April, the City of Surrey started repairing the more than 100-year-old tombstones.

Now with the work done, Sue Bryant, a member of the Surrey Historical Society, said she was delighted with the effort.

“We can’t say enough of how well the City of Surrey’s cemetery division took care of the repairs—and even fixed a few more that were in need,” Bryant said, on behalf of the historical society. “Overall, it was quite a good job.”

Laurie Cavan, the general manager of the Parks, Recreation, and Culture department, told the Cloverdale Reporter in April the repair work was done in an effort to restore the grave markers in such a way that they would retain their historic appearance.

“To prevent future vandalism, the repaired monuments will be fastened with a metal rod through the monument into its base,” Cavan said at the time. “It is rare for historic monuments in Surrey to be defaced or damaged by acts of vandalism.”

The vandalized markers—nearly all one metre or taller in height—were all located in the pioneer section of the cemetery.

At the time, Michael Gibbs, president of the Surrey Historical Society, wondered, given the profile of the pioneers, the historical value of the pioneer section, and its century-old markers, if security cameras were an answer to prevent further acts of vandalism.

Bryant said she’ll be resuming her cemetery history walks this summer beginning with a paranormal walk hosted by Gypsy Moon.

“I’ll be leading one at the end of July, with social distancing measures in place.”

She said the July walking tour is already full, but there will be another one in September. The details for the September walking tour will be posted on the Museum of Surrey’s website in the coming weeks.

“I’ve been busy behind the scenes researching more stories to share on these walks as well, so they should be even better than ever.”

Surrey-area minor hockey associations are aiming to hit the ice again later this summer, as always.

Registration has opened for play in the Surrey, Cloverdale, Semiahmoo and North Delta associations that comprise the Valley West zone in B.C.

The regional Pacific Coast Amateur Hockey Association said it is “well positioned for a successful season start in September, following prescribed return-to-play protocols from our sport governing bodies, the public health authorities and provincial government.

“It is our intention to have both recreational and rep hockey,” the association said in a July 3 statement. “This includes preparing game schedules for various return-to-play scenarios. We are pleased that we are now in Phase 3 of B.C’s Restart Plan, and we are beginning to see some of our municipal arenas reopen with programming run by our member associations.”

Local minor hockey associations are looking to start on-ice sessions in mid-August, as in previous seasons, but in Surrey it’s not yet clear when city-operated rinks and rec centres will reopen during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The city is looking at a “phased” re-opening of rec centres starting in the fall “if conditions stay the same,” City Manager Vincent Lalonde told Surrey council at its June 29 meeting.

Meantime, hockey practices organized by individuals have been held at private rinks including Langley Sportsplex and Delta Planet Ice. No Hockey Canada-sanctioned events are currently allowed.

The PCAHA says it has been working with its member associations on plans for a safe return to hockey. Regular meetings with all parties “have been occurring since April to plan and prepare for next season.”

• RELATED STORY: New PJHL boss is game for the return of hockey this fall, if green light given.

The Now-Leader was on a recent Zoom conference with executives from Valley West minor hockey associations, including Surrey president Harbs Bains, Cloverdale president Deanna Cox, North Delta president Robert Reid and Semiahmoo executive director Dave Newson.

“We know we have to work together to make this game come back this fall, and also make it comfortable and seamless for our members,” Bains said.

In early June, Hockey Canada said the best approach for a return to hockey in Canada is to allow each of its 13 provincial organizations “the opportunity to work with authorities in their respective regions to determine when it is safe to return to the ice in areas that fall under their jurisdiction.”

Minor hockey registration has since begun, and pre-season camps planned.

“With our registration patterns,” Newson said, “we’re getting good numbers and very little negative feedback about plans to return – just a couple of emails from people wondering what the season’s going to look like and if it’s a good time to register, that type of thing. But I think people are sensing that there will be some hockey in some form, and that it might look different but they want to be part of it when the time comes.”

Reid said “the rumour mill kind of took over for a few weeks there, with people saying there’d be no hockey, no games, nothing,” due to the pandemic.

“Unless we hear otherwise, our game is going ahead the way it always has. If we have to modify it once we do get direction, we have a contingency plan in place.

“We spend so much time chasing our kids off the XBoxes,” Reid added, “and for a couple months there’s been nothing but that, but I get the impression that parents are itching, absolutely itching to get back to what we know and love.”

Cox, who was elected president in Cloverdale in the spring, said the issues include tournaments and how they would be played.

“I had one of my rep coaches asking about registering for a fall tournament in the States, and we agreed that that’s a bad idea,” Cox said. “It’s about finding something local, and hopefully by the spring they can go back into the U.S. for tournaments, places out of town.”

For associations across Canada starting this coming season, divisions of minor hockey will no longer be known as Peewee, Bantam, Midget and similar names. In a change announced last November, Hockey Canada has moved to U7, U9 and other alpha-numeric, age-specific division names.

“We just have to keep getting the message out with the new branding, and be consistent,” Bains said. “The kids will get used to it right away, but it might take longer for the parents.”

COVID or no COVID, Newson said all of the local associations are interested in gaining more access to city-operated rinks and using private facilities less, for financial reasons.

New to Surrey at the start of last hockey season was North Surrey Sport & Ice Complex, a three-sheet arena built near Pattullo Bridge as a replacement for the two-sheet North Surrey Recreation Centre.

“For us,” Bains said, “it was a great new building and the anticipation and excitement was there. Some found it a long ways to travel because they got used to the other rink location, but as the season progressed it was fine. The kids loved playing there.”

For those in Cloverdale, the new rink provided some relief in an area where the city cancelled plans to build a two-sheet arena.

“We found that we could do more practices closer to home, and didn’t have to buy as much ice in Langley, for example, that early-morning ice,” Cox said.

“We found this past year that they expanded their adult hockey even more (at Surrey Sport and Leisure, in Fleetwood), and I get that the city has to make their arenas profitable, but we get complaints every single week about kids having such bad ice times,” Cox continued.

“It’s hard on the kids when they’re practicing at 10:30, 10:45 at night, or 5:30 in the morning, just to get on the ice here in Surrey. We could get better times in Langley but then we’d be paying three times the rate we’d pay in Surrey. We have kids at the Bantam and Midget ages who quit because the ice times are so bad.”

In other hockey news, BC Hockey says it will be operating a zone program for the 2020-2021 season, putting to rest rumours that the program would be scrapped during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The BC Hockey Zone AAA/AA Program provides elite-level development for players aged 13 to 18. The focus of this program is to prepare them for the next level of hockey through expanded draw zones.

B.C. Rugby recently released its return to play plan, but it looks like games may not be played before September 2021. (Photo: Malin Jordan)

Rugby is coming back.

B.C. Rugby announced it’s Return to Rugby plan July 7. But one local rugger says despite the road map, it’s not going to be an easy journey for rugby in British Columbia.

“It’s nice to see a plan,” said Paul Kelly, the captain for the Surrey Beavers. “But it won’t look like the sport we know until probably the fall of 2021.”

That interim “look” is one of small practices leading up to touch rugby and possibly a flag-style type of rugby game. B.C. Rugby’s return plan (see graphic below) consists of five phases with players currently slotted into phase two—a maximum of 50 people, a maximum of 60 minutes, all while maintaining a two-metre gap between players.

“Rugby is coming back but it’s up to all of us to make sure it’s brought back in a safe and responsible manner,” Annabel Kehoe, B.C. Rugby CEO, said in a press release. “While we won’t be returning to full-contact rugby for the foreseeable future, we’re excited to support clubs delivering modified training before progressing to non-contact rugby.”

With regular rugby only returning in phase five—when a vaccine or treatment for COVID-19 is available—Kelly said it’s going to be hard for clubs to survive.

“It’s good to see some training sessions will be allowed in the fall, but it’s gonna be a challenge to keep players interested.”

Kelly said his club, like many others in the province, are facing the same two challenges: lost revenue and keeping up that player interest. He said one feeds the other.

“It’s a little discouraging overall,” he explained. “We’ve had our doors closed for the last three months and we’ve missed out on a lot of revenue.”

Revenue keeps the clubs afloat, but that only comes with a full rugby season (which, in turn, creates that much-needed player interest, which generates that much-needed revenue).

He said rugby players’ interest will be hard to maintain without games. He added people don’t play rugby to run around in light, non-contact training sessions for weeks or months on end. They play to smash each other on the pitch.

“There is zero interest right now. Until we see light at the end of the tunnel, I don’t see many players hanging around hoping that something will change.”

B.C. Rugby’s restart plan offers no hope either. In phase four—scheduled to start in January of 2021—it notes that only “small-sided” training games can be played at clubs and that only “B.C. Rugby administered inter-club games” will be allowed.

Kelly said the outlook’s even worse for B.C. rugby clubs if you factor in the loss of the high school rugby season—a pipeline for rugby clubs to gain new players.

“We get a lot of high school players,” Kelly explained. “Unless they go away for university, they usually come out and play for us. But now those players are already out of the regular loop of playing rugby. Are they going to pick it up in the fall of 2021? For some, that could be nearly two and half years since they played their last rugby game.”

Kelly noted some older players may retire rather than wait until the fall of 2021 to resume playing.

“Your body takes a beating in this game. Some older players might say, ‘I haven’t played for 18 months.’ It’s gonna be interesting, but I think a lot of clubs will suffer.”

Kelly explained the Beavers’ Cloverdale clubhouse, the Beaverlodge, has been sitting idle so he’s been trying to organize a few social-distanced events in an effort to gain some revenue and open a connective conduit between players and their club. “We’re trying to do smaller functions at the club to keep revenue coming in.”

Kelly added, “This is the biggest challenge we’ve faced since our clubs’ inception [in 1970]. Our clubhouse burned down about 10 years ago and we rebuilt. It’s going to be challenging, but we’ll rebuild from this too.”

The new commissioner of Pacific Junior Hockey League says he’s confident its teams could be playing games sooner than other local junior circuits.

White Rock-raised Trevor Alto took the reigns of the PJHL at the start of May, in the midst of a COVID-19 pandemic that put an end to sports competitions of all kinds, including the mid-March league final between North Vancouver and Aldergrove.

The 13-team league includes Surrey Knights and White Rock Whalers.

As rinks begin to reopen for skills sessions this summer, Alto said the fall months could feature PJHL league games – if and when a green light is given by health and hockey authorities in the province.

“With a long-term view, I’m very positive about us being able to operate a game in a safe manner,” Alto told the Now-Leader.

He said the PJHL is pretty well structured for a return to play.

“We don’t have to deal with things like the WHL does, of going across provincial boundaries and into the States to play,” Alto said. “Our players travel on their own, in their own vehicles, to games, so there’s no bus situation, and no hotel stays in our league either, so there’s no issue there, and no buffets, team meals, that other leagues will have to deal with, in order just to operate.

“We’re lucky enough to deal with just the arrival at the arena and how we go about conducting a game, and then how we exit the arena,” Alto added. “Possibly we’d also have to look at how fans can attend in a safe manner, so our focus is on each of the individual facilities. They’re coming back online with various speeds and various expectations. I think we have to be very flexible with how each team comes back.”

The Knights’ pre-season training camp is planned to start Aug. 24 at Langley Sportsplex, and the Whalers have word of “identification skates” posted to the club’s website, as a way of “building our future pod.”

In mid-May the PJHL announced the arrival of the Chilliwack Jets as the league’s latest expansion franchise. Majority owner Clayton Robinson will also serve as the club’s first head coach and general manager.

“We’re excited about that franchise joining the league,” Alto said. “The league was making some big moves and a time when other leagues weren’t, so that’s very much a positive for our league and what it has been able to accomplish in recent years under Ray Stonehouse’s leadership.”

Stonehouse, the outgoing league commissioner, will stay with the PJHL in a senior advisor role for the next two seasons. Earlier this year he was named an inductee to the BC Hockey Hall of Fame, Class of 2020, as a builder.

During Alto’s first couple of months on the job, his work has involved a good number of conference calls as opposed to in-person meetings.

“This has all been a shock to the system for everyone,” he said. “It’s been really good to see the hockey community come together at all levels. Being involved in junior hockey for awhile, we kind of live in our own bubble sometimes, but it’s been great to collaborate with some of the minor hockey associations. I’ve been on quite a few calls, including with Pacific Coast Amateur Hockey Association.

“As hockey administrators it’s our duty to get these kids back on the ice as soon as possible,” Alto added. “What that’s going to look like, we’re still working on that. There are lots of ideas. At the end of the day we’re all just following orders of the health authorities and Dr. Bonnie Henry, and also Hockey Canada. And the end of the day it’s a huge collaborative effort.”

The 2019-20 season was another difficult one for Surrey Knights, who finished with a single win in 44 games, well behind other teams in the PJHL standings.

Alto says he’s confident the team can rebound with the guidance of Gerry Leiper, head coach and general manager.

“He has done an excellent job,” Alto said. “Gerry’s passion for building that program is second to none, in my opinion, and it’s been a breath of fresh air in a time that’s been difficult. So I think the Knights have a coach and GM there who is doing a great job and I look forward to where he can take the team.”

(Photo: Tom Zillich)

A new walking track at Bear Creek Park is designed to separate those who like to walk from athletes in training.

The main track at the Surrey park is now reserved for track athletes from Monday to Friday, 5 to 8 p.m.

“It’s a safety issue,” said Jessie Dosanjh, a track coach with Universal Athletics.

“It’s a really good thing that the walkers can use the new track. It’s important to separate the walkers from the track athletes, for safety concerns. There used to be a big argument about it, but now the (walking) track is there for them. I have not heard anybody have a concern about it, but maybe a few are going to be upset. And with social distance, it’s good too, to have people separated a little bit more.”

The new walking track “provides a casual drop-in amenity that is essential during busy periods at Bear Creek Park to ensure a safe training facility at the existing athletics track to support the competitive development of world-class athletes,” according to Neal Aven, Surrey’s manager of parks.

The four-lane walking track, located around the perimeter of the upper grass soccer field parallel with 88th Avenue, is 400 metres long and five metres wide.

“It’s wonderful,” said walker Camilla Greene on a recent Tuesday afternoon. “The rubberized surface makes it bouncy, so it’s great for walking. It’s not too busy, either – just a few people out here right now.”

Construction was completed in the spring, although the rectangular track has been open to the public since last fall. Installation of pedestrian lighting is planned this fall, Aven said. The total project budget is around $500,000.

Dosanjh said he has witnessed many accidents and injuries on the main track in recent years, including the time when star athlete Katarina Vlahovic was hurt in a run-in with a walker.

“She just took off from the blocks and someone came in front, and to avoid that she hit the hurdles and broke three of her teeth,” Dosanjh said last fall. “I had a couple athletes get injured, and the people, it’s not their fault. They want to walk, and they can use the track if nobody is there, but at least they can respect the place for what it’s built for. It’s not for a stroller or dress shoes, not a bike on it. If they really want to walk or roll around, they need a safe place, and the other (track) will be for that.”

The walking track is part of Phase 1 of the Bear Creek Park Athletics Centre project identified in the city’s 2020 five-year Capital Financial Plan, Aven noted.

The “destination sports facility” would be home to a 2,200-seat covered grandstand and artificial turf field by 2023. The complex is designed to host national track and field meets, games of football, soccer and other sports, and also community events such as fundraising walks/runs and possibly concerts. The plan calls for a “creative” increase in the number of parking stalls in the park.

With a price tag of around $21 million, the project would include upgrading the track and sports field to “international standards” with a rubberized surface, and replacing the 500-seat wooden bleachers with a modern grandstand that would feature both individual plastic seats and “relaxed” seating, a concession, change rooms and a sheltered “warmup track” that would double as training space during the winter months.

Details of the project were revealed to the public last October during an open house held at the adjacent Surrey Arts Centre.

For now, Dosanjh said the Universal club’s athletes are keen to be back on the track, after months of down time during the COVID-19 pandemic.

“We got our permit and it was beautiful to see our athletes back at the track,” he said in late June.

“We don’t have any competitions for the athletes yet, but it’s important for them to keep fit,” he said. “This is a tough time for them. They are excited to come (to the track) but they don’t see anything to acheive this year. Not yet. The rule is, no more than 10 (athletes) in a group, to make things safe, and not more than 50 athletes in total on the field at one time.”

With a regional return-to-play plan now approval, the White Rock-South Surrey Titans minor football association has turned its attention to the next step – getting players signed up to play.

The organization – which includes players from five to 18 years old – has opened registration for the coming season, and practices will begin next week.

Teams in all divisions – from flag to midget – are expected to be set by Aug. 1, with games beginning on Labour Day weekend. Flag division is for players aged five to seven years old; atom flag is for eight and nine year olds; peewee is 10-11 year-olds; junior bantam is for those 12 and 13 years old; bantam is for 14-15 year olds and midget is for players 16-18.

Currently, special ‘early bird’ fees are in place until July 15, association registrar Tina Giustino added.

When football does resume later this summer, it will look quite different than in past seasons. For starters, at all levels of the Vancouver Mainland Football League, games will features nine players per side, as opposed to the traditional 12, and coaching staffs will also be limited on the sidelines.

With smaller rosters, available spots are expected to fill quickly, Giustino noted.

Even pre-pandemic, nine-per-side football has been popular in the VMFL, with White Rock being “famous for its nine-on-nine football” success, VMFL president Kevin Parks noted to Peace Arch News last month.

• READ ALSO: Navigating safety issues ‘especially challenging’ for contact-sports organizations

Other COVID-19 safety protocols include new face shields for players, frequent cleaning and sterilization of in-game footballs, and the requirement for players to wear gloves and long sleeves, among other new regulations.

The VMFL’s in-depth return-to-play guidelines were first designed by Parks, and then adjusted in consultation with other minor-football executive members before ultimately being approved by B.C. regulatory body ViaSport, Football Canada and the various health authorities involved.

The full return-to-play report can be viewed on the Titans’ official website, www.letsgotitans.com. Player registration can also be done on the same site.

CORRECTION (Thursday, July 9, 12:41 p.m.)

The editorial below was published in today’s issue of the Now-Leader (Thursday, July 9, 2020). In fact, councillors are ineligible to be on the board, according to the BC Police Act.

Legislation exists regarding appointments to police boards and is entirely under the purview of the provincial government. The BC Police Act prescribes police board appointments which includes the mayor as chair (ex officio or non-voting), up to seven provincial appointees and one municipal appointee. All seven board members were appointed on June 29 by a provincial Order in Council.

Additionally, according to Section 24 (1) of the Act:

A person who is a councillor or is ineligible to be elected as a councillor must not be appointed to a municipal police board.

This structure is designed to ensure independence of the police board and insulation of the Service (SPS) from local politics.

The Now-Leader apologizes for any confusion our editorial may have caused.

– – –

Who will be the lone Surrey councillor to join Mayor Doug McCallum on the city’s new police board?

Will it be the naturopath, the environmental protection officer, the realtor/yoga instructor, or the meat shop owner?

Or will it be the former Block Watch captain, the former MLA, the long-time executive director of Crime Stoppers, or the retired veteran police officer?

Last week, the Ministry of Public Safety and Solicitor General revealed who will be the seven community members on Surrey’s new police board, with McCallum to serve as its chairman. That leaves the appointment of a councillor to complete the circle.

By any objective standard, it should be a shortlist of two: Either the councillor with 25 years’ experience as a police officer, or the councillor who has served as executive director of Crime Stoppers since 2004. Both candidates are steeped in policing and crime-related issues and their presence at that table would undoubtedly be a boon to Surrey residents, especially given that this is a fledgling board that will oversee a fledgling city police force.

READ ALSO: ‘Historic moment’ as seven community members are named to Surrey’s new police board

The hitch is, both of these obviously superior candidates are rivals to McCallum and his Safe Surrey Coalition – whose members the mayor exclusively appointed in 2019 to the interim Police Transitory Advisory Committee.

The mark of a statesman, and not just a mere politician, is to know when to set aside political advantage to do what’s best for the citizenry.

We hope that’s what happens here, with this council member appointment to Surrey’s new police board.

The city’s residents deserve nothing less.

Stephany Garber Black writes the timing of the increase “couldn’t be better.” (Black Press File Photo)

By Stephany Garber Black

Special to the Cloverdale Reporter

I disagree with Jock Finlayson’s conclusions that when it comes to increasing the minimum wage, the timing couldn’t be worse.

The timing couldn’t be better. I say this because raising the minimum wage will protect human life and reduce poverty.

(Finlayson’s piece “Minister should look at financial carnage amid min. wage increase” ran in the June 4 issue of the Cloverdale Reporter.)

The minimum wage increased 75 cents to $14.60 per hour on June 1, an extra $6 for eight hours of work. These minimum wage employees are often working in restaurants and customer service where their interactions with the public make them more vulnerable to being exposed to COVID-19 than those in different industries. We need to trust these people to stay home when they feel ill to protect the rest of us.

Fighting poverty is part of protecting us collectively because minimum wage workers should not be forced to choose between working sick or being able to pay rent and eat. The increased minimum wage will help those workers protect themselves and others in the coming months.

The minimum wage historically has always been about protecting the vulnerable. According to our federal labour standards, the government has put minimum wage in place to protect non-unionized workers, reduce the number of low-paying jobs, alleviate poverty, create incentives to work and address inequality.

It is apparent the business community has organized and has advocates like Finlayson to protect their interests. Still, labour is discouraged from organizing to defend their wages because businesses can take away those coveted jobs.

SEE ALSO: COLUMN: B.C.’s labour minister should look at COVID-19 financial carnage amid minimum wage increase

Instead of mentioning that the minimum wage is in place to protect the vulnerable and reduce poverty, we have Finlayson reducing labour to a business expense. Talking about labour as a cost of production is problematic, because if working people are reduced to a business expense, what is a human life worth? I would argue that human life is precious and can’t just be looked at only in economic terms. This principle that human life is more than just a production expense is why we have a minimum wage in the first place.

Raising the minimum wage is not as bad as Finlayson makes it seem. Studies have shown that while raising the minimum wage may slightly increase unemployment; it also increases job stability. That means that it may be harder to find a job at first, but it is more likely to be a job you keep after you do. It also has a ripple effect of increasing other people’s wages, especially those close to minimum wage. If there is a time when we should protect the poorest and create more stable jobs, shouldn’t it be during a global health crisis?

Finlayson makes mention of the “calamity” and “carnage” the COVID-19 crisis has caused businesses. Perhaps we should remind ourselves why businesses closed in the first place—to protect human lives while we prepared and restructured our society during the pandemic. We chose to put the collective good before our individual needs as we listened to experts, voluntarily closed businesses, stayed home, and practiced social distancing.

As we look at the struggles of businesses, we must not forget the minimum wage workers and the working poor. The poor and the vulnerable need our help during a global pandemic when unemployment rates are rising and they have an increased chance of exposure to COVID-19.

Therefore, in the fight to protect human lives and decrease poverty, I politely disagree with Finlayson by saying that increasing the minimum wage could not have come at a better time.

(File photo)

Marine Drive businesses eager for a re-opening of White Rock’s waterfront parkade will have a while longer to wait.

A final decision on re-opening the more than 180 parking spaces in the facility will have to wait until city council’s next regular meeting on July 27.

But communications and government relations manager Donna Kell confirmed to Peace Arch News that the new COVID-19 Recovery Task Force – to which council had referred the matter for input at its July 13 meeting – recommended Tuesday that “staff look at ways to reopen the West Beach Parkade in a safe and reasonable manner, as quickly as possible.”

City staff – including engineer and operations manager Jim Gordon – have already told council it would only take two or three days for them to develop a plan for re-opening the parkade that would take into account such pandemic-related issues as social distancing, posting warning signs and ensuring adequate disenfection of the parkade’s elevator.

A final council decision to re-open the parkade can’t come too soon, said South Surrey White Rock Chamber of Commerce executive director Ritu Khanna, who added she is hearing from many businesses on the strip that customers are frustrated by the lack of parking spaces.

“Every day counts right now; every weekend counts for the businesses down there,” she said, noting that the city is inevitably a destination for visitors from all over the Lower Mainland.

“We have been asking the city for three weeks to open the parkade – we don’t want people to have challenges of parking when they come to White Rock – that’s the reason for having the parkade in the first place. Businesses can do the social distancing, but this is going to deter people from coming back.”

READ MORE: White Rock’s West Beach Parkade now open

Khanna pointed out that, in addition to restaurants, the Marine Drive strip is also home to retail and service businesses.

“I respect the city is being prudent and taking measures because of the perceived risks of COVID-19 – but, at the same time this is taking away business and revenue opportunities on the waterfront.”

And that revenue, she suggested, could offset increased operating costs due to measures such as extra sanitation of the facility.

“The city could mitigate (the risks of opening the parkade) by increased signage; maybe open every other stall – but at least get it open,” Khanna said.

“For every single business right now it’s been a tough ride. I feel very strongly that it needs to open sooner than later. It’s very unfortunate that it it has taken so long.”

Khanna’s comments were echoed by White Rock BIA executive director Alex Nixon.

“We’re hearing from a lot of businesses on the waterfront that their customers are having a challenging time finding parking,” he said.

“In general, that’s been a problem, but it’s particularly a problem now, when restaurants are encouraging customers to make reservations because of the reduced capacity, only to find customers arriving late for their reservations because they have had problems finding parking.”

Nixon said he certainly appreciates the concerns of council in mulling the re-opening of the parkade, adding that the challenge is how to balance a desire to restart the economy with the need to ensure public safety .

“No-one wants to see COVID get a foothold in our community,” he said.

But he noted that business owners share the same concerns as council members, because the health of the community is essential to their livelihood.

“They really do understand it, because they are having to take so many precautions themselves. They want their staff and their customers to be as safe as possible.”

At the July 13 council meeting, Coun. David Chesney, had urged caution in moving to re-open the parkade.

“Two hundred (parking) spots probably mean on average – at three or four people (per vehicle) – 600 (to) 700 (to) 800 more people on our waterfront,’ he said, noting the spate of visitors during recent sunny days.

“I don’t think that we want to put any more people into that mix, to be very honest,” he added.

“The restaurants can’t get any busier – they’re chock-a-block full as it is, with the weather… the sidewalks currently are very difficult to pass. I’m happy to say the promenade and the pier, to this point, have had fairly good social distancing. But adding a further 600 to 800 people to the mix would be the wrong way to go.”

Close to 100 people rallied to keep the RCMP in Surrey on Monday (July 13).

The event was staged outside city hall as Surrey council met remotely, in another virtual meeting.

“Great evening at Surrey City Hall protesting the Mayor’s vanity SPD (Surrey Police Department),” Ramona Kaptyn posted to Facebook.

“Many many Surreyites turned out supporting #keepthercmpinsurreybc,” wrote Kaptyn, president of the Surrey/White Rock chapter of CARP (Canadian Association of Retired Persons).

“Our ‘honking’ cars circled City Hall, people waved at us from the street and from their vehicles. One supporter was on a recumbent bike and several RCMP vehicles in the area sounded their sirens and gave us a thumbs-up.”

Photos of the rally were posted to social media.

(Story continues below)

On June 29, the provincial Ministry of Public Safety and Solicitor General announced the members of Surrey’s new police board, as part of the city’s transition from the RCMP to a municipal police department.

The board will be responsible for “setting the direction and strategic priorities” of the Surrey Police Department, to replace the Surrey RCMP.

A next step in the City of Surrey’s transition plan will be for the new board to hire a chief constable.

In 2018, Surrey city council voted unanimously to terminate their agreement with the RCMP and transition to a municipal police department.

Last month, long-time Langley resident Pastor Brad Sumner was taking in a show with his teenagers at the Twilight Drive-In theatre in Aldergrove when the thought struck him: “why couldn’t a church do this?”

So under his toutage, the team at Jericho Ridge Community Church got to work, bringing the drive-in church concept to life this past Sunday, July 5 at a church on the Langley-Surrey border.

Part of the challenge of COVID-19 is social isolation, so the idea was born to have a drive-in church gathering where people could come and be together in the safety and privacy of their own vehicles while also experiencing a sense of community and connection with other people, Sumner explained.

RELATED: B.C. church services resume with public health limits

“The event connected well with the senior adults in our community,” added the lead pastor at Jericho Ridge.

“Many of them have been looking for a sense of meaningful connection with others, but have been unsure as to how to do this safely and wisely,” Sumner said.

Through the use of an app that is normally used for assisted listening devices, those who attended were able to hear the live music, as well as a message on managing complex emotions – all the while abiding by local health authority orders such as social distancing, number of cars at an event (50 or less), and not creating unnecessary noise for neighbours.

The drive-in church was such a “success,” Sumner said, that it will be repeated on the long weekend in August in the church parking lot at 19533 64th Ave., from 10:30 to 11:30 a.m.

“We look forward to welcoming more guests to our parking lot safely on Aug. 2 with the assistance of some very new technology that mirrors a very old concept,” he explained. “Young and old are welcome to join us!”

In today’s issue of the Now-Leader (Thursday, July 9, 2020), we published an editorial that argued for the inclusion of certain councillors on the Surrey Police Board. In fact, councillors are ineligible to be on the board, according to the BC Police Act.

Legislation exists regarding appointments to police boards and is entirely under the purview of the provincial government. The BC Police Act prescribes police board appointments which includes the mayor as chair (ex officio or non-voting), up to seven provincial appointees and one municipal appointee. All seven board members were appointed on June 29 by a provincial Order in Council.

Additionally, according to Section 24 (1) of the Act:

A person who is a councillor or is ineligible to be elected as a councillor must not be appointed to a municipal police board.

This structure is designed to ensure independence of the police board and insulation of the Service (SPS) from local politics.

The Now-Leader apologizes for any confusion our editorial may have caused.
