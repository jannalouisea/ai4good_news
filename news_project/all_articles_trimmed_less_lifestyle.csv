0,"This story is part of a week-long series on dieting in 2020. Next up: Dieting and social media.

With a new year comes new trends. But when it comes to diet culture, a quick scan of the glossy magazines at grocery store checkouts shows how much we prize the dramatic weight loss story.

But just what effect does all this diet talk have on children?

Sarah Landry — known as @thebirdspapaya to her over 814K Instagram followers — has been vocal in her efforts to change how we talk about and display the diversity of the human body.

Landry, who lives outside of Toronto, went through a transformation several years ago, losing roughly 110 pounds in the span of a few years, ultimately dropping to an unhealthy weight for her — 114 pounds — and a size zero.

It wasn’t until she reached her “goal weight,” that she realized she wasn’t happy, nor was she healthy.

People were still congratulating her, even after she lost even more weight because of stress and life circumstances.

“I began to realize how many red flags there were toward diet culture and disordered eating,” says Landry. “It was unhealthy ... It was almost impossible to maintain (my weight) with how little I could eat and how much I had to exercise to stay that weight.”

She was obsessively calorie counting, weighing herself multiple times a day, and exercising out of guilt and fear around food and weight gain.

The mother of three wanted to set a better example for her children, especially her two daughters, Jemma, 11 and Maya, 13.

“It bothered me when my daughter, Jemma, was speaking about me and said to me something like ‘People love you for your weight loss,” said Landry.

And yet, her transformation story and her powerful posts on Instagram about accepting her body, landed her dedicated followers, magazine covers and media attention.

As she struggled with where the weight loss ended and she began, she worried what affect this behaviour was having on her kids.

“I can’t control TV and how inclusive it is but I can control the words that come out of my mouth and the conversations we have at home, and it starts with how I talk about myself and what I’m proud of,” Landry said.

After Jemma commented about the praise her mom receives, Landry made immediate changes, starting in their home. “There’s no diet culture talk allowed at home. We’ve gotten rid of scales in the house. I don’t want there to be this defining moment for them that they have a number. I want to continue to have a redirection of conversation and a change in the ways we talk about our bodies and ourselves,” said Landry.

Kyla Fox, clinical therapist and an eating disorder specialist, tells the Star that kids are sponges to their surroundings and are acutely attuned to their caregivers and their environment.

“The ways you feel about food and your body will be a mirror for your children. More of the work is on caregivers to heal themselves and their ideologies around food and their body in order to influence a positive relationship for their children,” says Fox. “If you don’t believe in the messages you’re hoping to instill like, ‘everything in moderation,’ ‘beauty from the inside out,’ ‘love the skin you’re in,’ neither will your kids.

Fox who has two young daughters, struggled with an eating disorder when she was younger and noticed care gaps and fundamental flaws in the treatment and recovery approach, which is why she developed The Kyla Fox Centre, a clinical and holistic eating disorder centre in Toronto.

The language we use within the house around food affects kids from a young age so it’s important to be mindful about talking about healthy dietary habits, she said.

But how can parents change the conversation to have a positive effect on their kids?

“To feel healthy is to learn how to live healthier. Perhaps the conversation is more about that. Mom wants to live her best life, feel stronger, happier, safer, share feelings more easily, take up more space in the world, go after what matters, listen in to her body more, understand what makes her feel full,” said Fox. “If we lived in a world where there was more open and honest communication about how to really feel healthy, we would be tapping in way deeper to ourselves and to each other.”

While parents can monitor language at home, they can’t control external forces that play on a child’s insecurities. This includes comments by other children or things they see on social media. Fox says a parent should be attentive to a child’s behaviour and address issues as soon as they are noticed. Is your tween reading calories on labels and selecting the item with a few less? If so, this is an opportunity to educate, have a deeper conversation to discover the root of why they’re behaving this way.

“The relationship your child develops with their body is an articulation of the way your child feels about themselves. And so being emotionally filled up — emotionally communicative, emotionally able to process, emotionally validated, emotionally supported — means that a child will be less likely to take out their feelings on their body through food. People who love themselves don’t hurt themselves,” said Fox.

“The only way to actively support others is to not hide behind your concerns, but address them. ‘Hey, I noticed you’re doing these things now that you didn’t do before, are you OK? Why do you think you have started this? Know that I’m here for you and want to be able to talk honestly.’ Opening up space for a bigger, safer conversation is key to bringing someone’s suffering/rituals/preoccupations forward,” said Fox.

Jemma now has an Instagram account of her own, bearing witness to her mom’s positive messaging, affirmations and body empowerment.

“As parents we can get so caught up being distracted by our bodies that we forget how many amazing things are going on around us,” Landry said.

Instead of asking your partner or friends whether an outfit makes you look fat, or asking how many calories are in something, or constantly complaining about having to lose 10 more pounds — all which create a negative dialogue for children — share what you love about yourself, she said.

Landry suggests “being mindful about how we speak about ourselves, and reminding each other to not comment on others bodies, when it comes up.”

Most importantly, don’t speak poorly about yourself, she said.

It’s not easy to learn to do but “When you take that out of the picture, you can connect more fully. More completely,” said Landry.

“I’m proud I got to change my own tune and have (my kids) be witness to it,” she said.",She lost 100 pounds and became an Instagram sensation. Then she realized how diet culture was affecting her kids,8,0.13436424411240122
3,"Two years ago, clothing designer Kate Theriault was at home healing from an injury and needed something to occupy her hands and mind, so she turned to sashiko – the centuries old Japanese art of mending.

“In that moment, when I knew I needed to mend myself, I was looking around for something to do, and sashiko came back to me,” says Theriault who had taken a sashiko workshop a couple of years before. “I was mending myself, my garments and I started to think, what else could I mend in my life?” says Theriault, a life-long sewer who teaches mindful mending and sashiko workshops in Guelph, Ontario, and sells sashiko supplies at her online shop Cedars + Sage.

Even if you’ve never heard of sashiko, which translates as “little stabs,” you may be familiar with the look which includes bold geometric patterns hand-stitched with white thread onto indigo dyed fabric. It’s a type of mending that is meant to be seen.

The technique originated in rural, northern Japan about 400 years ago to mend and patch clothes, extending the life and increasing the warmth of worn garments with added layers of cloth.

Today, visible mending is also an antidote to fast fashion – enabling crafters to mend rips, tears and general wear of clothing and other textiles, and it’s having a revival.

“We are becoming more conscious of our impact on the earth. This is a way to lesson our impact, to not throw away things, to keep them and avoid buying more,” says Theriault. “I also feel that anything that is working with our hands is having a bit of a revival right now.”

Toronto maker Stacey Sproule has seen a surge of interest in the craft since she started teaching visible mending classes in 2015. Classes would get cancelled, rarely selling out, but in the last year or so, she says every class has sold out.

“My workshops are aimed at getting you ready to feel empowered to start fixing your clothes. But I think that to say that you have to do this because it’s pragmatic is not enough, it’s visually satisfying too – it’s good for the planet and also beautiful – it’s a win-win,” says Sproule.

The craft appeals to everyone from sewers to people who haven’t worked with a needle and thread at all and makers such as Sproule say that the craft appeals to all ages – from younger people in their mid-twenties to the elderly.

Locally, the craft is taking off with shops such as The Make Den on Sterling Rd. and The Workroom on Queen St. offering workshops and classes.

Mending forces us to slow down.

Judith Martin is a Canadian textile artist from Manitoulin Island who uses naturally dyed thread and cloth to create hand stitched quilts. “Stitching the quilts makes me feel good,” says Martin. “I do this repetitive motion with my hands and run my hands over this beautiful texture that I’ve made, I feel better, I slow down and I think about things that come into my head and solve problems.”

Craft enthusiast Julie Cathro-Silver, took a sashiko workshop after noticing it had become trendy. She’s still working on mending the jeans she started and during this period of social distancing has started working on them again. “I’ve always found creativity to be therapeutic, with Sashiko mending, it’s the same thing — sitting with a project, even when my skills aren’t great, feels good, peaceful, and calming … the tactile nature of sewing is something that is very therapeutic to me, especially when the world is in full blown chaos.”

Although there are rules around sashiko, such as: the size of stitch (¼ inch, which works out to be the same size as a short grain of rice), the size of the spaces in between, stitches must be done in an order — all the horizontal lines and then all the vertical lines no matter how intricate your pattern. There is a lot of mindful thought in how you prepare to stitch but “the stitch itself – a running stitch, is the most basic stitch you can do,” says Sproule. “I’ve never had anyone throw up their arms and say I can’t do this.”

Basically, all you need is a needle and thread to get started. The idea is that you’re gathering several stitches of material onto a needle and then pulling it through, rather than going up and down, so a long needle is helpful. “But you can still do it with any needle,” says Sproule. “It’s just going to feel a little bit different.” If you can’t get hold of sashiko needles, long darner needles also work, and although 100 per cent cotton Japanese floss works best, in a pinch, you could use embroidery floss. When tackling a mending project, she recommends starting with woven materials such as cotton, linen or denim.

“I like to talk about it as feeling empowered to repair the things that you love. Nothing is hopeless. It’s a meditation on hope in some ways,” says Sproule.

5,"What next?

This is a question I’m being asked a lot these days. What they mean is, What will life be like once we make it through this COVID-haunted, socially isolated, anxious period? Will it be the same as before? Answer: No.

Different, then. But different how? Better or worse? And better or worse for whom? Will it be the best of times or the worst of times, or both? Will it be the French Revolution? Will the United States crash and burn or rise from the flames renewed, like the mythical Phoenix? Speaking of flames, will the baking still be a thing?

I’m not making fun of the baking. I have baked. I have also made yoghurt. And kefir as well! Someone said to me, speaking of daily life, “This is like being in some weird sci-fi dystopia.” To which I replied: “No, this is like being in 1952, except with birth control and the internet.” And yoghurt, and kefir: they didn’t exist then, at least not in my high school. If you don’t believe me, check out “Archie” Comics.

In this moment, pleasure in small things. Who knew that washing the floor could be done not hastily and resentfully but mindfully and pleasurably? The first, second, and third times, that is. The fourth time, maybe not so much.

So the answer to the baking question is: in my world, yes, the baking will still be a thing. For others, maybe not so much.

First, the really good news: We will make it through this. There will be an Other Side. Already one of the must-haves for getting from now to then is in preparation: a spit-on-the-stick-and-it-turns-colour self-administered, cheap, and widely available instant test. With this magic wand in hand, we can test ourselves before we go anywhere or see anyone; that way, we’ll know if we don’t have It, and if our stick turns the wrong colour we can take immediate action. The effectiveness of this sort of testing will rely a lot on people’s willingness to do it, but consider the alternatives. We’ll be strongly motivated, because nobody wants to go back and relive COVID-19, Take One.

The other must-have — a reliable, safe vaccine — is kind of within sight, we’re told. The folly of opening everything up — especially indoor spaces — while there are still superspreaders among us, unknown even to themselves, has already been made apparent in the states south of us that chose to ignore the best medical advice. Through their non-actions, the agony and the joblessness and the small business failures will be prolonged, unfortunately.

The necessity of taking precautions is now impossible to ignore. Even the Lone Danger, sensing his growing isolation on the face mask issue even among Republicans, has finally given up on the idea that wearing a sissy face diaper will cause your male organs of generation to drop off, though his light bulb moment appears to be connected to his own perception of how good he looks in one. “Like the Lone Ranger,” he quipped.

But where is the faithful Indigenous partner, Tonto, in the President’s Lone Ranger simile? Maybe he’s been fired, like just about everyone; or maybe he quit, realizing that you can’t be the faithful partner of someone who doesn’t understand faithfulness. Three other choices for Tonto: 1) Murdered by a policeman 2) Protesting land seizure on and around Mount Rushmore 3) Relocating statues that show grateful Native North Americans looking up to male politicians on horseback while thinking: Give back my horse!

But I digress, as usual. Back to the Other Side. On the Other Side, there will be fewer statues of that kind. This is guaranteed.

Also guaranteed: We will continue to wash our hands, at least for a while. Hand sanitizers will remain a purse accessory, and someone will successfully market a line of cute carrier sacs for them in the shapes of gnomes. We will close the toilet when flushing, having been vividly informed of the plume of invisible virus-filled vapour that ascends. Someone will successfully market signs you can stick on your toilet seat that say CLOSE THE TOILET WHEN YOU FLUSH, OR YOUR LUNGS WILL TURN TO MUSH. Air kisses and self-hugs will be the polite way of greeting, at least as long as we are still viewing beloved Uncle Bobbert and Aunt Mathilda as potential Sackfulls O’Pestilence. Someone will successfully market a collection of embroidered heart-shaped pins that say I LOVE YOU BUT I DON’T LOVE YOUR VIRUSES. Or, less insultingly: A MILLION DISTANCE KISSES!

All of the above will come to pass as sure as eggs is eggs. But nothing else is guaranteed. We find ourselves in the Land of Choose Your Own Adventure: a lot of roads are diverging in the yellow wood, and where we’ll end up will depend not only on which road we take now, but also on factors beyond our control.

So instead of predictions, here are some hopes.

I hope that political economists will recalibrate their way of measuring national well-being. It’s not just the GNP, it’s overall satisfaction with the shape of life. Many have enjoyed the slower pace during this period. Why were we rushing around like maniacs? Can we spend our time on earth more satisfyingly and thus more productively? I hope so.

In that connection, working at home — at least some of the time — will continue. And I expect that technologies to facilitate long-distance but effective transactions and communications will therefore be improved and more widely deployed.

In Canada we already have public health care, for which we should be grateful. But other factors contributing to illness will now be considered — such as poverty — and I hope this will mean more widespread distribution of wealth, and a coming to grips with inequalities built on discrimination and racialization. Too much accumulation at the top of any economy means stagnation: it’s Smaug the Dragon sleeping on a heap of inert gold. For money to do anything in the world it has to circulate, and not just from one rich person to another.

I hope that our desire to green the planet will become stronger post-COVID. Many have turned to Nature during this period, realizing for the first time that it is part of them. Every breath you take contains oxygen made primarily by marine algaes. Kill the oceans and we’re dead. My hope is that most people and countries will finally realize that, and take the necessary steps.

So, let’s hope there will many new kinds of jobs. Plastics will have to be rethought so they are less destructive, and cleaning up the plastic mess that’s already out there will take years. Lots of jobs there! New uses for unexpected materials are already coming online — heard about the mushroom coffins? I hope that energy conservation will become a widespread goal, and less polluting energy sources such as hydrogen will be deeply explored.

However, my main hope is that we’ll be able to learn from past mistakes. Will we correct our pre-COVID course and head for a better, kindlier future? Or will we practice a politics of division and fear, squabble greedily, ignore all warning signs, and then die out as a species?

Hint: If you get it right, you’ll still be able to do the baking, too.

Yet the 20-acre parcel of timber symbolizes the achievement and ongoing battle by a tiny coastal community to protect as much mature forest as they can on their remote B.C. island.

“We just couldn’t bear to see yet another clearcut,” said Read Island resident Lannie Keller of the Surge Narrows community, which managed to raise $150,000 inside of four months to protect 20 acres of forest earlier this year.

And the community is working to buy another parcel with an important riparian zone to complement their recent acquisition and further protect Read Island’s ecologically sensitive areas. This time, it’s a spot where the forest intersects with streams and swampy areas critical to salmon and amphibian habitat.

“There is a remaining 128 acres of wetland and mature trees in the middle of the island, which would extend our protected area in a lovely and significant way,” said Lannie, who along with husband Ralph, sparked the community’s most recent efforts to conserve their forests.

Approximately 80 residents live full time on Read Island — one of several “outer islands” wedged between Vancouver Island and the B.C. coast in the northern reaches of the Straight of Georgia — which is only accessible by boat or float plane.

And the community of Surge Narrows — which boasts not much more than a public dock, a small post office, a small school, a community hall, and an abandoned, ramshackle clapboard store — is tucked into Read Island’s northwest flank.

Despite its small size, Surge Narrows acts as a community hub for Read Island, as well as for residents of surrounding Maurelle, North and South Rendezvous, and Sonora islands.

So when nearby Lot 302 went up for sale last summer, and the Kellers heard the mixed mature forest was drawing the interest of a logging company, the couple knew they had to act fast.

“It was a beautiful piece of treed land along the main road where people travel to get mail, to the school or the dock,” Lannie said.

The parcel was also adjacent to the island’s John Kim Ecological Sanctuary and would create a green corridor from the Surge Narrows dock to the boundary of the island’s existing Fish and Forest Reserve at the headwaters of two important salmon streams, Ralph added.

“We thought, ‘Oh man, we better do something right now,’ so we went back and wrote them a cheque,” Lannie said.

Lot 302’s owners, long-term residents, were willing to sell the land to the community at a reduced price.

So the Kellers, through their local kayaking business, Coast Mountain Expeditions, offered a $50,000 down payment and guaranteed the entire $150,000 purchase price if the community decided not to come on board.

But the community was all in.

The Kellers presented the idea to the Surge Narrows Community Association (SNCA), representing about 130 permanent residents on the surrounding isles.

“The response was super enthusiastic,” said Lannie, who wasn’t surprised by the tight-knit community’s response, but rather by the speed at which the remaining funds were raised.

“We were astounded. It just happened so fast,” Lannie said, adding the community, which doesn’t have deep pockets, gave generously.

“Sometimes it was to the point where we said, ‘You can’t do that. You don’t have that much to give,’” said Lannie, noting one resident was donating half her limited pension to the project.

But what really shocked the community was the response from the outside world, the Kellers said.

“The funding came from near and far,” said Lannie, adding people donated from across Canada and even internationally.

“Some had distant links to Read Island, but some had absolutely no connection at all but said (forest conservation) resonated with them.”

Protecting remaining intact forests strikes a deep chord with people around the globe, Ralph said.

“Most people today love living forests. The wilderness and the feeling they exude,” he said.

“As soon as you clear-cut it, lay it all to waste and destroy the wildlife habitat, nesting sites and the wetlands, it threatens us personally. Whether it’s British Columbia or Brazil, a clearcut has become the international symbol of the destruction of the environment.”

Read Island, like most of British Columbia, has a long, history with clearcut logging, Ralph added, noting the practice is ongoing on the island’s woodlots.

In the mid-1980s, just a couple of years after the couple arrived on the island, 1,200 acres of mature low-elevation rainforest was razed to the ground, he said.

“To be able look across the island for several kilometres and not see a single tree was pretty impactful for all of us,” Ralph said.

It led to the community working together for the first time in 1992 to purchase a lot from Raven Forest Products to create the island’s first reserve to try to protect the salmon streams.

But in that instance, the effort took three years to raise $78,000 for the 20-acre lot, Lannie said, adding people had relatives’ kids knocking on doors in Vancouver for spare change.

“We were exhausted afterwards,” she said.

But this last time around, an international conservation organization arrived on Read in February to explore whether it would back the purchase of Lot 302, only to find the fundraising was already done, Lannie said.

Now, the Germany-based Wilderness International is partnering with the Surge Narrows community to provide the bulk of the funds to try to purchase the wetland Lot 309, Ralph said.

Wilderness International has promised $150,000 to help the SNCA purchase the lot, said David MacDonald, Canadian director with the organization.

“We’re waiting on the decision of the landowner, after which we’ll draw up a co-operative agreement,” he said.

Wilderness International purchases private lands with intact rainforest to protect biodiversity and capture carbon dioxide to prevent climate change, he said.

German society is passionate about protecting the world’s forests because they have so little of their own wilderness left, MacDonald added.

Aside from occasional visits from biologists or student groups to study the ecosystems at their sites, not much else will happen other than the foundation paying taxes in perpetuity, he said.

“Essentially, the concept is: We buy the forests and leave them alone.”

The Kellers said the Surge Narrows community is also waiting to hear from the landowner to move forward.

“We’re all waiting with bated breath,” Lannie said.

With the experience gained through their kayaking company, they know the wilderness on and around Read Island is precious, the Kellers said.

“This environment is so incredible, and we’ve had thousands of people visit from all over the world over the years. And they’ve said they’ve never been anywhere so beautiful,” Lannie said.

“It’s special, and it deserves protection.”

9,"WATERLOO REGION — Ellen Papenburg is hopeful for clear weather this week so she can catch more sightings of Comet NEOWISE. The latest comet to blaze across the night sky will be visible just after 10 p.m. each night for the next little while.  “I could see this one in the city, which makes it special,” said Ellen Papenburg, a local amateur astronomer and member of the Kitchener-Waterloo Astronomy Club.  NEOWISE isn’t as bright as some of the comets Papenburg has seen in 50 years of skygazing, but it is still a pleasant surprise after two promising comets, Atlas and Swan, disintegrated before they got close enough to the earth to see. “Comets are quite fickle,” Papenburg said. “I compare comets with cats. They do what they want and they have tails.” That is why it is such a delight to be able to spot one so easily. Papenburg was able to see NEOWISE from her downtown Kitchener home with a pair of binoculars, and then again with a friend early one morning. It has been seven years since she has seen a comet with the naked eye.  Last week, Papenburg woke up at 3 a.m. to go out and find NEOWISE with a friend. The comet was only visible in the early hours of the morning then.  “It was worth it,” she said. “I’m not a morning person so I’m glad it will be visible in the evening now.”  Papenburg has spent most of her life chasing these celestial objects.  “They are like dirty snowballs. They are made of rock and ice and frozen gases,” she said.  She has seen between 15 and 20 comets in her lifetime. Her love for these fickle balls of rock and ice began with her first comet sighting at 16 years old. It was 1970 and she was living in Holland when she watched Comet Bennett brighten in the night sky.  She was hooked after that. Her favourite one was Comet West in 1976.  “That one was so big,” she said. “It had such a long tail it took up almost one-sixth of the sky.”  “I’m still waiting on another one like that.” NEOWISE is about the width of a fist above the northwest horizon, just below the Big Dipper. It will be climbing upward in the coming weeks which also means it will become dimmer in the sky — catch a glimpse before it’s too late.  It was discovered by the Near-Earth Object Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (NEOWISE) space telescope on March 27. The K-W Astronomy Club is the K-W Centre of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada and can be found on Facebook or at kw.rasc.ca. Check out the website for a clear sky chart and other resources.

13,"Just over a month ago, if you wanted to pop into Itacate restaurant on a Tuesday afternoon, you would’ve been out of luck. Its owners, the Moreno family, reserved Tuesdays as a day off from making mouth-watering tacos de carnitas and traditional mole. But that changed in the wake of COVID-19: They decided to open their doors to feed the community for free.

The Moreno family immigrated to Toronto from Mexico City in 2007 and opened Itacate in 2016 to cook the kind of soulful food they had grown up on. Now, outside the door of the little counter-serve spot on a strip of St. Clair West dotted with family businesses, a simple sign invites anyone in need—frontline workers, those who have lost their jobs, homeless people—to pick up a hot meal at no charge. Last week, they prepared 150 portions of chicken fajitas, each served with a steaming side of rice and beans.

“My mom decided we were going to start making free meals for people who need it because, well, she's like that: She feels good when she’s taking care of people,” explains Jahaziel Moreno, who runs the restaurant along with her parents and sisters. “We don't ask for identification to prove you’re a frontline worker or anything. We just let people know that there is good food here for those who need it.”

The restaurant has faced its own financial pressure: Plans to open a second storefront have been shelved after sales drastically slowed because of COVID-19 restrictions (they used to do a solid late-night shift, for example, serving hearty tortas to the party crowd). “My mother had some savings, so we are using that at the moment,” says Moreno simply. “She has a saying in Spanish, which is basically: If you give to people, then one day God will give it back to you.”

Francisco Rico-Martinez, co-director of the FCJ Refugee Centre on Oakwood Avenue, just around the corner from Itacate, wasn’t surprised to see the Moreno family in masks, serving take-out meals to neighbours free of charge. “They’ve passed through very difficult times since arriving in Canada, and they have been resilient,” he says. “I helped them with the process of becoming permanent residents, and when that happened last winter, they invited more than 100 people from the neighbourhood to a party. It was a way to say thank you to the community for helping them to stay in Canada.”

Kerri Romeo, who says she could live off of Itacate’s “incredible” chilaquiles for days, has lived in the St. Clair West and Oakwood area for four years and sees its community spirit thriving despite recent hardships. “It’s great to see everyone keeping this neighbourhood alive,” she says. “This stretch of St. Clair West is in transition—there are a lot of empty storefronts—but newer businesses like Primrose Bagel Co. have offered free coffee and bagels, and little free pantries have popped up across the neighbourhood for those who might need it.”

Rico-Martinez, who brought the FCJ Refugee Centre to St. Clair West 16 years ago, feels the same way. “This remains a neighbourhood of family businesses,” he says. “I’ve been amazed at the donations from the community. Every day, we receive groceries on our porch, we receive packages of art supplies for children. The Moreno family is a huge part of the sense of belonging that exists in this community.”

Itacate has long been a taste of home for Josue Hernandez, who immigrated to Canada from Mexico a decade ago and stops several times a month get his fix of authentic tacos and crisp, weighty pambazo sandwiches. “My relationship with the family is bigger than the restaurant now: I have a friendship with them,” he says. “Every time I go, I joke about soccer with Jahaziel’s father, because our favourite teams are rivals. It’s the kind of place where you feel like you know everyone—but they literally know everyone. They are so close with each other, and they treat everyone like a part of their family.”

Before social distancing stopped the Morenos from seating customers at their two small tables, they relished offering sit-down hospitality—they wanted every guest to feel welcome. “Do you know what Itacate means?” asks Rico-Martinez. “It’s the word people in Mexico use for the big bag of food your mom might prepare for you to take home after a visit. That gives you an understanding of the type of restaurant they wanted to create.”

The Morenos’ dedication has not gone unnoticed; neighbours pop their heads in often to offer thanks and encouragement to the family as they prep meals. “A customer left us a card that read: ‘Not all heroes wear capes or scrubs—some wear aprons.’ My mom cried,” says Moreno. She stops to think for a moment. “My mother cooks with love and people can feel that.”",A family restaurant responds to the current crisis by feeding its neighbours for free,5,0.0021060533511106927
16,"Outdoor journalist Kris Millgate spent a decade in TV news before starting her own production company, Tight Line Media, in 2006. With a quarter century of multimedia storytelling, Millgate traverses the country in search of dynamic topics, researching issues thoroughly then translating core elements via video, photo and words with credibility.

Her latest project is an immersive experience which will keep her on the roads, and streams, of the Pacific Northwest all summer long.

“Ocean to Idaho” debuts on social media platforms this summer. The multimedia experience offers audiences the opportunity to track the journey of migrating salmon from — as the title implies — the Pacific Ocean to the Salmon River in central Idaho, an 1,368-kilometre journey.

“We have so many things going on, and so many layers of priorities, whether it be figuring out how to feed our family tonight to how we’re going to try to plan a summer vacation,” Millgate said. “And within all of that is wildlife in wild land just trying to do their thing with all of us on top of them. And, just for a minute, I can help people engage in what is going on within our natural resources, despite all the things that we’re doing on top of them.”

Her outdoor adventure began at the mouth of the Columbia River in Oregon and will end at the Yankee Fork of the Salmon River in Idaho. Footage gathered during the trip will turn into a finished film plus stories for print and video media outlets countrywide in 2021.

“I go stretches at a time, like 10- to 12-day trips at a time, and then I get ahead of the fish so then I can come home, hug my kids, take a shower, catch up, make sure that everything social media-wise is running because that can turn into its own separate beast.”

The immersive social media campaign has been a challenge for the veteran journalist.

“By having social media, we can reach these audiences in a more dynamic way that really makes them feel involved. My credibility, my accuracy, my journalistic integrity — all those things still exist, but there’s this more accessible layer there where people can engage more.”

During her time at home, she writes, edits, cuts video, schedules more interviews — it’s a hectic pace.

“As a reporter, it changes the expectation because they want more of the personal behind-the-scenes stuff. I get asked for more of that in the last five to 10 years than ever before. But, we’re still just real people. And so, I go on these assignments and I’m not trying to tell you how to think on an issue, I just want you to think.”

Millgate hasn’t run into too many surprises on her trip yet — at least with the fish.

“What is surprising me is that everything is falling into place,” she said. “I’m pulling off the impossible here, and I haven’t gotten lost. I find every spot I need to be. I find it when I need to be there. Everyone that agrees to be interviewed is in their spot when I get there. And that’s pretty unbelievable.

“It’s almost serendipitous, you know? It’s like, everything that could go wrong is not going wrong.”

Millgate is well familiar with the Idaho section of her journey this summer. The rest has been an exciting discovery for her.

“You get me past like the very end of this migration route and I don’t know what anything looks like, I don’t know where anything is,” she said. “And so it’s this whole new world of shooting a landscape I’ve never seen and I love that.

“There’s nothing boring about it when your eyes are overwhelmed with everything that’s new. I like those days. So the fact that there’s like this rain forest which is the Lower Columbia sitting in the middle of this basic desert migration route, it’s awesome.”

Millgate shot a film a few years ago on the Yankee Fork of the Salmon River in central Idaho that was dredged for gold and left in ruins.

There she found the genesis for her current project.

“When I was in there shooting — I’d never seen a salmon. I’ve never caught a salmon in Idaho. I’ve never touched one. But I saw them in there and I thought, I’m watching them, you know basically on their last day of life and they’re guarding their spawning bed. And thinking, ‘How on earth does this fish do that and what on earth does that journey look like?’ I’m looking at a fish that just swam 850 miles to lay eggs and die. So my imagination kind of wandered: ‘What does that journey look like and how do I chart this back to the ocean?’”

Then last year, Millgate severely broke her leg when she was hit by a puck coaching her kids’ hockey team.

She was incapacitated for four months.

“When that happens to you, and you get thrown down on the couch like that, you really have no other choice but to look at yourself and your work, and where you’re at and what really matters. And I had a lot of those things already lined up in my life. But that concept of following the fish just kind of started sticking with me.”

In October of last year, she planned out how she’d pull the project off, with intricate levels of detail, lining up travel schedules and lodging and crews. But then, the pandemic hit, throwing much of the plan out the window.

“When that happened, as a freelancer a lot of my work fell away instantly. And there was nothing I was going to do about that. But this project kind of hung on and it morphed into this whole other thing — ‘OK, now we’re going to stack even more odds against you. See if you can pull this off.’ And so, I dumped my flights, I dumped my hotels, I dumped crew, and figured out how to do it in a way that was safe, responsible and reasonable.”

Toyota and Four Wheel Campers came through as sponsors for the project, giving Millgate self-contained transportation and lodging in one.

“There was all this time between October and May where it was a total wild roller-coaster ride of, ‘OK, this is going to happen. Oh, this is totally off the table,’ to, ‘Hey this is going to happen and it’s gonna look totally different. We’re going to pull it off.’”

The practicality of driving through the Pacific Northwest during a pandemic has been a challenge logistically and emotionally for Millgate.

“It’s kind of interesting to travel right now, because you get a different sense of how each area is handling it,” she said. “And I’m not with people. But you can feel it. Parts of Oregon are so shut down right now that even passing through without any interaction in a certain county feels uncomfortable.”

Millgate doesn’t want to give the impression she’s flaunting any of the pandemic precautions.

“I’m not trying to rebel in any way, I’m just trying to bring something that’s important, and bring it in a way that’s responsible,” she said.

“And frankly, sometimes it’s quite lonely. You’ve got your interviews, but then you don’t have anyone to hang out with when you go back to your camper. You work 15-hour days because that’s how many hours of light we have right now. And then you go back to your camper. And you’re camping in places where nobody is, that you’ve arranged with someone to let you have a safe place to park in their back lot, or whatever.”",‘Ocean to Idaho’ follows migration of salmon from Pacific to central Idaho through immersive social media campaign,6,0.22876222127045265
19,"Veteran trainer Michael McDonald got choked up thinking about what happened to his partner, April LeBlanc, last week at the Woodbine backstretch and how the thoroughbred racing community responded to her accident.

“It’s a big family back there,” McDonald told the Toronto Sun. “We run against each other every day, but April’s been at Woodbine since she was 18 years old and everybody knows her and likes her. It’s a good camaraderie at the backside and the response has been very warm.”

The race track community certainly rallied around LeBlanc, who co-owns and helps train a number of horses at Woodbine with McDonald. A Gofundme page was set up by a couple of her good friends at the track — Cory Clark and Ryan Lloyd — that has so far raised more than $20,000 with donations coming from trainers, jockey and track workers, as well as Woodbine Entertainment.

LeBlanc’s accident occurred last Thursday, although nobody actually saw what happened. McDonald said LeBlanc doesn’t remember what went down either.

“She remembers absolutely nothing from that whole day,” he said. “She doesn’t even remember driving to the racetrack.”

This is what McDonald knows: “My foreman was walking to the paddock with April and forgot the water bucket and he turned back to get it. When he called out to April, he wondered where she had gone. And then when he looked to the right, he saw her laying on the ground, unconscious.”

“She was pretty busted up,” said McDonald, who was in Lexington, Ky., at the time.

McDonald believes the horse LeBlanc was walking — the three-year-old filly Boatloadofnerve, who he co-owns with LeBlanc — reared up and struck her in the face with a front leg. LeBlanc was rushed to the hospital and suffered a brain bleed, a concussion, multiple seizures, a severely broken nose and chin and mouth lacerations that required many stitches and dental surgery.

“(Boatloadofnerve) is a handful, she really is,” McDonald said. “A bit of a bad actor. But April gallops her every day and she knows the filly and she’s aware that she can do stuff. But horses do things so fast. Even the most experienced hand can get blind-sided. I mean, April’s been on horses since she was six years old — riding, training, teaching kids to ride.”

McDonald said LeBlanc has suffered a number of injuries in the past but, even with her injuries, would never leave the game. He expects her back as soon as she’s well.

“This game is a labour of love,” he said. “It’s not a job. If you don’t love it, you walk away from it.”

Though LeBlanc was discharged from the Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre this week, she faces a long recovery and her many friends around the track have vowed to pitch in and help run her farm — Shadowy Hills in Alliston — and look after her horses.

On the Gofundme page, her friends wrote: “April has touched her community in many ways: teaching riding lessons to a variety of kids, all the workers on the back stretch, friends and family. She has always been there for anyone who needs her day or night, so let’s give back to her the way she would for us. Not only has April been part of shaping and mentoring children, she has rescued and re-homed and saved several animals: Dogs, cats, horses, you name it.”

Of course, horses don’t generally hurt their trainers or riders on purpose and no doubt LeBlanc will be cheering on Boatloadofnerve on Saturday in the 10th race at Woodbine — a 6 1/2 furlongs, maiden claiming event with a purse of $29,600.

Also racing on Saturday for McDonald will be his four-year-old filly Charmaine’s Mia in the $175,000 Grade II Royal North Stakes. The Kentucky-bred bay has raced 21 times, winning four of those while recording three second-place finishes and two thirds, earning $152,800 for McDonald.

She’s in tough, though. The Royal North will feature last year’s champion and Canada’s top female sprinter from 2019, Summer Sunday, trained by Stuart Simon, as well as another tough Simon entry, Sister Peacock.

Other entrants include Gary Barber’s four-year-old Eyeinthesky, the Barbara Minshall-trained Another Time, who finished second, a neck back of Elizabeth Way, in the Grade II Nassau Stakes on June 27, and Woodbine favorite Foxxy Belle, a chestnut mare who has been a huge winner since being claimed by owner Tommy Massis last June.

“She’s a decent filly,” McDonald said of Charmaine’s Mia. “She’s already stake-placed. She ran at Gulfstream this year and was fourth in a stakes on Pegasus Day, and then she came up here and was fourth in the Whimsical, only beaten by 3 1/2 lengths. I’m not saying she’s going to win it, but I don’t think I can find a better spot for $175,000 anywhere in North America, so I figured I’ll just take a chance.”

Unfortunately, McDonald won’t be there in person. Having just arrived back from the U.S. on Tuesday, he’s in quarantine for two weeks.

“I’m a small trainer and I’m very hands-on and I’ve got 10 (horses) at Woodbine and I own all 10 myself so it’s killing me not to be there,” he said. “Apart from being totally bored, it’s no fun training over the phone.”

On the upside, McDonald said he has total confidence in his assistant Devon Boreland.

“Devon is very capable and I’m in constant contact with him from 4:30-5 a.m. in the morning, so we can get it done together,” McDonald said.

20,"Wheeler scratched the INSTANT MONOPOLY™ ticket but set it aside, not realizing that she won the $250,000 top prize.

Sometimes a lottery prize has more value than just the cash itself. It can enable you to make a decision from the heart. For Melissa Wheeler, a 41-year-old support worker from Guelph, a $250,000 INSTANT MONOPOLY™ prize allowed her to continue working at the group home she’s supported for 20 years during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Wheeler regularly plays LOTTARIO with a friend at work. But there was something about that INSTANT MONOPOLY™ ticket that caught her eye one day.

“I was grocery shopping at Zehrs on a Saturday with my stepdaughter, just as the COVID-19 pandemic quarantine was beginning,” she recalls. “I don’t usually buy lottery tickets at the grocery store, but in the checkout line I decided to play THE BIGGER SPIN and also play some games I don’t normally play, including LOTTO 6/49, and a scratch ticket for INSTANT MONOPOLY™, which was new to me.”

Wheeler scratched the INSTANT MONOPOLY™ ticket but set it aside, not realizing that she won the $250,000 top prize.

She decided to scan her tickets the following day using the OLG Lottery App on her phone.

“I was excited when I found a prize for THE BIGGER SPIN worth $50,” she says. “I told my husband about the prize and he suggested I check the tickets I had bought the previous night. The app said that I had won the $250,000 prize for INSTANT MONOPOLY™. I couldn’t believe it. You never think this will happen to you.”

After asking her father to double check the ticket using the OLG Lottery App on his phone, he confirmed the big win.

“My father was more excited than we were,” she says.

Wheeler hid the winning ticket inside a cupboard. The following day, she and her husband made the trip to the OLG Prize Centre in Toronto to pick up the cheque.

“Back in Guelph, our bank had never seen anything like that cheque before,” she says. “They were as excited as we were. They also arranged for us to talk to a financial advisor about what we were going to do with the prize money.”

When schools were closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Melissa and her husband had to decide who would stay home to look after their son. Wheeler is passionate about working at the group home and wanted to continue working there, but her husband, who also works for an essential service industry, makes more money than she does.

“To protect the group home residents, they wanted the same group of care workers to support them consistently, so they could limit their exposure to COVID-19,” she says. “I didn’t want the residents to be cared for by strangers if I chose to stay at home. The prize money allowed me to choose to continue supporting the group home and make an ethical decision, instead of one based on financial need.”

The prize money also gave Melissa and her husband the opportunity to make a decision in the best interest of their family. While Melissa continued her important work at the group home, her husband was able to take a leave of absence from his job to stay home with their young son, an opportunity he wouldn’t have had otherwise.

Wheeler’s mother, who lives with her, is also a group home worker. Over 65, she was considered a higher risk worker and was required to stay home to protect her from coronavirus. Melissa offered her mother the financial backing to continue working on her terms, once the pandemic ends.

“When things return to normal, she can decide how she wants to spend the rest of her life,” says Wheeler. “She can retire or work as she pleases.”

Wheeler and her husband also stepped up their regular donations to the Guelph Food Bank, which had seen increased demand during the pandemic lockdown.

“We know that some of the people in our area rely on the food bank, so it was important to us,” she says. “When we saw that Nissan was matching donations it was an easy choice.”

She and her husband each allocated an equal slice of the prize money to buy a car. Wheeler bought an ever-so-slightly used 2018 Nissan Qashqi crossover for herself. Her husband bought a vintage 1977 Corvette Stingray he’s been kicking the tires on for the past decade or so.

Some of the money is also slated to buy a hot tub, pay down the couple’s mortgage, and renovate their home.

“My brother-in-law is an actuary so he’s always telling us what the odds are of winning a lottery,” says Wheeler. “After nearly throwing out that winning ticket, I can tell you that the odds are a lot better if you check your cards and tickets using the OLG Lottery App.”

23,"VICTORIA -- The search for 41-year-old Ben Kilmer in the Cowichan Valley captivated Vancouver Island residents two summers ago.

The married father of two young children disappeared mysteriously on May 16, 2018, leaving his work van idling on the side of Cowichan Lake Road.

Hundreds of volunteers helped with the search effort that stretched into the fall. But the search ended in despair when he was found dead by suicide.

His wife, Tonya Kilmer, vividly recalls her shock when police told her the news at the family’s home.

“My heart just sank,” she recalled Tuesday. “Why are you here? How can you be here? How is this even possible? And it was the last thing that I would have thought – I was sure that Ben was still out there.”

In the 27 months since his death, Tonya has focussed on finding answers to those questions and to trying to understand why the man she loved — who had no family history of mental health problems and no diagnosis of mental illness — took his own life.

She says financial stress piled up over the family home Ben was building, leading to insomnia, and a cycle of worry over the course of seven months.

Initially, her husband was reluctant to ask for help, either with his mounting anxiety or the financial struggle triggering it.

Tonya says she doesn’t want to see other families go through the same pain.

“Just don't let pride get in the way of seeking help, of getting that help that is needed,” Tonya says.

The day Ben disappeared, his last phone call was to his counsellor, who couldn’t pick up because he was with a patient.

Tonya wants others feeling acute desperation to know that they can always 911, and police will help with mental health calls.

It’s a call he didn’t make, but one she thinks might have saved Ben’s life, a man she remembers as a true adventurer who loved dearly his family and loved being outdoors with them.

“A man who lived every moment to the fullest,"" she remembers. ""A man who loved living outdoors and being active with his family. A man who loved with his whole heart.”

Tonya says she’s motivated to come forward now and speak out about Ben’s life and death because of the stress many are feeling during the COVID-19 pandemic.

She’s sharing her story with a Cowichan Valley-based podcast called Obstacle Course Podcast, beginning Wednesday over three episodes.

The podcast is a not-for-profit effort by John Close and Andrew Langford. It focuses on people overcoming adversity.

The three episodes with Tonya look at what led to Ben’s death and how it could have been avoided.

“What was it that led to Ben being compromised like he was?” says Close. “And more specifically, how can we prevent this from happening too somebody else?”

“We go into darkness and try and shed light,” says Langford.

Two years after she lost the man she called her rock, Tonya is working to shed light on his death, so that it wasn’t in vain.","Cowichan Valley widow opens up about husband's disappearance, suicide",8,0.38120423768821243
24,"VICTORIA -- Al will never forget the blind date and his first sight of Pat.

“She had the neatest miniskirt in the world,” Al recalls with a smile. “I fell instantly in love with her!”

Pat felt an immediate connection with Al too.

“He was such a kind and loving person,” Pat says. “He would do anything for me and anyone else.”

They got married six weeks later, on Friday the 13th. It was the only day the church was free.

“So [now] we actually celebrate on any Friday the 13th in the year,” Pat smiles. “There’s usually two of them.”

They’ve been lucky in love for 47 years. Although Al hasn’t been so fortunate in health.

“I felt wonky,” Al describes his early symptoms. “Not exactly a clinical term, but I felt wonky.”

His body was wonky and his mood too. Pat started writing reminders for him on a whiteboard so Al wouldn’t get confused. And then after an unrelated surgery Al was suddenly far more than wonky.

“It was like a totally different person when he came out of that,” Pat says.

Al was diagnosed with Lewy body dementia. Pat became his primary caregiver. They managed OK, until the pandemic shut down their respite support.

“He really went downhill very quickly,” Pat says. “And I went down with him.”

The situation was looking bleak. Then one day, Pat discovered the whiteboard looking anything but.

“He had taken it and coloured the whole thing in permanent marker,” she laughs.

He wrote ‘Pat is Amazing’ and surrounded the message with shapes and colours.

The man who’d never done anything creative in his life suddenly felt compelled to make art.

“It was a release,” Al explains. “This is a medium for me to be able to express myself.”

After Pat bought her husband a bunch of multi-coloured markers, Al started expressing himself multiple times a day. He hasn’t stopped for months.

“It was life-altering,” Pat smiles. “It’s so wonderful for him.”

It’s transformed their living room into Al’s ever-expanding art gallery. There are currently 113 of the eclectic and bright posters hanging on three of the room's four walls.

They all feature recognizable phrases radiating with vibrant colours. They range from Dr. Bonnie Henry’s motto (“Be Kind. Be Calm. Be Safe.”) to novelty song titles (""Purple People Eater"") to unexpected observations (""Dear Fly, Nobody Likes You"").

“You need to be able to laugh,” Pat says, remembering when Al debuted the fly poster. “I think I’d lost my laughter for a while.”

Now they’ve found that’s one of the secrets to staying lucky through so many unlucky Fridays.

Perhaps the other secret is celebrating the positive. Most of Al’s work features messages like, ""Follow your Bliss,"" ""Never Give Up,"" and ""Carpe Diem.""

“Sometimes its hard to find,” Pat says. “But there’s always a sliver lining.”

25,"“American Dirt,” Jeanine Cummins, Flatiron Books (MacMillan), 383 pages, $23.99 paperback What would you do if your entire family was gunned down at a birthday party, and only you and your eight-year-old son escaped?  This is in Acapulco and the shooters are members of a powerful cartel with a vendetta against your journalist husband for reporting on their brutalities. And you own a bookstore and only recently found out that the leader of the cartel was one of your favourite customers.  How will you get away? That’s the opening chapter of “American Dirt,” a novel about Mexican migrants, published in January and chosen by Oprah for her Book Club. The author, Jeanine Cummins, received a seven-figure advance for it and it was blurbed glowingly by authors Stephen King, Ann Patchett, Sandra Cisneros and Julia Alvarez. Don Winslow calls it “a ‘Grapes of Wrath’ for our time.” I couldn’t put it down. Lydia Perez and her son, Luca, leave her now dead mother’s home where the police are barely investigating the shooting that took 16 of their relatives. (She suspects that the police are under the control of Javier, the cartel leader.)  Lydia and Luca spend the night in a hotel under a false name but in the morning a parcel arrives, a book of fiction from Javier with a love note. She and Luca manage to evade the black SUVs in the parking lot and board a series of buses to head for Mexico City. What follows is a desperate and fear-ridden journey to “el Norte.” If they can escape across the U.S.-Mexico border, she has an uncle in Denver whom she hopes will take them in.  First she tries to fly to Tijuana but airlines require her son’s birth certificate. So, like scores of other Mexicans, they walk countless miles and learn to ride atop freight trains. They join migrants from other Latin American countries, including two sisters from Honduras. Rebeca and Soledad are teens who followed their father from their village to the city, only to become sex slaves for a gangland pimp.  Lydia has gone from a comfortable middle-class life to a living hell. While she was aware that her husband’s work put their family in some danger (his newspaper would put them up in a hotel for a few days after each cartel story was published), she was regrettably naïve as to the depths of evil that Javier, whom she saw as a sophisticated bibliophile, was carrying out. And the plight of migrants was outside her comfortable life in Acapulco. Now she too will have her money stolen and witness the murders and accidental deaths of several fellow travellers.  But the way north is, like the Underground Railway, not without its angels — they survive with the help of the kindness of strangers. “There is always a smile, a blessing, a flare of recognition from the hardworking young man, who … imagines his own little sister or cousin or daughter in the place of these girls.” “American Dirt” is an adrenalin-fueled page-turner. This is the story of human beings escaping unbelievable violence in hopes of surviving in a country not controlled by brutal cartels.  But the book has been met with controversy, claiming that a white writer is too privileged to have empathy for her Latino and Mexican characters. The author spent four years researching the migrant experience and cites several migrant chronicles written by non-whites. She still felt unqualified to write this book but was advised by a Chicana academic: “We need as many voices as we can get, telling this story.”  For this reader, I am grateful that she did. In a better world, so would the President of the United States. We Canadians need to face our own racism and open our hearts to immigrants — all are human beings, like our own forbearers, in search of a better life.

26,"VICTORIA -- After decades of debate and nearly four years of construction, the Capital Region is on the home stretch towards completing its new tertiary sewage treatment plant.

There’s still a lot of work to be done before it’s finished but the construction is now far enough along that trials have begun taking place, using potable water, to see how it runs.

Currently, when you flush your toilet in the CRD (Capital Regional District), your waste passes through a six-millimetre screen before the raw sewage is flushed out into the ocean's currents, one kilometre off of our shoreline.

As of Dec. 31 of this year, that is all going to change.

“We have been working on the project now for almost four years and we’re on track to meet that regulatory deadline for treatment by the end of the year,” said Elizabeth Scott, deputy project director with the CRD’s Core Area Wastewater Treatment Project.

“We’re very pleased to be where we are and excited to be so close to the finish line.”

It has been a massive undertaking, coming in at just over three-quarters of a billion dollars and claiming the title of the largest infrastructure project ever in the CRD.

Once the tertiary treatment plant is completed, your sewage will still pass through two existing pump stations on its way to the new Mcloughlin Point Wastewater Treatment Plant. The two stations are located at Clover Point and Macaulay Point, and have both been expanded, rebuilt and rerouted.

“What we’ve done at these pump stations is upgrade them so that they include screening and de-gritting,” said Scott.

At those pump stations, waste runs through a machine that separates large solids from liquids. That liquid is then pumped through 35-kilometres of piping across the CRD until it reaches the new treatment plant, where it will receive the royal treatment.

It’s a three-stage treatment process beginning with primary treatment.

“That’s a physical process where you separate out the solids,” said Scott. “You basically allow heavier solids to settle out in giant tanks.”

Then, the waste passes on through to the secondary process, which is a biological process. During this step, micro-organisms breakdown some of the dissolved and suspended solids.

Finally, waste will then pass through tertiary treatment, which is when the effluent passes through a five-micro disc filter.

“The cumulative impact of those three stages is that you’ve removed and completely eliminated many pharmaceuticals, compounds of emerging concern and contaminants,” said Scott.

The CRD’s waste system will soon exceed provincial and federal regulations, which only require secondary treatment.

The last step before sewage makes its way to the ocean includes a two-kilometre journey down an outflow pipe. The waste is then sent down to a depth of 60 metres, where the treated water will be discharged into the ocean.",$775M Greater Victoria sewage treatment plant nears completion,7,0.029040787574867943
27,"A Wisconsin family rescued a young bear after it got a plastic cheese ball container stuck on its head.

Tricia Hurt, her husband Brian, and their son Brady were out fishing on Marsh-Miller Lake on Sunday when they came across the distressed black bear.

""We knew that if we didn't do something, we are pretty sure it would not have made it to shore,"" Tricia Hurt told CNN. ""It was really huffing and puffing, my husband said.""

The family came up behind the bear, and Brian pulled on the tub but lost his grip -- but he realized the bear's ear was loose. They looped the boat back around, and after a final tug the bear was free and swam safely to shore.

Hurt said the whole ordeal lasted about five minutes.

""We were so excited! We did our good deed for the day. We will never ever do this again, and it felt good to help the poor bear. You don't like to see animals struggle,"" Hurt said.

When they got back to the resort bar, word of their courageous act had already spread thanks to some campers watching on the shore.

The Hurts learned from people at the bar that the bear had been running around with the tub on its head for three to four days.

The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources had been contacted several times but had been unable to locate it thanks to the rural, wooded landscape, Hurt said.

""We weren't going to put the video up,"" Hurt said. ""But we wanted everyone to know that the bear was OK.""

28,"I was a food writer for 12 years before The Record asked me to join their restaurant review team. Apart from my own sites, my byline appeared on well-known ones and now-defunct ones. I authored a white paper for a popular appliance manufacturer. Local and national media interviewed me a few times. I gave talks about food history and appeared on discussion panels on both sides of the border.  After my first Record review ran, a local acquaintance told me I shouldn’t write under my name and every picture of me should be removed from the internet. He didn’t think I should be recognized as the author of my work, although my white colleagues were credited for theirs. I politely ended my reply with, “I’m not easily erased.” He abruptly ended the exchange. I wasn’t surprised. I was born in Kitchener, grew up here, and got my degree from the University of Waterloo. Like other visible minorities, I’m well acquainted with the area’s casual and overt racism: Kids in school called me the N-word. Sales clerks follow me. Restaurant servers try to deny service. We see hate platformed, read gaslighting comments, and hear fauxpologies. Whenever someone demands to know where I’m “really” from, I’m reminded that to some, being Canadian is only skin deep.  That sense of who can and cannot be Canadian is woven into the national fabric. For Canada’s first 100 years, immigration policies prioritized those who could easily blend into colonial culture. Policies and regulations created an unofficial colour bar that throttled immigration from China and India. While not legislated, Wilfrid Laurier’s cabinet approved banning Black immigration. Japanese Canadians’ voting rights were withheld until 1949; Indigenous Peoples didn’t receive universal suffrage until 1982.  Shifting public attitudes of the 1960s led to Lester B. Pearson’s government overhauling our immigration system. Applicants earned points for things such as education, work skills, and language skills; race wasn’t supposed to be a factor. A few years later, in 1971, Pierre Trudeau adopted the Bilingualism and Biculturalism Commission’s recommendation to make multiculturalism national policy.  But reversing a century of systemic racism doesn’t happen overnight.  Black Lives Matter has laid bare deep-seated biases against Black people and other marginalized groups, with conversations turning to how these attitudes flow in the undercurrents of our daily lives: salaries and promotions, social media moderation, how we think about food. I know I’m a rare flower in that I’m a bylined, paid, freelance food writer, who happens to be of South Indian ancestry. This field is traditionally populated by white writers focused on urban, white, bourgeois diners. These writers often elevate certain cuisines to three-star haute status while they devalue immigrant cuisines to cheap eats, particularly when made by immigrant hands. They’ll blur regional foods into Chinese, Latino, and Indian abstractions, and coo over the curiosity of “ethnic” foods, when gentrified or appropriated by white personalities. Contemporary food writing isn’t entirely fogged by exhausted views. Independent voices and staff writers, like some now at The New York Times, San Francisco Chronicle, and Food & Wine, don’t necessarily look like, think like, or eat like their predecessors and are more reflective of their communities and generations. While some continue the aspirational chase for “the best places,” others unearth compelling stories in tasty places. Condescending eyes aren’t cast on diasporic cuisines or their labour. Restaurants and chefs previously fawned over aren’t automatically slid easy praise.  Change is difficult, especially after decades of magazines, newspapers, radio, and TV reinforcing cultural biases. Some eaters are flummoxed with opinions, voices, or faces that don’t fit the old mould. Without reading my work, a woman told me I’m unqualified to write about “white people’s food” because I wasn’t raised on it. When I said that must also mean white people who weren’t raised eating Japanese, Chinese, Thai and other non-European cuisines weren’t qualified to write about them, she mumbled something and walked away.  I’ve been told restaurants in Waterloo’s University District — a young area, chockablock with diasporic cuisines often cooked by non-white hands — aren’t “worthy” of review. Patronizing comments like “who can eat this?” echo sentiments about stinky, spicy, unclean foreign foods. My foodways writing spotlights cuisines our neighbours bring with them, but some insist those aren’t “the most important” ones. As one person said, “we don’t eat like this.”  But we do.  More than 50 years after immigration reforms, Waterloo Region’s population includes more than 220 ethnicities and one in five of us identify as a visible minority. How we think of ourselves should evolve with our community. How we tell today’s stories — from business to arts to sports to culture to food — should reflect who we are now. Not who we were in the decades before I was born. Not who those in far-off glass towers think we are.  We may not have eaten like this in 1950, but we do eat like this in 2020. Because that’s who we really are.",Systemic racism impacts how we view food — and reviewers — in Waterloo Region,2,0.43788759365057206
29,"WINNIPEG -- A set of twins from Vita, Man., are in the fight of their lives as they were each diagnosed with cancer just days apart from each other.

Mason and Sierra Malmsten are 16-year-olds and currently at the Children's Hospital of Winnipeg battling cancer.

Mason was diagnosed with Stage 3 Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and Sierra was diagnosed with Stage 2 Hodgkin's lymphoma.

Their dad, Gordon said everything started back in May when Mason developed a cough.

""With everything going with COVID and everything, of course, we got him tested for COVID, it came back negative and so his doctor said it is probably his asthma,"" said Gordon.

He said Mason was given a puffer and the doctor said his cough would go away in a few weeks.

However, just before he was supposed to be done using his puffer, he started to cough up blood.

""We brought him into the Steinbach emerg to get him checked out. Spent most of the evening there. They did a bunch of tests and determined that they thought it was a very severe case of bronchitis.""

Again, Mason was given medication but he was still coughing up blood a few days later.

Gordon said they took Mason to the children's hospital, per his family doctor's request and after waiting there for several hours the doctors said there was a strong chance he had cancer.

""He has a large mass the size of a softball growing in his chest. It is left of his heart, right of his esophagus, right underneath the top of his left lung, and right above his carotid arteries,"" he said.

Gordon said Mason spent a few days in the ICU and the doctors were eventually able to confirm that it was cancer.

A SECOND DIAGNOSES, DAYS LATER

He said the family was obviously upset about the diagnoses, but a few days later Mason's twin sister Sierra said she had a bump on her neck.

Their family doctor said they should take Sierra in for tests just in case.

Gordon said they again went to the children's hospital at which point they ran into Mason's cancer doctor and he told him the situation.

""His comment was 'it's extremely unlikely that she has cancer',"" said Gordon, adding the doctor still advised she get checked out.

A week later the doctors then diagnosed her with cancer.

Sierra Malmsten

Gordon said their doctor, who has been in the field for 35-years, has never heard of fraternal twins both being diagnosed with cancer a week apart.

DEALING WITH CANCER IN A COVID-19 WORLD

Gordon said it has been difficult for the family and said learning of the diagnoses was extremely disappointing.

On top of everything, he said the situation hasn't been made any easier with COVID-19.

Gordon said only one parent was allowed to visit at a time and so he and his wife Sherri, would be ""passing each other in the hallways"" as they visited Mason.

He said it became more difficult once Sierra was diagnosed because they weren't allowed to bring their youngest daughter Brooklynn with them to the hospital.

Gordon added they relied on family to look after Brooklynn and it was only as of two weeks ago they were allowed to bring her to the Ronald McDonald House where they have been staying.

THE FINANCIAL TOLL OF DEALING WITH CANCER

He also said this has taken a financial toll on the family as both he and his wife had to take a leave from their jobs.

""We still have like our regular household stuff that is happening at the house and we still now have the expense of the Ronald McDonald House,"" said Gordon. ""The Ronald McDonald House is a great place, amazing place, but still you have your meals that you have to be thinking of and you have to buy your groceries for here and the little extra stuff that they need. The hospital food is not always the best, so then you are running out and grabbing little snacks for them. It's been a lot of driving back and forth and a lot of parking.""

THE FAMILY PLANS FOR THE NEXT STEPS

Gordon said at this moment in time both Mason and Sierra are close to finishing their second round of chemotherapy.

He added that the doctor said the best-case scenario, chemo could stop in September, worst case they would need to continue chemo until Christmas time.

""Once the chemo stops, then we need to start building up their immune system again, which is the next big challenge,"" he said. ""The doctor said it's going to probably be the New Year before their life goes back to normal.""

'IN IT TO WIN IT' FAMILY PULLS TOGETHER THROUGH DIFFICULTIES

Gordon said Mason and Sierra have been staying as positive as possible and he added that in a way it has been a blessing that they are going through this together and supporting each other through everything.

""They support each other, they cry with each other, they are each other's biggest cheerleaders.""

Sierra and Mason.

Gordon added that for him and his wife it has been difficult. He said they try to be positive when around the kids but it gets tough when they are by themselves. Gordon said they cry a lot, adding it is hard to be positive sometimes.

But he added that his wife has started using the saying ""We're in it to win it"" and that no matter what Mason, Sierra, and the entire family are going to get through this time.

FUNDRAISER STARTED FOR MALMSTEN FAMILY

Gordon said a family friend has started a GoFundMe for the family to help cover some of the financial issues.

As of Thursday, the page had raised more than $5,700 for the family.

He added that if people don't want to donate to the GoFundMe, he is urging people to register to become a blood donor as both Mason and Sierra have had to have blood transfusions. He also encouraged people to give support to the local Ronald McDonald Houses.

Gordon said he appreciates all the support his family has been receiving and they are hoping they will be able to get through this soon.","We're in it to win it': Manitoba twins battling cancer, diagnosed weeks apart",8,0.49581224138185065
30,"“Unsolved Mysteries,” the alternately chilling and far-out docuseries that returned to TV this week, began with a solved one. In the fall of 1982, William Catterson, a New Jersey father of two, failed to return home from his fast-food job. His car was found, abandoned. A chocolate cake, an anniversary present for his wife, still rested on the passenger seat. Two years later, writer and producer Terry Dunn Meurer included his case in an HBO documentary: “Missing Persons: Four True Stories.” Catterson, who had faked his own disappearance, saw it. He turned himself in to police, then reunited with his family. “And I was like, ‘Wow, that’s interesting,’” Meurer said. She and her producing partner, John Cosgrove, began to imagine a series that would not only televise have-you-seen-this-person enigmas and criminological riddles but maybe also crack them, too. “Unsolved Mysteries” debuted on NBC in 1988 as part of a late-’80s tabloid TV boom and endured for decades on various networks and cable channels. It had murders and missing persons. Also ghosts, Bigfoot and assorted UFOs. A cadaverous Robert Stack hosted. Eerie theme music gave even hardened viewers the heebie-jeebies. A pick-and-mix format alternated melodramatic crime stories and supernatural thrillers, arguably presaging both pulpy newsmagazines like “Dateline” and paranoid dramas like “The X-Files.” Now Netflix has brought it back. The new “Unsolved Mysteries,” which reunites much of the original creative team, debuted Wednesday with a six-episode batch, to be followed by at least six more instalments later this year. It arrives in an America it anticipated: a crime-obsessed, conspiracy-minded nation with increasingly subjective notions about truth. The format has changed, but the blend of fact and folklore remains. It is a combination that risks trivializing actual crimes by juxtaposing them with wilder content and legitimizing the uncanny through proximity to fact. Not that the creators see it that way. “We like the mix,” Meurer said brightly. “We’ve always thought of ourselves as a mystery show, not as a true-crime show.” From the beginning, competing impulses powered “Unsolved Mysteries”: a crusading compulsion to seek justice and a market-driven need to entertain. The show leaned heavily on reliable tabloid conventions — lost loves, missing heirs, unexplained deaths, medical mysteries — and many of the segments varied first-person interviews with best-guess re-enactments, some of them lurid. Paranormal cases and alternate histories made the counterfactual (a conspiracy theory about Martin Luther King Jr.’s death, Bigfoot) into just another puzzle. “We just came up with every single type of mystery that we could think of: UFO, paranormal, ghost stories, miracles, past lives, psychics,” Meurer said. “We just mixed it all in with the crime.” On NBC, “Unsolved Mysteries” began with a disclaimer: “This program is about unsolved mysteries. Whenever possible, the actual family members and police officials have participated in recreating the events. What you are about to see is not a news broadcast.” So it was not news. Not exactly. But as crowdsourced detection, the series worked. In the ’80s and ’90s, as an episode aired, viewer tips would pour into the show’s call centre. Of the solvable mysteries — a missing child, say, or unidentified remains — the show counts more than 260 as resolved, a clearance rate of about 34 per cent. (“Bigfoot isn’t necessarily solvable,” Meurer said.) Some of those solutions came via viewer tips. After a Friday night broadcast in 1988 about fugitives Missy Munday and Jerry Strickland, a flood of calls had already led to their arrest by Saturday morning. After nine seasons on NBC, the show moved to CBS, then to Lifetime in an attenuated form, then to Spike, which repackaged old episodes and added Dennis Farina as a tan, tough-guy narrator. The Spike stint ended in 2010, but “Unsolved Mysteries” did not disappear. Its website and cold case forums remained open. Old episodes popped up, unofficially and then officially, on YouTube. Amazon began streaming them in 2017. Meurer never gave up on a revival. “There’s always mysteries that need to be solved,” she said. When the hit Netflix drama “Stranger Things” premiered in 2016, she noticed tweets and Facebook posts comparing that scripted series, which is set in the ’80s and goes big on the paranormal, to “Unsolved Mysteries.” So she brought a pitch to its producers at 21 Laps Entertainment. Shawn Levy, who founded 21 Laps, had watched the original “Unsolved Mysteries” in college, admiring the way it meshed genre mystery with character-driven story. “There’s a finite number of true iconic brands in the world, especially in the world of storytelling,” he said. “‘Unsolved Mysteries’ is a true icon.” (He also called it “the Holy Grail of IP.”) Levy, whose company has a deal with Netflix, came on as an executive producer, as did Josh Barry, president of 21 Laps. Levy wanted to honour what he called the “DNA” of the original show, though longtime viewers will immediately recognize changes. Feeling that Stack, who died in 2003, was irreplaceable, producers omitted a host. Gone, too, is the party-platter format of the ’80s and ’90s, in which calamity followed calamity, separated only by commercial breaks. Now each episode, which runs 50 minutes, give or take, centres on a single mystery. There are no commercials. These episodes — three unexplained deaths, one missing person, one wanted man, one paranormal phenomenon — move closer to traditional documentary, with fewer re-enactments and a greater emphasis on interviews and archival sources. The show assumes a somewhat more sophisticated viewer with a far longer attention span. One episode — a family annihilation chiller — is presented almost entirely in French, with English subtitles. And the producers hope that a platform like Netflix, with its global reach and its more than 180 million subscribers, many of them now homebound, may lead to more solutions. “The reach is so wide,” said Marcus A. Clarke, who directed several episodes of the new version. That reach prodded Angel Rivera to participate in the first episode, “Mystery on the Rooftop.” In 2006, his brother, Rey Rivera, went missing. His body was found a week later in the conference room of a Baltimore hotel. A murder or a suicide? The medical examiner could not say. “It’s not something that I ever readily shared with anyone,” Angel Rivera said. But he trusted the producers and described the interviews that Clarke had conducted as therapeutic. “There was a sense of peace doing it,” he said. And the show, he believes, might prompt someone to come forward with information. “We’ll get it out to more ears and eyes than we could ever possibly imagined,” he said. “For my parents, even for me, there’s that closure that we’re all looking for.” Rivera did not mind that the same viewers who will scrutinize his brother’s death can also watch “Berkshires UFO,” an episode about close encounters in the Berkshire mountains in 1969. “I think it falls in line with what the brand is about,” he said. In 2020, when politicians knowingly circulate alternative facts and conspiracy theories trend on TikTok, what does it mean for that brand to take a flexible approach to observable reality? “Unsolved Mysteries” did not create this fungible, disingenuous moment. But a show that puts aliens on the same epistemological footing as a murdered family does meet it. This is not necessarily an act of bad faith — Meurer absolutely believes in the paranormal. “I’ve always felt that way, my whole life,” she said. And Clarke, who directed “Berkshires,” is a UFO enthusiast. He mentioned the Times’ reporting on the Pentagon’s recent release of three videos, filmed by Navy pilots, that show unidentified aerial phenomena. “If at this point people don’t believe or understand that these things are real, they are in denial,” he said. Levy, who described himself as “slightly to the skeptical end of that sliding scale,” enjoyed “Berkshires UFO.” But when pushed, he said he felt less certain about the show’s accommodating approach to the supernatural. “That is something that needs to be considered moving forward,” he said. Another potential problem, for viewers if not necessarily the producers, is the show’s relationship with law enforcement. Cops were not necessarily the series’ heroes. After all, if a case made its way to “Unsolved Mysteries,” police had probably failed in some way. But agencies have historically suggested mysteries to the show’s producers and sent officers to vet tips. Like the recently cancelled “Cops,” the series makes an implicit argument for law and order with its envisioning of a dangerous, anarchic world. “We’ve always had a great reputation with law enforcement,” Meurer said. Still, an episode in this new series, “No Ride Home,” explores a botched police investigation into what may have been a racially motivated crime. In 2004, Alonzo Brooks, a young Black man, disappeared after attending a party. After a police search failed, a search led by friends and family located his body. A cause of death was not determined. In June, spurred by inquiries from “Unsolved Mysteries,” the FBI reopened his case, offering a $100,000 (U.S.) reward. “We’ve been seeing a lot of people being kind of brought to justice from old cases and this is one that really deserves it,” Clarke said. “The family deserves it.” Cynthia Bowles, a longtime story producer, thinks that the Brooks case could be solved. She also feels hopeful about the murder of Patrice Endres (the subject of the episode “13 Minutes”) and the disappearance of Lena Chapin (“Missing Witness”). “They could all shake loose,” she said. Ethical complications will not matter so much if the right tips come. If Brooks’ family — or Rivera’s or Endres’ or Chapin’s — gets answers, who will care about wiggly truth value or an outlook that sees the world through a camera lens, darkly? “‘Unsolved Mysteries’ has always represented hope,” Meurer said. “That’s why we do the show: the hope is that we’re going to solve these cases. “To me,” she added, “that mitigates the darkness.”","‘Unsolved Mysteries’ returns, because 2020 isn’t scary enough",1,0.23308445025757263
31,"KITCHENER -- Family and friends are trying to help a Kitchener family who are struggling to make ends meet, after their seven-month old son was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer.

Grayson Curtis is currently undergoing chemotherapy for a malignant rhabdoid tumour, which affects young infants and children. The cancer started in his kidney and has now spread to his liver and lungs.

His parents, Shauna Payne and Joshua Curtis, say their little boy has been strong.

“It seem like the chemo is working,” Shauna says. “Only because he seems so much happier now.”

Their ordeal started on July 1, when they noticed Grayson had a bloated belly. They initially thought he had gas, but after doctors at Grand River Hospital examined Grayson, they rushed him to McMaster Children’s Hospital in Hamilton.

Joshua says the situation was difficult at first, mostly for Grayson’s 9-year-old sister McKenna.

“She wasn’t allowed in the hospital to see her brother,” he says. “It was pretty hard for us because we’re always together.”

Over the last few weeks, Joshua and Shauna have been off work and they’ve been struggling to pay their bills.

That’s when family and friends stepped in to help them out by organizing online fundraisers and raffles, as well as starting a GoFundMe page.

“Within 24 hours we already exceeded $10,000,” says cousin Lucinda Payne.

“Honestly, I’m just so grateful to have, like an army behind me,” says Joshua.

Carmen Cordova, who has been a friend for more than 20 years, is also hosting a Zumbathon fundraiser next month.

“They don’t need to be worried about the logistical stuff,” she says. “They just need to worry about their emotional wellbeing.”

The Curtis family appreciates the support, as they’ve already been through a lot in the last few years.

“We’ve had four miscarriages and also had a stillborn in 2017,” says Shauna.

“They deserve every bit of help they can get,” adds Payne.

32,"There are spiders in my garden, and that’s a very good thing. They have their role to play in controlling troublesome bugs. Sadly, too many people neither like them nor appreciate them and the sight of a spider can quickly turn an arachnophobe into a clumsy tap dancer. Before you know it, they’re hopping and stomping around. That’s not a good move in a garden.  Just saying the word spider can set them off, so I avoid pointing out any plants that have spider connections, and I have at least three in my garden. The smallest is a succulent, Sempervivum arachnoideum. There, the species name should tip anyone off.  The common name might not mention spiders but the sight of a clump of these plants that appear to be covered in spider webs often causes a few wrinkly noses. It’s because of the white, hairy webbing that covers the green rosettes that they’re called Cobweb Hens and Chicks. I have a couple of pots filled with this succulent and, like other hens and chicks, it’s hardy enough to stay outside over winter — providing the pot is. Cleome hassleriana is another plant that might provoke a reaction, by its common name and by its appearance. It’s known as cleome and just as often called spider flower or spider plant. It doesn’t have webs, but the individual flowers do have long, threadlike stamens that resemble the legs of you know what. Even the seed pods can be mistaken for cute little spider bodies. Despite the name, this tall, leggy plant with its large, intricate flowers is excellent in the back of a perennial border. Cleome self-seeds, but never enough to be invasive. Plant it once and it will usually return each year. There are a few varieties that range in colour from white to pink through lilac, and many are bicoloured. If there is a drawback, cleome have slightly thorny stems; however, there are hybrids available like ‘Senorita Rosita’ that are without thorns — except they don’t self-seed. The last in my trio of panic-inducing plants is a summer-flowering bulb called Ismene fetalis, or yes, the white spider lily. This plant is a beauty and mine are flowering now. Ismene aren’t hardy enough to grow year-round in the garden, although they could be planted there for the summer. In a flower bed or a planter or pot, Ismene grow best in moist soil in full sun to part shade. Mine are growing in pots in a rich, well-drained soil and I water them frequently. If the soil is allowed to dry out, there’s a chance the highly fragrant flowers will fail to bloom.  These plants grow from a bulb much like amaryllis and are just as exotic looking. In fact, they’re distantly related and have similar long, straplike leaves. I treat them much the same way as an amaryllis bulb by letting the foliage die naturally. I store the bulbs over winter and start them off again in spring.  Without going into its forebears, this particular Ismene is a hybrid of similar species that grow naturally in South America. Ismene, once a popular girl’s name, is sometimes sold as Hymenocallis and bulbs are usually available in spring. As for that spidery sobriquet, I suppose it’s because of the appearance of the flower, although I can’t see much resemblance myself. The other common name for Ismene is Peruvian daffodil and it does have a look of a raggedy daffodil but with long wispy stamens that, like the cleome, could be seen as spidery. Ignore the name, I say, and appreciate the flowers — and do try to appreciate those other things.

33,"SUDBURY -- A northern Ontario photography enthusiast captured two celestial events, aurora borealis and Comet NEOWISE, in one breathtaking time-lapse video.

Christina Emond has been capturing nature and wildlife in northeastern Ontario for more than four years as a hobby.

This week, she set up her Canon Rebel T7 camera with an 18 mm lens and a tripod on Murray Lake in Hagar, a small rural community east of Sudbury, and took a time-lapse video of the northern lights and Comet NEOWISE.

Using a slow shutter speed over two hours, she was able to capture the two celestial events in a 24-second time-lapse video.

Comet NEOWISE, C/2020 F2, is named after the NASA mission that discovered it, Near-Earth Object Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer. It has caught the attention of stargazers around the world and is visible to the naked eye from dusk to dawn in the northern hemisphere. NASA says the comet will not be seen again for another 6,800 years.

Emond said the comet can be seen from about 10:45 p.m. to about 4 a.m. starting in the northwestern part of the sky as it moves east.

Her time-lapse also captured the aurora borealis, known as northern lights. In northeastern Ontario, the phenomenon is seen more as movement in the sky without the colour, however, the camera was able to pick up the various colours.

Northern Lights Centre describes the phenomenon as ""bright dancing lights of the aurora are actually collisions between electrically charged particles from the sun that enter the earth's atmosphere.""

On her way to the lake Monday night, Emond came across a curious moose calf that was walking along the dark rural road. She said she could hear the mother in the bush.

Watch the video of the adorable moose calf as it saunters around a dark, rural northern road. When Christina, a former hunter, makes a moose call, it catches the young animals attention.

In an interesting coincidence, the night she took the picture of a lifetime, it was her late husband's birthday.

""I know he was there helping me on this one,"" said Emond.

The amateur photographer said she has really grown connected to nature through her experiences and has gotten rid of her hunting firearm. Some of her photography is even being featured at a furniture store in Markstay.

Her favourite encounter is with a wolf she came across that caught her attention during one of her daily photoshoots. She said she saw the animal out of the corner of her eye as it was eating snow on a beautiful winter day. They observed each other calmly at a distance and she was able to capture several spontaneous images.

She said she is very careful around wildlife and if she notices any signs of aggression, she leaves them alone and gets away quickly and calmly.

Another memorable experience was she recalls is when she encountered a lynx on a local rural road and was able to walk behind it for a short period of time. For wildlife and nature images she uses a Sigma 150mm lens and tries to get out in nature every day.

The self-taught photographer said she takes 200–800 photos in a sitting and has learned a lot from local photographers Allison Currie Beaulieu, Ray Thoms, and Gerry Gooderham.

34,"CALGARY -- He’s the biggest bird around and he's considered a 'free wild bird' by Alberta Fish and Wildlife.

As urban legend goes, it's believed that in the spring of 2019, Turk was brought to the Calgary Stampede grounds and given to a rancher as a gift. Turk escaped the horse trailer he was in and took up residency in Ramsay. The community adopted the bird as its unofficial mascot and a Facebook group was created with over 6,300 members.

But now Turk has moved north across the Bow River and has been frequenting the courtyard at a seniors independent living facility called Willow Park on the Bow.

""I got interested in Turk the turkey, I’d heard about him, he has Facebook, he’s very famous,"" said resident Marianne Jaromi. ""And one morning instead of a rooster crow, I heard a turkey gobble.""

Jaromi says the majority of residents have embraced their new neighbour, especially when many have been challenged with isolation during the pandemic.

""It (Turk) changes my day from being negative to being very positive,"" said resident Laura Pearce. ""I put it (Turk) on Facebook and everybody in the world has seen it, it’s great entertainment.""

Turk likes to spend time in the courtyard during the day and stays close to the double glass doors where he can see his reflection. Residents believe the bird might be lonely or even looking for a mate.

""I think he thinks that’s a playmate in there and he starts pecking at the window,"" said Vicky Jones, who’s lived there for seven years. ""Pretty soon, he backs up and plumes out at the window and so I told him, 'You know Turk, if you think that’s that’s going to be a girlfriend it’s not, it’s you.'""

Eleven-year resident Frieda Hughes said the bird delights everyone at the building.

""Oh, he’s nice, he’s very tame and he likes people and we like him but he’s very messy.""

Facility management regularly wash down areas after Turk has been there to make sure no one slips on his large droppings.

""We like to have him here but we’re just worried that he’s going to get inside then the feathers will fly,"" said Jaromi. ""Because then we won’t be able to get him out but again we’re worried about the mess, he’s a nice good visitor but it’s time to go.""

Jaromi would like to see Turk go to a good home in the country but, for now, residents are enjoying his company while it lasts.

35,"Which Kitchener author has sold the most books? * Incorrect guesses have ranged from Edna Staebler (Schmecks) to David Morrell (Rambo); from David Chilton (Wealthy Barber) to Mabel Dunham (Trail of the Conestoga). The actual winner isn’t readily recognizable because only four early novels bore his real name — Kenneth Millar. His primary nom-de-plume is more familiar — Ross Macdonald. But his private eye’s name gives the game away — Lew Archer. Through 18 novels, numerous short stories, radio productions and several films (two starring Paul Newman as Lew Harper), Archer became the dominant private investigator during the late 1940s to mid-1970s And Archer’s roots curl back here to Kitchener. Biographies by Tom Nolan, Matthew Bruccoli, Paul Nelson and Kevin Avery cover Millar’s entire career. Each outlines the Kitchener years but Nolan devotes 40 pages to an exhaustive look at Ken’s Kitchener world ... and it’s not a pretty picture. Growing up with dysfunctional, separated parents, Millar (1915-1983) spent several periods in Kitchener, as well as California, Vancouver, Medicine Hat, Winnipeg and Wiarton. In 1920, Annie Moyer Miller brought young Ken to her mother’s house at 32 Brubacher, a dour, repressive environment that Ken evaded as much as possible. Not quite a stereotypical juvenile delinquent, Ken could be labelled a juvenile bookworm delinquent. He frequented pool halls, gambling rooms (yes, even in 1920s Kitchener) as much as bookstores and the Kitchener Public Library (KPL). The most famous story — perhaps apocryphal although I prefer to believe it — combines both sides of his addictions. One day at MacCallum’s billiard parlour/newsstand he discovered a hard-hitting crime novel by Dashiell Hammett. Later, he asked KPL’s Mabel Dunham why Hammett’s books were not stocked. They were, she said, but in a restricted area not accessible to the public. While Ken’s intellectual mind was outraged, his criminal mind was engaged. After closing, he snuck in, found KPL’s restricted area with authors such as Faulkner, Hemingway, Flaubert and Hammett and grabbed an armful. On the way to grandmother’s home, he symbolically dumped them into a sewer. For two years, Ken attended Kitchener Collegiate during which he contributed to the school yearbook, the Grumbler, as both author and literary editor. In 1931, his first published story “South Sea Soup Company” was a Conan Doyle send-up featuring “Herlock Sholmes.” In 1932, he was listed on the Grumbler’s editorial staff and in “Zuider Zee” introduced “Philo France,” to lampoon Philo Vance, a popular New York gumshoe. His final Grumbler story, “To the Damned Their Due,” featured an escaped murderer parachuting from a plane only to perish on hydro wires. After graduating, although motivated by teachers such as Cy Philp and Bill Archer, Ken had no immediate prospects so spent a year working on a farm. Fortunately for his future — and the future of literature — Ken’s feckless father died in May 1933 and his insurance policy bought Ken four years of college. During his sole year at Waterloo College, he contributed numerous articles to the school’s paper The Cord. Realizing that the small college’s faculty knew less than he did, Ken transferred to Western in London for a five-year course in history and English. Again, his knowledge of literature outpaced his professors. The day after graduating from Western, Ken and Kitchenerite Margaret Sturm married and one year later they had a daughter, Linda. Further studies at the University of Michigan led to his doctorate and eventual recognition as one of that university’s all-time outstanding graduate students. Ken and Margaret lived and wrote in California until they died in 1983 and 1994. Three times, they returned to hometown Kitchener, 1948, 1955 and 1971. Locally, only the Kitchener Public and University of Waterloo libraries have circulating copies of Nolan’s book but there are new and used copies on the internet where numerous sites also detail his private and public lives. Although he dropped his surname, it accompanied Ken’s writing career step-by-step: his wife Margaret (Sturm) Millar actually authored more mystery novels than her husband over a longer time, 1941 through 1986.

36,"REGINA -- Saskatchewan’s entomologist, James Tansey, is reminding residents to be on the lookout for an invasive insect that feeds on lilies.

The Red Lily Leaf Beetle arrived in Montreal in the 1940s, and spread through eastern Canada. It has been spotted in several locations in Saskatchewan in recent years, however Tansey said he hasn’t heard any reports this year.

The beetle - known for its bright red back - eats all parts of the lily plant.

“Pretty much all lilies are on the menu, including the Prairie Lily,” said Tansey.

Local gardening centre, Dutch Growers, said the insects could become a bigger threat in the future.

“It is in Alberta and it is in Manitoba. So, things that are around us tend to eventually make their way here,” said Rachelle Hofmeister with Dutch Growers.

Hofmeister said gardeners should regularly inspect their lilies and if they do see the beetle or its larvae, it’s best to just remove it.

“If you see these, you see damage on your lilies, just squish them with your finger and that should be an effective strategy,” said Tansey.

But wearing gloves is recommended, especially when removing the larvae.

“They do this kind of weird thing where they put a fecal shield overtop of their body, to sort of hide themselves from predators,” said Hofmeister.

You can also put diatomaceous earth around the base of the plant in early spring, which Hofmeister said will dehydrate and kill the beetle, but is safe for other helpful insects.",Sask. entomologist warns gardeners to watch for Red Lily Leaf Beetle,4,0.8375779756625729
39,"WINDSOR, ONT. -- A Windsor man returned home to a surprise celebration on Friday afternoon after spending 113 days in the hospital because of COVID-19.

Giuseppe Talerico, 67, was thankful to seeing over 60 of his friends and family lined up on his street with “welcome home” signs and balloons.

“It was the biggest surprise for me. I got a lot of friends, thank you everyone,” says Talerico.

Talerico’s battle against COVID-19 began on March 26, when he began having difficulty breathing, discoloration in his face, chest pressure and a loss of appetite.

An ambulance transported him to the Windsor Regional Hospital. Within 24 hours, he was rushed in to the ICU, intubated and put on life support.

“All we could do is pray and reach out to family and friends,” says his daughter, Eleonora Vitella. “As we could not come together physically, we virtually held masses and prayed the rosary with people from all over the world and rallied from all the support.”

The family’s faith was truly put to the test, as Talerico went from spending days, to over a month under intubation.

“Each passing day was taking a toll on his body, he had been intubated for a months' time, which normally max is 10-14 days. The ICU medical team needed to make a decision whether he could handle being extubated and survive,” says daughter Maria Calvaruso.

On April 24, the first glimmer of hope of appeared. Telerico opened his eyes as his loved ones watched on Facetime.

“It was a very emotional moment, we still had fears and because he was not out of the woods,” Vitella recalls.

On day 89, the family’s prayers were answered as Terlerico was released from Windsor Regional Hospital and sent to Hôtel-Dieu Grace Healthcare’s Rehabilitation Centre.

“We truly believe his love for his family and grandchildren kept him motivated to survive. Miracles are possible with love, prayers and faith from family and friends,” Calvaruso says.

After a total of 113 days, Talerico returned home, just in time to celebrate his grandson Leonardo’s 8 birthday on Saturday.

“A month ago he said Nonno you have to promise me you’d come one day before my birthday, and the wish came true,” says Talerico.",Windsor man receives homecoming surprise after 113 days of COVID-19 hospitalization,5,0.1859062658947177
41,"Nasra Gele calls her brother Abdinassir Abdille every single morning to check how he’s doing. The siblings have been separated for more than 20 years. Gele and Abdille, along with their parents, moved to the Daadab refugee complex in Kenya after fleeing their war-torn homeland, Somalia, in 1991. Gele eventually came to Halifax in 1997, but her family stayed behind. While she’s thought about her family members often throughout her time in Nova Scotia, the past few months have been especially difficult and their catch-up WhatsApp calls have become less and less lighthearted, according to Gele. Abdille’s asthma has become more threatening over the last two years, and with COVID-19 preventing puffers and medication from flowing to the Daadab refugee complex, Gele said she worries that her brother, too, will fall victim to the chronic disease. Asthma runs in their family and it claimed the lives of their aunt and grandfather. “Every morning I talk to them to see how he’s doing. Some days he’s OK, some days he’s getting worse, sometimes it’s really scary,” said Gele. “The situation is very, very hard now. Every night, my brother thinks (whether) he will die now or not. When he’s home and he’s sitting, really he cannot even breathe.” Abdille’s 14-year-old daughter Nasteeh, who similarly suffers from asthma, has also been on Gele’s mind lately. Gele said the father and daughter have hardly stepped foot outside in the last four months during the COVID-19 pandemic, given their immuno compromised state. United We Win Halifax, a private sponsorship group that met Gele through her translation and settlement support services for newcomers in Nova Scotia, has launched a GoFundMe campaign to raise money to sponsor and bring Abdille, his wife and seven of their children who are under 18, to Halifax. “We were really struck partly by how much Nasra was doing in the community, but also trying to support her brother (in Kenya), sending money to him to buy food and medication,” said Dave Aalders, a member of United We Win Halifax. Aalders said Gele told him about the asthma attacks her brother would have where he “didn’t know (if) he was going to live” and the limited health care and access to medication at the refugee complex. That prompted the group to lend a hand. “We want to be able to help,” he said. “And also the fact that (Abdille) has been (at the refugee camp) since the early ‘90s and the world sort of tends to forget about some refugees, that bothered us as well, that there are folks that have been there for that long and haven’t had a chance to get out.” The group’s GoFundMe fundraising goal is $10,000, but that will only cover a portion of the $30,000 that is required to bring a refugee family the size of the Abdille family to Canada and support them for one year, according to Aalders. They have also set up accounts with some bottle depots in Halifax, allowing community members to exchange their bottles and have the money from that exchange go directly toward an account in the United We Win Halifax’s name to help sponsor the Abdille family. “The sooner we can get the money raised, the sooner we can (complete) the application and get things rolling,” said Aalders, adding they want to sponsor other refugees, seeing how “the need is so great.” Aalders acknowledged that the federal government has put its refugee resettlement programs on hold during the pandemic, but said he hopes they will be able to bring the Abdille family to Canada soon as possible. “They’ll be able to (live) in a healthier environment and not have to worry about (Abdille) dying from not being able to breathe or (Nasteeh),” he said. ‘I would be really happy to see my family’ With the poor housing conditions, dust and extreme heat at the Daadab refugee complex, Gele said she’s concerned the respiratory conditions afflicting her brother and niece will only worsen, making them more susceptible to COVID-19. Gele had asthma herself, but recovered from the disease a year after arriving in Halifax. Living here, she said she’s grateful to have access to an emergency room or a puffer if ever she experiences an asthma attack, but recognizes her family is not so lucky. Aalders said this is concerning, considering how the virus “could spread like wildfire” in a typically overcrowded refugee camp. Ultimately, Gele said she wants her family to be able to live in “good health,” as she hopes for all people, and reunite with them in Halifax. “For 25 years, I haven’t seen my parents or my brother or my family. I have seven children and my children have never seen their uncle or my parents, so I would be really happy to see my family,” she said. “I want to say thank you so much to anyone supporting my family.” Aalders said people can contact United We Win Halifax at unitedwewinhfx@gmail.com for more information about sponsoring the Abdille family or to pitch in for the bottle exchange initiative.","‘Situation is very, very hard’: Group looks to sponsor family in Kenyan refugee camp",9,0.8599465287952899
42,"TORONTO -- A small patty shop in Scarborough is experiencing a wave of newfound fame after Toronto’s most famous artist gave his stamp of approval.

Patty Stop, located near Port Union Road and Lawrence Avenue East, got a highly coveted shout out from Drake on Instagram earlier this week. The rapper posted a photo of one of the shop’s stuffed patties to his 68.8 million followers and the response that followed was incredible, according to co-owner Freddy Gyebi.

“In terms of social media, my followers on my Instagram have been skyrocketing,” Gyebi told CTV News Toronto. “My views have been skyrocketing.”

Gyebi says he’s been friends with Drake for quite some time now, but admits he didn’t actually know the rap superstar would take to Instagram to show his support.

“A couple weeks back he was like ‘yo, I need to try one of your stuffed patties,” Gyebi said.

So the restaurateur made his way to Drake’s mega-mansion on The Bridle Path for a personal patty party.

“Set up the whole shebang, in terms of the lettuce, the tomatoes. I made the stuffed patty for him, he had it, he liked it. Then he had another one, said he liked it. And I didn’t know he was going to post it, I didn’t even know he posted it until one of my friends was like ‘yo he posted it.’”

The post that followed on Monday evening was simple, a stuffed patty on a countertop, tagged @pattystopinc with a head exploding emoji, the ultimate sign of respect.

According to Gyebi, the interest that came next has been immense and is more than welcome following a forced closure due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

“We had to shut down,” Gyebi explains. “COVID has definitely taken a toll on the business, but we’re still here, we’re still able to sell our patties to the community.”

In the meantime, the owners started a GoFundMe campaign in an effort to provide food to Toronto’s front-line workers with a goal of serving up 300 meals a week.

And while Gyebi admits that he doesn’t have a culinary background, he and his co-owner Jason Cheddie agree that their product is different because of what goes into it.

“It’s definitely the love we put into it. We put a lot of quality ingredients into our patties. It’s just not your average patty,” Cheddie said. “Everything is homemade. Straight original from our recipes.”

Drake understands that effort, according to Gyebi, and says that’s why an endorsement from the city’s biggest artist is so significant.

“To me, it means a lot. It just shows that, you know, he believes in being Torontonian. He wouldn’t do it if he didn’t like it, that’s the type of person he is,” Gyebi said.

“He’s doing it because he actually likes the product and he believes it in, you know.”

43,"Space, the final fragrance.

If you've ever wondered what space smells like, a new perfume may answer that for you. A Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign was recently launched for a new fragrance called Eau de Space to bring the smell of outer space back down to Earth.

The fragrance was developed by Steve Pearce, according to Eau de Space product manager Matt Richmond. Pearce is a chemist and the founder of Omega Ingredients, a company focused on the ""creation of the highest quality, provenance driven, natural flavours and ingredients for the food and beverage industry,"" its website says.

Pearce was originally contracted by NASA to recreate the smell in 2008 after he worked on a scent exhibition for which he recreated the smell of the inside of the Mir Space Station, Pearce told CNN.

Using notes from astronauts who described space smelling like ozone, hot metal and fried steak, Pearce used his knowledge of flavour and fragrance chemistry to produce combinations matching those descriptions, he said.

It took Pearce a few weeks to gather the ""right aroma chemicals"" to try out a few ideas before arriving at something he found satisfactory, he said.

The scent was created to help astronauts train before launching in orbit, and it was part of NASA's goal of eliminating any potential surprises astronauts might encounter or experience in space, according to the Kickstarter.

""It's kind of like a smell from a gun, right after you fire the shot,"" Peggy Whitson, an astronaut and former resident of the International Space Station, told CNN in a 2002 interview about the smell of space. ""I think it kind of has almost a bitter kind of smell in addition to being smoky and burned.""

Richmond said that he has struggled to describe how the fragrance smells, adding, ""Astronauts describe the smell as a mix of gunpowder, seared steak, raspberries and rum.""

The company's main goal with Eau de Space is to increase interest in STEM learning for K-12 students through what Richmond called ""experiential education."" He hopes that Eau de Space will start the discussion, with parents, teachers and scientists taking it from there.

Richmond revealed that they are looking into releasing a fragrance called Smell of the Moon based on the excitement around Eau de Space.",Eau de Space brings the scent of outer space down to Earth,4,0.3326951853601291
44,"In 2008, Mountain Lake, made famous by the 1987 film ""Dirty Dancing,"" dried up and remained that way for over a decade. But this summer, it's starting to fill back up, astonishing both locals and visitors.

Mountain Lake Lodge is a mecca for true ""Dirty Dancing"" fans who travel to the Pembroke, Virginia, resort to see the various landmarks featured in the film. There's the cabin that ""Baby"" and her family stayed in and the gazebo where guests took dance lessons.

But the lake where Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey practiced their famous lift is not what it used to be. The lake's water level first dropped in 1999 but came back in 2003. In 2006, it dropped again and by 2008, it went completely dry, according to The Roanoke Times.

In recent weeks, however, after a wet spring, employees noticed that it was filling back up.

""It's about a third full right now and it seems to be holding,"" Mountain Lake Lodge's General Manager Heidi Stone told CNN.

""It's very exciting,"" Stone added. ""The guests get very excited because for so many years it's been dry and looked more like a meadow. It's the prettiest when it's filled with water.""

According to scientists, this phenomenon of the lake draining and filling back up makes Mountain Lake one of a kind.

""The mountain lake basin is absolutely unique, not only in Appalachia but in the entire world,"" Roanoke College professor Jon Cawley said in a video posted on the lodge's website.

Cawley explains that after studying the lakebed, he and other scientists found that the lake hits a major low about every 400 years.

""When the lake drains -- when it actually empties out -- it is cleaning itself by moving sediment that has accrued in the bottom of the lake down through that rather complex plumbing system to actually make the lake bigger, deeper, and to keep it clean,"" Cawley said in the video.

Fans will have to wait to see if the lake will fill up completely, but Stone said even without the lake, there's other activities at the lodge to enjoy such as a ""Dirty Dancing""-themed weekend package that includes a scavenger hunt, trivia, and obviously a dance party.",Dirty Dancing' lake mysteriously filling up with water 12 years after it dried up,4,0.7214844075832684
45,"HALIFAX -- Leeann Galloway moved to Toronto in January, soon after she learned she was put on the list for a double-lung transplant. When she first moved, she knew there would be a wait, but, like the rest of the world, she had no idea COVID-19 was coming.

Once the pandemic hit in March, transplants were put on hold, and Galloway's fate was left up in the air.

Pandemic restrictions and her condition meant she couldn't go anywhere. Her husband had already left work, and their home in North River, N.S., behind to be with her.

That means the Galloways have been paying the bills at home and in Toronto.

""We've been living on one income right now,"" she says. ""The government does cover just the rent cost only, everything else is out of pocket.""

Galloway says she and her husband managed to find a small house to rent in Scarborough. But they recently had problems with their water system back home, flooding the basement.

​""It's been a stressful, long seven months,"" says Galloway. ""We're hoping it ends soon.""

In the meantime, Galloway walks around their rental tethered to an oxygen machine.

Transplants recently resumed in May, but now she needs to be matched with a new set of lungs. Even when that happens, there's no guarantee the transplant will happen right away.

""Sometimes people get two or three false calls before they get the right lungs,"" she says.

According to the Lung Association of Nova Scotia, there are eight people from Nova Scotia who are in Toronto waiting for lung transplants, and one person from Prince Edward Island. There are also nine Nova Scotians and one person from P.E.I. on the list, waiting to get a call to move to Toronto.

Michelle Donaldson, communications manager with the provincial Lung Association, says the pandemic made an already stressful time even more difficult for people who are waiting.

""I think it creates a lot of stress and also those people are waiting for a lifesaving procedure, so can they afford to wait?"" she says. ""That was one of the things that was a big concern amidst the pandemic.""

The waiting and worrying is something Galloway is all too familiar with, after her father had a double-lung transplant himself more than a decade ago.

He had a rare blood protein disorder known as Alpha-1 antitrypsin disease, which is considered hereditary. He died two years after his procedure at the age of 54.

Galloway, who is 48 years old, says doctors have tested her for the disease, but so far those tests have come back negative.

""But they think I have something out there that they're not sure of, the way I'm going downhill so fast, and I'm so young.""

In the meantime, Galloway says the wait is both an emotional and financial strain.

Friends and family back in North River have been pitching in to help, holding fundraisers and raffles to raise money to help the Galloways pay their expenses.

An online fundraising campaign has also been launched as part of those efforts.

Galloway says total strangers have also donated, including one woman who made a contribution in memory of her son, who died in a car accident and was an organ donor.

Most of all, Galloway misses home, and the daughter and granddaughter she can't see right now except over video chats.

She hopes all the waiting will eventually lead to one thing.

""To get the lungs to come home,"" she says. ""To get better, just to get that call, is my hope.""",N.S. woman has waited in Toronto seven months and counting for double-lung transplant,8,0.7111917696952796
46,"VANCOUVER -- Vancouverites looking up to the night skies recently may have spotted a rare astronomical treat and the spectacle is expected to continue for a little longer.

Comet NEOWISE had been visible to the naked eye over the past several days, making a once-in-a-lifetime appearance before disappearing for thousands of years.

Stargazers around the world have shared their sightings of the comet online and astronomer Rachel Wang from Vancouver's H.R. MacMillan Space Centre says locals might still be able to catch a glimpse before the comet fades.

""You want to go sooner rather than later because it is dimming in brightness,"" Wang said on CTV Morning Live Thursday, adding that the best time to see the comet is about an hour after sunset.

The ""sweet spot,"" she said, is about 10:15 p.m.

""You want to look in the north-northwestern direction,"" she said. ""If you can bring binoculars I would highly recommend doing so.""

Getting away from light pollution is also key, Wang said.

Wang said it's believed the comet came from the Oort Cloud, which is a huge cloud surrounding the solar system.

""It's very rare that we have a comet pass so close to Earth, so close that we're able to see it and also that it maintains its brightness,"" she said.

Wang said there was another comet that was expected to pass close to Earth last December, but it disintegrated before it could be seen.

Anyone eager to see Comet NEOWISE shouldn't wait too long.

""You really want to go as soon as possible because it's dimming in brightness every single day,"" Wang said.

47,"TORONTO -- A six-year-old Wyoming boy is being hailed as a hero by his family after he protected his little sister from a dog attack and ended up needing 90 stitches to his face.

Bridger Walker's aunt, Nikki Walker, shared details of the attack on Instagram. She wrote on July 9 that Bridger saw the dog approach his sister and deliberately stood in front of her. The dog attacked Bridger instead, biting the side of the boy’s face and head, the aunt said.

""My nephew is a hero who saved his little sister from an attacking dog. He, himself, took on the attack so that the dog wouldn't get his sister,"" the Instagram caption read.

Despite being injured, Nikki said Bridger grabbed his sister's hand and ran with her ""to keep her safe.""

Nikki's Instagram post included photos of the siblings and Bridger following the attack, with bruises and multiple stitches across his face.

Nikki said that when she asked Bridger why he stepped in front of the dog, he told her that ""If someone was going to die, I thought it should be me.""

""We love our brave boy,"" she wrote. As of Wednesday afternoon, the post has received more than half a million likes.

Nikki said Bridger was treated by a ""skilled plastic surgeon"" following the attack and is now recovering at home.

""His wounds are looking so much better! He’s in great spirits, and his awesome personality is intact,"" Nikki said in an update to her post. ""He can’t smile too widely yet but he was grinning as I read some of your comments to him.""

Nikki also updated concerned users with information regarding the dog involved in the attack.

""The dog's owners are really great people who have been nothing but kind to Bridger and his family. We feel no resentment toward them at all, and -- if anything -- there's only been an increase of love between our families as a result of this incident,"" she wrote.

While some social media users have been calling for Nikki to start a GoFundMe page to help with the boy's recovery, she said those interested can instead direct donations to Mission 22, a non-profit geared towards preventing suicides among former service members, or the Wounded Warrior Project, a group dedicated to helping injured American military veterans.

Nikki added that those wanting to support Bridger can send him photos of ""cool rocks"" as he is ""a huge fan of science, especially geology.""

""Let's go on a rock hunt! As you're out and about, be sure to take pictures of any cool rocks that you see. Be sure to tell him what state or country the rocks are in. Thank you again for all the love. #BridgerStrong,"" Nikki wrote in another post.

Nikki is asking social media users to share Bridger's story in hopes of receiving a shout out from a Marvel superhero actor so they can hear about ""this latest hero who joined their ranks.""

Hulk actor Mark Ruffalo responded in a comment saying, ""People who put the well beings of others in front of themselves are the most heroic and thoughtful people I know. I truly respect and admire your courage and your heart.""

""Real courage isn't dominating people or fighting against people or walking around like a tough guy. Real courage is knowing what is right to do and doing it even when it might end up hurting you somehow,"" he added.

Despite being part of the DC Comics universe, Anne Hathaway, who played Catwoman in ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" dedicated an Instagram post to Bridger.

A man has turned heads online after plucking an apparently drowning baby eagle from the water in Windermere, B.C. on July 4, 2020. (Brett Bacon/Instagram)

Brett Bacon says he was just trying to prove to his son that he’s cool.

The father from Calgary is turning heads online after saving a baby eagle from drowning in the middle of a lake in Windermere, roughly 125 kilometres north of Cranbrook.

The shocking incident happened on July 4, according to a video posted by Bacon on July 4.

The video – which has been viewed 10,000 times as of Friday afternoon – shows Bacon hanging over the side of the boat trying to pull the eagle from the water. After grabbing it, the bird attempts to fly away a few times but appears to be caught on Bacon’s shirt.

Bacon’s infant son is seen lying safely on a seat nearby.

In an interview with the New York Post, the father said he brought the eagle to dry land where it flew away and has since been taken to a wildlife rehabilitation facility.

Black Press Media has reached out to nearby conservation societies for an update on the eagle.

Eagles are known to be fairly good swimmers and have thick down feathers which allow for them to float, according to biologists. However, occassionally juvenile or older eagles can drown if they’re too far from shore or get caught on something.

54,"DHAKA, Bangladesh - Heavy flooding is worsening in parts of Bangladesh, with over 1 million villagers marooned or leaving their homes for higher ground along with their cattle and other belongings, officials and volunteers said Tuesday. Water levels at major rivers were rising Tuesday at around two dozen points in 20 districts. Many new areas in northern, northeastern and central Bangladesh have been affected over last 24 hours, Arifuzzman Bhuiyan, an executive engineer with the Water Development Board, said by phone. Bangladesh has 64 districts. “The situation is worsening,“ he said. “The worst thing is that the floods are getting prolonged this year, which is a bad sign.” Bhuiyan said heavy rainfall and rushing waters from upstream India were the main reasons for the floods in the delta nation of 160 million people, which receives monsoon rains between June and October every year, often leading to flooding. The floods started late last month, and after briefly easing continued to worsen, affecting many new areas, destroying crops and driving people from their homes in several impoverished regions. Bangladesh is crisscrossed by 230 rivers, including 53 shared with India. In the northern district of Kurigram, one of the worst-hit areas, thousands of villagers have moved from their homes to higher ground since the weekend, bringing along their cattle and other belongings, said Mizanur Rahman Soikat, project co-ordinator with the Bidyanondo Foundation, a local charity. The foundation has been distributing both cooked and dry food to the flood-affected villagers, many of whom have lost their crops and livelihood. Soikat said that over the last few weeks, the charity has distributed food to some 135,000 people in Kurigram, while the government’s relief office was also providing food, cash and cattle food. “Over last two days, the situation has deteriorated and many villages went underwater in the district,“ he said by phone. “I have seen thousands taking shelter.” The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said in a statement Monday that more than a million Bangladeshis have been marooned by the floods, with the worst of it happening since the weekend. “Thousands of people are expected to leave their homes throughout the beginning of this week to seek shelter in higher ground as the Water Development Board warned that the onrush of water from upstream would further intensify,” the statement said. A.T.M. Akhteruzzman, a relief and rehabilitation officer in the northern district of Rangpur, said about 50,000 people who live along the Teesta River basin have been marooned. “Waters are coming from India, while heavy rainfalls in the region are causing havoc,” he said. “We are trying to do our best to stand by the people, as we have already provided more than 300 tons of rice, cattle food, baby food and a good amount of cash. Our relief operations will continue.“",Over 1 million marooned in Bangladesh as floods worsen,9,0.5052838205796004
56,"Canuck Place volunteer Helene Robillard knows just how to make Canuck Place child Levi smile, as they stroll through the beautiful grounds at Dave Lede House in Abbotsford.

Over the last three years, Canuck Place volunteer Helene Robillard has spent many memorable hours at Abbotsford’s Dave Lede House.

With a ready smile and keen willingness to help, Helene has contributed more than 730 volunteer hours to the children’s hospice since September 2017, during regular afternoon shifts and at many major Canuck Place events.

“Helene’s attention to detail and efficiency makes her an invaluable volunteer,” says Deborah, a Dave Lede House counsellor. “Whatever endeavour she’s supporting is enriched by her engaging personality and ‘can do’ spirit. I’m so grateful she’s a part of our CPCH volunteer squad.”

When volunteering in-house, Helene works directly with children and families, providing practical, emotional and social support. Always busy, you’ll often find her baking up a batch of cookies, deep-cleaning toys when the children are napping or mentoring new volunteers.

“Helene connects with every child. She takes the time to learn what brings joy to each child, what makes them laugh. She knows their heart, and openly shares hers with them,” says Karen, a registered nurse.

Helene is one of hundreds of volunteers who make the work Canuck Place undertakes possible.

“We love our volunteers, and can’t say enough about how much we appreciate their hard work and endless support they provide to children, families and staff,” says Jessica Tremblay, Director Volunteer and Support Services. “Our volunteers are part of the very fabric of Canuck Place, helping make it the trusted and respected pediatric palliative care organization it is today.”

As a healing environment to ease suffering and help navigate grief and loss, Canuck Place provides pediatric palliative care for children and families right here in the Fraser Valley and across BC & Yukon. Their children are the most medically complex and ill children in the province. This past year alone, more than 765 children with life-threatening illnesses and families were supported through inpatient and outpatient care in the hospice, in-home, and in-hospital.

Bringing huge hearts and a willingness to do whatever is needed, Canuck Place volunteers at Abbotsford’s Dave Lede House and Vancouver’s Glen Brae hospice contribute over 24,000 hours each year – equivalent to the cost of hiring 12 full-time staff! Canuck Place wouldn’t be the same without them.

The motivation to give; the inspiration to grow

As valued members of the Canuck Place team, volunteers are an integral force behind the spirit of compassion and care that defines the children’s hospice.

Each week, approximately 100 volunteers provide essential support throughout Canuck Place – everything from playing with children, answering phones and stuffing mail to tending gardens, changing light bulbs and baking cookies.

57,"TORONTO -- As the now-famed Comet NEOWISE continues to zip through the inner solar system to the delight of stargazers around the world, new photos show how the northern lights provided a breathtaking backdrop for the comet in Canada in recent days.

Liron Gertsman, a photographer and self-described “astronomy enthusiast” based in Vancouver, recently captured the speeding ball of ice and dust on two separate occasions.

The first night on July 12, Gertsman photographed the comet over English Bay in Vancouver for what he described as a “very ‘Vancouver’ landscape” image featuring the spectacle.

The next night, the 19-year-old photographer captured Comet NEOWISE again over Harrison Lake, located a short distance from Vancouver, but this time there was an extra special backdrop.

“I was treated to what might be a once in a lifetime event; the Aurora Borealis (Northern Lights) showed up, ‘photobombing’ my comet shot,” Gertsman said in an email to CTVNews.ca on Wednesday. “For about 30 minutes, the Aurora was visible to the naked eye, a very rare event at this latitude of just 49 degrees north.”

While the colours were hard to see, Gertsman said, the pillars of the Aurora Borealis were “clearly visible dancing across the northern sky.”

In order to enhance the photos’ vividness, Gertsman explained that he did some basic colour correction and adjusted the exposure, brightness, and contrast. He said the photos were taken using long exposures and star tracking, which he was able to do with a special tracking mount that compensates for the motion of the Earth and prevents “star trails” in these types of photos of the night sky.

“The result is more detail and colours than the naked eye can see, but all the data is captured in-camera,” he said. “This is a pretty standard workflow for much of the night sky pictures seen online (including most images you’ll see organizations like NASA post), especially those used for scientific purposes, as they help to show more detail.”

Speaking of NASA, the agency also shared a photo of the comet – also known as C/2020 F3 – as it soared above western Manitoba on Tuesday.

In that photo, taken by Donna Lach, the comet can be seen speeding across the night-filled sky with ribbons of colour from the Aurora Borealis just beneath it.

“I fought off mosquitoes as I waited for the never-ending dusk to show me what was in the sky. Finally, at about 11:30 p.m. CDT, the aurora and comet were both appearing, and I could see it was going to be epic,” she told NASA. “The large, thick band of aurora soon started to dance, showing brilliant blues and purples looking to the west.”

For anyone hoping to catch a glimpse of the comet for themselves, NASA has provided some tips on how to spot it in the night sky before it disappears in the coming weeks for another 6,800 years.",Northern lights 'photobomb' images of Comet NEOWISE over Canada,4,0.24273997354306764
60,"Wedged between the Coast Mountains and the Rockies, BC’s interior puts you at a crossroads of sweeping ranchlands, grassy vistas, and golden plateaus. And that’s just the landscape. There is a rich history here, too, from the Indigenous peoples whose stories, traditions, and stewardship of the land span millennia, to the ranchers, gold prospectors, and adventurers who braved unknown wilderness to traverse rough terrain and uncharted waterways.

Challenge yourself to try something new and experience some of BC’s history this summer through guest ranch stays, cultural tours, museum visits, guided trips into the backcountry, and more.

Drive Through Historic Gold Rush Country

Follow in the footsteps of 1860s Gold Rush prospectors and see how the mighty Fraser River shaped life in these parts. From Kamloops, head west toward Lillooet and “Mile 0” of the historic Cariboo Wagon Road. Visit sites ranging from preserved road houses to ghost towns and connect with locals in small towns along the way. Travel as far as Barkerville Historic Town, which brings this era to life with a restored townsite and costumed interpreters, and en route discover a vital Indigenous culture that dates back thousands of years.

The quintessential guest ranch experience awaits in the Cariboo and Chilcotin. Blake Jorgenson photo.

Stay at a Guest Ranch

If you’ve dreamed of long trail rides through peaceful pastures or into meadows bursting with wildflowers, consider a stay at one of BC’s many guest ranches, most of which are found in the Cariboo and Chilcotin. The quintessential guest ranch experience is, of course, riding the range, but when you need a break from the saddle, the possibilities are many. Whether you’re looking for a true cowboy experience (think: corralling livestock or mucking out stalls) or something a little less rugged (a day at the onsite spa, anyone?), you’ll find freedom and adventure in the wide-open spaces.

Cast a line in calm lakes and fast-moving rivers, hike into the mountains for expansive views, or stick close to the ranch – and to the cowboy theme – with wagon rides, lasso throwing, and, of course, tall tales around a campfire under a clear, starry sky.

Find Adventure in the Wild

With wide-open spaces come wide-open opportunities for adventure. The lakes and rivers of BC’s interior beckon with more places to fish than you can experience in a lifetime. There are calm waters for paddling – including multi-day wilderness canoe routes – and there are stretches of thrilling whitewater for adrenaline junkies. You can fly into the backcountry for some hardcore hiking and mountain biking from an alpine basecamp or saddle up for an off-the-grid horse-packing trip. Whichever option you choose, keep your camera close as you’re very likely to spot some of BC’s four-legged residents along the way.

61,"A Black man dies slowly, agonizingly, a knee lodged firmly on his neck. And in the seismic moment after George Floyd’s death in police custody, North American cities have erupted with the kind of mass protests unseen since the civil rights movement of the ’60s. Kitchener, in true Canadian fashion, staged a kinder, gentler rally of its own last week, drawing thousands of masked protesters to march peacefully along city streets, throwing garbage into conveniently located bins on the sidewalk. But what happens when the flames die down, public interest wanes and everyone goes back to their tedious, pandemic-confined lives?  Does racism become a thing of the past? Or does everyone tire of the subject and move on to the next social-media outrage? Waterloo Region is lucky to have a cache of articulate, passionate activists with lived experience willing to speak truth to power. But there’s sadness, frustration — often palpable — and impatience with those who don’t “get” that anti-Black racism isn’t some new issue that just emerged in the last two weeks. In today’s spotlight: Christopher Taylor, the author/Black history prof recently named University of Waterloo’s Anti-Black Racism Adviser; and Ruth Cameron, community leader/doctoral student/executive director of the AIDS Committee of Cambridge, Kitchener, Waterloo and Area. Their comments below are scathing, blunt and, in some cases, darkly ironic, because after 400 years of struggle, gallows humour may be the only refuge. On a personal level, how are you two holding up? Cameron: I’m a queer Black woman who’s a mother and a leader. I’m seen as a resource, so I have to make sure I focus on radical self-care. We’re trying to live while we’re in active grief. Taylor: I’m getting a lot of messages from concerned white folks. I might just start resorting to cutting and pasting a Black-faced smiling emoji. Searing images of burned out storefronts, militant police lines and tear gassed protesters have plunged U.S. cities into chaos and sparked protests in Canada. Is this a pressure valve being released or just more racial tension you didn’t ask for? Taylor: Black folks are asking for life and basic human rights and the response is to quell it with state controlled violence, which is the language of white supremacy. Cameron: Yo, it’s full on fascism, folks. Stay ready. Also, take a very close look at what’s happening in political spheres close to home. Not just every four years, but All. The. Time. I want to remind people that the Montreal police used tear gas on people (last) week, in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Is this a bellwether “MeToo” moment in which the world changes in an instant, or one in a long line of momentary blips that will ultimately achieve nothing? Taylor: From the conversations I’m hearing, and what I’m seeing on social and mainstream media, folks are not about real change. They’re about feeding that guilt hunger through Black pain. So it’s going to be a lot of tears, then by Canada Day weekend — if things “open-up” a bit more — it’s going to be business as usual. White folks at the cottage in their Birkenstocks.  You’ve seen this scenario play out before.  Taylor: People like to go back to the 1960s, but conveniently like to forget Ferguson (where police shot an unarmed Black teenager) six years ago. Or Rodney King or the Yonge St. uprising in 1992. White collective memory when it comes to race and racism is like a goldfish trying to remember where it parked the car. Cameron: Black people are killed every day by systemic anti-Black racism. It’s not rare. It’s a constant backdrop in Black lives.  So why has Floyd’s death sparked such a prolonged and heated response? Taylor: Because we’re in a global pandemic with a U.S. government that would do anything to distract the masses from the fact they have the highest positive case load in the world and by far the most deaths.  So it’s the intersection of Donald Trump, COVID-19, warm weather, 400 years of racism and one Black death too many?  Taylor: Folks are now paying attention because they have nothing else to do. They got tired of baking and Instagram fitness challenges. I get the cynicism, but am I wrong in saying this time feels different? Cameron: What differs now is the tone of our calls to action. The young people I mentor and work with aren’t interested in incremental change. This is no call for reform. We want completely different ways of doing things. If the system you’ve created is hurting me, I’m not going to say “harm me just a little less.” I want it to end. Black people are rising up to claim our humanity. Christopher, you described Floyd’s death as a modern-day lynching. Taylor: What a lot of folks fail to realize is that lynching in the U.S. and Canada was a spectacle. Just like how we would go to the movies, white folks would go and see that n***** swinging off a tree like Strange Fruit. They would even take pieces off the deceased human as a souvenir. So when white folks watch the video of a Black man being killed, they really need to ask why? Might be to feed their curiosity, blood lust, guilt. Whatever it is, it ends up being a form of entertainment. And for you? Taylor: I don’t watch the videos. Seeing this Black man getting killed is a mirror to my own mortality. What about Regis Korchinski-Paquet, the Afro-Indigenous woman who fell 24 storeys to her death in the presence of Toronto police? Cameron: Her body was left out for six hours before her remains were taken away. George Floyd was slowly murdered on camera for nine minutes by a police officer who casually kept his hands in his pockets. The manner in which Black people are killed and our remains displayed is an intentional message that we are disposable.  I’m parroting a refrain from the chattering class: surely morally superior Canada is above all this. Taylor: Canada just loves to point the finger at the U.S. Meanwhile, it allows us to change the channel on the fact our government has failed its own — white — citizens. How can we expect white folks to care about Black people when they don’t even care about their own parents and grandparents dying/murdered in long-term care homes? Where were those protests? How effective has the media been in cutting through the hype? Taylor: White media should be asking white police officers and politicians why they think it’s OK to defend the killing of a Black man. They should be asking white folks about white supremacy and not how they feel about Black people. Cameron: I’m aware how hard individual journalists have to fight with editors to capitalize the ‘B’ in Black, to frame our issues as “systemic” versus individual isolated events, to ask hard questions instead of “Hey Ruth, how is this stuff making you feel?” I’m grateful for that. But mainstream media has a lot of catching up to do, to communicate where Black communities are now. Incremental change is not OK.  White liberals are outraged by Floyd’s death, pledging solidarity and support on social media. Given the lack of historic follow-through, there’s a stench of hypocrisy. Taylor: I’m all for raising awareness. I think that’s a real key in any kind of change movement. But let’s be real for a second: when was the last time a hashtag prevented a murder or an assault? Or impacted the climate we live in? Are sexual assaults at zero on university campuses after the #MeToo movement? Cameron: There is absolutely NO point in making any statements unless they contain a clearly defined commitment to an action. Black cultures are all about accountability. I also hear grumbling from older white men about what they perceive as an angry, resentful tone when marginalized voices take the podium. They want a more “nuanced” conversation.  Taylor: I think they need to go sit in the back of the class, shut up and listen. They take up too much space. Did I provide enough “nuance” or did I just fall in the trap of the indignant and “angry Black man?” Cameron: “Civility” and “nuance” are strategies used by some white people to deflect when Black people express that we’re living in constant harm. Taylor: What these older white men or SWAMs — Straight White Able-Bodied Men — fail to realize is that when they speak up and ask for a “fairer” or more “nuanced” conversation, they actually mean that they want the conversation to fall within parameters they control, that they dictate, that fall under their terms and in language they understand. What can all the self-professed allies who have suddenly popped out of the woodwork do to make a difference? Taylor: There’s no blueprint for white folks to follow. It’s like teaching a lion to be a vegan. If there’s one thing I would suggest, it’s to understand that this s*** happens every day. Black bodies are being killed and there’s no hashtag or protest. Just because it’s not popping up on your social media feed — your echo chamber of a fabricated reality — doesn’t mean it’s not happening all the time. Cameron: Donate to organizations that are Black-led and serve Black people. Hire multiple Black people, rather than individual tokens. Interrupt racism and amplify Black decision-making leadership within your organizations. Stop consolidating power and hoarding resources. Share and hand over. Even in Waterloo Region, a serenely insulated multicultural nirvana? Taylor: We don’t live in a vacuum. We wake up for the “sensational deaths,” but anti-Black racism permeates all facets of society. Black kids being followed in stores; not being called on in class; the liberal use of the ‘N-word’ by white folks; the co-opting of Black voices for political gain. These are all functions of the same system that killed George Floyd. Cameron: Black people in Waterloo Region are subjected to targeted policing surveillance in neighbourhoods like Chandler-Mowat and Kingsdale, the school resource officer program and the Community Outreach Program (COPs). This must end now, and those financial resources must be given to the Black community to administer. These programs are run by “allies,” are they not? Taylor: I’m always wary of institutions that co-opt the language of the oppressed, stand as “allies,” but actually and deliberately choose not to make change. The FBI knew that folks wanted to kill Malcolm X, and when they would do it, but they didn’t stop them.

65,"TORONTO -- The anti-Semitic hashtag 'JewishPrivilege' was trending on Twitter Monday after Jewish people took it over to share their experiences of discrimination, with one expert saying such hatred is still 'alive and well' in Canada today.

According to Jewish News, the trend first started Sunday night when Israeli writer and activist Hen Mazzig shared his family's experience with anti-Semitism after others used the hashtag to accuse Jewish people of being ""privileged.""

""#JewishPrivilege is when my grandparents were violently forced out of Iraq and Tunisia for being Jewish with only the clothes to their back. Along with 850,000 other MENA [Middle East and North Africa] Jews they arrived to Israel with nothing, only spoke Arabic, and lived in a tent/tin shack for years,"" Mazzig tweeted.

""I want all my Jewish followers to share the 'Jewish Privilege' them and their families experienced.""

Noah Shack, vice president of the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs (CIJA), told CTVNews.ca that #JewishPrivilege has, for years, existed as an anti-Semitic hashtag used primarily by conspiracy theorists.

""A lot of these tropes are well known about Jews controlling media and government, and the economy and unfortunately, a lot of these conspiracy theories have ended in the past with violence,"" Shack told CTVNews.ca in a phone interview on Monday.

""We're seeing a lot of traction on the hashtag now because Jewish people have sort of taken it over to discuss those experiences of persecution that have come about as a result of anti-Semitism, not just as something in the past but of course something that's very much alive and well today.""

After Mazzig's tweet, many others joined in on the conversation including stand-up comedian Sarah Silverman who said she experienced other children ""throwing pennies at me on the bus"" and had ""pastors in Florida calling for my death and telling their congregation that knocking my teeth out and killing me would be God’s work.""

Comedian David Baddiel tweeted that ""Jews don't always feel white, if by white you mean, to put it bluntly, safe."" Baddiel explained that he was just 12-years-old when he overheard a new teacher call him a 'Jew' and others agreed. He added that ""this is without getting into most of my mum’s family being murdered.""

Dov Hikind, founder of the campaigning organization Americans Against Antisemitism, also used the hashtag to tweet: ""I had the #JewishPrivilege of growing up without grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins because my parents’ friends were nearly entirely wiped out by Hitler.""

The hashtag has been used more than 100,000 times on Twitter as of Monday afternoon, trending in the U.S., Israel, the U.K. and Canada.

Shack said anti-Semitism is ""not just a relic of the past"" and that countries such as Canada, the U.S. and the U.K. are seeing a rise in discrimination against Jewish people.

""I am enjoying a life in Canada today, because a couple of generations ago somebody had the good fortune to be able to flee murderous persecution,"" Shack explained. ""Despite the fact that we live in such a wonderful open diverse and vibrant democracy here in Canada, I can't help but worry whether or not my children will be the next generation that's forced to flee.""

While Jewish people are using the hashtag to bring awareness to discrimination, a number of organizations expressed concerns online that hashtag is drawing attention to those tweeting anti-Semitic comments.

Danny Stone, the CEO of the Antisemitism Policy Trust, tweeted ""That #JewishPrivilege is trending makes me feel sick. It may not be a hate term but Twitter should know what this does to communities.""

The Campaign Against Antisemitism (CAAS) also criticized Twitter for not taking action to curb anti-Semitism on the platform, claiming that the social media site has a ""long record of enabling racism against Jews.""

""The idea that Jews are a 'privileged' group is a slur designed to deny that antisemitism exists and to imply that Jews are a cause of racism towards other minorities,"" the CAAS tweeted.

However, Shack said the attention the hashtag is getting is a ""good thing"" as it will amplify Jewish voices and ""drown out those of the anti-Semites.""

""It's important that people take note that this isn't something that just gets swept under the rug and that Canadians, Jews and non-Jews alike stand together and call it out and make it absolutely clear that this kind of hate [and] discrimination has no place in Canada,"" Shack said.

""Whether it's directed towards Jewish people, or any other people, it's just not what we're about here.""",JewishPrivilege' hashtag trends on Twitter as users fight back against anti-Semitism,2,0.4389616300445631
70,"In the midst of recent backlash over his anti-Semitic comments, Nick Cannon sounded off Friday about the reaction to his apology for those remarks.

He tweeted, ""I hurt an entire community and it pained me to my core, I thought it couldn't get any worse.""

""Then I watched my own community turn on me and call me a sell-out for apologizing,"" the tweet went on to say. ""Goodnight. Enjoy Earth.""

He then added, ""Y'all can have this planet. I'm out!""

THE CONTROVERSY

ViacomCBS ended a decades-long relationship with Cannon this week after he was joined by controversial hip hop figure Professor Griff on a recent episode of the ""Cannon's Class"" podcast, where talk turned to Black people as the ""true Hebrews"" and included anti-Semitic conspiracy theories.

In 1989 Griff was briefly kicked out of the rap group Public Enemy after he made anti-Semitic comments, but later rejoined the group as its ''supreme allied chief of community relations,"" according to a New York Times article from that year.

During his appearance on Cannon's podcast, Griff doubled down on his past comments and said he was ""hated now because I told the truth.""

Cannon said that Griff was ""speaking facts"" and amplified Griff's views that Jewish people controlled the media, likening it to the power of the Rothschild family, banking scions who have long been targets of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories.

""The Masked Singer"" host also disputed that such views were anti-Semitic, saying Black people are the ""true Hebrews.""

""It's never hate speech. You can't be anti-Semitic when we are the Semitic people,"" he said. ""When we are the same people who they want to be. That's our birthright. We are the true Hebrews.""

On Monday Cannon posted a series of tweets about the controversy, writing ""Anyone who knows me knows that I have no hate in my heart nor malice intentions.""

""I do not condone hate speech nor the spread of hateful rhetoric,"" he wrote. ""We are living in a time when it is more important than ever to promote unity and understanding.""

He added that he is ""an advocate for people's voices to be heard openly, fairly and candidly.""

HIS APOLOGY

ViacomCBS has had a professional relationship with Cannon for several years and is the parent company of multiple networks including Nickelodeon, on which Cannon appeared as an actor starting in the 1990s.

ViacomCBS also owns MTV, where Cannon's comedy sketch series ""Wild 'N Out"" has been popular since its debut in 2005 and recently expanded to its sister network, VH1.

On Wednesday a spokesman for the corporation released a statement to CNN saying the company ""condemns bigotry of any kind and we categorically denounce all forms of anti-Semitism.""

""We have spoken with Nick Cannon about an episode of his podcast 'Cannon's Class' on YouTube, which promoted hateful speech and spread anti-Semitic conspiracy theories,"" the statement read.

""While we support ongoing education and dialogue in the fight against bigotry, we are deeply troubled that Nick has failed to acknowledge or apologize for perpetuating anti-Semitism, and we are terminating our relationship with him.""

That same day Cannon shared a lengthy post titled ""Truth and Reconciliation"" on his official Facebook page in which he demanded full ownership of his ""Wild 'N Out"" brand and said ViacomCBS was ""now on the wrong side of history.""

""I don't blame any individual, I blame the oppressive and racist infrastructure,"" Cannon wrote.

""Systemic racism is what this world was built on and was the subject in which I was attempting to highlight in the recent clips that have been circulating from my podcast. If I have furthered the hate speech, I wholeheartedly apologize.""

He also specifically apologized to the Jewish community.

""I must apologize to my Jewish Brothers and Sisters for putting them in such a painful position, which was never my intention, but I know this whole situation has hurt many people and together we will make it right,"" he wrote. ""I have dedicated my daily efforts to continuing conversations to bring the Jewish Community and the African American community closer together, embracing our differences and sharing our commonalities.""

He followed that apology with one on Twitter in a thread where he tweeted his thanks to rabbis and others in the Jewish community who he said had reached out to educate him.

Cannon tweeted that his comments ""reinforced the worst stereotypes of a proud and magnificent people and I feel ashamed of the uninformed and naïve place that these words came from. The video of this interview has since been removed.""

Fox, which employs Cannon as the host of their popular reality competition show ""The Masked Singer,"" released a statement Wednesday that he would be keeping his job with them.

""When we were made aware of Nick Cannon's interview with Richard Griffin on YouTube, we immediately began a dialogue with Nick,"" the statement read. ""He is clear and remorseful that his words were wrong and lacked both understanding and context, and inadvertently promoted hate. This was important for us to observe. Nick has sincerely apologized, and quickly taken steps to educate himself and make amends.""

71,"A GoFundMe campaign has been launched for a man in his 30s, identified as Hollywood actor Josiah Black, who was found dead at the Spion Kop Summit in Lake Country Tuesday, June 16, 2020. (GoFundMe)

A GoFundMe campaign has been started for a man who was found dead along a popular hiking trail in Lake Country on June 16.

The man in his 30s has since been identified as actor Josiah Black, best known for his role in Jigsaw – a 2017 Hollywood film in the Saw franchise.

“It is with a heavy heart that I write, on Monday, June 15, 2020, Josiah Black passed away suddenly and unexpectedly,” fundraiser organizer Jeremiah Black wrote, of the man found at Spion Kop Summit just after 9 a.m., June 16.

He leaves behind his wife, Alicia, and 16-month-old daughter “with another little boy or girl on the way,” the campaign reads.

“Josiah was loved and remembered by many as being a caring, loving father, husband, brother, son and friend to everyone who he came across,” the fundraiser reads. “During Josiah’s final days, he loved spending time outdoors, gardening, reflecting on the words of God, playing with his family, working on his classic VW Westfalia vans and writing through many facets.”

Black had a successful career in acting and stand-up comedy that brought him across North America from Vancouver to Los Angeles.

The GoFundMe campaign, launched June 22, has a $250,000 goal to “offer support, show love and offer encouragement to Josiah’s wife, baby and baby on the way during this difficult and uncertain time.”

“All of the funds dedicated in his name through this page will be offered directly to his family to help them with living expenses in the coming days, weeks, months and years,” Jeremiah Black wrote. “It’s my hope that they will be able to afford a safe home near to family if needed and have enough to put into a college fund for his kids.”

So far, nearly $20,000 has been raised in honour of Black.

72,"Kaden Van Buren started at midnight on Saturday. By 3 p.m. he had completed the trek 19 times.

Aldergrove resident Kaden Van Buren trekked up and down the Abby Grind 19 times on his 19th birthday Saturday, July 12. He was accompanied throughout the day by trail runners he’d met on previous hikes.

To ring in his 19th birthday Saturday, high school graduate Kaden Van Buren completed the Abbotsford version of the Grouse Grind – 19 times.

The Aldergrove teen started at midnight, to cover more than 68 kilometres of steep ground on the Glen Ryder Trail on his day off work from Newlands Golf Course.

By 3 p.m. Van Buren had trekked up and down the steep face of the Abby Grind for 15 hours straight, cheered on by “Rise and Grinders” he’d met previously on the hike.

To those who know the now-19 year old, the feat was baffling.

Just a year ago Van Buren could barely make it out of bed, let alone manage a continuous ascent and descent of more than 15,000 metres in one go.

RELATED: 96-year-old woman scales B.C. Butte with help of family, friends

Two years ago Van Buren was diagnosed with a form of arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, as well as Crohn’s disease.

His conditions gradually worsened until August 2019, when he found himself immobilized by pain in his joints. He was in and out of doctors’ offices and hospital emergency rooms.

“It hurt to sleep,” he said, mentioning a number of medications he tried to relieve his agony.

Close family friend Teresa Penner admitted she was unsure whether Van Buren was going to make it another year after watching the teen struggle with stairs at the Chief Sepass Theatre, where he photographs for LifeApp community events.

To hike out in nature had become a far-off dream, one Van Buren tried to keep alive as an amateur photographer with more than 29,000 followers on Instagram.

“I couldn’t hike for the longest time. I’d get up and walk shorter walks on flat ground, and take photos from there. But it was still so painful,” he said.

“What kept me going while in crutches was the hope of being able to chase my dream of landscape photography one day,” he shared.

“Hope – that was the biggest thing. To find a passion for something. That kept me going.”

Along Van Buren’s journey back to health, he discovered dual passions for trail running and cycling, too.

It was a combination of treatments that allowed him to get up and move again.

After putting himself on a strict diet and spending hours each day exercising to improve his condition, the teen promised himself if he ever got better he wouldn’t take for granted the ability to run or walk.

A biologic medication, adalimumab, helped him regain his strength to the point of something “freakishly unbelievable,” Penner remarked.

“Once I started feeling a lot better it made me so grateful,” Van Buren said.

“It’s the best feeling ever. I have a new perspective on life after being able to walk around and run freely again. It made me want to push myself and see how far my body can go.”

Van Buren’s next goal is to top the fastest recorded completion of the Abby Grind, which currently stands at 27 minutes (up and down).

So far, Van Buren’s personal record is 29 minutes.

“This weekend or the next I’m going to beat that time,” he said.

Nowadays, with physical exercise, Van Buren only feels slight twinges from the arthritis in his right hip.

Though in comparison to last year, the active teen said “it’s nothing bad.”

By Cara Black

Soho, 360 pages, $35.95

Fans of Cara Black’s nineteen novels featuring the plucky Parisian private eye, Aimee Leduc, should now make way for Kate Rees, likewise plucky and likewise serving the cause of justice in Paris. But unlike the French Aimee of the 2000s, Kate is an American-born Allied spy operating in German-occupied Paris in June 1940.

Kate, a sharp shooter extraordinaire, is assigned to assassinate the Fuhrer himself when he makes an appearance at the Sacre-Coeur Cathedral in Montmartre. Kate’s shot misses — the bullet takes out a German admiral standing behind Hitler — and she spends the following hair-raising day and a half slipping around Paris, avoiding Nazis on her trail, seeking the undercover route to safety in England.

The story packs in all the Second War spy story staples: nasty Germans and nastier French collaborationists; traitors to the Allied cause and infiltrators of its espionage apparatus; cameo appearances by Churchill and multiple off-stage rants from the Fuhrer. All of this, in Black’s familiar style, is relentless, honest and immaculately researched.

The narrator, 30 and an IT wizard in Portland, Maine, has been hard done by. Just before the man she has always thought to be her dad died, she learned her biological father was actually a rich man-about-Portland. When she approaches him with love in her heart, he slams her out of his life. At that low point, she sets out to win a little justice and fair play.

What follows is a plot heavily weighted in red herrings, much misdirection and several fake leads. There’s a murder, but it comes so close to the book’s end that it’s almost meaningless. All the rest is expertly dodgy and entertaining.

Sibling rivalry has seldom been so fraught.

Alex, the youngest sister by five years, has a solid job and a hunky live-in boyfriend in a Colorado town. Ruth, who split from Alex and the rest of the family ten years earlier, unexpectedly shows up. She’s loaded with awkward baggage: a stretch in prison, a stash of cocaine and money belonging to a sinister drug dealer who’s on her trail. Ruth is also five months pregnant.

Both sisters spin contrasting but believable lines of narrative explaining their contrasting life histories. As the dark and creepy story grows more complex with every chapter, the question becomes: which sister is speaking the truth? The answer finally arrives not without huge surprises for all concerned, the reader conspicuously included.

It seems only yesterday — it was actually July 1987 — when Scott Turow introduced Sandy Stern, the absolute ace of criminal attorneys, to American crime fiction. That was in “Presumed Innocent,” and now, many novels later, here is Stern back again. Despite his age (he’s 85) and various frailties, he performs gloriously in what may be Turow’s most legally complex book.

Stern’s client is a man of medicine who conceived a cancer cure that won him a Nobel Prize and made him a zillionaire. Now patients on his regimen are dying. The government charges him with a slew of crimes, fraud and murder not excluded. Everybody goes to court where we all stay, vastly entertained, for almost the entire book.

If law schools offer doctorates in criminal law, “The Last Trial” would seem to make a definitive textbook. It is amazingly instructive, and amid all the heavy-duty learning, Turow treats us to one chapter that is as darkly comic as anything he has written. Check it out. Chapter 19.","Women rule the latest crime fiction, along with a darkly comic turn from Scott Turow",1,0.5931837303800576
76,"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle should throw themselves a party this weekend.

After Monday, when they officially bade adieu to royal life, it’s time for champagne, caviar and a three-tier cake scrawled with, “Freedom!” The bash with their closest pals should also include a few symbolic nods to their new homeland, Canada. (Actually, scratch that because now I’m picturing Heather Dorak browbeating guests into doing Pilates on an itchy Hudson’s Bay blanket as George Clooney gets wasted on Molson Canadian and Oprah, already stinking of ketchup chips, demands the terrified chefs whip up a batch of Nanaimo bars for her flight home.)

The point is, Harry and Meghan are now liberated. Congratulations!

Your royal nightmare is over. Let the real dreaming begin.

Anyone who believes the young couple made a grave mistake by ditching the charmed life of his birth — and one she married into — need only watch a nine-second clip from Monday. It was Commonwealth Day, Harry and Meghan’s last pony show as departing senior royals. The narcoleptic event went down inside Westminster Abbey, though given the frostiness on display, it should’ve unfolded in the North Pole.

Harry and Meghan, looking resplendent, were already seated in the second row. But when Prince William and Kate Middleton, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, ambled toward their spots in the first row, months of reported feuds twisted into high-def focus. Meghan waved at Kate, sweetly, but was ignored like a dirty panhandler.

William and Kate then took their seats. And Meghan turned toward her husband to whisper.

What she said, I have no clue.

But I would not blame Meghan had she asked in a hush, “Harry, what is wrong with those two?”

After months in which a “falling out” between the brothers was widely reported, this was a chance for the couples to at least feign congeniality for the global cameras. You know? Pretend everything is A-OK. Hug it out. Fake laugh and make small talk. Do something to disabuse the world of the notion there is now bad blood between two blood brothers.

But that’s not what happened. And the blame goes to William and Kate, who telegraphed petulance.

My heart goes out to Harry and Meghan. It really does. Tired of the absolute garbage they’ve endured from the British tabloids — and determined to animate their own philanthropic and career goals without the controlling shackles of Buckingham Palace — they reasonably asked to become part-time royals.

Instead, they were stripped of their Sussex brand and banished from the Queendom.

Whether it was the awkward, chilly interaction with William and Kate on Monday or getting booed by a heckler at the Endeavour Fund Awards a couple of days earlier, Harry and Meghan’s final weekend as royals was not cause for any second-guessing — it was proof #Megxit was one of the greatest decisions ever made.

The royal family does not deserve Harry and Meghan. The world does.

The royal family wanted to hold them down. They are now free.

On Saturday, during an interview on MSNBC Live, British journalist Victoria Mather revealed the extent of the classist-slash-racist forces aligned against Markle when she blurted out, “I think what has really, really upset the British public is that Meghan Markle, who many people consider only, you know, five clicks up from trailer trash, has actually tried to disrespect the Queen. And the Queen is the most respected person — most respected woman — in the world.”

Now, if I were to be similarly nasty, I might point out Mather looks like Benedict Cumberbatch’s uncle in drag who works the overnight shift at a Twinings factory. Five clicks up from trailer trash? Mather looks and sounds three clicks below a stolen bangers-and-mash breakfast along the banks of the River Thames, in the company of Piccadilly Circus freaks.

But if you watch the rest of the interview, the narrative is clear: Kate Middleton came from a great family worthy of royalty. Meghan Markle, by contrast, was spawned from a biracial hillbilly clan, and has no right to yank Harry from his relationship with his king-in-waiting brother and preternaturally uptight sister-in-law.

So Meghan is basically the Yoko Ono of this century: blamed for the breakup of another “Fab Four.”

Give me a break. From the moment Markle was linked to Prince Harry, she has coped with vicious attacks on her character and motivation. And yet, at every turn, she has bravely smiled, put on her hiking boots and taken the high road. Her steely resolve, her focus on the big picture, reminds me of someone else: Princess Diana.

So Harry and Meghan’s final march through royal duty this weekend is no longer cause for debate: it is irrefutable evidence they made the right decision by getting the hell away. What they want for themselves, compared to what was expected of them, could never be reconciled. There was no middle ground here.

Harry and Meghan, after the birth of their son, realized royal life was a prison in the making.

Now they are free. Now there is no looking back.

77,"It only took 14 years.

When the Dixie Chicks triumphantly returned earlier this month, dropping a fist-up emoji of a song called “Gaslighter” — also the name of a long-awaited album, coming soon — my thoughts darted to a few places. One, I remembered how much I bloody love the Dixie Chicks.

Two, a reminder of the fuss that engulfed the game-changing country trio, back in the early aughts, when frontwoman Natalie Maines publicly denounced both the Iraq War and the then-president George W. Bush (and how quaint all of that sounds now).

Three, a fixation on the idea that while “Gaslighter’ has the ire and the tang of songs on their 2006 comeback album — think “Not Ready To Make Nice” — and that it, additionally, makes pulp of a term that is ubiquitous these days — “gaslighting” is an in-vogue word, employed everywhere from politics to reality TV — I was not entirely sure that what this song was about was actually … well … “gaslighting.” Maybe it’s just a bummer?

Indeed, visions of Alanis cascaded upon me, as I wondered if gaslight might just be the next “Ironic”? You remember, dontcha, that ’90s anthem which describes any number of things — “a traffic jam when you’re already late,” for one; “ten thousand spoons when all you need is a knife,” for another — few of which were especially ironic?

Some background: “gaslighting” has become a more popular expression, in this Trump-era zeitgeist of “alternative facts” but in its purest essence, in the personal realm, it refers to a form of sustained emotional abuse that involves manipulating the truth to make someone doubt their grip on reality — and the term actually goes back decades. To a 1938 play “Gaslight,” in fact — one that later became a classic movie with Ingrid Bergman. In that plot, a husband wrecks havoc on his wife by subtly altering things, including playing with the gaslights in the house.

What do you think?

Lying. Manipulation. Keeping your victim foggy-eyed and off-balance. The toolbox of the classic gaslighter in that original incarnation. And one that has become a staple in psychology, and has now morphed into a go-to bit of invective in this era, it reaching its own sort of pop-political apotheosis when, in an interview last year, none other than Taylor Swift accused Trump of “gaslighting the American public.” Lately, I have heard everyone from Real Housewives to contestants on “Love Island” throw around the term.

The term has also been enjoying a good run on bookshelves, too, especially in a form of domestic noir as practised by authors like Gillian Flynn. There is, for instance, Tara Isabella Burton’s pretty great, gender-bending Talented Mr. Ripley redux from a couple of years ago, “Social Creature,” in which the anti-heroine uses gaslighting via the very 21st-century modes of social media. And also, even crazier, the meta-ness of A.J. Finn’s bestseller “The Woman in the Window” (soon to be a movie with Amy Adams), which was sold as a gaslight novel but then got even more curiouser, when the author was unveiled as a serial liar himself in a long profile done of him in “The New Yorker,” with his past deceptions including claiming to have had cancer, among other things (cue the allegations of Finn as a gaslighter by colleagues).

A Guardian columnist echoed some of my own reservations, though, when she warned against cheapening the term. “Put simply, all gaslighters are lying creeps, but not every lying creep is a gaslighter,” Barbara Ellen wrote. Meaning: it is not a convenient umbrella term for all mendacious behaviour, nor is it “gaslighting every single time someone lies, or makes excuses.”

When it occurs, “it is a systematic dissolving another person’s sense of self, until they’re questioning every move and instinct.” And not just a phenomenon that pops up on a show like “Love Island,” where male contestants are tagged as gaslighters, when — girl, please — many of them are just himbos who’d say anything to get laid.

So, what say you, Dixie Chicks? In their album — which the group has called “the most personal and autobiographical” — the just-out song clearly traces Maines’ very public divorce from a liar-face. And the full-blast lyrics? Well, they speak for themselves. Exhibit A: “Give you all my money, you’ll gladly walk away … Gaslighter, denier, doing anything to get your ass farther …”

It is an earworm, all right, but is, actually … gaslighting? Let the debates begin.",Is Dixie Chicks’ gaslighter really just a jerk?,1,0.17034919685568128
78,"When even the mother of “The Bachelor” doesn’t believe he has a chance in hell of finding love you know it’s over: romance, or whatever passed for romance on the long-running reality franchise, is dead.

Viewers who endured a train wreck of a “Bachelor” season had to put up with a fiasco of a finale, spread over four hours and two nights Monday and Tuesday, as pilot Peter Weber’s bid to find a wife crashed and burned.

To summarize: Peter claimed to be head over heels in love with one woman who said she loved him but that they were too different to make things work. Two days after she walked out on him, Peter claimed to be head over heels in love with another woman and proposed marriage to her. But the engagement ended because he still had feelings for the first woman, who confessed she still had feelings for him and agreed to give him a second chance.

Despite the optimistic presence of jeweller Neil Lane in Tuesday’s live studio audience in Los Angeles, briefcase of diamond rings in hand, there was no engagement.

A couple of clear villains emerged from the shambles: Weber himself and a tired series that prizes made-for-TV manipulation over the human connections it claims to value above all else.

There was also a clear hero: Hannah Ann Sluss, the 23-year-old we were all making fun of a couple of weeks ago for dotting her i’s with hearts, but who boldly and confidently stood up for herself and rejected Peter’s weaselly rationalizations after he sabotaged their engagement.

The third person involved in this mess, Madison Prewett, also 23, was coaxed back into Peter’s arms after “Bachelor” host Chris Harrison personally delivered the news of Peter’s broken engagement. This strikes me less as altruism than a desperate attempt to get Peter paired off and stave off criticism that the entire season was a colossal waste of time.

But Peter’s mother Barb very bluntly told Peter and Madison on Tuesday that their relationship is doomed to fail. While I think it was impolitic of her to sabotage her own son on live TV like that, I also think she’s probably right given her disdain for Madison (evidenced by the rude faces she made on camera every time Madison opened her mouth) and that of the rest of Peter’s family. How does a relationship that’s already on shakey ground withstand that kind of familial disapproval?

But let’s back up and retrace how we got to this sorry point.

Weber was never a popular choice as star of this “Bachelor” season, one that was marked by tedious sniping among the contestants and Peter’s seeming inability to form more than shallow connections with any of his would-be mates.

Madison, a foster parent recruiter from Auburn, Ala., was an early front-runner, but just before she, Peter and two other women jetted off to Australia for “fantasy suite” week, she told him she’d be hard pressed to continue dating him if he had sex with the other two on their overnight dates. Deeply religious, she was saving herself for marriage.

Peter, on the other hand, was renowned for his sexual prowess. His claim to fame, and likely the reason he was chosen as Bachelor, was that he had sex four times with “The Bachelorette” in a windmill fantasy suite. So to no one’s surprise, except maybe Madison’s, Peter confessed he’d been “intimate” (whether with one or both of the other women was never specified) and Madison bolted.

She did come back, but his indiscretion hung like a cloud over their relationship and she left him in the Australian outback, seemingly forever.

This is where Peter could have used his powers for good instead of evil.

Hannah Ann, a model from Knoxville, Tenn., adored Peter; his family adored Hannah Ann. (That clip we saw ad nauseam of Barb wailing at Peter, “Bring her home to us”? The “her” was Hannah Ann.) But Peter was obviously gaga for Madison. The day after the breakup he told Hannah Ann that despite her obvious devotion to him his heart was “being pulled in two different directions.”

The honourable thing to do would have been to send Hannah Ann home then and there. Instead he claimed the very next day that he’d found “true love” with her. “My heart chooses you forever,” he told a very surprised Hannah Ann before pulling out a pear-shaped diamond ring.

It’s the same ring Hannah Ann put back in his hand weeks later after Peter confessed he couldn’t give her his entire heart.

Onstage in the studio, Hannah Ann lambasted Peter for downplaying his feelings for Madison. “I had no idea what I was saying yes to. That’s called being blindsided,” she said. “If you would have sat me down and had an honest conversation you know that my instinct would have picked up on that you were not ready for a commitment with me …

“And that’s the most hurtful part is that you didn’t respect me enough just to have that open conversation with me.”

She left him with this zinger: “If you want to be with a woman you’ve got to become a real man.”

Peter apologized a lot but never really explained why he did what he did. Was it pride? FOMO? A desire to please his family? A sense of pressure not to leave the show still single?

Whatever the reason, his actions did nothing to endear him to viewers who were already very displeased with him. And it’s hard to feel unreserved enthusiasm for his and Madison’s relationship given his shoddy treatment of Hannah Ann.

This is the third season in a row of “The Bachelor” to finish without a so-called happy ending. Arie Luyendyk Jr. dumped his fiancée for his runner-up; Colton Underwood got jilted by his favourite but got her to agree to continue dating him; and now this.

But maybe the issue isn’t the show’s failure rate but the whole premise that a man getting down on one knee to propose to a woman he’s known for barely two months is the pinnacle of romantic love.

Warner Bros. and ABC remain unbowed. They’re debuting yet another “Bachelor” spinoff on April 13, “Listen to Your Heart,” in which the contestants are all musicians, to be followed by a new season of “The Bachelorette” on May 18 starring Clare Crawley, the oldest franchise star at 38.

83,"Summer is here and stories about the outdoors are apt, but under Covid-19, what do they mean?

Deborah Underwood’s “Outside In”, illustrated by Cindy Derby (Harcourt Houghton Mifflin, 32 pages, $24.99, ages 3-7), resonates even in the shadow of lockdown. “Once we were part of Outside and Outside was part of us,” begins this story aimed to tempt kids to explore nature. Instead, Underwood’s take on Outside shows ways nature reaches indoors — through sunlight, our clothes, even the water gushing from our taps. We might forget we’re part of nature, but Outside reminds us. A wonderfully perceptive mix of poetry, art, and environmental awareness.

Akiko Miyakoshi’s “I Dream of a Journey” (Kids Can, 32 pages, $18.99, ages 3-7) suits Covid-19 shut-in fatigue. “In my dreams I set off on a journey …” says a bear hotelier, and he dreams of travelling to places his guests have been, to beaches and windswept dunes. When he wakes from his colour-filled sleep, he’s back in his own hotel. There’s something eerie yet familiar in Miyakoshi’s muted art, the bear’s timid wanderlust, and travel that can happen only in dreams.

Deborah Hodge celebrates the real “Outside” in “West Coast Wild Babies,” with lose-yourself-in-them illustrations by Karen Reczuch (Groundwood, 32 pages, $19.95, ages 3-6). In simple language Hodge describes some of the Pacific coast’s many baby creatures — gray wolves, orcas, harbour seals, oystercatchers and more. Reczuch’s pellucid colours show the scene with idealized serenity (no “graveyard of the Pacific” tumult here), heightening natural beauty, baby life and security.

Ibram Kendi’s “Antiracist Baby,” illustrated by Ashley Lukashevsky (Kokila, 24 pages, $11.99, all ages), brings the vital issue of antiracism to babies and all readers in a jaunty, challenging board book. Here are nine clear steps to acting for and practicing racial equity. Kendi’s words are few but his content is deep: “open your eyes to all skin colours … use your words to talk about race …” With its acknowledgement that “Antiracist Baby is bred, not born,” this timely book can be a first step in discussing our own society.

Andrea Curtis explores nature in urban spaces in “A Forest in the City,” illustrated by Pierre Pratt (Groundwood, 40 pages, $19.95, ages 10 and up). In a direct, informative text, she tells us of urban trees and the perils posed by city soil, pollution, and neighbourly peccadilloes. Pratt’s illustrations balance the staid text with playfulness and humour, showing trees’ glorious greenery among and around humans’ busy ways. Pratt’s art conveys the joie-de-vivre trees bring; Curtis’s text provides the science.

In Rebecca Stead’s “The List of Things That Will Not Change” (Wendy Lamb, 224 pages, $22.99, ages 10-14), set in New York, Bea tells the story of her father’s wedding to his gay partner. To do it, she takes us back to the time of her parents’ divorce, her ensuing life in two homes, her bad spelling, and her efforts to befriend her step-sister. Stead is a marvel at ravelling up her tale through interlocking pieces, past and present, and here she’s at her best. Bea’s slow revelation of what’s in her heart happens with colourful, precise incident, each page deepening emotional intensity.

First Nations sleuths the “Mighty Muskrats” travel from their reservation to the city in Michael Hutchinson’s “The Case of the Missing Auntie” (Second Story, 181 pages, $10.95, ages 8-13). While they contend with city ways, they try to find out what happened to Grandpa’s sister, scooped by the government and adopted years ago. This quick, engaging mystery (indeed, the series) is a real gift to Canadian readers, most particularly for the Indigenous familial culture and social and historical realities it portrays.

A strong sense of place and down-to-earth narrator characterize Riel Nason’s “Waiting Under Water” (Scholastic, 216 pages, $8.99, ages 9-12). Loving her home on the Bay of Fundy, Hope is terrified when her family decides to move to Toronto.

84,"EDMONTON -- More families are hoping a one-time treatment option for a rare condition will be made available in Alberta – while their young children still have time to see its benefits.

Kaysen Martin turns two years old on Friday.

A fundraiser by his family to afford Zolgensma – a one-time gene replacement therapy proven to halt and in some cases reverse the effects of spinal muscular atrophy – has nearly reached $1 million.

While $1 million appears remarkable, the family is still $2 million short – and feels they're running out of time. Zolgensma is most effective before a patient turns two years old.

The fundraising push has meant Kaysen’s birthday is as much a deadline as it is a celebration.

""Being his mom, I need to be able to tell him I did everything I possibly could for him,"" Lana Bernardin, said.

She has been told there’s a ""little bit of wiggle room"" on the timing, but that doesn’t make Zolgensma any easier to access in Canada.

The drug is not approved for use in the country and costs $2.8 million south of the border.

As rare as the disease is, at least three families in the capital region are dealing with a spinal muscular atrophy diagnosis.

Harper Hanki is one year old.

""She’s fought tooth and nail through everything, from all the appointments, the physio three times a week, to the lumbar punctures every four months,"" her dad, John Haki, told CTV News Edmonton.

""Seeing that there is a treatment that could potentially stop it in its tracks, and not being able to afford it... It was heartbreaking,"" mother Amanda Hanki said.

Zolgensma’s manufacturer, Novartis, says in the U.S., the drug is ""priced according to the value it provides to the patients, caregivers, healthcare system and to society as a whole.""

Novartis has offered up to 100 free doses of the drug in 2020 throughout the world through a program families apply for and are selected via random lottery.

Of the three families, only Harper is eligible for the program.

Reign, a 16-month-old boy whose condition now requires round-the-clock breathing assistance and a feeding tube, does not qualify.

His parents, like Kaysen’s and Harper’s, hope the government will step in to speed up the approval process.

""This is a no-brainer,"" Reign’s dad, Ryan Johnston, said.

The only treatment currently allowed in Canada requires three yearly spinal injections for a patient’s life.

""(Zolgensma) is not only going to heal these children, it’s going to save us millions and millions of dollars, over the course of a lifetime.""

Health Canada has placed the drug under priority review, cutting the nine-month process in half.

""We’re just a regular family wanting the best for our child,"" Harper’s mom, Amanda, said.

Regardless, Kaysen will be celebrating his second birthday on Friday with a drive-thru party.

88,"Sex scandals, dynasties and the custody of one immensely rich little girl lie at the heart of Bryn Turnbull’s dazzling fictional debut.

The major players are familiar: The Prince of Wales, the future Edward VIII, abdicated the English throne to marry twice-divorced American Wallis Simpson, a scandal that shook the monarchy and eventually brought his niece Elizabeth to the throne; Gloria Vanderbilt was the mother of “Little Gloria,” the future Vanderbilt jeans icon, whose 1934 custody “trial of the century” was as sensational in its day as the O.J. Simpson case, according to her grandson, CNN news anchor Anderson Cooper.

By billing these events as fiction, Turnbull tightens her timeline and shades her characters, heightening the drama. We have heard much of this shocking story before — “Little Gloria” Vanderbilt herself wrote about it in old age. But this time is different: in Turnbull’s hands we hear from Thelma Morgan Furness, an insider in both Windsor and Vanderbilt circles.

Twin sisters Lady Thelma Furness and Gloria Vanderbilt — beautiful, free-spirited Americans — followed their Mamma’s maxim: “Marry money and you’ll never want for anything.” Thelma did but, disappointed with her husband, the philandering Viscount Marmaduke Furness, she enjoys a lengthy affair with the Prince of Wales (thus earning her the title “the woman before Wallis”), whose tastes always ran to married women.

In 1934 Furness sets sail for New York to lend emotional support to her widowed twin in the latter’s ugly custody fight for her daughter, Gloria, led by the ruthless Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, her sister-in-law. There are numerous villains in Turnbull’s cast, on both sides of the Atlantic. Thankfully, Thelma is an astute observer, sensitive to the behaviours of the rich and the royal and gives us insight into all.

Looking back on a recent rainy afternoon with friends at the Prince’s country house, for instance, Thelma is pretty certain his eye will wander during her absence — he’s had a string of mistresses, after all. She describes him as “spaniel-eyed,” resembling a “terrier” when angry, and loves gardening and needlepoint — but royalty still means a lot in society circles, so she’d rather keep him.

At The Ritz a few days later, in London’s “chilly mist,” she confides her dilemma to her friend Wallis, “the best-dressed woman in the room,” who promises to watch over the Prince. Every Eden has its snake.

This thoroughly researched tale zigzags between the wild 1920s and the Depression-era 1930s, from a whirl of parties, cocktails, splendid hotels and palatial estates — where a woman’s choice of evening clothing mimics a warrior preparing for battle — before descending into a hell of lurid headlines, overpowering courtrooms and gleeful character assassination.

Gloria Vanderbilt’s world harboured more than its own share of snakes — notably her own mother, who testified against her, the nurse her mother hired, and a maid who reported seeing lascivious goings-on between Gloria and Lady Milford Haven, a Marchioness and the Prince’s cousin by marriage.

This all happened long ago, but how familiar it sounds. Princess Diana hounded to death by the press, Prince Harry fleeing with his pilloried American wife Meghan Markle. In the earlier version a naïve woman is smeared in the press; a child schooled in terror of her parent; money and royalty wield their power.

“People like us” are immune, the Prince loftily assured Thelma. Apart from Lady Furness, a witty commentator on the theatre of her life (and a good mother and stepmother), truly sympathetic characters are thin on the ground. Wily Wallis may win her spaniel-eyed Prince, but what we witness is Thelma maturing into a woman worthy of our affection. Turnbull clearly has her favourites.

89,"Typically, David Lee Roth spends his days, or at least his nights, “in tactical spandex, moving at 134 beats per minute,” he said. But now Roth, the 65-year-old Van Halen singer, is just like the rest of us: stuck at home and obsessing about pandemics.

However, the past few months in quarantine have led Roth to an old pursuit, with new focus. Since April, he has filled his days creating COVID-themed drawings — he calls them comics — and then sharing the finished works, one each week, on his social media channels. The art, like Roth’s music and disposition, is vibrant, whimsical and somewhat unconventional. In moments, it is confrontational. Several drawings feature his own face. Many are filled with images of frogs.

What sparked this surge of artistic expression?

“Well, I lost my job!” Roth cracked over the phone from his home in Los Angeles on an afternoon in late June. As recently as March, Roth was on tour as a solo act, supporting Kiss in arenas across the United States. Earlier in that run, Roth, who has also worked as an EMT in New York, had battled an unspecified illness. “I’m not so unconvinced I didn’t have the corona,” he said. “Man, they gave me enough prednisone to put boots on the moon! We left a trail of groupies, rubble and incandescent reviews. But I don’t want to go back through it.”

Even by rock frontman standards, Roth’s ability to command full attention from his audience is renowned, whether he’s launching himself off drum risers for mid-air splits or schooling fans on how Van Halen is “the rock ’n’ roll band who sold Ricky Ricardo rumba to the heavy metal nation.” But now his art is doing the talking. “Social commentary is what I do,” he said. “It’s what I’ve always done.”

In his recent artwork, that social commentary has elicited a strong response. In one piece, he declares a name change. “Diamond Dave following Lady Antebellum’s (now Lady A) example, will be dropping the ‘Lee,’” he wrote below a drawing of, naturally, a frog. “From now on he wants us all to call him ‘David L. Roth’ or simply ‘El Roth.’” To many, it diminished the steps white artists are taking to correct racism.

“Humour — not jokes — humour, the best stuff, isn’t funny at all,” Roth said, defending his work. “My version is the truth dipped in sugar. And maybe it’s a little sugar and spice. But the good stuff compels discussions.”

These are edited excerpts from the conversation.

Q: Why frogs?

A: I saw a story about Mark Twain — it was not his biography, it was a fictional piece with actors. And at the end of it ol’ Sam passes on, but he doesn’t go to heaven. He’s in the backyard where he grew up in Hannibal, Miss. And a little girl walks up and he goes, “Who are you?” She says, “I’m Becky Thatcher, and I’ve got some friends who are waiting to meet you.” And all the characters that he created come on up to greet him. So, I started my guest list. And probably the only one of that retinue that I could even spell, much less draw, was the frog from Calaveras County (from the short story “The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County”).

Q: Many of your drawings include a reference to the “Soggy Bottom.” I took this, at least in this context, to be a play on the phrase “draining the swamp.”

A: If I explain it, it’s a bumper sticker. If I let you explain it, it’s art. But you’re very close to exactly accurate.

Q: Can you describe your artistic process?

A: My approach is the best of both worlds: vintage and hyperatomic digital. Sort of like watching “Dragnet” on your iPad. You know, I moved to Japan for two-plus years to study Sumi-e and calligraphy, and four nights a week I trained and then I did homework. Jesus, I’ve spent thousands of hours learning to operate a horsehair brush with a block of ink that I grind myself. Hasn’t changed its recipe in 700 years.

Q: What appeals to you about using brush and ink as a means of artistic expression?

A: Hold on. This isn’t expressing myself. This is performance therapy. I’m venting. I’m angry. And I am not asking for forgiveness. And this is how I do it.

Q: People don’t usually think of David Lee Roth as angry.

A: That’s because I have transcended it. It is that secret magic when you take something that is essentially sad and find humour, eloquence and sometimes illumination in it.

Q: Can you say more about the piece that seems to be a response to Lady Antebellum’s name change?

A: It had connotations of personal politic. I sought to have a little fun at the expense of others, whose vision I will respect. And in lieu of the inevitable false-footed copycats I pretended to be one. But the supposed name change really drew some ire in terms of some folks posting from an arch right-wing stance: “Another left-winger takes a fall.” Hey, I’m a combat hippie — peace, love and enough guys and gears to defend the (expletive) out of it. You need one to support the other.

Q: Would it be correct to identify David Lee Roth as left-leaning?

A: I love civil rights. Equal rights. Women’s rights. Kids’ rights. The rights of the rights. OK? The entire list. But conversely, I’m prepared to shave my head, join the marines and go defend those rights. That in itself isn’t really a left-wing statement. Or it didn’t used to be when I was growing up. But I grew up in a really great time and a really great space during integrational busing in the ’60s. I went to schools that were 90 per cent Black and Spanish, and I was in the colour guard with a crew cut. Every morning at seven, we’d march to put up the flag. And then at night we’d go to Kenny Brower’s brother’s house, smoke pot and listen to that new Doors record. Combat hippie!

Q: You were on tour when the lockdown began. As a lifelong performer, was it difficult being forced to leave the road so hastily?

A: Every jiujitsu magazine has a 28-year-old who’s going to tell you about the two years that got taken away by his elbow. Every kick-boxing magazine has a 32-year-old instructor who goes, “Well, I lost those three years to my left knee.” So I’ve just been isolating away. Because I myself am high risk.

Q: For how long will we continue to see new artwork from David Lee Roth?

A: Like the tattoo artist said, ’till I don’t have any friends left! Until my Instagram’s empty! I can do this endlessly. I hadn’t considered this as something other than after dinner at the campfire. But lo and behold, people have taken a real fascination.

Q: Given that fascination, will these drawings eventually be offered for sale?

A: In terms of what I really do for a living, as soon as the B-list — that’s Beyoncé, Bono and Bruce (Springsteen) — say it’s OK, I’ll be back singing and dancing and selling you T-shirts. But in the interim, I am drawing and painting every night. And the fact that there’s an audience for it is quite a tickle. So of course I’ll make it available. You bet. I just didn’t see it coming. (Laughs.) But like my sister says, I seem to miss the big stuff.",David Lee Roth is letting his art (mostly) do the talking,1,0.5479963094662489
91,"There is a coronavirus threatening civilization, so the city of Toronto decided to fast-track the building of 40 more kilometres of bicycle lanes.

First things first, I guess.

This is, apparently, historic in that it is the biggest one-year expansion of the bike network in Toronto’s history. Just the sort of thing you slide through when people aren’t paying attention.

In any event, I wanted to double-check the facts for this column so I googled “bike lanes Toronto” and a local news site called Toronto.com popped up.

The main story was about the bike-lane expansion, but that wasn’t what caught my eye. Right across the top of Toronto.com was an ad for a 2020 Kia Sorento. Even better, in the shoulder of the story, was another ad for the same car. There wasn’t an ad for a bicycle anywhere on that page. Just car ads (there was another one at the bottom). Now we know which of these two modes of transportation pays the freight around here.

In any event, the story said — and I quote — that the bike lanes will make it easier for commuters to get to and from work during the COVID-19 crisis. Somebody should tell council that nobody is at work during the crisis, including them. They did this while holding a virtual meeting.

I imagine they got these brainwaves after reading stories that were in the Star recently. There was one that caught my eye in which urban designers imagine a car-free road network in post-pandemic Toronto.

This Freedom Ring Road would encircle the city and allow people in wheelchairs, or pushing baby carriages, or walking and cycling to visit the Brickworks on Bayview or attend an open-air yoga class in the middle of Queens Quay. All without fear of being hit by a car.

Will somebody please tell these people that this is not California. We live in Canada. Even in a good winter, it is either too cold to ride a bike or there is snow on the ground five months of the year. Sometimes six.

Yes, some people cycle 12 months a year. Not many, but some. At the Star, there are two that I know of; at the Globe, one guy not only cycled to work each and every day but he and his family always took a January vacation in a noninsulated cabin north of Kenora that didn’t have electricity. (They sure didn’t have to worry about black flies, did they? But the outdoor privy must have been something else.)

Downtown, in the old city of Toronto, is where the cyclists live. And there, within reason, is where there should be bike lanes everywhere. I say within reason because University Avenue south of Bloor is not a good reason. It will prove to be dangerous because it’s a major thoroughfare for traffic coming into and going out of Toronto.

It reminds me of one of the most famous thoroughfares in Europe, the Champs-Élysées in Paris. The Ontario legislature at Queen’s Park is about where the Arche de Triomphe would be. You can get over to Queen’s Park on crosswalks or at intersections; it’s virtually impossible to get to the Arch because it’s in the middle of a traffic circle.

Which reminds me: would the bicycle lobby quit saying things like, “We should be reducing or eliminating cars and car parking on our main boulevards, as is the case throughout Europe.” They say this knowing that not all that many GTA residents have been to Europe. I have. Many times, particularly in the last two years. Cars are everywhere. See my reference to the Champs-Élysées as just one example. And they park on those streets, too.

My take: Most on council forget that Toronto is a megacity. It is more than the Lake up to Bloor and Parliament in the east over to Bathurst. It’s the Rouge River to the 427 and north to the 407 (approx.) and if you’re living out there and working downtown you are not going to ride your bike. Nor are the people commuting in from Oakville and Whitby, or Kitchener and Peterborough. Those people are not Lance Armstrong; they ride the GO and the bus and subway and most of all they drive. That’s right. They drive.

When the pandemic wanes, and it will sooner or later, and the people who can’t work from home go back to the office, they will not be crazy about riding transit. Not for awhile, anyway. Which means they are going to be driving their cars. In fact, dealers are reporting that people are buying again. May sales were way up over April’s. And once they get used to driving those cars downtown again, it will be a long time before they give them up.

City Council has been living in a dream world for years. Times have been good and Toronto’s on top. It might not be, after the pandemic. Those folks would be wise to pay a little less attention to the bike lobby, which isn’t all that big, and a lot more to the car crowd, which is huge.",Council added 40 kms of bike lanes when nobody was looking,2,0.005709129450392925
95,"Dr. Ashleigh Lane at Arc Integrated Medicine has a passion for women’s health, and wants the women of North Delta to know relief is possible.

When Dr. Ashleigh Lane chose the name Arc Integrated Medicine for her clinic seven years ago, she envisioned an electric arc of light connecting two surfaces. Naturopathic medicine varies considerably between doctors, and in Dr. Lane’s practice the connection — or arc — between doctor and patient is crucial.

Dr. Lane grew up in North Delta, and it was her connection to the community that led her to focus on women’s health.

“There’s an overwhelming need for it here. There aren’t a lot of great options for women in the area. Plus I find fertility, menopause and other women’s health issues fascinating,” she says.

Arc Integrated Medicine now has four Naturopathic Doctors serving North Delta with a variety of interests from joint pain to digestive challenges, skin conditions and more. Dr. Lane helps women at all ages find relief from things like PMS, endometriosis, PCOS, thyroid disorders and other aspects of women’s health.

Menopause and Perimenopause

Hot flashes, insomnia, increased anxiety… menopause can be relentless. For decades medical practitioners have told patients to grit their teeth and wait it out, but Dr. Lane wants women to know relief is possible.

“A lot of the time my patients’ symptoms improve within a few weeks! It can be a really simple fix,” she says. “In menopause your hormone levels drop significantly, and sometimes they fall off too steep of a cliff. If we bring them back up a bit we can give your body time to adjust, then slowly bring them down over time.”

In your first appointment you’ll spend an hour with Dr. Lane discussing all aspects of your health to get a complete picture of contributing factors. The root cause of your symptoms is unique to you, and Dr. Lane will suggest treatments customized to your body.

“Hormone therapy is often low risk for a high return on quality of life.”

Fertility

When you’re trying to have a baby, it can be daunting to make the jump from the broad knowledge of your GP to expensive procedures at a fertility clinic. Dr. Lane can bridge the gap.

“We look for the root cause of your fertility issues through lab work, and investigating your diet and lifestyle,” Dr. Lane says. “There are a lot of different ways we can help.”

Through infertility some women learn they have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and treating that can help regulate ovulation. Other women may make diet changes to improve egg health. If the issue is sperm health, Dr. Lane can help with that too.

“Even if patients choose to visit a fertility clinic later, our treatments can be complementary to those procedures.”

VANCOUVER - When Rick Thompson's doctor told him a surgical team was going ahead with his double-hand transplant in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, his first reaction was surprise.

“We're targeting August, maybe early September,” he said in a recent interview.

“I was even shocked when (the doctor) told me. I met him last week and I asked him for a ballpark time frame. And he said August, and I said 'Oh, OK.' I wasn't quite ready for that.”

Thompson moved to Ontario from British Columbia in April to prepare for the surgery in London. It involves medical and psychological tests, as well as finding a donor.

If things go as planned, Thompson will be Canada's first double-hand transplant patient.

Thompson had all of his limbs amputated after contracting bacterial meningitis and septic shock in 2015.

He left work early one day in May, after feeling like he was coming down with the flu, and decided to sleep it off. A few hours later, he woke up to get a drink of water.

“But when I stood up my feet were like on fire. I could barely walk. I made it downstairs to where my wife Rita was watching TV. And that's pretty well the last thing I remember. I just collapsed on the floor.”

He woke up six weeks later in intensive care, confronted with the choice of dying in palliative care or amputation.

“If I wanted to survive, I would need all four limbs amputated,” he said.

“In the end, the will to live is stronger than anything else.”

After 8 1/2 hours of surgery, doctors had amputated his limbs.

“That was a difficult time, obviously, because you know, you wake up as a different person. You look down and all you see is bandages ... where your hands used to be or where your legs and feet used to be,” he said.

“The first thing that came to my mind was, what did I just do?”

After learning about hand transplants two years ago, Thompson met with a team of doctors in Ontario to assess whether he would make a suitable candidate.

“It's life changing,” he said.

“Being able to shake someone's hand, being able to pick up a cup of coffee with one hand, write your name with a pen, open a door, you know, just the things that we take for granted every day.”

Dr. Steven McCabe, who performed Canada's first hand transplant, may participate in the surgery. He is a hand surgeon at Toronto Western Hospital and an associate professor at the University of Toronto.

The surgery can take 10 to 12 hours with four teams of surgeons. Each team consists of six to 10 people.

While operating on both hands makes the surgery logistically harder because it involves more people, McCabe said it is “logical” to do the two transplants at the same time.

“When you transplant, you're introducing this different tissue,” he explained. “And the theory behind that is that you don't want to introduce two different donor tissues.”

A person who undergoes a transplant has to take immunosuppressants, so the body doesn't reject the new organ or limb, and it's easier when surgery is done all at once, he said.

“So if you transplanted one limb, and then three months or a year later, the other one, you'd have to go through that again. The idea is to get that all over with one donor.”

But there's also another reason.

“Having one hand when you have none is a huge benefit,” McCabe said.

“But if you're going to have that type of surgery, and it seems logical to transplant both hands, part of the sense of wholeness is restored. It seems to be very important for patients.”

There are risks associated with the surgery, including infections and the possibility of blood loss. But McCabe said the benefits outweigh the risks, and limb transplants have low rejection rates.

After the surgery, transplant patients face a long recovery, he added.

“If you transplant the limb near the elbow, it will take a few months for the muscles to start to work again, and maybe up to a year or more for the nerves to get down to the fingers to have some feeling,” McCabe said. “So, I think we would say, you can't judge whether it's really helped or not for at least a couple years.”

Thompson said unlike most organ transplants, a hand transplant is visible.

“It's physically there. So getting over the mental challenge is going to be the hardest one, because you know they belonged to someone else at one point and now they're on your body,” Thompson said.

“You have to look at it as a gift ... (the donor) family has decided to give you this gift. And it's a gift I'm not going to waste.”

98,"We’ve had one hell of a run these past few thousand years but maybe it’s time to share

An open letter to my fellow white, heterosexual, males:

Boys, we have had one hell of a run.

It’s been a blast for the past 12,000 years or so since the agricultural revolution when humans started to move from hunter-gatherer societies to settling down and growing crops and mastering the art of animal husbandry.

Along the way, let’s be honest, many of us straight white males (SWMs) haven’t been super nice. We ended up with a world where – in Europe and in North America at least – we took charge, took credit the work of others, and profited on the backs of women, slaves, and indentured servants.

Decade by decade, those we took advantage of may have clawed back one tiny bit of recognition and apology after another, whether it was women, or descendants of Black slaves, or Chinese head-tax payers, or Indigenous victims of Canada’s attempted cultural genocide.

After some (not very) civil disputes in the U.S., we finally decided to free the slaves, which was pretty nice of us. Right?

We apologized to the Chinese Canadians. You’re welcome.

We also decided to let women vote and do other stuff that even incompetent white men are allowed to do.

You know: drive, sit on juries, have jobs.

As for Indigenous people? Please hold, it’s coming. (I’m told.)

The LGBTQ community? Well, we legalized sexual activity in 1969. And us SWMs listened to Frankie Goes to Hollywood in the 1980s, and watched Will and Grace in the 1990s, didn’t we? We allowed the entertainment industry to create a whole bunch of shows that included many (mostly white) homosexual (mostly male) characters.

Listen, we are not bad people. Sure we get Tasered and carded and harassed way less often than people of colour. Sure the worst of us spent decades physically bashing, emotionally torturing, and professionally oppressing members of the LGBTQ community. And some of us haven’t always treated women the way they should be treated.

But it’s not our fault, we were born this way.

White privilege? Sure, it’s pretty sweet to be born a straight white male, but many say that is not our collective fault. There has been a lot of white privilege pushback in recent days, many SWMs – others too – claim that it’s not a thing.

At the risk of being shunned by some of you, my fellow SWMs, I think it might be time we take a back seat. If not a back seat, can some of us at least ride shotgun for a bit?

No one is asking SWMs to be eliminated from the planet. They aren’t shipping boatloads of us in chains to unknown worlds, and horrific futures of permanent slavery. No one is trying to erase our culture, whatever that exactly is. But some are asking we be a little more inclusive and accepting.

While those in our SWM ranks, such as Don Cherry, accuse “you people” (i.e. immigrants of colour) of stealing from us, what is generally sought by people of colour, women, the LGBTQ community, isn’t more than we have or frankly even as much. For the past few hundred years, all “they” have been looking for is something at all.

• READ MORE: VIDEO: Don Cherry says he was fired, not sorry for ‘Coach’s Corner’ poppy rant

Recently the voices have been getting louder suggesting the scraps we threw off the side of the table weren’t enough.

Guys, let’s stop getting so defensive. “Straight pride? Male pride? White pride?” Please. That’s what the last 12,000 years has been all about.

As I said, boys, it’s been a hell of a run.

We’ve been metaphorically standing on the neck of so many people for so long that I don’t think we can cry about them scratching at our ankles, telling us they can’t breathe.

To my fellow SWMs who have been resisting, please pull the car over. Take your hands off the wheel, sit in the passenger seat and just observe, maybe listen for a bit.

It doesn’t have to be emasculating or an existential threat.

Let’s just learn to take turns.

Make no mistake, things are a lot better for the non-SWM community today than they were even 20, 100, or certainly 1,000 years ago, but clearly we still have a ways to go.

99,"Although Colin Jost has worked at “Saturday Night Live” for nearly 15 years, it wasn’t until this past spring that he was able to watch his show the same way its audience does: from home on a Saturday night with a sense of anticipation and uncertainty.

The circumstances were not ideal. Amid the coronavirus pandemic, with its staff members sheltering in place, “SNL” finished its 45th season with three remotely produced episodes assembled from footage that cast members recorded on phones and other devices.

Until now, Jost said, he had avoided rewatching “SNL” from home, as a coping mechanism to survive the emotional ups and downs of making the show.

But with this ad hoc production process, Jost, a longtime “SNL” head writer and an anchor of its Weekend Update desk, said he was genuinely surprised by his colleagues’ creations.

Speaking by phone from Montauk, N.Y., where he has been these past four months, Jost told me, “It was really heartening to see people make things, to have no idea what they would be and then have them really make you laugh.”

At “SNL” in particular, he said, “you don’t get to step out of your own work and have that experience often.”

Jost, 38, has been in a retrospective mode for a while now, having been working on a memoir of his life and trajectory at “SNL,” where he has spent nearly his entire career. Not that his time there has been especially tumultuous or scandalous. But Jost knows many viewers believe he has coasted on his annoyingly clean-cut looks that, despite his underlying earnestness, can give him an air of insincerity.

As he writes in his memoir, “Some of you think you know me, but you’re actually just thinking of the villain from an ’80s movie who tries to steal the hero’s girlfriend by challenging him to a ski race.” (In acknowledgment of this, he titled the book “A Very Punchable Face.”)

In pre-pandemic times, Jost’s memoir, which Crown will publish Tuesday, might have come across as a victory lap for an author contemplating new horizons. But now the book reads like his appreciation for a comedy institution that he hopes will come back in its traditional, chaotic form as soon as possible.

As exhilarating and as frustrating as it was to make “SNL” from home, Jost told me, “You finish watching and then you’re just sitting on your couch. It’s a lot less fun than getting to celebrate or commiserate with your friends.”

In early March, when such things were still permissible, I met with Jost in his office at NBC’s Rockefeller Plaza headquarters. With no particular sense of urgency, we talked about “A Very Punchable Face,” a book that is partly an account of his awkward coming-of-age in Staten Island and partly a recap of his relatively smooth career path from the Harvard Lampoon to “SNL” to Weekend Update, which he anchors with Michael Che.

When I asked him why he had written a memoir — a step rarely taken by “SNL” alums, let alone by someone still working at the show — Jost told me he felt he had reached “the end of what felt like a defined chapter in my life.”

Referring to his relationship with actor Scarlett Johansson, Jost said, “I’m about to get married. I now almost have a stepdaughter who I love and is a big part of my life now. I’m starting to do more and more outside of the show. It felt like the right time to look back.”

Within days, “SNL” announced that it was suspending the rest of its live season and seemed unlikely to return. Gradually, however, its producers began strategizing to write and perform the show from home, a plan that at one point would have leaned more heavily on contributions from the Weekend Update desk.

But, said Jost, “We felt like everyone needed an outlet who was working at the show, and I think people wanted to see the whole cast.”

If Jost followed one of the most reliable industry routes to arrive at “SNL,” his colleagues said he was never content to coast on his pedigree and earned his keep there every week.

“He seemed like he was a child,” said Andy Samberg, who joined the “SNL” cast in 2005, the same year that Jost started there as a writer.

“But,” Samberg added, “it didn’t seem like, professionally speaking, he was out of his depths in the slightest. He was someone who was game to write with anybody and he was also a guy who would lock himself in his office and write something hilarious by himself.”

Che, who became Jost’s co-anchor in 2014, said that they found it challenging at the start of their partnership to put a personal stamp on Weekend Update and escape the influence of numerous celebrated predecessors.

“The first season or two, the only thing you’re thinking about is how to do the segment the way other people have done the segment,” Che said, adding that he and Jost were seeking a way to do it “just for us — there was no template for it.”

What has succeeded for them, Che said, are recurring bits like the one where they read jokes sight-unseen that they have written for each other (and which Che often writes to make Jost sound racist).

“I guess if you look at Colin and you don’t know him, if someone told you that he was a racist, you’d be like, yeah, maybe,” Che said. “He couldn’t be further from it, which is why it’s so funny. I literally try to come up with the worst possible things for him to say, because there’s nothing really bad to say about him.”

Jost gets a bit more introspective in “A Very Punchable Face,” looking back on a childhood in which he did not begin speaking in full sentences until he was nearly four and an adolescence in which he struggled with his weight.

As he told me, “My confidence throughout my life was always about being creative, feeling like I was funny or smart. I never feel confident about my physical appearance. There’s still that chubby kid inside of me.”

Jost hastened to add that, in the book and in life, “I’m not really ever looking for sympathy from anybody. If people hate me, I understand it. I also hate myself sometimes.”

Near the end of the book, Jost writes that he is “preparing mentally to leave ‘SNL’ in the future” and getting ready “to sleep semiregular hours and write without the constant swirling pressure of a live show every Saturday night.”

But when we spoke in June, Jost sounded less committed to this hazy exit plan. After working on the at-home episodes, he said, “It made me even more appreciative of my job and my friends at work, the energy and the joy of doing the show. That makes me want to stick around more.”

In the coronavirus era, Jost said, it was difficult to make plans with any sense of foresight or optimism. “It hits you in waves, of having hope or feeling normal for a second, and then lurching the other way,” he said.

But when he thought back on his first mass Zoom conversation with his “SNL” colleagues, as they planned for their first at-home episodes, Jost sounded like he was looking forward to many more such interactions at the show.

“We’d all been in these weird bubbles,” Jost said.

“You start thinking, how can you ever do comedy in times like this? And then you’re around funny people and you have no choice. Everyone just has it in their bones.”

100,"LONDON -- British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Friday that people will no longer be told to work from home and avoid public transit in a major easing of lockdown restrictions -- even as he said the government was ""preparing for the worst"" in case of a new coronavirus spike this winter.

Johnson said the government's advice to avoid non-essential use of public transit was being lifted immediately, and that from Aug. 1 workers would no longer be told to do their jobs from home, if possible. He said it will now be up to to businesses to determine whether they can bring employees back to workplaces in a ""COVID-secure"" way.

The U.K.'s official pandemic death toll, which stood at more than 45,000 as of Friday, has for several weeks been the highest in Europe and the third-highest in the world behind the United States and Brazil.

Johnson is trying to walk a tightrope, avoiding a resurgence of the virus while also encouraging a return to shops, restaurants and workplaces to kick-start a moribund economy that has shrunk by a quarter since March.

While some businesses have seen customers return in previous stages of lockdown easing, those that rely on office workers struggling, and Johnson is keen to see more people go back to city-centre workplaces.

But the prime minister's move to give employers ""more discretion"" about whether to ask their staffs to return to regular work locations appears at odds with the views of his chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance,, who said Thursday that there was ""absolutely no reason"" to change the work-from-home advice.

Johnson said he was not ordering people back to the office.

""Obviously it's not for government to decide how employers should run their companies and whether they want their workers in the office or not,"" he said.

The announcements apply only in England. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland all have their own public health systems and are reopening at slightly different speeds.

At a news conference, Johnson set out more details of the U.K.'s road out of a nationwide lockdown that was imposed in March but is gradually being eased. Shops, pubs, restaurants and hair salons have already reopened in England, and Johnson said they can be joined as of Aug. 1 by beauticians, casinos, bowling alleys and skating rinks. Nightclubs will remain closed.

He said indoor performances would be able to restart in August ""subject to the success of pilots"" and sports fans should be able to return to stadiums in October.

Johnson said the measures could be reversed if coronavirus infection rates begin to climb again.

A report commissioned by scientific adviser Vallance said this week that there could be 120,000 hospital deaths in a ""reasonable worst-case scenario"" if a virus outbreak coincided with a bad flu season over the winter, though it stressed that was not a prediction.

Johnson said the government was preparing for winter by expanding capacity to test people for the virus, even if they have no symptoms. Currently, some 200,000 tests are performed a day, and Johnson said capacity would hit 500,000 a day by the end of October.

He also said local authorities would be given new powers to impose restrictions in response to localized outbreaks.

Johnson also announced 3 billion pounds ($3.8 billion) to help the country's health service cope with a possible second wave of the virus.

The money will allow the state-funded National Health Service to buy up space in private hospitals and maintain a string of temporary hospitals that were built rapidly around the country as the outbreak accelerated in the spring.

The ""Nightingale hospitals"" ended up treating few patients, but the government wants to keep the spare capacity in case a new wave of COVID-19 cases coincides with the winter flu season.

""It's possible that the virus will be more virulent in the winter months, and it's certain that the NHS will face the usual annual winter pressures,"" Johnson said.

He said the government's strategy was to ""hope for the best but to plan for the worst.""",U.K.'s Johnson nudges workers back to office as lockdown eases,2,0.05612329752074041
103,"CALGARY -- With a cluster of COVID-19 cases linked to a Calgary restaurant and multiple cases connected to a couple of fitness centres, some are wondering whether Alberta might soon return to stricter measures.

Five cases of COVID-19 have been linked by Alberta Health Services to the Cactus Club in downtown Calgary — two staff members and three patrons — and two cases of the virus have been linked to RIDE CYCLE CLUB, including employees of other fitness centres. Several businesses made the decision to temporarily close as a result and urged recent guests to consider getting tested.

“While AHS has not mandated it, we have decided to voluntarily close this location out of an abundance of caution to ensure the health of everyone,” Cactus Club spokesperson said in a statement.

It added the restaurant would undergo a deep clean of the restaurant and would likely reopen early next week.

Anyone who visited the Cactus Club restaurant on Stephen Avenue between July 2 and 10 is asked to monitor symptoms and contact health authorities if needed.

YYC Cycle is asking anyone who visited its studios since July 2 to do the same.

“We got word of a potential outbreak of a soon-to-be-open studio in Calgary and once that happened, we understood that there may have been a couple of staff members of ours that attended those private classes,” said Andrew Obrecht, co-owner of YYC Cycle.

“After that we did find out two staff members did test positive for COVID.”

He said the businesses has chosen to close its doors until the weekend and has been busy contacting recent guests.

“We have heard from AHS that because of the protocols and procedures in our studios, those riders that would be in the classes that those staff were in would not have been considered high risk, but of course we can’t take any chances.”

Other fitness centres that have also chosen to close temporarily because of possible exposure of their staff include Rhythym Ride and Kult Fitness.

The latest clusters come as Alberta has seen the number of new cases in the province above 80 each of the past few days.

An infectious disease specialist said many have been wary of a ""second wave"" but in science numbers don’t always clearly indicate that.

“I’m not sure we’re ever going to see these classic waves where we have a level of infection that drops down to a level of zero and then another big uptick,” said Craig Jenne from the Cumming School of Medicine.

“Unfortunately it’s still in our community so we are going to continue to see outbreaks. The key right now is to keep them small.”

He said the difference about the daily number of cases now as opposed to in March is that positive measures such as masks, social distancing and testing are now in place.",Calgary restaurant and fitness clubs closed due to COVID-19 concerns,5,0.19983942017714307

107,"TORONTO -- Atlantic Canada’s reputation for being warm and welcoming has long been a source of pride.

But instead of hospitality, the pandemic is exposing a glimpse of hostility aimed at those who are assumed to be outsiders.

""Being from Halifax, growing up here all but eight years of my life, I really didn't expect this,” resident Tony Mountenay told CTV News.

Tony and Debbie Mountenay chose to return to Nova Scotia during the pandemic because they were looking for a laid back retirement.

As required, they isolated after they arrived. But then they decided to go out and run errands.

""And we had three different incidents where people came up beside us, yelling at us, through the window, and when it first happened, we had to try to think, well what was that about?” Debbie said.

The answer was the licence plate on their truck — showing that they came from Ontario.

Visitors from beyond the “Atlantic bubble” have been vilified by locals fearing the virus could be imported.

Though relatively rare, there have been incidents of “plate-shaming.”

A woman from Quebec was told to go home while walking on a New Brunswick beach.

More than 15,000 Newfoundlanders signed a petition demanding their province not open the border to anyone.

Debbie said one woman who had harassed the couple had done so in front of her own children.

“She really shouldn't have been doing that in my opinion,” she said. “Another man, you could tell he was out of control.""

The Atlantic bubble, which encompasses the provinces of New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador, is a concept that was introduced recently to allow easier travel between the Eastern provinces as the region reopens.

People from all across Canada are allowed to travel to any Atlantic province, but those outside of the Atlantic bubble must isolate for 14 days — as leaders in the region are quick to remind people.

""The Atlantic bubble is open today, [but] that does not apply to those who are from Ontario, Quebec or Western Canada,” Nova Scotia Premier Stephen McNeil said. “If you're coming into our province, you're required to self isolate as well.""

The Atlantic provinces have largely fared well during the pandemic compared to provinces such as Ontario or Quebec. Of the Atlantic provinces, Nova Scotia has had the most cases in total, at just over 1,000 — a far cry from Quebec’s 56,521 cumulative cases.

The stress for locals in the Atlantic provinces is that out-of-bubble visitors could lead to a second wave of the virus.

Only last week, a string of new cases in Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island were proven to be related to travel from outside of the bubble. One individual flew from the United States to Toronto, and then to Halifax. This case was then connected to cases in Prince Edward Island.

McNeil said on July 6 that he is frustrated with travellers who do not isolate for the 14 days after they arrive.

“We have worked hard together and sacrificed so much in this province to help flatten the curve only to have some people come into our province who think they’re above it all, who think that the rules don’t apply to them,” he said. “Guess what? They do.”

But the Mountenay’s experience in Nova Scotia suggests that the uncertainty over who has isolated and who has not has led to some rather un-neighbourly behaviour.

In response, the couple has come with a way to alert people they’re not a threat. A piece of paper that clearly states a person has completed isolation.

""I don't want to get [COVID-19],” Debbie said. “And I don't want to give it to anybody.""",Plate-shaming' is happening in Atlantic Canada as locals fear those from outside the 'bubble',5,0.3460779190181549
108,"TORONTO -- Civil liberties groups are launching legal action against an Ontario law that lets the government provide police with personal information about people who tested positive for COVID-19.

The province announced in April that it would provide first responders with a database detailing the name, date of birth and address of all patients who tested positive for the virus.

The Canadian Civil Liberties Association (CCLA) and its partners have now served a notice of application to begin a legal challenge at the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in an effort to stop the provincial government from disclosing the information to police.

“Individual Ontarians’ health information is among the most sensitive personal information the government holds,” Abby Deshman, the director of the criminal justice program at CCLA, said in a statement.

Deshman said that given ""patchy nature of COVID testing and the risk of asymptomatic spread,"" police should not rely on test results to keep safe from the disease. Instead, she said, police should practice the same public health advice the rest of the province is following.

Deshman added that sharing COVID-19 test results with police is “not necessary, and in fact undermines an effective public health approach to this pandemic.”

A spokesperson for the Ontario Ministry of the Solicitor General confirmed with CTV News Toronto on Friday that the government was served with a notice.

“On July 7, 2020, Ontario was served with the Notice of Application for Judicial Review,” the spokesperson stated. “As this matter is subject to litigation, it would be inappropriate to comment further.”

In a previous statement, the province said that the measures were taken under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act to protect first responders by allowing access to the information of people they come into contact with amid the pandemic.

“Once the declaration of emergency is lifted, this data will be made inaccessible to first responders,” the province said in a statement in April.

But the groups involved in the legal action, including the Aboriginal Legal Services, the Black Legal Action Centre and the HIV and AIDS Legal Clinic Ontario, say the measure violates their constitutional rights to privacy and equality.

The groups, including the CCLA, argue that the measure also breaches provincial health privacy protections and is not authorized by Ontario’s emergency legislation.

“Police involvement in public health matters impedes effective public health responses,” said Khalid Janmohamed, a lawyer with the HIV and AIDS Legal Clinic Ontario.

“People are less likely to get tested or seek treatment because they are afraid of being targeted by police. We have seen this happen in relation to the criminalization of people living with HIV and people who use drugs.”

The groups say they wrote and sent a letter to Ontario’s Solicitor General on April 22 about their concerns, but have yet to receive a response.",Groups launch legal action against Ontario for sharing COVID-19 data with police,2,0.5384787957378443
112,"SUDBURY -- In the second new case reported in northeastern Ontario on Wednesday, a staff member at Extendicare in Timmins has tested positive for COVID-19.

The Porcupine Health Unit has declared at outbreak at the home.

""One staff member without symptoms tested positive,"" the health unit said in a news release. ""Extendicare has continued to test all staff for COVID-19 regularly as part of the enhanced surveillance initiative currently being implemented in long-term care facilities.""

Currently, the case is the only positive result at the home at this time.

""While the individual is an employee at the facility, all infection prevention measures have been followed,"" the release said. ""This individual is in isolation at home, and the investigation remains ongoing.""

This is the 69th case in the health unit's coverage area, and follows another new case reported Wednesday by Algoma Public Health earlier in the day.

""All Algoma residents must continue to practice physical distancing because any close contact could be a possible exposure,"" the health unit said.

It marks the 26th case in Algoma and the individual is self-isolating at home. The source of exposure for both new cases is unknown.

""This serves as an important reminder that we need to remain vigilant, COVID-19 is still circulating,"" the Porcupine Health Unit said. ""It is strongly recommended that all community members follow the measures proven to reduce the risk of spread – physical distancing, hand washing, cough and sneeze etiquette, not touching your face and washing commonly touched surfaces.""

Residents are urged to wear a non-medical mask or face covering when inside public spaces, and, outdoors if physical distancing is a challenge.

B.C. health officials have confirmed 21 new cases of COVID-19, marking five days in a row of higher daily case counts.

Three of the new cases are epi-linked, which means the person did not test positive for the virus but displayed some symptoms after being in close contact with an infected person or work in a facility with a known outbreak.

That brings the total number of active confirmed cases to 192, provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said in a news conference on Thursday (July 16).

Fifteen people are in hospital with three of those in intensive care. There were no new deaths since Wednesday afternoon.

Since the novel coronavirus was first confirmed in B.C. in February, there have been 3,170 confirmed cases.

The new cases were announced on the same day that results of a study by a group of B.C. researchers was released, suggesting eight times more people in B.C. have been infected with COVID-19 than the confirmed test stats.

Henry said that serology testing will help determine if transmission has been missed “when cases pop up out of nowhere seemingly.”

She says when an outbreak occurred in Alert Bay off northern Vancouver Island, the province did serology testing on residents there.

“That gives us a better idea of how this virus is transmitted in community settings so we can more nimbly target outbreaks as we go into the fall,” she said.

My first priority as Mayor has always been to protect this wonderful community. As we respond to the crisis presented by COVID-19 under the State of Local Emergency, this priority is more important than ever. We have now over 2,000 confirmed cases in Canada.

I was disappointed and surprised to learn about the large number of Delta residents, young and old, that are ignoring the plea of our Provincial Medical Health Officer to distance ourselves by at least 2 metres to combat the spread of this invisible deadly virus. TWO METRES OF SOCIAL SEPARATION MUST be practiced by everyone. The global reality is that this virus will cause deaths in our City.

It is not OK to be physically close to your friends and neighbours during this pandemic. Instead, use technology and other means to remain socially connected.

We must heed the orders of the Provincial Medical Health Officer. As the Mayor, I am determined to use all powers under our Local State of Emergency to ensure our community is safe. I am directing City staff to take swift action to ensure compliance with the orders.

Our Police Officers and Bylaw Inspectors are responding to violations of these orders in addition to regular calls for service. You can help preserve their resources for real emergencies by obeying the orders and gauging the importance of your calls. Always call 911 in an emergency, but consider the situation before calling for routine issues. Call 811 if you have a non-urgent health question. Be patient. Delta staff are working hard to implement Delta’s emergency plan during this critical time.

As Mayor, I am pleading with everyone to take strong actions now while we can still limit the spread of this virus. We are running out of time. I am imploring everyone in Delta to stay home except for essential trips. Stay away from large gatherings in our popular parks and leisure destinations. Walk in your neighbourhood. Stay separate so we can protect not just ourselves, but also those in the community who are most vulnerable to the severity of COVID19. Everyone needs to do their part.

Make sure that you are not passing on this deadly virus and make sure you are not positioning yourself to receive it.

Our incredible Delta Staff, Police and Firefighters are working tirelessly to try to reduce illness and deaths due to the COVID-19 virus.

We cannot do it alone. It is the civic duty of all community members to serve our city, and our country, by staying home. We can only lessen the illnesses and deaths from COVID-19 with your involvement now.",Mayor urges Delta residents to follow COVID-19 precautions – North Delta Reporter,5,0.1772112589385827
115,"OTTAWA—A national clinical trial this summer will focus on protecting cancer patients against severe COVID-19 infection by attempting to boost their compromised immune systems.

Researchers from the Ottawa Hospital say they want to explore the potential of IMM-101, a preparation featuring a dead pathogen containing properties that can stimulate the “first-response arm” of the immune system.

Study lead Dr. Rebecca Auer, surgical oncologist and director of cancer research at the Ottawa Hospital, says it could help experts understand why some COVID-19 patients are relatively asymptomatic while others end up in intensive care or die.

“The difference, it seems, between these two different presentations has to do with how strong your innate, or your sort of non-specific, first-line defence immune system response is to the virus,” Auer said Wednesday.

“And so we’re hoping that by boosting and stimulating this innate immune response, particularly in those vulnerable patients that have a reduced immune response to begin with, we’d be able to prevent symptomatic infections and prevent serious infections.”

Cancer patients are at much higher risk of severe complications from COVID-19 because chemotherapy, cancer surgery and radiation treatments suppress innate immunity even further.

Auer points to an “urgent need” to protect them while the world waits for an effective COVID-19 vaccine, which could take another year or more to develop, test and implement.

A successful trial could also protect cancer patients against other respiratory infections as well as the coming flu season, says Auer, noting the threat of illness is a fairly big problem for those undergoing treatment.

“A study demonstrated that about 13 to 15 per cent of cancer patients will have to delay or stop their treatment because of influenza during the average flu season,” she says.

“And also, cancer patients don’t respond as well to the influenza vaccine every year because their immune system isn’t as strong. So we think that the IMM-101 may in itself be able to help prevent symptomatic influenza infections.”

Auer says IMM-101 has also been tested elsewhere for its anti-cancer properties and that, too, will be examined in this trial, although it’s not the primary objective.

The researchers say the bacteria, Mycobacterium obuense, is safe to use in cancer patients because it has been killed by heat.

The Canadian study will recruit 1,500 patients currently receiving cancer treatment, and participants will be randomly assigned to receive either regular care or regular care plus IMM-101.

Auer says the treatment would be administered as an injection in the arm, to be followed by two more booster shots.

Researchers will follow patients for a year, watching for any respiratory infections and monitoring whether the treatment works and how long it lasts.

The trials will take place in eight centres located in Ontario, British Columbia and Quebec.

Researchers say people interested in participating should speak with their cancer specialist.

Researchers from the Ottawa Hospital came up with the idea and worked with the Canadian Cancer Trials Group at Queen’s University to design the trial.

Dr. Chris O’Callaghan of the Queen’s University group notes cancer patients are also at greater risk of COVID-19 infection because they require regular medical care, making it difficult to adhere fully to public health guidelines.

“These patients are unable to practise social isolation due to the need to regularly attend hospital to receive critically important cancer treatment,” says O’Callaghan, who will oversee the trial.

Auer says a successful trial of IMM-101 could also suggest usefulness in treating any patient with a reduced innate immune system, such as older patients with chronic illness.

She notes that the tuberculosis vaccine known as BCG — which uses a similar formulation to IMM-101 but uses live bacteria instead of dead bacteria — is being tested around the world to see if it can boost the immunity of health-care workers exposed to COVID-19.

Funding and in-kind support, valued at $2.8 million, comes from the Canadian Cancer Society, BioCanRx, the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, the Ottawa Hospital Foundation, the Ottawa Hospital Academic Medical Organization, ATGen Canada/NKMax and Immodulon Therapeutics, the manufacturer of IMM-101.",Cancer trial to focus on protecting patients from COVID-19 infection,8,0.5844608707784413
120,"TORONTO -- When a group of kids were invited for a playdate last month in six-year-old Gaby Munshaw’s neighbourhood, she was told she couldn’t join the fun.

The Ontario girl had been out riding bikes with friends on June 16, when the parent of a different set of children invited the young cyclists over to his yard.

But Gaby’s mother said that because she is a front-line pandemic worker, her child was excluded.

“He told her that she wasn’t allowed to play because the kids were afraid of her,” Crystal Munshaw told CTVNews.ca over the phone on Thursday. “Because her mommy is a COVID nurse and she might have COVID. My daughter came home in hysterics and hid behind a tree.”

Munshaw, who has since taken a leave from work at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Barrie, to be near Gaby more, hasn’t hugged her daughter in months. She has been living in a trailer parked in the backyard of the Midland home where her parents live with the girl. Only a handful of employees at the hospital have been diagnosed with COVID-19 since the pandemic began, she said, noting that none were direct-care staff and all were believed to have contracted the virus in the community, not at the hospital.

The rejection Gaby faced because of her mother’s job has been difficult for the girl. She cried herself to sleep that night, said Munshaw.

“It’s heartbreaking,” she said. “This kid is broken and hurting.”

Gaby may not be alone, according to a new Statistics Canada report. Of more than 4,000 respondents in Canadian Perspectives Survey Series, about one in five said they fear being exposed to COVID-19 stigmatization as public health restrictions lift across the country. About one in ten said they feared stigma associated with their work at a hospital or other health-care facility.

The social consequences felt by health-care workers has been evident throughout the pandemic, including reports in some countries of nurses being “assaulted, abused and ostracized.” In New Brunswick, a doctor gained international attention when he was blamed for causing a cluster of COVID-19 cases after crossing provinces to pick up his young daughter because the girl's mother had to attend a funeral in Africa.

The new Statistics Canada report suggests there is considerable social fear among Canadians beyond contracting the virus itself. But for Munshaw, this isn’t about being afraid anymore.

“It’s not a fear. It’s reality,” she told CTVNews.ca.

“I know I can’t be alone. I’ve now been off work for three weeks because I’m having panic attacks every time I think about going back… and how it’s going to affect her and how I help her through it. The stigma is real.”

Our new article examines which groups of people feel more afraid of unwanted or intimidating acts or behaviours because they may be judged as putting others at risk of contracting #COVID19. Here are some of the reasons people fear being stigmatized: https://t.co/kYcdNaByHc pic.twitter.com/hUTH3VHAtx — Statistics Canada (@StatCan_eng) July 15, 2020

Despite the stigma that Munshaw and her daughter have experienced, children are at far lower risk of contracting COVID-19, according to available data. Across Canada, there have been fewer than 8,000 known cases of the virus in children and teens and only one death among people under the age of 20, though much is unclear about that solitary case.

While children may be less vulnerable to the health effects of COVID-19 as a disease, parents have expressed concerns about setbacks in numerous other areas, including social, behavioural and academic regression.

Social consequences related to stigmatization are best combated with education, says Toronto pediatrician Dr. Dina Kulik.

“Empowerment comes from education,” she told CTVNews.ca over the phone on Thursday. “Let’s say you have a seven-year-old and they’re being bullied or shunned because they have a runny nose. Let’s teach our kid to express through education why it is that they’re not a risk to other people. Or teaching them: ‘This is why we’re going to stay two metres away from people, this is why we’re wearing a mask, why we’re washing our hands.’ If they understand how to protect themselves and others, and they come into a situation where others are judging them, they can use that knowledge to educate others to minimize or lessen the burden of that stigma.”

This type of strategy may be easier for some children than others, suggested Munshaw, whose daughter has a speech delay that worsens in stressful situations. Munshaw wishes more adults would be educated about risk levels, too.

“Guaranteed I’m not the only one dealing with this with a child. Guaranteed I’m not the only health-care worker being treated like garbage because you are a COVID nurse and people are uneducated,” she said.

“At a time when we’re saying ‘We’re all in this together,’ we’re not.”

Since the incident in June, Munshaw reached out to two of Gaby’s friends who also have front-line worker parents. Gaby has had playdates with each of them now this month. They’ve been swimming, had a bonfire, and played in the rain with water guns.

Gaby still knows that kids are “afraid of her,” Munshaw said, but small moments have been helping. Earlier this week, a neighbourhood friend biked by and asked if Gaby wanted to join.

“She flew off the porch so quick,” her mom said. “She went for a bike ride twice around the block and came back and said to my mom, ‘See, I do have a friend.’”",The stigma is real': Front-line pandemic worker says her child was shunned by neighbours,5,0.25529404008730594

The claim says Paul passed away on May 16 as a result of COVID-19 and/or neglect at the age of 102.

On May 2, the lawsuit claims, Paul’s family noticed cognitive changes in her and as the week progressed she began having difficulty eating and drinking without assistance.

The family was advised on May 7 that she’d been tested for COVID-19 but they claim they were not informed the test was positive until May 12. Their claim alleges that from that time on, they made numerous efforts to get information from staff but were either provided “conflicting and/or incorrect information or no information at all.”

The lawsuit alleges that the home and Sienna Senior Living “failed to protect residents through inadequate preventative and responsive measures” to the pandemic and that neglect resulted in a “mass spread” at the home.

It also alleges that due to staffing shortages, residents were left with substandard care leading to dehydration, malnutrition and other physical ailments.

Speaking on behalf of Sienna Senior Living Thursday, Swaraj Mann indicated they’ve seen reports of the proposed class action but had yet to receive a copy of the claim.

“We intend to respond in due course through the appropriate court processes,” she said.

This is the third lawsuit to be filed against Sienna Senior Living by Thomson, Rogers.

A $20-million class action suit was filed June 1 on behalf of the residents of Scarborough’s Altamont Home, where more than 50 residents have died. It was also one of five cited in a scathing Canadian military report.

On June 15, a $15-million class-action suit was filed against Woodbridge Vista Care Community, where more than 20 residents have passed away due to COVID-19.

124,"Ontario public health officials are generally encouraged by the COVID-19 trends as a large portion of the province gets set to enter Stage 3 on Friday.

Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. David Williams said there were 111 new cases reported Thursday for a total of 37,163.

Another five people with COVID-19 passed away, and 2,737 have died in all during the pandemic.

Regions held back from Stage 3 — including the Greater Toronto Area — will learn next week if they’ll be able to move forward with reopening.

York Region saw 10 new cases, Windsor-Essex 14, Peel 25 and Toronto 30.

“So we see the numbers staying low in each of those jurisdictions,” Williams said. “Twenty-nine of our 34 health units had five or fewer cases and 20 actually had no cases at all.”

Hospitalization data also shows a decrease in the number of people in need of serious medical intervention, he said.

A weekly analysis of COVID-19 in Ontario released Thursday showed 877 new cases over the past seven days.

“That’s the fewest — it’s under 1,000 — in a long time,” Williams said. “So even that total amount for the week is down to show you the consistency of the decline in the number of cases in this time period.”

125,"As India saw a record jump in coronavirus cases over the weekend, the bulk of the nation’s attention was on Amitabh Bachchan, the country’s biggest movie star, and his family, who are now among the 906,000-plus infected. The 77-year-old Bollywood patriarch’s image is ubiquitous across the country on advertisements for everything from hair oil to cement, and his infection — along with actor son Abhishek, daughter-in-law Aishwarya Rai and granddaughter Aaradhya — ignited something akin to an outpouring of national grief. Bachchan’s illness also highlighted one of India’s most acute and chronic inequalities that’s been accentuated by the pandemic: access to quality health care. He and his son were hospitalized in one of Mumbai’s best private hospitals, although they had only mild symptoms, at a time when ordinary citizens have been struggling to find a bed in crowded state-run hospitals, or are being denied medical care by private facilities outright. As India struggles to contain the world’s third-largest outbreak — adding nearly 30,000 new cases every day — such inequalities will make it even harder to stem the pathogen’s spread. “The double standard is the rich get treated in India and the poor don’t,” said Leena Menghaney, a lawyer and public health activist based in New Delhi. “That’s very starkly played out in the fact Amitabh Bachchan has survived tuberculosis, he’s survived hepatitis B, and now he will get some of the best treatment for COVID-19.” As the outbreak intensified in recent months, government hospitals have become overwhelmed — especially in Mumbai and New Delhi, the two worst-hit cities. Widely reported instances of some private hospitals and doctors refusing to treat COVID-19 patients have been blamed for deepening the crisis. The private sector accounts for around 60 per cent of India’s total hospital bed capacity. Shocking stories abound: a patient in Mumbai was asked to sleep on the floor until a bed was available in state-run facility, while another woman suffering brain damage was turned away by private hospitals which would not treat her unless she had a certificate proving she was virus-free. A pregnant woman died in May after being denied help by three private hospitals in the outskirts of Mumbai. Virus Dashboard The health care facilities in Mumbai have since been bolstered, with the local government taking over 80 per cent of the beds in private hospitals, drafting doctors into compulsory virus duty and setting up a dashboard showing the availability of beds for COVID-19 patients. But the speed and ease with which citizens can access these facilities differs. In June, a government survey conducted by Ayushman Bharat, an agency that administers a health insurance scheme for the poor, found that 22 of 101 private hospitals had provided so few services that they were deemed inactive. Out of a group of 96 private hospitals asked if they’d provided any COVID-19 treatment, 81 said no. The Bachchans encountered no such difficulties when they fell ill and were admitted to Mumbai’s Nanavati Hospital, a private facility close to their home. Bachchan emerged as Bollywood’s premier superstar in the 1970s and is seen as India’s answer to Robert DeNiro or Al Pacino, playing “angry young men” characters battling corrupt establishments. While other actors of his generation have seen their fame fade away, Bachchan has only grown in stature. Besides dozens of endorsement deals and critically acclaimed film work, he also hosts the Indian edition of “Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?” and cameod in the 2013 Hollywood film, “The Great Gatsby.” His son Abhishek, also a superstar, is married to actor and former beauty queen Aishwarya Rai in one of Asia’s most famous and photogenic unions. “He’s considered to be sort of a national treasure so if something happens to Amitabh Bachchan it’s considered to be a failure of the government,” said Menghaney, the health care activist in Delhi. Slum Dwellers Despite the Bachchans’ infection, COVID-19 remains largely a disease of the poor in India, with hot spots concentrated in slums and tenements where social distancing is all but impossible. Many there depend on daily wages and cannot work from home. And even if beds are available in private hospitals, few can afford them. As the lockdown is eased across India and Mumbai’s elite start allowing their cleaners, cooks and drivers to return to their homes, the health of the city’s richest people will remain intertwined with its poorest. “The private health-care system has completely failed on this occasion. The message is that if you don’t pay to take care of the health of the poorest, the richest are also not going to be safe,” said T. Sundararaman, the New Delhi based global co-ordinator of the People’s Health Movement, a health care access advocacy group. “Therefore universal access to health care should be seen as a universal public good.”",Bollywood legend’s COVID-19 infection exposes Indian inequities,5,0.014559974924812313
127,"OTTAWA — A recent spike in coronavirus cases in Canada is worrying and can be linked to groups of young people gathering in bars and nightclubs and at parties, a top medical official said on Friday.

“When we examine recent trends in case reporting, there is some cause for concern. After a period of steady decline, daily case counts have started to rise,” Howard Njoo, the deputy chief public health officer, told a briefing.

The daily case count rose to an average of 350 over the last week up from 300 a day earlier in July, Njoo said. More than 430 cases were reported on Thursday.

“This coincides with increasing reports of individuals contracting COVID-19 at parties, nightclubs and bars as well as increasing rates of transmission among young Canadians,” Njoo said.

“Singing, mingling and dancing in close contact with others in closed spaces and crowded places is not the way to party this summer. These are ideal conditions for the spread of COVID-19.”

Canada has reported 109,266 total cases and 8,827 deaths, far fewer than the United States.

Officials and experts this week said they saw signs of a new spike as the 10 provinces lifted social and economic restrictions imposed in March to fight the outbreak.

“Our relative success is fragile. … There is always a bit of a fatigue factor and certainly I think that’s come into play a bit now, especially with the warmer weather,” Njoo said.",Recent spike in Canadian COVID-19 cases is worrying: Medical official,5,0.2495592256534228
128,"WELLINGTON COUNTY — Robert Case first heard about the issues with water-taking in Centre Wellington when he moved to Guelph in 2007. He was dropping his daughter off at her bus stop, and a neighbour had brought post cards raising concerns about water bottling permits to send to the Ontario Ministry of Environment. Today Case is the board chair for the Wellington Water Watchers and last week witnessed the ousting of Nestlé from the county. “Good for us that we raised enough of a stink to make it uncomfortable for Nestlé to do business here,” he says. “But let’s finish the job by pushing our government to start phasing out permits to take water for bottling completely,” Case says. “It’s great Nestlé is leaving, but it’s still the same problem.” The sale of the Nestlé infrastructure to Ice River Springs water bottling company is still under review by the Competition Bureau of Canada, the federal organization that reviews all company sales to protect competition in the marketplace. Case speculates that once Ice River Springs takes over Nestle’s Ontario plants and well, they’ll have a monopoly on water bottling in the province.  Ice River Springs, a private company, portrays itself as a family-owned business invested in sustainability and environment. The company says all their bottles are made from 100 per cent recycled plastic made at their Shelburne recycling plant and plans to do the same at the former Nestlé plants. They report they use 85 per cent of the PET recycled material in Ontario’s blue box program.  Sandy Gott, Ice River Springs’ executive VP and co-owner says the company has invested $30 million in plastics recycling, and takes in 65 million pounds of plastic per year. But Case doesn’t buy it. “It looks like a lot of greenwashing if you ask me,” he says. “Water doesn’t require plastic.” Though he admits, “It’s interesting that they’ve found ways to recycle plastic.”  The Grand River Source Water Protection Committee and Centre Wellington, a township next to the Middlebrook well, reported in May that private permits to take water do not have a major impact on municipal water levels, because they are usually too far from municipal wells. But Case feels this misses the point. “I approach it with a more precautionary, conservation lens,” he says. “The question of affecting water flows is only one part of the equation.” Case feels that regardless of the amount of water taken, people need to ask why the water is being taken, for whose benefit and at what cost. “Water is for life, not profit,” he says. The sale involves all of Nestle’s Purelife brand bottled water infrastructure including a factory in Puslinch, Ontario and Hope, BC, as well as the Middlebrook well in Erin, Ontario.","Activist happy to see Nestlé go, seeks end to bottling permits",0,0.10948862729435938
129,"VANCOUVER—Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond says the greatest hurdle as she investigates a “game” in which B.C. doctors and nurses allegedly guessed the blood-alcohol levels of Indigenous patients may be hearing from the health-care workers who participated.

So she’s making the promise that any health-care worker with information about the racist practice — including those who participated or watched it happen — will not be reported to their bosses if they take part in the investigation.

Turpel-Lafond says she’s already hearing from Indigenous people from every corner of the province. The calls and stories recounting racist, sometimes harrowing treatment in emergency rooms have been “countless,” she said.

The Indigenous lawyer, who’s known for her child-welfare advocacy, was appointed by Health Minister Adrian Dix three weeks ago to lead an investigation. Since then, Turpel-Lafond has assembled an investigative team, launched a website, survey and phone line to deal with allegations that health-care staff made a game out of guessing the blood-alcohol levels of Indigenous patients in emergency rooms before treating them.

No health-care workers have yet been suspended as a result of the allegations, which Dix said weeks ago were credible enough to warrant the investigation.

Turpel-Lafond said the focus of the investigation will be to get to the bottom of what happened, not to “name and blame.”

The promise of confidentiality is not what some were hoping for initially.

Richard Jock, interim CEO of the First Nations Health Authority, a provincial body that delivers health services to 200 First Nation communities in B.C., said in a previous interview he was initially surprised to hear the allegations, but upon speaking to Indigenous doctors, found out that such things may be common in the province.

“This particular game may have been in play for many years,” he said.

Jock said it would be crucial for the investigation to reveal details of those involved in the practice, so that there can be professional action and accountability to the communities they serve.

Of note, B.C.’s legislation protecting whistleblowers does not yet apply to the health authorities.

Turpel-Lafond said the stories she’s heard over the past several weeks dealt specifically with the issue of the “disturbing” blood-alcohol guessing practice, as well as broader issues of anti-Indigenous racism faced by patients.

“As an Indigenous person, I’m not completely shocked. The stories that I’ve heard are very difficult stories,” she said. “In some instances, they’re stories where a person’s life has been lost. I certainly feel that pain that I’m hearing.”

Turpel-Lafond said it’s become clear to her that an investigation on this topic is overdue in B.C., and that she urgently needs to hear from Indigenous people and health-care professionals across the province to get to the bottom of the allegations.

She said, professional associations including Doctors of B.C. and the B.C. Nurses Union have been “unequivocal” in their support of her investigation.

“If there are obstacles and it cannot be done, we need to go down another path,” she said, referring to the possibility that she may recommend the investigation morph into an inquiry in the future.

She also said it’s crucial that even as disturbing allegations of treatment of Indigenous people emerge, First Nations, Métis and Inuit people should continue to seek out the health-care services they need, particularly as B.C. continues to face health crises from the COVID-19 virus and opioid overdoses.

Turpel-Lafond is known for delivering frank and thorough feedback on public-interest issues, particularly on the topic of child welfare. In 2015, she wrote an extensive report criticizing a government-commissioned report on child-welfare reforms, saying that not enough was done to consult Indigenous groups.

Turpel-Lafond said she hopes to have an initial report completed in a matter of months.

Washing your hands frequently and staying home when you’re feeling ill is more effective than facemasks in controlling the spread of a virus. (Black Press Media file)

With new novel Coronavirus cases emerging all over the world, health officials are urging residents to take precautionary measures to prevent more individuals from getting sick.

Canadian health officials are urging people to wash their hands frequently, with soap, for at least 20 seconds at a time and avoid touching their face or other people.

Handshakes and embraces should also be avoided.

“Wash our hands, stay home when you’re sick, stay home from school, stay home from public events, stay home from visiting people in long term health [facilities] and hospitals,” Health Minister Adrian Dix said at a news conference in early March.

Lucky for us, a 17-year-old developer from Oxford, England has designed an easy way to make sure we all properly wash our hands.

134,"KELOWNA, B.C.—British Columbia’s health minister says several COVID-19 exposures in Kelowna serve as a reminder of the risks posed by private gatherings.

Adrian Dix said during a news conference Monday that warnings of possible exposures at a restaurant, spin studio, bed and breakfast and resort are believed to stem from “private parties” at the hotels.

Eight positive tests for the disease are linked to visits to downtown Kelowna and the city’s waterfront between June 25 and July 9, said an email from Interior Health, the regional health authority.

“When people come together for private parties — in this case it was primarily people in their 20s and 30s — the risks are considerably higher,” Dix said.

The exposures follow the move to a new phase of reopening in B.C. that allows for tourism within the province. Although the accommodation industry was not ordered to close during the pandemic, many operators did so voluntarily but began welcoming guests again as part of the new phase.

Infections in B.C. inched up on Monday as health officials announced 62 new cases since Friday.

Two more people also died for a total of 189 deaths in B.C.

The new figures bring the total number of confirmed cases in the province to 3,115, while 2,718 people have fully recovered from COVID-19.

Interior Health also issued an isolation order for Krazy Cherry Fruit Co. in Oliver after two positive tests associated with the farm. Public health officials are monitoring the situation and placed restrictions on those living and working on the farm, the government said in a news release.

The cases linked to Kelowna involved people who live in three regions of the province, including the Interior, Fraser and Vancouver Coastal Health regions, said Dix. He credited contact tracers with making the connections.

He said the tourism industry has done a good job of creating safe environments for guests, but it’s also up to guests to ensure they respect physical distancing guidelines and group size limitations.

“Whether it’s a trip or a party at home, the same risks and the same rules apply,” Dix said.

If you’re gathering with friends and family, you should consider the increased risk that indoor locations pose and determine how many people can maintain a safe distance accordingly, he said.

“We have got to live with COVID-19 for the next year so that means the responsibility is on all of us to understand the risks and understand our responsibilities to one another.”

Interior Health issued an exposure advisory for the resort and bed and breakfast on Friday and added the restaurant and spin studio in a statement on Sunday.

Visitors to the Boyce Gyro Beach Lodge on July 1 or the Discovery Bay Resort from July 1 to July 5 were advised to self-isolate and monitor themselves closely for symptoms.

The health authority is now urging visitors to Kelowna’s Cactus Club restaurant on Water Street between July 3 and July 6, or the Pace Spin Studio on July 2, 4, 5, 7, 8 and 9 to self-monitor and get tested if COVID-19 symptoms appear.

The B.C. Centre for Disease Control also warns that a case or cases were confirmed on an Air Canada flight from Kelowna to Vancouver on July 6, but Dix could not say if that warning was linked.

Public health contact tracing is underway and the health authority said it’s reaching out directly to anyone who has been exposed, where possible.

Testing is recommended for anyone with novel coronavirus symptoms, including fever, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, or a loss of taste or smell, said Interior Health.

“Milder symptoms may include runny nose, fatigue, body aches ... diarrhea, headache, sore throat, vomiting and red eyes,” it said in a statement.

Anyone with even mild symptoms is urged to stay home and avoid travel.

Efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19 include physical distancing, regular hand washing, not touching the face and avoiding gatherings of more than 50 people, the health authority said.

135,"CAMBRIDGE — After living with severe jaw pain for over two years, Joyce Rendle was finally put on a short list to receive an MRI at Cambridge Memorial Hospital. The test was originally scheduled for August, but when Rendle received a call from the hospital a few weeks ago, she was optimistic there had been some cancellations and she would get in sooner. Instead, she was told that her test is currently deemed non-essential and the date had been cancelled indefinitely, due to the backlog caused by restrictions in place for the COVID-19 pandemic. “I can’t tell you how many nights I’ve been awake with pain and got down on my knees and just said ‘Please, I just need an answer.’ Then I have this MRI two months away and my hopes are crushed and there’s no hope in sight,” Rendle said. “I’m just desperate. This has really interfered with my quality of life.” On May 26, Ontario said hospitals could resume elective and non-essential surgeries and clinical activities put on hold in March, providing the hospitals met certain criteria. This included appropriate staffing levels, sufficient personal protective equipment (PPE) and maintaining an adequate hospital occupancy level. While Cambridge Memorial Hospital is making a gradual return to resuming these services, Sandra Hett, vice-president of clinical programs and chief nursing executive, said it’s “not business as usual yet.” That will likely be the case across Ontario for what could be longer than a year, Dr. Samantha Hill, president of the Ontario Medical Association said. Hospitals can’t get to the levels they were at before COVID because they still need to maintain precautions, Hill said. “That means spacing patients farther apart, that means a deeper clean between patients, it means everything takes longer to be done safely,” she said. “So you started with a system that already had wait lists, hallway medicine, et cetera, and it keeps getting worse.” In May, hospitals were to submit a plan to public health prior to resuming elective services, including a plan to book patients based on a prioritization scale. Hett said this scale is determined by Cancer Care Ontario Grand River and St. Mary’s hospitals confirm they are also undergoing similar processes. Lee Fairclough, president of St. Mary’s and Waterloo Wellington hospital lead for the pandemic response, said triaging and rescheduling will occur over many months and will be based on bed capacity. “This process has always existed, and there are times when procedures and surgeries unfortunately need to be postponed to accommodate more urgent and emergent cases,” she said.  “Under the new reality of COVID-19, some bed capacity must be maintained in case there is a surge in COVID cases, and hospitals must also have sufficient personal protective and other equipment, medications and human resources,” Fairclough said. In an email to the Cambridge Times, Ontario Health said it recognizes this is a difficult and distressing time, especially for patients waiting to receive the services they require; however, addressing the backlog will require different timing from hospital to hospital. Hill said that the best course of action at this point would be to get the Ministry of Health, government officials and representatives from the Ontario Medical Association to come together to work through the current problem. “It’s a real crisis. It’s not something that there is an easy answer for,” she said. “There are mitigating options that we can apply, but we need to figure it out together.” With files from Perth Courier.",Hospital backlog leaves Cambridge resident ‘desperate’ for new test date,8,0.2729144368186801

140,"TORONTO -- Vogue Portugal has come under fire for a cover for their “Madness” issue that appears to show nurses in a mental hospital pouring water on a model — imagery that advocates say trivializes and glamourizes mental health struggles.

The cover is one of four covers for the magazine’s July and August issue, and was revealed this week in a post on the magazine’s Instagram account.

“It’s about mental health,” the caption read. “It’s about time.”

The photo shows a nude model crouched in a bathtub in a larger room decorated in blue and white tile, with two nurses standing above her, dressed in old-fashioned uniforms.

The cover triggered a wave of criticism calling out the “offensive” and “disrespectful” concept.

Comments below the original Instagram post accused the magazine of attempting to “aestheticize” the struggles of mental health by using a mental health institution as a setting for a fashion shoot.

“MENTAL ILLNESS IS NOT AN EDITORIAL CONCEPT,” one Instagram user commented.

Vogue Portugal issued a statement on July 3 saying the cover was intended to “open up the topic of mental health” and spark “discussion.”

The magazine did not address the backlash directly in their statement, or address concerns that the cover was tone-deaf, but said that the issue itself contained interviews with psychologists “and other experts in the field.” They also said the theme of mental health was “not linked to the theme of madness, but instead [was] covered as an aspect of human emotions and behavior.”

They claim the design of the room depicted in the cover was formed after “deep research of hundreds of reportage photographs from some of the most relevant and famous documentarists who have captured mental health hospitals,” confirming that the cover is drawing on the history of mental health institutions for its aesthetic.

“We acknowledge the significance of the topic of mental health and our intention, through visual storytelling, is to shine a light on the important issues of today,” the statement reads.

Advocates say this defence misses the point completely.

Poorna Bell, a journalist and author who has spoken up about mental health advocacy since losing her husband to suicide, said on Twitter that Vogue Portugal’s defence was “unbelievable.

“The discussion has been had,” she wrote. “You’re late to the table and offensive.

“I don’t have patience or time for people and brands that in the face [of] overwhelming upset and evidence around why what they’ve done is problematic, cannot apologize and say they […] will do better.”

Rose Cartwright, cofounder of Made of Millions, a non-profit platform that is dedicated to mental health advocacy, pointed out in a statement Sunday that a fashion magazine is uniquely ill-equipped to comprehend or discuss mental health struggles.

“You could barely design a more perfect engine of mental ill health than Vogue - an advertising machine that finds beautiful ways of lying to women about what will make them happy,” she wrote on Instagram.

She pointed out that “madness” and many issues with mental health develop because people “exist in impossible situations that their minds can't make sense of, or because they've inherited holding patterns from generations of poverty, discrimination and abuse.

“These subjects are tonally off-colour for a brand that's built on luxury.”

The model depicted in the cover, Simona Kirchnerova, initially described it as a “career highlight,” on her Instagram to have been featured on the cover with her actual mother and grandmother playing the nurses.

After the backlash, she issued a statement saying “the model is not in charge of any photo shoot,” and revealing that she had dealt with depression herself in the past.

The other three covers for Vogue Portugal’s “Madness” issue include a woman sitting in a chair in front of a fake beach background, a woman in a voluminous black dress with numerous legs protruding from underneath the skirt, and a pair of hands holding a human heart.",Vogue Portugal receiving backlash for cover depicting model in a mental health hospital,1,0.023634577631987064

TORONTO - Ontario has taken over management of another long-term care home after it failed to bring a COVID-19 outbreak under control.

The government says Villa Colombo Homes for the Aged in Toronto's North York area will now be temporarily run by Humber River Hospital.

Twenty-seven people have died of the virus at the home, while another 16 residents and five staff have tested positive.

The government says the hospital had been working with staff at the home for weeks to contain the virus' spread.

In early May, the government issued an emergency order allowing it to appoint temporary managers to long-term care homes that are unable to contain outbreaks.

Since then, the government has used the order to appoint hospitals as temporary management at a number of homes.

JOHANNESBURG - Former South African President Nelson Mandela's fight for freedom and human rights makes him the most influential person among Africa's youth, according to a survey conducted across the continent.

Mandela's legacy is alive seven years after his death, according to the poll of young people in 14 African countries in which 86% of respondents said his values are still relevant today. The results of the survey were released Friday, on the eve of Mandela's birthday, by the Ichikowitz Family Foundation.

Mandela's stand against inequality is pertinent in helping Africans combat COVID-19, which is surging across South Africa and the continent, said the Nelson Mandela Foundation, which welcomed the findings.

“The pandemic has exposed the gross inequalities around the world, the glaring gaps between the haves and the have nots, and many in Africa are finding their survival under threat because of lack of access to health care,” said Luzuko Koti, the foundation's spokesman.

According to the survey's findings, 55% of respondents said Mandela more than anyone had the greatest impact on Africa. The poll asked 4,200 young men and women aged 18 to 24 in Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Gabon, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Mali, Malawi, Rwanda, Senegal, South Africa, Togo, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

The United Nations secretary-general will give the annual Mandela lecture on Saturday, the Nobel Peace Prize winner's birthday.

Separately on Friday there are commemorations for Mandela's daughter Zindzi, who died in a Johannesburg hospital this week. Although her cause of death was not announced, her son told South Africa's state broadcaster that she tested positive for COVID-19 on the day of her death.

President Cyril Ramaphosa praised her family for disclosing it. “This is a virus that affects us all, and there should never be any stigma around people who become infected,” he said in a statement. In disclosing her status, “you are helping encourage social acceptance for sufferers.”

OTTAWA - Singing and dancing in close quarters is not the way to party this summer, Canada's deputy public health officer Dr. Howard Njoo said Friday.

Njoo urged younger people to stop jamming bars and dance floors, to stop the spread of COVID-19. He offered that view after images of crammed bars in Montreal and a spike in new cases accompanied the reopening of Quebec bars and nightclubs this past week.

Njoo said there is “cause for some concern” because new COVID-19 cases are starting to rise after a steady period of decline. He said there have been 350 cases per day nationally over the last week compared to an average daily case count of around 300 in early July.

On Thursday, more than 430 cases were reported, he said.

“This coincides with increasing reports of individuals contracting COVID-19 at parties, nightclubs and bars as well as increasing rates of transmission among young Canadians in some jurisdictions across the country,” said Njoo.

“I encourage everyone, especially young adults, to find creative ways to stay socially active in the time of COVID-19. Singing, mingling and dancing in close contact with others in closed spaces, in crowded places, is not the way to party this summer.”

Njoo said indoor activities carry a higher risk to spread COVID-19 and that can have serious health consequences, even for young people.

However, Quebec Premier Francois Legault said Friday the recent resurgence of COVID-19 cases in the province is due to private gatherings rather than bar visits. That came a day after Legault said he was seeking a recommendation about whether to close bars and nightclubs following a recent string of outbreaks in the Montreal area linked to those venues.

Njoo said younger Canadians have a duty to act responsibly to keep COVID-19 from spreading to older people, including their parents and grandparents.

“We are all in this together, and have a shared responsibility to help keep COVID-19 transmission low.”

Ontario announced new rules starting Friday that allow restaurants to resume indoor service, as well as businesses such as bars, gyms and theatres to start welcoming patrons again.

Njoo said it is up to individual provinces and territories to decide how to ease COVID-19 restrictions. And he said it is up to everyone to exercise good behaviour such as washing hands, maintaining physical distancing and wearing masks as required.

“It is concerning that we're seeing the data show us that a greater proportion of our cases are now among what we call young adults, those less than 40,” he said.

“I can remember that when I was younger I thought I was invincible - you can do anything, don't worry about it, it'll be OK.”

While everyone has an equal risk of catching COVID-19, young people don't generally suffer the most severe health consequences, he said.

“Having said that, we have seen some anecdotes of young people having severe outcomes so you can't consider that everyone is immune from having serious consequence.”

Without naming names, Njoo noted there have been cases where apparently fit celebrities have suffered badly from the illness.

Canadian actor Nick Cordero died earlier this month at 41 after a three-month hospital battle against a range of issues stemming from COVID-19.

The case of the tall, energetic, Tony-nominated theatre performer captured the world's attention as his wife posted daily social media updates on his condition, which included the amputation of his right leg.

Can a pregnant woman spread the coronavirus to her fetus?

It's possible, but it seems to be relatively rare and scientists think they know why that is.

Many viruses can cross the placenta and infect a fetus in the womb, and evidence has been growing that the coronavirus sometimes can too.

Researchers in Italy studied 31 women with COVID-19 who delivered babies in March and April and found signs of the virus in several samples of umbilical cord blood, the placenta and, in one case, breast milk. But this sort of testing can just detect bits of genetic material -- it doesn't mean there is virus capable of causing infection in those places.

In one case, there was strong evidence suggesting the newborn had the virus at birth because signs of it were found in umbilical cord blood and in the placenta. In another, a newborn had certain coronavirus antibodies that are unable to cross the placenta, so they could not have come from the mother.

A report from France gave even stronger evidence of in-the-womb infection, and that newborn was very ill at birth.

Meanwhile, research led by the National Institutes of Health gives a possible reason for why fetuses aren't infected more often: cells in the placenta rarely make the two tools that the coronavirus typically uses to gain entry. In contrast, they found plenty of what Zika and another type of virus use.

Most research so far has been on women who were in late stages of pregnancy when they got the virus; more research is needed on what happens if infection occurs earlier in pregnancy.

The advice to pregnant women remains the same: wear a mask in public, wash hands often and stay at least 6 feet away from others to avoid infection.",Can a pregnant woman spread the coronavirus to her fetus?,8,0.10876169244541334
147,"KELOWNA, B.C.—Health officials are monitoring several cases of COVID-19 exposure in Kelowna, B.C., and say they’ve identified two more locations where people may have contracted the respiratory illness. Interior Health says in a statement issued Sunday that a restaurant and spin studio have been added to the resort and a bed and breakfast identified on Friday in an advisory about the Okanagan outbreak. An email from the health authority says eight positive tests for the virus are linked to visits to downtown Kelowna and the city’s waterfront between June 25 and July 9. Visitors to the Boyce Gyro Beach Lodge on July 1 or the Discovery Bay Resort from July 1 to July 5 were advised Friday to self-isolate and monitor themselves closely for symptoms. The health authority is now urging visitors to Kelowna’s Cactus Club restaurant on Water Street between July 3 and July 6, or the Pace Spin Studio on July 2, 4, 5, 7, 8 and 9 to self-monitor and get tested if COVID-19 symptoms appear. Public health contact tracing is underway, and the health authority says, it is reaching out directly, where possible, to anyone who has been exposed. Testing is recommended for anyone with novel coronavirus symptoms, including fever, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, or a loss of taste or smell, says the statement from Interior Health. “Milder symptoms may include runny nose, fatigue, body aches ... diarrhea, headache, sore throat, vomiting and red eyes,” says the statement. Anyone with even mild symptoms is urged to stay home and avoid travel. Efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19 include physical distancing, washing hands regularly, not touching the face and avoiding gatherings of more than 50 people, the health authority says.","Four sites in Kelowna, B.C., now linked to COVID-19 exposures",5,0.2090909925517701
150,"OTTAWA -- Long-term care homes have been among the hardest hit locations during the COVID-19 pandemic, accounting for the majority of cases and deaths recorded in Ontario.

Below you will find the latest figures from Ottawa Public Health on all current COVID-19 outbreaks in the city. These data are compiled from the daily reports from Ottawa Public Health unless otherwise stated. If an institution is not listed, that means it has never experienced an outbreak of COVID-19 as of the most recent reporting.

Since April 1, a single staff or resident case of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 is considered an outbreak in A long-term care home, retirement home, or other non-hospital congregate setting.



Since May 10, 2 staff or patient cases of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 within a specified unit within a 14-day period where both cases could have reasonably acquired their infection in hospital is considered an outbreak in a public hospital.

Ottawa Public Health warns these data may differ from other numbers published elsewhere due to data entry lag, different reporting sources, or download times. Please note these numbers are preliminary and will continue to change as new information is received, and quality assurance work takes place.

151,"Much of Ontario is moving into the third stage of reopening as the number of new COVID-19 cases has remained steadily low. Health Minister Christine Elliott said there were 111 new cases reported Tuesday morning, with one death. “Locally, 28 of Ontario’s 34 public health units are reporting five or fewer cases, with fully 21 of them reporting no new cases at all,” Elliott said on Twitter. “With 122 more resolved, there are 11 fewer active cases in the province.” There are 137 patients in hospital with COVID-19 with 39 in intensive care units. Of those, 21 are on ventilators. Most of Ontario — excluding the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area and parts of the southwest — will enter the third stage Friday, meaning restaurants and bars can serve meals indoors and gyms can reopen as long as physical distancing is maintained. Queen’s Park says 2,723 people have died from the virus since the pandemic struck in March, but the Star has determined there have been 2,761 coronavirus deaths in Ontario. That difference of 38 fatalities is because some were not included were not included early in the outbreak since COVID-19 tests had not been conducted before those people — most of whom were elderly residents of long-term-care homes — died. The government says there have been 36,950 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Ontario. As of 5 p.m. Tuesday, a Star survey of Ontario’s regional health units found a total of 38,966 confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19. Over the last week, the province’s 34 health units have reported an average of 127 new infections per day — well down from a sustained peak of nearly 600 cases per day, seen in late April. Tuesday’s 5 p.m. total, up 91 cases in 24 hours, did not include any new reports from Toronto, which has switched to updating just three days a week. The Star’s tally includes some patients reported as “probable” COVID-19 cases, which means they have symptoms, travel history or contacts that indicate they likely have the disease, but haven’t yet received a positive test from a lab.",New cases of COVID-19 remain low as much of Ontario prepares for Stage 3,5,0.017864520827795327
152,"KITCHENER -- Health Canada has approved rapid COVID-19 testing kits developed by a company in Guelph.

Guelph’s Precision Biomonitoring and Biomeme, a Philadelphia company, both usually work in DNA testing. Together, they developed a test for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The mobile testing platform can deliver results for up to nine samples in about an hour, the company said in a news release.

“This approval is the result of the dedication and commitment of our teams at Precision Biomonitoring and Biomeme, as well as ongoing collaboration with our validation partners,” Dr. Mario Thomas, CEO of Precision Biomonitoring, said in a news release. “This rapid test can now be distributed everywhere across Canada, especially in remote areas and workplaces where creating virus-free zones is vital. We can now bring the lab to the sample.”

Currently, people need to visit a testing centre and wait several days for results.

The SARS-CoV-2 Real-Time RT-PCR Test will be deployed across the country now that it's approved.

The approval aligns with the federal government's plan to work with innovative companies to combat the pandemic, according to Precision Biomonitoring.

The government says the hospital had been working with staff at the home for weeks to contain the virus' spread.

MIAMI - Teams of military medics were deployed in Texas and California to help hospitals deluged by corona virus patients, as Miami area authorities began stepping up enforcement Friday of a mask requirement - echoing efforts in many parts of the world to contain surging infections.

In California, military doctors, nurses and other health care specialists were being deployed to eight hospitals facing staffing shortages amid a record-breaking case numbers. In Houston, an 86-person Army medical team worked to take over a wing of United Memorial Medical Center.

Texas reported 10,000 new cases for the third straight day Thursday and 129 additional deaths. California, meanwhile, reported its largest two-day total of confirmed cases, nearly 20,000, along with 258 deaths over 48 hours. There are more than 8,000 people in hospitals who have either tested positive for the corona virus or are suspected to have it.

There were signs elsewhere in country's Sunbelt that the virus was stretching authorities' capacity to respond. The medical examiner's office in metro Phoenix has gotten portable storage coolers and ordered more to handle an influx of bodies - reminiscent of New York City at the height of the pandemic there earlier this year.

In Florida's Miami-Dade County, the county commission unanimously approved an emergency order giving all code and fire inspectors authority to issue tickets of up to $100 for individuals and $500 for businesses not complying with guidelines to wear masks and practice social distancing. Police officers already had this enforcement power.

“We're going to put a heck of a lot of people out there,” said Mayor Carlos Gimenez. “Our people are going to go everywhere.”

Gimenez said that too few people, especially younger people, have been following the “new normal” guidelines, so the county needed another enforcement tool.

In Miami-Dade, which is Florida's most populous county and the current epicenter of the outbreak , more than 3,100 new corona virus cases were reported on Thursday. The state, meanwhile, reached another ominous record, with 156 virus deaths, and a staggering 13,965 new cases.

Amid the upsurge, a Florida state legislator, Republican Rep. Anthony Sabatini, filed a lawsuit Friday against a mask ordinance in Pinellas County, home to St. Petersburg and Clearwater. About 100 people in support of his stance rallied in front of the county courthouse, some holding signs saying mask requirements are unconstitutional.

At least half of the 50 states have adopted requirements for wearing masks or other facial coverings.

But in Georgia, Gov. Brian Kemp has banned cities and counties from requiring face coverings. He sued Atlanta late Thursday to prevent it from defying his order, but Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said she was prepared to go to court to maintain the local mask requirement.

Worldwide, governments are frantically trying to prevent and put down fresh outbreak s and keep their economies running as the pandemic accelerates in some regions and threatens to come roaring back in others. Globally, confirmed cases numbered more than 13.8 million Friday and COVID-19 deaths totalled more than 590,000.

To cope with the pandemic's fallout, the United Nations said it is increasing to $10.3 billion its appeal for humanitarian aid funding

Jens Laerke, a spokesman for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, said in Geneva that the number of people who need humanitarian assistance has more than doubled during the pandemic - from around 110 million to about 250 million.

India's total confirmed cases surpassed 1 million, the third-highest number behind the United States and Brazil, and its death toll reached more than 25,000. That followed Brazil's announcement Thursday evening that its confirmed cases exceeded 2 million, including 76,000 deaths.

The continuing surge of new cases in India - where experts believe the vast majority of cases are still being missed - drove home concerns over the readiness of some countries to cope with outbreak s that could overwhelm hospitals and test feeble health care systems. The government ordered a weeklong lockdown in the technology hub of Bangalore after confirmed cases there increased exponentially.

In sub-Saharan Africa, which already had the world's greatest shortage of medical personnel, nearly 10,000 health workers in 40 countries have been infected with the corona virus , the World Health Organization said. More than half of infected workers are in South Africa, where most of the continent's infections are as well.

Israel on Friday reimposed sweeping restrictions to tackle a new surge in what Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called “interim steps” to avoid another general lockdown.

Stores, malls, barber shops, beauty salons, beaches and tourist sites will also be closed on weekends. Public gatherings will be limited to 10 people indoors or 20 outside.

New virus cases have soared in Israel since restrictions were lifted in late May. The country reported around 1,900 new cases on Thursday.

Japan's capital recorded a single-day record number of new corona virus cases for a second straight day on Friday with 293. Tokyo was taken off a list of places around the country where discounts are offered under a government scheme to encourage domestic tourism.

Spain, which earlier in the pandemic was one of the world's hardest hit countries, was grappling with more than 150 active outbreak s, most of them in the northern Aragon and Catalonia regions. Health authorities asked the 5.5 million residents of Barcelona, the regional capital of Catalonia, to stay at home as much as possible to stem the virus ' spread.

They also announced a local ban on social gatherings over 10 people, and nightclub and gym closures. Spain reported 580 new cases Thursday, the highest daily number since May 10.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson charted a different course, announcing that as of Aug. 1 the government was no longer asking people to avoid public transit and would stop advising workers in England to work from home.

Keen to reinvigorate the economy, Johnson wants to see struggling businesses that rely on office workers rebound. The U.K.'s official death toll, which stood at more than 45,000 as of Friday, has for several weeks been the highest in Europe.

162,"VANCOUVER -- The last COVID-19 update of the week from B.C.'s health ministry will be delivered through a written statement Friday.

The update, which is expected to be released in the afternoon, will reveal new test-positive cases of the virus and any additional outbreaks or deaths.

No updates will be given over the weekend, but Dr. Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix are scheduled to speak live on Monday.

Thursday's update revealed another 21 cases of COVID-19, marking the seventh day out of the last eight during which the total number of cases in B.C. had grown by at least 20.

As of that briefing, there were 192 active cases of the virus in B.C., including 15 people who are in hospital.

An outbreak at St. Paul's Hospital's neonatal intensive care unit was also reported Thursday. That outbreak wasn't announced by Henry and Dix, but instead was posted in an outbreak bulletin by Vancouver Coastal Health.

The NICU has since been closed for intensive cleaning, but a satellite unit has opened.

164,"VANCOUVER -- British Columbia's recent surge in COVID-19 cases was ""not unexpected,"" health officials said Tuesday while announcing just 13 more infections.

The latest briefing from provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry and B.C. Health Minister Adrian Dix ended a stretch of five days in which the province recorded between 20 and 25 new cases per day.

That was a significant jump over the daily average of 11 cases that was recorded over the preceding 10 days.

""It was distressing to me,"" Henry said. ""It's way above my comfort zone.""

But the provincial health officer also noted the increase, which came following several separate COVID-19 exposures in Kelowna, particularly around Canada Day, was an anticipated consequence of the province's gradual reopening.

""With every increase in our activity, the potential for COVID-19 transmission increases as well,"" she said.

""We are getting out more, we're being more active and we are unfortunately transmitting this disease. But we're also monitoring closely and public health teams are actively working to mange every single case and make sure we find all of those close contacts who are at risk.""

British Columbia has passed the first incubation period since Canada Day, and since moving into Phase 3 of its restart plan. That means it's important for people to be extra aware of potential COVID-19 symptoms if they emerge.

""There may be other people out there right now who were at parties at Canada Day, who had been in contact with somebody who had this disease over the past couple weeks, and you may have mild symptoms,"" Henry said. ""If you have any concerns at all, you can be tested anywhere in B.C. and that's important right now. We need to continue to minimize our cases, manage them effectively with public health teams, and modify our activities as we need to do to make sure that we can continue to safely get out and about and open up.""

Officials did not have any additional virus fatalities to report on Tuesday, leaving the death toll at 189.

The latest update brings the total number of COVID-19 cases identified in B.C. since the start of the pandemic to 3,128. Another 12 people have also recovered from the virus since Monday, for a total of 2,730 recoveries in the province, leaving 209 active recoveries.

There remain 14 people in hospital, including five in critical care or intensive care units.

Officials did not have any new outbreaks to report in the community or health care facilities, but are still working to contain active outbreaks at two long-term care homes and one acute care facilities, and dealing with an outbreak at the Krazy Cherry Fruit Co. farm in Oliver.

Henry said the Canadian Food Inspection Agency has reviewed processes at the farm and found them to be safe, stressing that ""food is not a source of COVID-19, for the most part.""

""We are confident there is no risk from cherries that have been processed at the Krazy Cherry farm,"" she said. ""I will remind people that we don't have any evidence of transmission from packaging or food, but that we should always wash things carefully and wash our hands.""

166,"NEW DELHI -- India crossed 1 million coronavirus cases on Friday, third only to the United States and Brazil, prompting concerns about its readiness to confront an inevitable surge that could overwhelm hospitals and test the country's feeble health care system.

A surge of 34.956 new cases in the past 24 hours took the national total to 1,003,832.

The Health Ministry also reported a record number of 687 deaths for a total of 25,602. It said 635,757 people have recovered and the recovery rate was continuing to improve at 63 per cent.

The grim milestone comes at a time when several Indian states are imposing focused lockdowns to stem the outbreak amid frantic efforts by local governments to protect the economy.

So far, three states -- Maharashtra, Delhi and Tamil Nadu -- have accounted for more than half of total cases. But in India's vast countryside, which is much less prepared and with weaker health care, the pandemic is clearly growing.

""The acceleration in cases remains the main challenge for India in the coming days,"" said Dr. Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, adding that a vast majority of cases were still being missed.

The continuing surge has forced authorities to reinstate lockdowns in some cities and states.

In Bangalore, a city that prides itself as the centre of of Indian technology innovation, the government ordered a weeklong lockdown that began Tuesday evening after the cases surged exponentially.

In Bihar, an eastern state with a population of 128 million and a fragile health system, a two-week lockdown was announced Thursday.

In Uttar Pradesh, the most populous state with more than 200 million people, authorities have started placing residents under strict weekend curfews, which will remain in place until the end of the month.

Other local governments are increasingly focusing on smaller lockdowns that shield the economy. Nearly a dozen states have imposed restrictions on ""containment zones"" -- areas that can be as small as a few houses or a street.

Dr. Anant Bhan, a global health researcher, said that India was likely to see ""a series of peaks,"" as the infection spread in rural areas. He pointed out that the capital of New Delhi and the financial capital, Mumbai, had already seen surges, while infections have now shifted to smaller cities.

India's response to the virus was initially sluggish and then it bought time by locking down its entire population of 1.4 billion people when Prime Minister Narendra Modi imposed a nationwide lockdown for three weeks on March 24.

""If (the) situation is not handled in these 21 days, the country and your family could go back 21 years,"" Modi said then in a televised address to Indians, many of whom were still unaware of the scale of the crisis in the country.

The nationwide lockdown, then extended for five more weeks, came at an enormous economic cost amid an unprecedented humanitarian crisis when millions of impoverished migrant workers were forced to return to the countryside due to job losses and hunger.

Aimed at increasing the capacity of the health care system, the lockdown slowed down the virus, but it wasn't enough. Cases kept increasing while testing still remained abysmally low and the virus rocketed through India's vast landscape -- from high up in the Himalayan Kashmir to the sprawling beaches of Kanyakumari in Tamil Nadu.

""Slowdown isn't eradication,"" said Jayaprakash Muliyil, an epidemiologist at the Christian Medical College in Vellore.

Muliyil said that India had to try and slow down the virus because it didn't have enough beds but was only partly successful since the ""requirement was quite large.""

India's public health care system is one of the most chronically underfunded in the world and access to hospitals in rural areas is very low. Experts say the challenge for India will be to tightrope the opening up of the economy while trying to restrict the increase in cases to manageable levels that don't overwhelm hospitals.

""India's strategy going forward will revolve around containment zones,"" said Rajesh Bhushan of India's federal Health Ministry. Once more zones are mapped out, health care workers will go from house to house and test those with symptoms, he said.

Experts say low testing remains a concern.

Dr. Ujjwal Parakh, a senior consultant at the department of respiratory medicine at Ganga Ram Hospital, New Delhi, said authorities could have been more transparent about testing guidelines.

Initially, India had some of the world's most stringent testing criteria and used only about a third of its testing capacity. After months of sluggishness, it has now ramped up testing, from a single lab in January to over 1,200. Over 300,000 samples are being tested every day. In some cities, it has also allowed tests without a doctor's prescription. ""The battle plan is to do all the things we know work. Open the economy, as much as it is safe. Track things very closely,"" said Jha. ""But don't let the virus get a foothold.""

168,"EDMONTON -- As the number of COVID-19 cases mounts in both Canada and Alberta, we're slowly getting a clearer picture of how the pandemic is spreading and how the situation here compares to other jurisdictions.

While the daily case count announcements from provincial health authorities are the most eye-catching figures, there's other important numbers beyond newly confirmed cases, including hospitalizations and testing data.

This page will be updated daily as new information on Alberta, Canada and international cases of COVID-19 is made available.

Starting the week of June 29, the province will provide daily data updates Monday through Friday and not on weekends and holidays.

Follow the links below or scroll down to see how the COVID-19 situation is changing in Alberta as the pandemic continues.

HOW IS COVID-19 GROWING IN ALBERTA?

The province's daily case count announcement is among the most prominent COVID-19 statistics.

The number of new cases represents the number of patients who are newly infected with the coronavirus. The number of active cases in the province can go up or down depending on the number of new recoveries on a given day.

The above graph divides active cases into those who are sick, but not in hospital, and those patients requiring hospitalization. Hospitalized patients are further divided by those getting care in and out of intensive care units.

Recoveries are defined by Alberta Health Services as follows:

A return to health after 14 days of isolation for those with COVID-19 but who experienced only mild symptoms.

If hospitalized due to COVID-19, anyone who does not require additional hospitalization or treatment in the 10 days after they left the hospital.

If tested, such as a health care worker, two negative tests at least 24 hours apart.

Daily case counts include both lab-confirmed and probable cases. The case count for a given day is sometimes revised to more accurately reflect probable cases that were either later confirmed or determined not to be related to COVID-19.

WHERE IS COVID-19 HITTING ALBERTA THE HARDEST?

Since early April, the province has provided a geographic breakdown for both its five health zones as well as individual cities and community-level subzones within those cities.

Alberta Health Services divides the province into five health zones: Calgary, Central, Edmonton, North and South.

A map of those zones can be seen here, and it's important to note that the Edmonton and Calgary zones cover an area significantly bigger than the cities they are named after.

Sizable daily jumps in the new number of cases can't necessarily be attributed to the virus growing, as testing volume and reporting time also influence the data.

For more local data, the province's COVID-19 statistics page has an interactive map showing cases by city and community.

HOW MANY COVID-19 PATIENTS ARE IN HOSPITAL?

Tracking hospitalizations is an important indicator of how severely pandemic is affecting Albertans as well as how the coronavirus is taxing the province's health care system.

Alberta has the capacity for 295 intensive care unit beds and nearly 8,500 total beds, according to the province's modelling released in April.

So far, the number of hospitalizations and ICU admissions have both remained well below those maximum capacities.

Hospitalization data is often retroactively updated by the province as individual hospitals report data at varying times and speeds.

HOW IS ALBERTA TESTING FOR COVID-19?

Alberta has been the top province in Canada measured by per capita COVID-19 testing since near the start of the pandemic.

The province has now administered more than 500,000 tests Albertans.

It's important to distinguish between test volume (number of tests completed) and number of people tested as patients can be tested more than once.

The province has made seven notable shifts in testing policy.

March 23: The province announced testing was being focused on at-risk populations and health care workers. At the same time, testing returning travellers was deprioritized to only those showing symptoms.

April 7: Testing is opened to any symptomatic individuals in the Calgary Zone, which had seen significant spikes in cases in March and April.

April 13: Testing was expanded to any Albertan with symptoms consistent with the coronavirus.

April 17: The province announced it would start testing all staff and residents of continuing care facilities for COVID-19 regardless of whether or not they show symptoms.​

May 4: The testing criteria was expanded again to include anyone exeperiencing headache, muscle or joint aches, fatigue or severe exhaustion, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, unexplained loss of appetite, loss of sense of smell or taste, or pink eye.

May 11: The province opened testing to asymptomatic residents of the Calgary zone who work outside their home. Testing is to be done on a first-come, first-serve basis for up to 1,000 asymptomatic residents each day. The policy was in place until May 18.

May 29: The province announces all Albertans, including those who are asymptomatic, were eligible to be tested.

HOW IS COVID-19 BEING SPREAD IN ALBERTA?

The province divides the ways COVID-19 is being spread into three categories: travel-related cases, spread via a known source, and spread via an unknown source, or community transmission.

Initially, travel-related cases were responsible for many of Alberta's new COVID-19 cases. But since travel restrictions came into effect, the number of travel-related cases has largely flattened since early April.

Close contact with individuals known to be carrying the virus remains the most common way of spreading COVID-19 in Alberta.

Suspected community transmitted cases, where the carrier isn't immediately known, are an important indicator of how the coronavirus is spreading in a community as well as how successful measures like physical distancing have been in limiting transmission.

Identified cases are investigated by AHS and classified into one of the three categories. The classification can change pending further investigation.

WHICH AGE GROUPS HAVE BEEN MOST SUSCEPTIBLE TO COVID-19?

Since the onset of the pandemic, COVID-19 has affected the elderly more than other age groups as seen in high death and active case counts.

But, younger age groups are not immune, and by mid-June, cases among Albertans under the age of 40 had risen to form a majority of all active cases in the province.

HOW DOES COVID-19'S GROWTH IN ALBERTA COMPARE TO ELSEWHERE?

Conclusions drawn from comparing provinces are somewhat limited by widely differing testing volumes and practices among provinces, but the raw data does allow from some contrast.

The above graphs rank provinces by the number of tests they administer and how many confirmed cases they have, both adjusted to per 10,000 population of their respective province.

Tests are also not without their own biases. More tests will produce more positives, and it's easier to test everyone in a less populous province.

Rates adjusted for population provide a snapshot of the COVID-19 situation on any given day, but experts say the growth of the virus, which is unrelated to population size, is also an important indicator of future trends.

169,"It’s unclear why measures aimed at putting an “iron ring” around nursing homes failed to stop COVID-19 from causing “tragic” levels of death and illness, says Long-Term-Care Minister Merrilee Fullerton. The admission came as the province revealed three-quarters of the new coronavirus fatalities officially reported Thursday in Ontario were of vulnerable nursing-home residents.  At least 933 have tested positive for COVID-19, along with 530 nursing-home staff to date, the highest toll of any workers in the health-care sector.  The measures to protect nursing homes include screening of new admissions, staff and volunteers and stiff restrictions on visitors.  But on Thursday the province added more measures. They include the temporary ban on transfers of hospital patients to long-term care unless in extraordinary circumstances, and only with a COVID-19 test followed by 14 days in isolation with droplet and contact precautions. Nursing-home residents in the same room as a patient with symptoms will now be tested, as will all residents in adjacent rooms, all staff on the unit or nursing-care hub involved, any essential visitors and other contacts as deemed necessary. Wider surveillance testing will also be conducted in select nursing homes to get a wider picture of disease.  Fullerton, a former family doctor, called the highly contagious virus different from the expected influenza pandemic and said improved testing and the freeze on hospitals transferring patients to long-term care will help limit the damage. The goal is “to understand how elusive this COVID-19 is and what else we can do, what other tools we have for this,” she added, acknowledging some nursing homes were scrambling for staff even before the illness hit. “It’s a new virus with a new way of spreading,” Fullerton told reporters, saying the way it is shared by people who are not showing symptoms has made it difficult to manage.  Statistics on outbreaks in more than 100 of the province’s 626 nursing homes became increasingly grim Thursday, further evidence of what Premier Doug Ford has famously dubbed a “wildfire.” More than half, or 271, of the 514 new coronavirus cases reported by the Ministry of Health were in nursing-home residents who accounted for 29 of the 38 new deaths.  That’s the “first time” COVID-19 infections in nursing homes have outpaced new infections in the community, said chief medical officer of health Dr. David Williams. The provincial numbers are based on reports from Ontario’s public health units as of 4 p.m. the previous day. The numbers indicate COVID-19 cases in nursing homes grew at a rate of 12 per cent in 24 hours, double the rate in the general population. Across Canada, almost half of deaths from the illness are in long-term-care residents and 93 per cent of fatalities are in those over age 60.  Officially, Ontario has reported 162 deaths of nursing-home residents but a more up-to-date Star compilation of reports and news releases from public health units puts the number closer to 250. Critics said the province should have put as much effort into preparing nursing homes for the onslaught as it did getting hospitals ready for a surge of patients that has not yet materialized.  “It should never have come to this,” said NDP Leader Andrea Horwath, urging Ford to detail a plan to take over direct management of nursing homes with severe outbreaks, as has happened in British Columbia. “Families deserve answers as to why their mothers and fathers were not better protected,” added Liberal Leader Steven Del Duca, calling for a public inquiry. Acting on a promise made by Ford earlier this week, Fullerton said teams from several Toronto hospitals including Mount Sinai and North York General have been sent to 38 area nursing homes to determine what help they need with patient care, infection prevention and control, testing and personal protective equipment. The ministry would not reveal the names of the nursing homes.  “This is the model that we will be expanding across the province.”",Why did Ontario’s safety measures fail to protect nursing homes from COVID-19?

172,"MONTREAL -- Quebec public health authorities announced they would be using a new system for calculating the number of people who have recovered from COVID-19 and it sent the recovery numbers skyrocketing Friday.

Officials announced that 23,686 more people have recovered from the virus for a total of 49,939. That is 87 per cent of the total cases in the province, up from 67 per cent of Thursday.

The number drastically reduces the national number of active cases, which were 27,603 before the massive jump in recoveries. The number of active cases in Canada is now 4,058. The national recovery rate is now at 88 per cent, up from 67 per cent on Thursday.

According to Quebec, there are now just 1,566 active cases from the 57,142 positive cases reported.

Quebec did not specify what system they were using to calculate recoveries when they announced the dramatic increase Friday morning.

The number of new active cases continues to trend upward. Since Thursday, 141 more people have tested positive for COVID-19 in the past 24 hours, down one from 142 cases reported Wednesday. Monday and Tuesday had 109 and 129 new cases, respectively.

Authorities reported that just one person has died in the past 24 hours from COVID-19, and hospitalizations continue to drop.

The total number of deaths due to the virus is now 5,647 since the start of the pandemic. The one death was reported in Laval.



Hospitalizations due to the virus dropped again with 17 fewer people receiving treatment in Quebec hospitals for a total of 260. Of those, 16 people are in the intensive care ward, a decrease of four.The two hardest hit areas in the past 24 hours were Montreal with 78 new cases and Monteregie with 33 making up 77 per cent of the new cases in Quebec.

A whopping 23,686 people were recorded as newly recovered in Quebec on Friday. The undisclosed new system slashes the number of active cases in Canada by more than 80 per cent.

On Thursday, there were a reported 27,603 active cases across the country, but Friday’s announcement in Quebec brings the total number of active cases in Canada to just 4,058.

177,"VANCOUVER -- Fraser Health has detected an outbreak of C. difficile at Royal Columbian Hospital in New Westminster.

The outbreak was declared on July 14, and a notice has been posted to the health authority's website.

Fraser Health has not confirmed how many patients are affected.

C. difficile, or Clostridium difficile, is a bacteria that can cause mild to severe diarrhea and inflammation of the colon. It's the most frequent cause of infectious diarrhea in hospitals and long-term care homes in Canada, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada.

The bacteria and its spores are found in feces, and people can get infected if they touch the spores and then touch their mouths.

Some symptoms of C. difficile include fever, diarrhea, nausea, loss of appetite and abdominal pain and tenderness.

For healthy people, C. difficile does not pose a risk, but people who are on antibiotics, undergoing chemo, have other illnesses or are elderly are at greater risk of infection.

Fraser Health is asking visitors to its health-care facilities to use hand hygiene stations upon entering and exiting, especially if there's been a reported outbreak. People who are sick, including those with rashes, fever, cough or flu-like symptoms are asked not to visit.

Visitors seeing patients in a unit with an outbreak may be limited to two people at a time. The health authority also recommends visitors not go to other patients' rooms or visit common areas like the lounge, cafeteria and gift shop.",C. difficile outbreak detected at Royal Columbian Hospital,8,0.4161722627650255
178,"JOHANNESBURG - South Africa on Tuesday surpassed the U.K. in its number of confirmed coronavirus cases as the country’s president warns of “the gravest crisis in the history of our democracy.” South Africa now has the world’s eighth-highest number of cases at 298,292, which represents nearly half of all the confirmed cases on the African continent. That’s according to a Health Ministry statement and data compiled by Johns Hopkins University researchers, which showed the U.K. with 292,931 confirmed cases. The pandemic is now spreading swiftly in parts of the African continent of 1.3 billion people as the world’s most poorly funded health systems begin to face what experts have warned all along: They would be rapidly overwhelmed. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa this week said many more virus infections have gone undetected despite the country conducting more than 2.2 million tests, by far the most of any African nation. A strict lockdown had delayed South Africa’s surge in cases but it has been loosened under economic pressure. Now, what the president calls the “storm” has arrived, and it is already “stretching our resources and our resolve to their limits.” Shortages of medical oxygen have been reported as the number of COVID-19 patients seeking help in breathing grows. Public hospital beds across the country could fill up within the month. South Africa grapples with the pandemic in the dead of winter, with temperatures in the outbreak epicenter, Gauteng province and Johannesburg, forecast to drop below freezing overnight. That makes ventilation a challenge especially in small, crowded homes for the poor.

179,"LONDON, ONT. -- Kristin Legault suffers from severe bipolar disorder. It was earlier this year she shared her success story with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Legault says for the first time she was seeing a positive change with her mental health, but that all changed months ago.

“Because of the coronavirus all of my ECT treatments were discontinued,” says Legault. It’s been around two months without ECT treatments and her mental health has severely declined.

Just two weeks ago, she was suicidal, and police and ambulance were called when she attempted to take her life at her grandparents home in St. Thomas.

She says, “I saw a GP (general practitioner), I wasn’t formed and I didn’t see a psychiatric nurse. Actually they were more concerned with my physical health than my mental health.”

Legualt says about two hours after arriving at St. Thomas Elgin General Hospital via ambulance, she was discharged without a next of kin being contacted.

“They just gave me directions on how to leave the hospital and I walked around Elm Street in St. Thomas at 2:30 a.m. by myself in my pyjamas.”

Her grandmother, Joanne Donkers, found her and got her home safe.

“She just walked out of hospital and I think that’s totally wrong. She could’ve gone anywhere and she was in real crisis and needed help.”

CTV News reached out to St. Thomas Elgin General hospital for comment, hospital communications staff replied via email saying:

""When a patient presents in the Emergency Department, they are triaged by a nurse and assessed by a skilled emergency physician. Based on the assessment, a decision to admit or discharge would be made.

""The decision to notify a family member is determined through a conversation with the patient. This process remains unchanged during COVID.""

Days later and still feeling suicidal, Legault’s GP sent her to the London Health Sciences Centre's (LHSC) Victoria Hospital on a form for mental health crisis care.

She said again, less than two hours later she was released from the emergency department.

Her grandmother, who found her outside Victoria Hospital, says their family is desperate for help.

“We are not equipped to take care of Kristin in crisis. We do the best we can but we really think there should be more help for her.”

Legault says she’s feeling hopeless, “I feel like - Am I ever going to get better? Is anyone ever going to help me?”

180,"LONDON, ONT. -- ""I miss him so much.""

It’s been seven years since Marilyn Reid last saw and spoke to her husband John. It was in February of 2013 that he was brought to Victoria Hospital via ambulance, suicidal and in crisis.

“When we got him there I was very relieved and I thought he was safe and in good hands.”

John, a veteran of the Canadian Armed Forces suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and was having suicidal thoughts.

“He was in the hospital in crisis and was there a week in crisis and then was released, but nobody contacted me to tell me that he was leaving the hospital. I was actually in shock.”

Reid says she received a phone call from the hospital, one that forever changed her life.

“The only phone call I got from them was to tell me that he was deceased and that he died on hospital grounds. He took his life, just very shortly after they released him.”

Reid says after seeing the CTV News story last week about a suicidal woman going missing after being discharged from Victoria Hospital, she knew she had to speak out.

“I cant believe that people are being released from the hospital and their loved ones aren’t being contacted. It’s been a few years since my husband died and I can’t believe this is still going on.”

The London Health Coalition believes the care for mental health patients is only going to get worse if there continues to be a lack of services and funding for mental health care.

“We in this community have already suffered from losing so many beds, thousands literally,” says Peter Bergmanis from the London Health Coalition. “There was the London Psychiatric Hospital and the St. Thomas Psychiatric Hospital that are vacant. So where are these people supposed to go?”

Reid agrees more funding and services would be key, but in the interim would like to see hospitals contacting family before discharging mental health patients.

“I, in my heart feel if I could have seen him and talked to him again that the outcome would’ve been entirely different.”

Policies differ from hospital hospital when it comes to notifying family of patient discharge.

In a statement the London Health Sciences Centre said, “Our care providers work with patients to support their discharge, including calling their families/supports when needed. We welcome families sharing their concerns with us, and we are committed to working with them directly.”

Meanwhile St. Thomas Elgin General Hospital states, “When a patient presents in the Emergency Department, they are triaged by a nurse and assessed by a skilled emergency physician. Based on the assessment, a decision to admit or discharge would be made. The decision to notify a family member is determined through a conversation with the patient.

182,"WINNIPEG -- The Manitoba government said they’re unable to determine why hundreds of dead fish washed up on the shores of Lake Winnipeg last month.

Hundreds of dead carp could be seen washing up on the shores of Lake Winnipeg in June, prompting the province’s wildlife and fisheries branch to conduct tests on the tissue of the fish to determine if a virus caused the mass die-off.

The province was looking to see if it was caused by the Koi Herpes virus, which has been found in Manitoba before, or the Spring Viraemia of Carp virus, which affects different species of carp.

A spokesperson for the province said they did not find evidence of either virus with the tests.

“Based on the evidence collected to date, Manitoba Agriculture and Resource Development (ARD) is unable to determine what caused this die-off,” the spokesperson wrote in an email to CTV News. “At this time there will be no further investigation.”

The province said if residents start noticing large numbers of dying or freshly dead fish, they’re asked to notify the wildlife and fisheries branch as soon as possible by phone at 204-793-1154 or by emailing fish@gov.mb.ca.

183,"ISLAMABAD - Pakistan announced Tuesday it would resume vaccinations against polio next week, months after the drive against this crippling children’s disease was halted because the novel coronavirus had overwhelmed the country’s health system. The anti-polio campaign would last three days, from next Monday, with the plan to have about 800,000 children vaccinated, the officials said. Police departments have received requests to ensure the safety of the polio workers. Rana Mohammad Safdar, who oversees anti-polio operations in the country, said polio workers would adhere to social distancing regulations while carrying out their duty. The announcement comes after Pakistan’s powerful army chief, Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa, told Microsoft co-founder and billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates last month that despite the challenge of COVID-19, the government planned to restart polio vaccinations across the country. Bajwa gave no date at the time. Pakistan, Afghanistan and Nigeria are the three countries in the world where polio — a disabling and life-threatening disease caused by the polio virus — is still endemic. The non-profit Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has helped Pakistan and other places worldwide fight the disease. The World Health Organization at a meeting in June reviewed the polio situation in Pakistan and elsewhere and extended travel restrictions, initially enforced in 2014, that require people to get vaccinated against polio a month before travelling to Pakistan. Pakistan had hoped to eliminate the disease by 2018, when only 12 cases were reported. But there was a surge in new cases the following year. Since January, Pakistan has reported 58 new polio cases from various parts of the country, including the northwestern region bordering Afghanistan. The Taliban and other militants regularly stage attacks on polio teams and security forces escorting them,a s well as vaccination centres and health workers because they claim the anti-polio drive is part of an alleged Western conspiracy to sterilize children or collect intelligence. The attacks on polio teams increased after it was revealed that a fake hepatitis vaccination campaign was used as a ruse by the CIA in the hunt for al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden. Bin Laden was killed by U.S. commandos in 2011 in Pakistan. Pakistan has had more than 253,000 cases of the coronavirus, including 5,320 deaths, since the first infection was detected in February. On Tuesday, it reported 1,979 cases — a substantial decrease in daily infections since May, when the lockdown was eased, causing a surge in COVID-19 infections and deaths.",Pakistan to resume polio campaign as COVID-19 cases decline,8,0.962201125180818
185,"TOKYO - Japan’s defence minister said Tuesday that officials have discovered “a number of problems” with U.S. military measures to guard against the coronavirus among service members stationed in Japan after 95 Marines tested positive at several bases on the southern island of Okinawa. Okinawan officials on Sunday said most of the cases since early July were at Marine Corps Air Station Futenma, which is at the centre of a relocation dispute. Others were at Camp Hansen, Camp Kinser and Camp McTureous. On Tuesday, Kadena Air Base reported two positive cases. Combined with three cases at Kadena in March, the total among the U.S. service members on Okinawa is 100, officials said. “We have discovered a number of problems,” Defence Minister Taro Kono said. “We need to more strictly scrutinize the situation with the U.S. military in Japan.“ Kono said the problems were discovered after Japanese officials requested information from the U.S. military. He refused to give details, but said the problems exist at U.S. bases throughout Japan, not just on Okinawa. In a possible indication of one of the problems, Kono said Japanese officials are inspecting a hotel used by the U.S. military to house service members newly assigned to Okinawa from the U.S. while they undergo a 14-day self-quarantine. Okinawan officials and residents have raised concerns about whether adequate safety measures are in place at the hotel. Later Tuesday, officials said no infections or major problems were found at the hotel and those staying there are not allowed to go out during their two-week quarantine. Current hotel residents will move to facilities on base next week, while the hotel will then accommodate those leaving Okinawa. Okinawa Gov. Denny Tamaki has criticized the U.S. military for a lack of transparency regarding the coronavirus, saying it has caused concern among residents. Tamaki in telephone talks Saturday with Lt. Gen. H. Stacy Clardy, commander of III Marine Expeditionary Force, demanded the U.S. military increase transparency, improve disease prevention measures, stop sending personnel from the mainland U.S. to Okinawa and seal the bases. The U.S. military has told Okinawa that all infected people have been isolated and the bases are virtually under lockdown, officials said. “We are taking prudent measures to prevent further spread of COVID-19 and will continue to communicate with our force, our families, and our local communities about positive COVID-19 cases,” Kadena base said Tuesday on its Facebook page. Okinawa is home to more than half of about 50,000 American troops based in Japan under a bilateral security pact. Residents have long been sensitive to U.S. base-related problems such as pollution, noise and crime. Okinawans also oppose a planned relocation of Futenma Air Base from its current site in a densely populated area in the south to a less populated area on the east coast, and instead want the facility removed entirely from the island. Outside the bases, Okinawa has reported only about 150 coronavirus cases. Nationwide, Japan has confirmed 20,000 cases including about 1,000 deaths. ___ Follow Mari Yamaguchi on Twitter at https://www.twitter.com/mariyamaguchi ",Japan: US military coronavirus policy has multiple problems,5,0.17151709517771863
190,"MIAMI -- Teams of military medics were deployed in Texas and California to help hospitals deluged by coronavirus patients, as Miami area authorities began stepping up enforcement Friday of a mask requirement -- echoing efforts in many parts of the world to contain surging infections.

In California, military doctors, nurses and other health care specialists were being deployed to eight hospitals facing staffing shortages amid a record-breaking case numbers. In Houston, an 86-person Army medical team worked to take over a wing of United Memorial Medical Center.

Several states have been reporting record numbers this week, contributing to a surge in the national death rate. The seven-day rolling average for daily new deaths has risen 34% from two weeks ago, while the case count in that period shot up 43%.

Florida reported 128 new deaths Friday and 11,345 new cases.

Texas reported 10,000 new cases for the third straight day Thursday and 129 additional deaths. California reported its largest two-day total of confirmed cases, nearly 20,000, along with 258 deaths over 48 hours.

There were signs across the Sunbelt that the virus was stretching authorities' capacity to respond. The medical examiner's office in metro Phoenix has gotten portable storage coolers and ordered more to handle an influx of bodies -- reminiscent of New York City at the height of the pandemic there.

In Florida, Miami-Dade County's commission gave code and fire inspectors authority to issue tickets of up to $100 for individuals and $500 for businesses not complying with guidelines to wear masks and practice social distancing. Police officers already had this enforcement power.

""We're going to put a heck of a lot of people out there,"" said Mayor Carlos Gimenez. ""Our people are going to go everywhere.""

Gimenez said that too few people, especially younger people, have been following the ""new normal"" guidelines, so the county needed another enforcement tool.

At least half of the 50 states have adopted requirements for wearing face coverings.

But in Georgia, Gov. Brian Kemp has banned cities and counties from requiring face coverings. He sued Atlanta late Thursday to prevent it from defying his order, but Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said she was prepared to go to court to maintain the local mask requirement.

For millions of parents in the U.S., Friday brought new information about how schools would cope with the pandemic after summer vacation ends.

Texas gave public schools permission to keep campuses closed for more than 5 million students well into the fall. Under the new guidelines, schools can hold online-only instruction for up to the first eight weeks of the school year, potentially pushing a return to campus in some cities until November.

Most Chicago children would return to the classroom two days a week and spend the other three days learning remotely once the school year begins under a tentative plan outlined by officials from the nation's third-largest school district.

Chicago Public Schools officials called the proposed hybrid approach preliminary, and asked parents, students and staff to weigh in. A final decision about in-person instruction for fall classes for the district's more than 300,000 students won't come until late August.

Worldwide, governments are frantically trying to prevent and put down fresh outbreaks and keep their economies running as the pandemic accelerates in some regions and threatens to come roaring back in others. Globally, confirmed cases numbered more than 13.8 million Friday and COVID-19 deaths totalled more than 590,000.

To cope with the pandemic's fallout, the United Nations said it is increasing to $10.3 billion its appeal for humanitarian aid.

Jens Laerke, a spokesman for the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, said in Geneva that the number of people who need assistance has more than doubled during the pandemic to about 250 million.

India's total confirmed cases surpassed 1 million, the third-highest number behind the United States and Brazil, and its death toll reached more than 25,000. That followed Brazil's announcement Thursday evening that its confirmed cases exceeded 2 million, including 76,000 deaths.

The continuing surge in India -- where experts believe the vast majority of cases are still being missed -- drove home concerns over the readiness of some countries to cope with outbreaks that could test feeble health care systems.

In sub-Saharan Africa, which already had the world's greatest shortage of medical personnel, nearly 10,000 health workers in 40 countries have been infected with the coronavirus, the World Health Organization said. More than half are in South Africa, where most of the continent's infections are as well.

Israel on Friday reimposed sweeping restrictions to tackle a new surge in what Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called ""interim steps"" to avoid another general lockdown.

Stores, malls, barber shops, beauty salons, beaches and tourist sites will also be closed on weekends. New virus cases have soared in Israel since restrictions were lifted in late May.

Japan's capital recorded a single-day record number of new coronavirus cases for a second straight day on Friday with 293. Tokyo was taken off a list of places around the country where discounts are offered under a government scheme to encourage domestic tourism.

Spain, which earlier in the pandemic was one of the world's hardest hit countries, was grappling with more than 150 active outbreaks, most of them in the northern Aragon and Catalonia regions. Health authorities asked the 5.5 million residents of Barcelona, the regional capital of Catalonia, to stay at home as much as possible to stem the virus' spread.

They also announced a local ban on social gatherings over 10 people, and nightclub and gym closures. Spain reported 580 new cases Thursday, the highest daily number since May 10.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson charted a different course, announcing that as of Aug. 1 the government was no longer asking people to avoid public transit and would stop advising workers in England to work from home.

The U.K.'s official death toll, which stood at more than 45,000 as of Friday, has for several weeks been the highest in Europe.

191,"WINDSOR, ONT. -- The Windsor-Essex County Health Unit reports 22 new COVID-19 cases in the region on Friday.

The health unit says 10 cases are in the community, seven are workers in the agri-farm sector, one is travel-related and four are under investigation.

There have been 1,879 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Windsor-Essex, including 1283 people who have recovered.

Windsor-Essex medical officer of health Dr. Wajid Ahmed says it is important for residents to be vigilant with social distancing, wear masks and keep close contacts to a minimum.

“We have seen more cases increase in our region as a result of those close contacts,”says Ahmed.

Windsor-Essex has the second-highest rate of cases in the province.

The death toll in Windsor-Essex is at 69. Forty-nine deaths have occurred among residents in long-term care homes and two are related to migrant workers.

In the last 30 days the majority of the cases have been in the agri-farm sector in Leamington and Kingsville, but Ahmed says there has been a shift in the last seven days.

“We are seeing a spike in the cases in the Windsor area,” says Ahmed. “Could be partly due to the reopening of the businesses as well and some of the contacts that we are seeing so it is very important that we don’t lose our guards.”

In the last seven days, 53 per cent of the cases are from the agri-farms and 47 per cent are in the other/unemployed/retired/missing category.

There are also six workplaces experiencing outbreaks, one manufacturing facility in Leamington and five in the agriculture sector — four in Kingsville and one in Leamington.

There are currently two long-term care or retirement homes in outbreak status – Village of Aspen Lakes and Augustine Villas in Kingsville.","22 new COVID-19 cases reported in Windsor-Essex, including 10 in community",5,0.34693088456262167

The bulletin, which lists ongoing and recently ended outbreaks of the coronavirus in health-care facilities around the region was updated around 3:30 p.m. Thursday. It indicates that outbreak restrictions were imposed at the facility on Thursday.

A spokesperson for Providence Health Care, which operates the hospital, said the NICU has been closed for cleaning, but the hospital's maternity unit remains operational and a satellite NICU has been opened.

Any babies born during the outbreak who need intensive care will receive it, the spokesperson said.

""There is no evidence of risk to patients elsewhere in the hospital,"" a statement from VCH says.

Moving forward, parents visiting their babies in NICU will be required to wear a mask and sign a visitor log, VCH said.

196,"TORONTO -- For months, Bruno Iozzo’s family waited for news of whether he would survive COVID-19.

In late March, the healthy 73-year-old man was among the first COVID-19 patients admitted to the Humber River Hospital in Toronto. For the next 104 days, Iozzo would fight the infection in the hospital’s intensive care unit.

CTV News first reported Iozzo’s story back in April, when his daughter Gisella was unsure whether her father would survive the infection.

“I just hope my dad would be one of those miracles that come out of this story that shows the world that there's hope,” she told CTV News back in April.

Today, Iozzo is indeed one of those miracles. He was discharged from Humber River Hospital a few days ago and is now rehabbing at the Runnymede Healthcare Centre with the goal of returning home on Aug. 29.

“He's been here for five days, he's walking, up in a chair, he’s eating by mouth,” said Geeta Grewal, director of patient care at the facility. “He's actively engaged in activities so he's doing very, very well. “

“It's amazing because he's so positive and he's so motivated that he really wants to do well and we know that he's going to do well.”

When he was first admitted to the hospital, doctors noted that the infection had damaged his lungs and were unable to send enough oxygen to his blood, which eventually led to a kidney failure and dialysis.

“We were very concerned when he came into the ICU,” Dr. Sanjay Manocha, a critical care physician at the Humber River Hospital, told CTV News. “He was critically ill needing life support to go on the ventilator and through his journey in the ICU there were times where we weren't sure if he was going to survive.”

Iozzo said he doesn’t remember much from the ordeal.

“(For) two, three months it was black,” he said. “Three months in this dark room.”

“It was the worst.”

While thousands of Canadians have died from COVID-19 in the past few months, Iozzo has become quite the success story for the doctors involved.

“It's a great feeling to see someone who was that sick, go through a severe critical illness on life support to the point where we were not sure that they were going to survive,” said Manocha.

“It was amazing to see and it provides hope for us that we can provide the same for other patients who go through this illness as well.”

Manocha also hopes that Iozzo’s story will be an inspiration to other frontline workers and patients alike.

“By seeing someone, leave the ICU and surviving this, it actually puts faith back into what we do on a day-to-day basis for all of our patients,” he said. “This, I think, will help the team recognize that their efforts are not (in) vain.”

Iozzo still faces a long road to recovery, but Gisella is overjoyed with her father’s perseverance.

“It's just incredible for him to speak, for him to see what he's gone through and be able to tell his story and to hug me,” she said.

“I was just happy that when he woke up that he remembered my name because part of me didn’t think he was going to.”

In an effort to give back to the hospital, Gisella has turned to fundraising. She collects a bag of garbage along the Humber River recreational trail -- which is near the hospital -- for every $100 that is donated through her “Trash for Treasure” campaign. She hopes to raise $30,000 for the hospital’s foundation by the end of the year.

Meanwhile, Manocha said it’s cases like Iozzo’s that give doctors’ hope that they will be better prepared in the event of a second wave of the virus.

The virus sent him into a medically induced coma, he told CNN's Anderson Cooper Wednesday. And when he woke up, he was paralyzed.

""I really thought I had been involved in an accident or some sort of mishap,"" Case said. He has since had to learn how to stand and how to write.

Coronavirus infections and hospitalizations are on the rise across the U.S. With cases nearing 3.5 million in the country, health experts are learning more about the varied ways the virus manifests and the harrowing impacts that can remain during recovery.

Case has undergone intensive therapy in hopes of regaining the mobility he lost from his muscles atrophying. Doctors told him only time will tell what his recovery will look like, he said. But had his wife not pressed for his healthcare, he might not have recovered at all, he said.

Both Case and his wife, Anne Costa Case, were sick. But they said they had a hard time accessing a test because they had not travelled and did not know anyone who had tested positive.

Case might have stopped there, but when his symptoms progressed, they went to the hospital.

""When he started reporting the shortness of breath, we decided that's it, we need to go to the ER,"" Anne Costa Case said.

He was transferred to a different hospital, put on a ventilator and then put in a medically induced coma for 20 days, he said. Costa Case could not be there with him for all that time, but she asked the nurses to play his favorite jazz music for him.

By the time he woke up and she saw him again, he had lost so much weight he was barely recognizable, she said.

203,"By Peter German

Surrey council’s avowed intention to create a municipal police force would end over 70 years of RCMP service to the community and terminate a 20-year contract signed in 2012.

Since 1935, the federal government has allowed its federal force to police municipalities, with over 150 contracts currently in place.

The reasons are obvious – a quality, cost effective police service. The RCMP did not ask to become Surrey’s municipal force. Residents overwhelmingly voted to replace the Surrey Municipal Police in a 1950 plebiscite.

So why does Surrey now wish to end its contract with the RCMP? The reasons given float between a safer city, greater accountability, and that Surrey is now a big city.

It is extremely unusual for a municipality to unilaterally end its contract with the RCMP, other than when communities amalgamate.

Once gone, never to return is the federal mantra, as it underwrites significant contract policing costs. Below are the real issues.

THE QUALITY OF POLICING WILL IMPROVE

Wrong! The quality of police officers on the street in the Lower Mainland is virtually the same whether they are municipal or RCMP. This is the result of common standards. At the end of the day, it boils down to having sufficient street resources and specialized units to deliver the level of policing required by a community. This is not the function of one force or another.

SURREY COUNCIL WILL GOVERN THE NEW FORCE

Wrong! Municipalities do not appoint police boards – the province does. The municipality has two seats on a police board. RCMP detachments typically report to a council appointed safety committee. Surrey recently changed this reporting structure, with the RCMP commander reporting only to the mayor.

A MUNICIPAL FORCE WILL BE COST-NEUTRAL

Wrong! Make no mistake, a municipal force will cost more than the RCMP. Nobody knows how much more, for one simple reason. The RCMP has not been engaged in the discussion.

Consider the following.

1. In 2018, the per capita cost of policing in Surrey was $284 compared to $458 in Vancouver – a 60 per difference.

2. Surrey detachment has 843 officers. Any force policing Surrey needs more resources. To suggest that the new force can perform its duties with the same number, or less officers is poppycock.

3. The RCMP patrol model is one person per car. Many municipal forces are contractually required to employ a percentage of two person cars.

4. RCMP members maintain most of the investigations they are assigned during a shift, rather than referring them to detective units.

5. The salary differential between the RCMP and municipal police is between 15 and 20 per cent.

6. A new force will offer a salary commensurate with the highest municipal police salary.

7. Ten per cent of Surrey’s policing costs are covered by the federal government.

8. Transition costs include tens of millions of dollars for clothing, vehicles, and infrastructure.

9. Surrey will be required to deal with all lawsuits, such as police car accidents.

10. The cost of recruiting 800 plus employees and training them is huge.

It is reasonable to project that Surrey will require a force of at least 1,200 police officers to cover off existing needs, and the new patrol model. Combine that with a 15 to 20 per cent increase in salaries, the loss of a 10 per cent subsidy, a huge capital investment, and transition costs, and the increased cost to Surrey taxpayers will be in the hundreds of millions of dollars.

RECRUITING A NEW FORCE WILL NOT BE A PROBLEM

Wrong! Where do you find 800, or 1,200 police officers? It is estimated that up to 150 municipal police officers from other Lower Mainland forces may bridge over to be closer to home or for promotions. RCMP pension portability remains an issue, despite Surrey bravely suggesting it is not. Nobody has even surveyed how many RCMP members are interested in joining, but the RCMP attrition rate is quite low. Where then will the bulk of the new force be recruited? Overseas? Other provinces? Will hiring requirements be reduced? And how will this provide a better level of policing?

TRAINING A NEW FORCE WILL NOT BE A PROBLEM

Wrong! The Police Academy at the Justice Institute of B.C. is woefully under resourced, with an aging and outdated infrastructure that struggles to keep up with the current attrition rate of municipal forces. It has no present ability to expand and provide the numbers of recruits required for Surrey or to backfill other departments. Despite a brave assertion that there is a plan, the need to train hundreds of police officers to an acceptable standard will be a huge cost to the Province and municipalities.

THE NEW FORCE WILL MAGICALLY REPLACE RCMP

Wrong! Any transition would rely heavily on a continued RCMP presence, meaning two police chiefs, multiple communication systems, different cultures, policies, and command structures. A one-year timeframe is pie in the sky. Recruiting, training, and new infrastructure will take much longer.

SURREY WILL BE SAFER

Wrong! Naysayers skate around the fact that Surrey’s violent crime severity index in 2018 was at a 10-year low. The local detachment has done everything asked of it by the City to deal with the illegal drug market, domestic abuse complaints, gang violence and routine calls for service. During a transition, organized crime may well have a field day. Transferring institutional knowledge, intelligence and sources is not an easy task for police.

MUNICIPAL FORCE CREATES BETTER SENSE OF IDENTITY

Wrong! The RCMP has responded to millions of calls for service over the past 70 years. Hundreds of RCMP officers make their homes in Surrey. They are volunteers – hockey, baseball, soccer, and football coaches. Many have been injured on the job and five made the ultimate sacrifice. It is our national police force, with which all Canadians identify.

The current, integrated nature of policing in the Lower Mainland has withstood the test of time, commissions of inquiry, and challenging cases. The citizens of Surrey should do what they want, but with their eyes wide open. Trading the yellow stripe of Canada’s national police for the blue stripe of a municipal force must not be a knee-jerk decision taken with blinders on. Taxpayers will endure the consequences for a generation.

Peter German, a lawyer and consultant, was the RCMP’s Lower Mainland commander (2007-11) and deputy commissioner for western and northern Canada (2011-12). He is a former member of the Transit Police Board. His graduate work on the RCMP contracts in 1990 was the first academic study of the area.

By Curt Taylor Griffiths

As a member of the Provincial Municipal Policing Transition Study Committee, which created the transition plan for the new City of Surrey Police Department, I feel compelled to respond to several assertions made by Peter German in the media, including in the June 11th issue of the Now-Leader.

German argues that the quality of policing will not improve with the transition from RCMP to a municipal police force. It will. The Surrey Police Department will deliver policing services within a community policing framework that is best practice and evidence based. It will be flexible and adaptable to the changing needs of one of Canada’s most dynamic communities. The delivery of policing services will be decentralized, focusing on the communities of South Surrey, Cloverdale, Newton, Fleetwood/Guildford, and City Centre/Whalley. Officers will assume ownership of the districts.

German states that the Surrey RCMP has 843 officers. This figure includes vacancies and officers on secondment to specialized units. The actual strength of the detachment is 792 and the number of deployable officers is fewer than that. The new SPD will have 805 officers, the majority of whom will be involved in front line service. Compared to the current deployment of RCMP officers in Surrey, there will be 16 per cent more uniformed SPD officers on the street.

Peter German: Costs of new police force will handcuff Surrey taxpayers for a generation

German raises the issue of increased salary costs associated with the new SPD. The collective agreement that will be negotiated between the RCMP union and the federal government is likely to include a provision that RCMP officers in B.C. have wage parity with their municipal counterparts. This would result in a 20 per cent wage increase for RCMP members. Notably, RCMP-policed municipalities will not be at the bargaining table, but will get the invoice. If wage parity is achieved, the costs of RCMP contract policing and municipal policing will be similar, even with the 10 per cent federal subsidy for RCMP.

German asserts that training the new members of the SPD will be a problem. It will not. The transition plan calls for 68 new recruits to be hired and trained over a two-year period at the Police Academy at the Justice Institute of B.C. The staff at the academy assured the transition committee that this number can be accommodated. The remaining hires will be officers who are currently in service. Although there has not been a formal survey of in-service officers, anecdotal evidence suggests that the SPD will be successful in hiring currently serving officers from other police services, including the RCMP. The transition plan calls for a gradual change-over from RCMP to municipal, with SPD members replacing RCMP officers over a period of time.

German raises the issue of community safety, arguing that criminals will have a “field day” during the transition. Unlikely. The graduated transition plan will ensure the department is fully staffed at all times. Protocols have also been established for investigative file continuity during the transition.

In German’s view, municipal police services do not create a greater sense of identity. They do. In contrast to their RCMP counterparts, municipal police officers generally spend their entire careers in one community. This facilitates ownership and partnerships. The SPD will be able to recruit a workforce that reflects the diversity of the community, an impossibility in an RCMP detachment where personnel decisions are not made at the local level. The arrival and departure of officers and the Officer in Command of the detachment is determined by the organizational needs of the RCMP rather than by those of the municipality.

The men and women of the RCMP who have policed the city for the past 70 years have served admirably. However, Surrey has outgrown the RCMP model. It was the last municipality in Canada with over 350,000 residents without an independent police service. The City of Surrey had its own police service from 1887 to 1951. In many ways, it is returning to its roots.

208,"HALIFAX—A Nova Scotia man has been charged with assaulting a peace officer near a border crossing — leading Premier Stephen McNeil to accuse the officer’s union of playing politics during the COVID-19 pandemic. Cpl. Jennifer Clarke said the RCMP were called to assist at the Fort Lawrence crossing near the border with New Brunswick just before 8 p.m. Wednesday. She said a man from East Amherst has been charged with assaulting a peace officer and breach of conditions. Jason MacLean, president of the Nova Scotia Government and General Employees Union, said the incident happened during a routine vehicle inspection, and it’s left the officer shaken. MacLean said the driver objected to the inspection and tried to choke the male officer, who used his radio to call for help from some nearby conservation officers. Those officers helped detain the alleged assailant before the police arrived, he said in an interview Thursday. The officer, MacLean said, “is very lucky that there were conservation officers nearby.” He said vehicle compliance officers have raised concerns about safety in the past because they work alone and are equipped only with radios. During a COVID-19 news conference Thursday, Nova Scotia’s premier said the incident is concerning and thanked public servants for their efforts as the province reopens its borders to Atlantic Canada. But when asked what his government would do to improve safety for peace officers, McNeil accused the union of distracting from wider efforts to recover from the pandemic. “To me, the union has looked at every opportunity to complain and looked to divide,” the premier said. “I will not allow some people to try to divide our province as we continue to work our way through dealing with COVID and reopen our economy.” McNeil said law enforcement agencies will be placed at the border if needed, but said some groups are bringing up past issues while the province tries to move forward. The premier said the province reported no new cases of COVID-19 and one additional recovery from the illness. MacLean said the premier’s outburst reflects a bad attitude towards unions and their safety demands. He noted that his union had not raised the pandemic when discussing Wednesday’s incident, and said the inspection happening at the time was not related to the pandemic or to border controls. “It’s unfortunate that (McNeil) gets that way because we’re speaking out on bona fide issues that are ones of safety,” MacLean said. “We’re going to continue to advocate.” He said the union’s duty is to stand up for members at a time when safety at work is paramount, and that it’s unfortunate the premier interprets safety concerns as sources of division. “Lost in all of this are the heroes that (McNeil) says are out there doing all the work, and I’ll tell you, it’s tough times,” MacLean said.",Nova Scotia premier accuses union of divisiveness after assault on officer,3,0.3390956478509337

An incident in Whalley Thursday night came to a tragic end, after a man jumped from the top of a 40-storey crane.

According to a news release issued by Surrey RCMP, it began just before 6:30 p.m., when an officer saw a man climb over a fence and into a construction site at 9887 Whalley Blvd.

When the officer called out to the man, he ran and climbed to the top of the crane, the release states.

One witness reported the man “appears to be walking around the crane, sitting, then walking, then going into the operator’s box.”

Despite efforts by multiple agencies – including the Lower Mainland Emergency Response Team, a crisis negotiator and Surrey RCMP’s Car 67, which pairs a police officer with a mental health nurse – the man jumped from the crane shortly after 10 p.m. He did not survive.

Many witnessed the tragic event, and police encouraged “anyone who may need help as a result of witnessing this incident to reach out to their health-care provider.”

“Witnessing a tragedy can be very impactful and emotionally disturbing,” Cpl. Elenore Sturko said.

218,"The world is aching for change, change for a more positive future that is genuinely inclusive and more equitable for all people in society. I (as many people do) wholeheartedly support movements towards these much-needed changes. From my lens, it seems as though the world is taking notice of other voices that have been aching to be heard for so long, through the forms of documentaries, books, and listening to people’s diverse experiences. My hope is that this leads to greater understanding, as this is an essential step towards building a future that is more equitable for all.

However, it seems that so many people believe that to be for one thing you have to be against another, and that is just not how things need to work all of the time.

In my household, we’ve been feeling a lot of digital daggers of hatred from the general public lately.

Let me explain.

My husband is a police officer. I’m sure that you have noticed an awful lot of negative social media and news attention around police. It is way easier to find negative stories about police officers than positive ones. This generally seems to be the case, but it is especially true right now.

• READ MORE: B.C. to review Police Act amid growing calls to defund police

• READ MORE: When protesters cry ‘defund the police,’ what does it mean?

Police agencies hire their members from the same human population as every other organization, so of course not all police officers are going to be wonderful human beings. Some of the actions of police officers shown in the media are disgraceful, to say the least. Obviously, former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin falls into that category.

Police officers who conduct themselves in this way by no means make up the majority of the police officers in the world.

On the contrary, they make up a tiny fraction of the general policing population. Negative policing stories are simply reported on with much higher frequency than accounts of police assisting people out of a dangerous situation, lending a helping hand to someone in need, or showing compassion.

Let me put it to you this way. Out of all the articles you’ve ever read about elementary school teachers, how many of those articles were about child abusers or sex predators? How many of those articles focused on teachers who went above and beyond to help prepare their students for an upcoming exam? You’ve probably read more articles about teachers who turned out to be predators than teachers who gave their all to help a student succeed. Does that mean that most teachers are sex offenders? Absolutely not. That is my point. What generally gets reported on are the tantalizing stories, not the mundane everyday stories that are not newsworthy. The exact same principal applies to the depiction of police in the news and on social media.

I wish people could understand what the day-to-day of policing is really like. On a daily basis, police officers respond to calls from the public where they are asked to bring justice and peace to pretty awful situations.

While doing this, they are shouted at, spat on, and worse. My husband has personally been called to deal with some incredibly reprehensible situations this year and has helped to arrest people who have committed some of the most horrific crimes imaginable. Because of this, he has been in some extremely dangerous situations. He loses peace over it, he loses sleep over it, he has nightmares, and then he repeatedly experiences hatred towards him because he wears the police badge. Nonetheless, he gets up in the morning, puts his uniform on, and goes back out to do his job to help make our communities safer. This can be very hard to watch as a spouse.

My husband is a genuinely kind and compassionate person. He has taught me more about understanding and empathy towards people from all walks of life than anyone else I’ve ever met. But to be honest, I know dozens of police officers who, just like my husband, also have a heart of gold and the actions to back up their intentions. It breaks my heart to see all of the police officers being painted with the same ugly brush based on the conduct of a select few whose actions have become highly publicized.

I suppose this letter to the editor is just a public service announcement from a police wife, who is hurting alongside the rest of the world. It is honourable to be working for positive changes for the world, and I truly hope that you are.

Please remember that while doing so, you don’t need to be against the kind-hearted and dedicated police officers who are working towards the same positive end goals that you are working towards.

An adult male pedestrian has been sent to hospital and is in critical condition after a serious crash in Cloverdale.

Police have closed the westbound lane of Highway 10 between the 176th (Highway 15) and 168th Streets.

“Road closures are currently in effect as a result of a serious motor vehicle collision that occurred in Cloverdale,” Corporal Joanie Sidhu, media relations officer, wrote in a release.

Police say at about 9:41 a.m. the man was hit by a semi-truck at the intersection of 172 Street and Highway 10. The man was trying to cross north to south on No. 10 when the westbound truck hit him.

“The semi-truck driver remained at the scene of the collision.”

Sidhu said the Surrey RCMP Frontline and Traffic Services were at the scene to investigate.

The road is expected to be closed for several hours.

Police are asking anyone with who witnessed the collision, or has dashcam footage, to please call Surrey RCMP at 604-599-0502. Anonymous reports can be made through Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-TIPS or www.solvecrime.ca.

221,"VANCOUVER -- As B.C. police are on the defensive over how they respond to mental health calls, a program in Oregon which takes police out of the equation is getting serious attention in Vancouver.

The unusual approach by CAHOOTS has worked for 30 years in Eugene, Ore., proponents say, has saved lives and saves millions of dollars a year by replacing police cars and sworn officers with trained civilians in a van.

“CAHOOTS is a great model for us to be looking at in Vancouver and exactly the conversation we should be learning from,” said Vancouver City Councillor Christine Boyle.

CAHOOTS stands for “Crisis Assistance Helping Out On The Streets,” and is getting national attention during a movement to defund the police, sparked by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May.

Fundamentally, CAHOOTS workers take a different approach in a variety of mental health calls including wellness checks, mental health crises, substance abuse and threats of suicide, the agency’s Kimber Hawes told ABC affiliate KEZI 9 News this month.

“Police are trained to perceive stuff as a threat, and we are trained exactly the opposite,” she said.

These are problems that, in the hands of police, have turned violent, such as the RCMP response to a wellness check on Mona Wang. A video that’s evidence in a lawsuit shows the responding Kelowna Mountie dragging Wang through the hallways of her apartment building, pushing her head to the ground, and stepping on her head.

After the video was reported on by CTV News, a top B.C. Mountie called for nurses to accompany officers on all wellness checks.

Another case in Nanaimo saw Mounties there respond to a call for help by apprehending former firefighter Shanna Blanchard. When she said she didn’t think they had the legal grounds, one of them punched her in the mouth, she said, causing her to lose a tooth. She said Mounties put a spit hood on and she worried she would drown in her own blood.

Today, the CAHOOTS program has three vans, some 40 staff, and is one service advocates point to when discussing what “defunding the police” might look like.

The Eugene and Springfield, Ore., police budgets are together $90 million a year, according to CAHOOTS materials. CAHOOTS handles 17 per cent of their calls for just $2.1 million a year.

And though in B.C., many mental health calls could be presumed violent and require the presence of an armed officer, CAHOOTS attended 24,000 calls last year, and only called for police backup 150 times.

A Vancouver police sergeant said she’s cautiously open to the model.

“It’s a smaller population, not exactly the same demographic as our city in Vancouver,” said Sgt. AJ Benefield during a police technical briefing on mental health response on Thursday. “Before us opting to have that approach we’d have to analyze how they’re doing things.”

However many mental health calls don’t present themselves as such up front, a VPD spokesperson said. They come in as calls requiring a police response, such as assault, or a disturbance, and then officers arrive, assess the situation, and determine if another resource is required.

The VPD face a rising tide of mental health calls: 4,836 in 2019, compared to just 2,276 in 2010. The agency is responding with a variety of approaches in conjunction with Vancouver Coastal Health, including Assertive Outreach Teams and and Assertive Community Treatment that is designed to proactively connect people in need with social workers and nurses.

The approach has resulted in mental health calls actually becoming a smaller component of what the VPD respond to, officers said.

“A lot of things we’ve been doing in the community, especially in regards to mental health for example, the VPD has really been the leader in a lot of initiatives” said Supt. Martin Bruce on Thursday.

Even if one department were to adopt a CAHOOTS-like model, there would be hurdles to having it be dispatched separately. Emergency dispatch in B.C. is done to police, fire and ambulance by E-Comm, which is a not-for-profit agency owned by shareholders that include police departments.

“If this type of response model is something the Province, our first responder partners or mental health service organizations would like us to explore further, we would be very open to discussing and re-imagining out important role under a new model,” said E-Comm spokesperson Jasmine Bradley.

The province has named a special committee of the B.C. legislature to examine and modernize the Police Act, which governs policing in the province. It will examine the extent of systemic racism and review the role of police with respect to complex social issues that include mental health.",Oregon mental health response saves money and lives - without police,2,0.16969414179438758
223,"Jazzy Sran, 43, was believed to have been smuggling cocaine across the border

The taped-off scene on Lucern Crescent just before 8:30 a.m. the morning after on July 11. (Patrick Penner / Mission Record)

The victim of Abbotsford’s latest homicide was identified last year in court documents as an alleged “crime boss” who was believed to be smuggling cocaine into Canada from the U.S.

Karmjit “Jazzy” Sran, 43, was shot dead Friday night at around 8 p.m. in the 2700 block of Lucern Crescent in Abbotsford.

The Integrated Homicide Investigation Team (IHIT) released his name Sunday night, and said Sran was known to police and that the shooting had “all the hallmarks of a targeted hit.”

The Abbotsford News reported in July 2019 that Sran had applied to the courts to be released from prison while he awaited a hearing on whether he should be extradited to the U.S. to face charges there for conspiracy to traffic in cocaine.

Sran had been in prison since April 24, 2019, but the courts denied him interim release the following month. There are no court documents indicating when, or why, he was later released from prison.

RELATED: Alleged Abbotsford crime boss loses bid for jail release while awaiting extradition hearing

Sran was arrested following an undercover investigation that started after a truck driver was arrested in November 2013 at the Sumas, Wash. border crossing when 19 kilograms of cocaine was found in his vehicle.

That man, who later became a cooperating witness with U.S. investigators, stated that he had intended to smuggle the drugs into Canada. The truck driver said he was working for two organizations, one of which had a boss he knew as “Jazzy,” the ruling states.

Sran, who worked in the construction industry, went by the names Jazzy or Jessi.

The witness offered to introduce Jazzy to a Homeland Security agent who was working undercover as a drug trafficker.

According to court documents, that officer and Sran had four face-to-face meetings in February and March 2014, when they discussed the purchase and smuggling of cocaine into Canada from the U.S.

During that time, three transactions took place involving supposed cocaine in the amounts of 19, 12 and 10 kilograms with a total street value of around $2 million.

But unknown to Sran, the product consisted of both sham and actual cocaine, according to the documents.

The documents state that Sran entered the U.S. on Nov. 12, 2013 and Feb. 28, 2014. During the transactions, he referred to himself as “the boss.”

The U.S. requested the extradition of Sran, and the courts issued an extradition warrant in April 2019, at which time he was arrested.

During the hearing to seek Sran’s interim release, his lawyer argued that there was no evidence that Sran had been involved in any criminal activity since 2014.

However, the judge denied his released, saying she believed that Sran had access to “large sums of money” and posed a flight risk.

Prior to his arrest, Sran was living in a home in Abbotsford with his mother, wife and four-year-old son.

Investigators are asking for dash-cam video from drivers who travelled along the following routes in Abbotsford between 7 p.m. and 8:30 p.m. on the evening of Friday, July 10:

• Taylor Road between Mount Lehman Road and Ross Road

• Ross Road to 56 Avenue

229,"Andrew Seangio, 35, turned himself into police in connection to the charges in Ottawa

A suspended B.C. RCMP officer has been charged with a laundry list of sex offences dating back a decade.

The Ottawa Police Service announced 34 counts of voyeurism and three counts of sexual assault against Andrew Seangio, 35, on Thursday (July 16). The charges are connected to alleged incidents involving six woman known to him and are believed to have occurred between 2011 and 2018 while he was living in the city.

Seangio was charged in March by Vancouver police in connection to a string of sexual offences near an all-girls school last year. Shortly after those charges were laid, Seangio was suspended by the RCMP.

Police say Seangio turned himself into police Thursday morning.

Investigators believe there may be further victims and are asking anyone with information to contact their Sexual Assault and Child Abuse Unit tipline at 613-236-1222 ext. 5944 or to e-mail mcm@ottawapolice.ca.

234,"‘Const. Browning and the RCMP have engaged in conduct that is reprehensible and deserves punishment’

A second woman has filed a civil lawsuit against Kelowna Mountie Lacey Browning, accusing the constable of assaulting her while on duty.

The suit filed in BC Supreme Court by Fiona Read on Wednesday, July 15, comes less than a month after security camera footage was released showing Const. Browning dragging UBC Okanagan student Mona Wang down a hallway at her residence and stepping on her head. Wang is suing the RCMP officer, the Attorney General of Canada, the Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor following the incident.

Read’s allegations date back to the early morning hours of New Year’s Day 2016, following a party at her friend’s neighbour’s house.

Read was initially meant to spend the night at her friend’s house but she says she became uncomfortable at the party and began walking back to her friend’s house to gather her things. She had planned to head back to her own house. She claims her friends attempted to stop her from leaving but was eventually allowed to leave.

Leaving her car at her friend’s house, Read began walking home. She came upon an RCMP vehicle and, according to the suit, felt she was “in need of protection” and approached the cruiser to seek help from the officer, who was later identified to be Const. Browning.

Browning asked Read to confirm her first name was Fiona, the suit claims, and upon doing so, “Browning grabbed the plaintiff, flipped her around, grabbed her by her hair and pounded her head into the ground multiple times causing damage to the plaintiff’s face.”

“The plaintiff lost count of how many times her face was slammed into concrete,” reads the suit.

Read claims Browning then cuffed her and pulled her from the ground by her arms which were behind her back. Read was arrested and brought to the RCMP detachment, where she claims she was held for six hours and Browning never asked her a question besides her name.

Read was fingerprinted and eventually told she was being charged with assault and resisting arrest, though she was never read her rights and the Crown never approved the charges, the claim states.

“Browning charged the plaintiff in order to cover up her assault on the plaintiff,” the suit reads.

Despite arriving at the detachment in “extreme pain and discomfort,” Read claims she was not allowed to be treated by paramedics.

After her discharge, Read went to see a doctor, where her injuries were documented, including her bruised and swollen face, missing chunks of hair and injured right knee.

“As a result of the brutal assault by Browning, the plaintiff had to permanently quit running and skiing due to the severity of the injury to her knee,” the suit states.

“The actions of Browning and the RCMP were reckless, arrogant, high-handed, abusive, and showed a callous disregard to the plaintiff’s rights. Browning and the RCMP have engaged in conduct that is reprehensible and deserves punishment.”

The following day, Read claims she attempted to file a complaint against Browning to her supervisor but they refused to accept it.

“The actions of the supervisor are evidence of the RCMP being complicit in covering up Browning’s assault of the plaintiff,” reads the suit.

The plaintiff only became aware that she had a right to complain and take legal action against Browning’s actions following media reports about recent allegations against Browning and the RCMP’s statements that ‘they take complaints seriously.’”

None of Read’s claims have been proven in court and Browning has not filed a response.

The RCMP has not yet been formally served with the lawsuit but the claims will be reviewed and addressed by the Department of Justice through the normal civil processes, said Staff-Sgt. Janelle Shoihet.

“The allegations are also being reviewed to determine if there are any other actions that need to be taken,” she added.

Browning was placed on administrative leave after criminal and internal investigations were launched related to her actions against Wang.

Shoihet said the criminal investigation into the previous allegations has been completed and is now subject to an external review by the Abbotsford Police Department. Once they have completed their review, and if there are no other investigative requirements, the materials will then be sent to the BC Prosecution Service for charge assessment.

An online petition calling for Browning to be fired and criminally charged has reached nearly 375,000 signatures.

236,"Abbotsford police used ‘less lethal firearm’ and dog in arrest of man believed to have gun

The province’s police watchdog is investigating after a man was seriously injured in late June after Abbotsford police officers shot him with a “less lethal firearm” and deployed a police dog.

The incident took place around 7:30 p.m. in the evening of June 28. Officers were called to a report of a man with a gun at a home in the 2000 block of West Railway Street, the APD told the Independent Investigations Office (IIO) – the public body tasked with probing police incidents in which someone is seriously hurt.

According to a release from the IIO: “Upon arrival, officers contained the area and engaged with the man. During the interaction, a less lethal firearm and police service dog were deployed, and the man was taken into custody.”

The IIO says the man was taken to hospital, where he was found to have sustained “serious but not life-threatening injuries.”

Anyone with information on the incident is asked to contact the IIO Witness Line at 1-855-446-8477.

The incident came a little more than a month after a second arrest that resulted in the IIO’s involvement. Police had injured a man during a takedown on May 21. The IIO were called into investigate, but in late June declared that it was dropping the matter because he did not suffer “serious harm.” The IIO only investigates incidents resulting in serious harm or death, regardless of wrongdoing. Other complaints or cases of potential wrongdoing are handled by the Office of the Police Complaints Commissioner (OPCC).

237,"Six-year-old William suffered burning in his eye and was taken to hospital after an incident at the Mission spray park. Several children had a negative reaction to something at the park. RCMP are investigating. / Carli Emary Facebook Photos

The spay park at the Mission Leisure Centre has been shut down after an incident this morning (July 14) left several children with sore eyes, burning lips and even burns on their face.

Mission Fire Rescue Services and BC Ambulance Services were called to the scene after several children began to cry and complain of a burning pain.

Colleen Draganov was at the park with her children when the incident occurred.

“One of the girls that we were with started crying and she couldn’t open her eyes. Her mouth was stinging and her eyes were stinging. She now has burns on her face.”

A few moments later, Draganov’s daughter began to cry.

“She’s four and she’s crying because her lips are all swollen and red … Then kids just started to come towards us, maybe four or five more.”

They all had similar symptoms.

Draganov called 911 and emergency crews arrived and treated the children.

Carli Emary was also at the park with her two children. Her six-year-old, William, was the first child to begin crying.

“He came out of no where, screaming and covering his eyes. I thought he had been stung by a bee at first, but no, he said ‘it burns, it burns’ and I started to hear other kids screaming,” said Emary.

Staff at the leisure centre offered what assistance they could until the paramedics arrived.

Emary’s son William was taken to hospital, but later released.

“It scared him. He though he was dying at first and then thought he was going blind. I had to calm him down.”

While the cause of the incident is unknown, Emary believes it was pepper spray.

“I got it in my mouth after touching him and I’ve been in a crowd that has been pepper sprayed and it’s the exact same feeling.”

Maureen Sinclair, director of Parks, Recreation and Culture said at this time they do not know what caused the incident.

“The spray park has been closed down at least for the day. Staff are cleaning everything up because it appeared that something was being passed from child to child,” said Sinclair.

“We don’t know what the cause of it was, but we’ll test it and retest it and run it in the morning and make sure everything is OK.”

The Mission RCMP were also called and are investigating.

According to a press release, the Mission RCMP are currently working with the District of Mission to determine the origin of the substance. The District conducted a test of the water shortly after the incident was reported. No irregularities were found in the water, including the chlorine levels. The Mission RCMP Victim Services team has been engaged to reach out to those affected.

“At this point, we can’t confirm what the substance is. We are currently looking at all avenues including engaging our Integrated Forensic Identification Services to identify the substance and it’s origin,” said Corp. Nathan Berze.

The Mission RCMP are requesting that if anyone has any information about this incident, to contact them at 604-826-7161 or report anonymously through Crimestoppers at 1-800-222-8477 (TIPS) or online at SOLVECRIME.CA.

238,"David Brault has been imprisoned since 1969 for his part in the killing of two men in Ottawa

An inmate serving a life sentence for his part in the 1969 slaying of two men in Ottawa died at Abbotsford’s Pacific Institution on July 13.

David Brault has been serving time for two counts of non-capital murder, two counts of sexual assault and “other offences” since his arrest over 50 years ago, according to a July 17 news release from Correctional Service Canada.

CSC said Brault’s next of kin have been notified of his death.

A story in the Ottawa Journal, which stopped publication in 1980, says Brault was 24 years old in 1969 when he and another man pleaded guilty to the shooting deaths of Gerald MacDonald of Ottawa and Michigan resident Kenneth Vallee.

Brault told the court he became angry after being passed dangerously by two cars on an Ontario highway and after he chased each vehicle down, he and his friend shot both men.

245,"I know he’s a little busy at the moment with the coronavirus, but it’s imperative for Premier Doug Ford, whether it’s in the next throne speech or perhaps after the next election, to announce that the government of Ontario is taking over the provincial tow-truck industry.

It might cost money, but it will be worth it. The insurance companies will love it, because they are sick and tired of being ripped off by the vultures out there. And Ford would likely win re-election in a walk because anybody (and there are many) who’s ever been taken to the cleaners by those outlaws will thank him with their votes.

I was driving down a ramp leading to the eastbound 401 the other day when a grey tow truck just blew past me. It was as if I was standing still. I knew immediately where he was going.

There had been a call for a tow truck further along the 401. And this guy was racing to get to the scene before other tow-truck drivers arrived.

To the winner would go the spoils.

Be assured, there are hundreds of tow-truck companies in Ontario that are honest. You can count among them those connected with the CAA. But there are still way too many crooks and unscrupulous people out there.

The “racing to the scene” I talked about two paragraphs ago is just the beginning. Those thieves are masters at taking advantage of emotionally upset motorists who’ve just been in a crash by hooking up the car (or cars) in question and taking them to the shop of a person with whom they’re in cahoots.

Although, because of legislation, the tow truck is required to post its rates, what unsuspecting motorists often aren’t ready for are hidden charges, like fees to hook up, to unhook and storage while they, or their insurance company, make arrangements to have the vehicle repaired. Which could mean another tow and a whole new set of charges.

Want to pay for the repairs yourself, so that your insurance doesn’t go up? Some body shops will give you an itemized bill, but not the one you’d been expecting. The damage and repair costs are often much higher than originally estimated.

These might seem like exaggerations, but they happen all the time.

The legislation I mentioned was set in motion in 2014 and finally became law in 2018. The laws are fine, so far as they go, but if you’re a crook, they don’t mean a lot. Those guys are professional liars (“I just called CAA on your behalf, sir, and they want you to know that, so as not to hold up traffic, it is OK for me to tow you. I will take you to a really good repair shop I know and they will look after reporting the collision for you”).

And you, as upset as you are, will probably say, “Yes, of course,” because if you said, “No,” they wouldn’t be in business long.

It never fails to amaze me that when there’s an accident on the highway you have the police, an ambulance service, a fire department and several tow trucks on scene. Three are public and the fourth is private. Why is that? Particularly when the evidence of skulduggery frequently committed by the fourth is so overwhelming.

That organized crime is involved is no longer in doubt. York Regional Police recently arrested 20 people and laid charges dealing with, among other things, murder, arson and threats in relation to a turf war and staging serious, multi-car crashes in order to file phoney insurance claims.

Rules and regulations rarely work. It’s up to municipalities to police the industry, but according to the CAA, fewer than 20 of more than 400 municipalities actually have laws clear enough to be enforced. Which means everywhere else is ripe for corruption. For instance, several Ottawa police officers were recently charged for receiving kickbacks from tow-truck drivers; Star investigations have found GTA officers to be involved in the same way.

The only way to clean up this mess is to eliminate the problem. Make tow trucks a division of policing, or EMS, or fire departments. The premier himself was quoted as saying after those 20 charges were laid that, “We’re coming for you and we’re going to catch you. The party’s over.”

This has been building for years and the time is now ripe to do something. Don’t just catch them, premier. Put them out of business. Make the industry a public service and be done with it.

247,"IVRY-SUR-SEINE, FRANCE -- Assa Traore has been fighting for justice ever since her brother Adama died in the custody of French police on his 24th birthday four years ago. And she's determined to keep fighting until ""the end,"" she says: until someone is convicted for his death.

But recently, her goal has grown larger. She's now at the forefront of a new movement to wipe out what activists deem to be systemic racism in policing, fight for Black rights and to challenge France's official vision of itself as a colorblind society.

""We became soldiers in spite of ourselves,"" Assa Traore, whose family is of Malian origin, told The Associated Press this week. ""There's a movement today. We call it the Adama generation, these people who are not afraid anymore, and these youth who will not shut up.""

The 35-year-old, who gave up her job as a special education teacher in a small Paris suburb to lead a movement demanding justice for her brother, has renewed purpose since George Floyd died after being restrained by Minneapolis police.

""George Floyd is our brother here in France, too,"" Traore said in an interview ahead of a demonstration Saturday marking the anniversary of Adama's death -- her speech determined, her energy palpable. ""When you see George Floyd's death, you imagine the death of my brother Adama Traore.""

It is not the first time that France has reckoned with its colonial history and relationship with its Black and North African citizens. Deaths involving police often lead to protests, most memorably in the form of nationwide unrest in 2005 sparked by the deaths of two boys who were electrocuted while hiding in an electric substation after fleeing police.

But now France is seeing a growing pushback against police violence, and against racism that many activists say is exacerbated by the country's official doctrine of colorblindness, which encourages immigrants to integrate and bans the government from collecting census data on race.

While four officers involved in Floyd's arrest have been charged -- including one with murder who is behind bars -- no one has been charged in Adama Traore's death. It wasn't filmed, and the cause of death is still the subject of fierce debate.

On July 19, 2016, police approached Adama and his brother for an identity check in the town of Beaumont-sur-Oise north of Paris, where the large family grew up. Adama ran away because he didn't have his ID. Gendarmes caught up with him and arrested him. Within hours he was declared dead.

One gendarme initially said three officers jumped on Traore to pin him down, according to early police reports. The gendarme later denied any of them pinned him down.

The exact cause of death is not even clear. A dozen court-ordered medical reports found various cardiac diseases were responsible. The Traore family countered those with an independent autopsy and medical reports pointing to asphyxiation instead. Lawyers for the officers deny police were at fault.

The family's lawyer Yassine Bouzrou said Friday that since early June, investigators have made 17 new requests for information, including a new medical examination by independent doctors in Belgium. Speaking to broadcaster France-Info, Bouzrou called that a sign that the investigation is being taken more seriously than before Floyd's death thrust it back into the spotlight.

In her quest for justice for her brother, Assa Traore has met with families of those who died at the hands of police, toured struggling French suburbs where most of the population is immigrant or non-white, and organized activists across racial, geographical and economic lines.

In June, as France was reopening from virus lockdown and videos of Floyd's killing circulated around the world, she rallied tens of thousands of protesters to call attention to French racial minorities' own problems with police.

""We have to change everything, this systemic racism, we need to break it,"" Traore said. She called for banning dangerous techniques that police use to immobilize people that ""overwhelmingly kill Black, Arabs and non-whites.""

She also thinks France needs to scrap the police oversight agencies, which are currently composed of police themselves, in favour of independent bodies.

In 2016, France's top official for defending citizens' rights, Jacques Toubon, reported that Black and Arab French people were 20 times more likely to be stopped by police than others were. In 2020, Toubon published a study detailing systemic racism in the Paris police. The government has pledged to root out racism in police forces but blames the problem on a few bad apples.

Traore has built bridges with other social movements -- like the yellow vest one against economic injustice and the climate crisis movement.

""It's been four years of going to every poor neighbourhood in France,"" Traore said. ""We've been in the most remote places in France, in small villages, it's been four years of alliances with domestic workers, undocumented people, yellow vests, climate groups.""

This Saturday's march was organized with climate activists under the slogan: ""We want to breathe.""

""Today the fight for Adama Traore does not belong to the Traore family anymore,"" Traore said. ""It's representative of a big unease and dysfunction of the French state, so it's a struggle we take on together.""",One quest for justice helps fuel Black rights fight in France,2,0.2237140727487692
248,"NORFOLK COUNTY — Provincial police are investigating after two youth were taken to hospital after taking drugs from someone they didn’t know. On July 9, pair of youths from Guelph and Kitchener — both 14 years old females — were at Turkey Point Beach, when they met a group of people they didn’t know from Brantford. They were invited back to a vehicle where they consumed drugs, Norfolk County OPP said. The teenagers returned to the beach but started feeling sick. A concerned passerby called 911 when they saw the pair vomiting and falling asleep. They were taken to hospital for treatment and have since been released. Media relations officer Const. Ed Sanchuk said it’s not known what substance these youth were given or who led them over to the vehicle. Police are asking anyone with information to contact the OPP at 1-888-310-1122, or Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-8477. This situation is a good reminder for parents and caregivers to speak to their children about the dangers of consuming drugs and taking things from strangers, Sanchuk said.  “It comes down to the fact that you don’t know what you’re getting,” he said. Even marijuana can be laced with fentanyl or some other illicit substance. “If it wasn’t for the good Samaritan noticing, it could have been a different story,” he said.","Teens from Guelph, Kitchener take drugs from stranger and end up in hospital",8,0.08174326235239371

“New Glasgow Regional Police would like to thank most residents who are adhering to the directives set forth under the Health Protection and Emergency Management Acts,” said police in a news release.

“But the small percentage of individuals who do not follow the directives are putting health and safety at risk.”

250,"VANCOUVER—Everytime Melissa Steinhauer sees a police officer, she worries they might start asking questions.

In her neighbourhood, the Downtown Eastside, drug use is prevalent and so is conflict between users and police.

Steinhauer, who uses heroin and cocaine, said she’s thought about being arrested for possession “many times, but it hasn’t happened, which I’m thankful for.”

The fear she describes is what experts say has proven deadly time and time again, pushing drug users further underground and away from harm-reduction services.

Years deep in an opioid crisis that’s raged across the country and even become deadlier, in some quarters, during the pandemic, Canada’s police chiefs say it’s time to try a different approach.

They’re publicly calling for the decriminalization of the personal possession of illicit drugs and for all police agencies in the country to recognize substance abuse and addiction as a public health issue, rather than a criminal one.

In a new statement, the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police proposed diverting people dealing with substance abuse or addiction issues away from the criminal system and toward social services and health care. The association stipulated such change would need to be synchronized nationally.

“Canada continues to grapple with the fentanyl crisis and a poisoned drug supply that has devastated our communities and taken thousands of lives,” said Chief Const. Adam Palmer, president of the CACP in the release.

“We recommend that enforcement for possession give way to an integrated health-focused approach that requires partnerships between police, health care and all levels of government.”

The report also endorsed access to users of a safe supply of pharmaceutical-grade opioids to combat the uncertain composition of illegal street drugs, which is the cause of many opioid overdoses. It further made a recommendation in favour of supervised consumption sites — where people could use drugs in a clean, safe environment, under the supervision of health professionals trained in emergency intervention.

Under the CACP recommendations, police would continue to target drug traffickers, producers and importers.

Steinhauer, who is a secretary at the Western Aboriginal Harm Reduction Society, said decriminalizing personal possession of illicit drugs would be a step in the right direction. Police though, she said, need to recognize the damage they do when officers seize drugs from dealers as well.

When her regular dealer loses his dope to officers, Steinhauer is sometimes left scrambling and forced to buy drugs from someone she doesn’t know. Sometimes that means the drugs are contaminated.

“Then I don’t know what’s in it,” she said. “Sometimes when you’re really sick, you don’t think ‘Oh, I’m going to get it tested.’ You just want to feel better. You want to get your medicine and feel better.”

There have been 15,393 apparent opioid-related deaths in Canada between January 2016 and December 2019, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada.

In May, more than five people in B.C. died every day from illicit drug overdose, the highest number yet recorded in the province, according to the BC Coroners Service.

The recommendations from the CACP were spawned by a Special Purpose Committee report titled: Decriminalization for Simple Possession of Illicit Drugs: Exploring Impacts on Public Safety & Policing.

Waterloo police Chief Brian Larkin, who co-chairs the CACP’s Special Purpose Committee, said the opioid crisis — which began on the West Coast around 2014 and swept across the country over the next two years — made it clear that some changes were due.

“When you look at policing, we’re responsible for advancing public safety in Canada,” said Larkin. “And we have a consensus amongst police leaders, including federally, that it’s time to have a dialogue. What’s been happening in the past clearly is not working for us.”

He said in preparing the report, they examined the approaches of countries such as Portugal, Sweden and Norway, where drug possession is still illegal, but criminal sanction, it’s been decided, is not the solution.

Drug policy advocates applauded the Canadian police chiefs’ call for decriminalization, but some were wary of the programs that might replace current practices.

“The way that CAPC has framed it, suggests they may be in favour of implementing some kind of administrative regime. So if somebody is found to be in possession, they won’t get criminal charges, but they may get a fine, or they may be forced into treatment,” said Caitlin Shane, a staff lawyer at Pivot Legal Society.

“When people fear arrest, or detention, or any kind of penalty, they’re going to be forced into more precarious scenarios, when using drugs.”

The organization has been calling on authorities to recognize the “harms of criminalization” for decades, said Shane.

“What we want to see is a situation where no one is penalized, whether criminally or administratively, for possessing small amounts of drugs for personal use.”

In the CACP report, the committee outlines the toll of the opioid crisis and why it believes decriminalization of possession alone won’t work.

“While decriminalization can reduce some harms for people who use drugs, they are still dependent on an illegal market where the contents and strength of drugs are unknown. The unregulated drug supply in Canada has become toxic leading to overdoses and death.”

The recommendations put forth by CACP would require some changes to the Controlled and Substances Act, said Larkin. That puts the onus going forward on the federal government.

“At the end of the day, we can suggest, we can recommend, but it’s up to the federal government to introduce legislation,” he said. “But we think that we will have a voice — this isn’t some utopian pie-in-the-sky thing that we’re floating out there. We feel very confident in our discussions with government.”

The CACP made it clear that its recommendations for dealing with the opioid crisis were independent of the ongoing conversation on scaling back police funding in the wake of the death of George Floyd at the hands of police in Minnesota on May 25.

“A decriminalization or diversion model will not provide any opportunity for police agencies to reduce their operating budgets or staffing,” said the report, which was dated July 2020.

“Some have suggested that decriminalization would free up police officer time and budgets could be reallocated to other priorities; however, police agencies must continue to resource drug enforcement units dedicated to disrupting the illicit drug markets.”

251,"SURREY, B.C.—Deaths and injuries involving police during so-called wellness checks coupled with recent protests against police brutality are generating scrutiny over how officers respond to people struggling with mental health challenges.

Police departments in Halifax, Toronto, Hamilton, Calgary, Edmonton, Vancouver and Kelowna are among those that have partnered with local health-care providers to create mobile response units that pair officers with mental health professionals.

They tout these specially trained units as a more effective way of handling calls related to mental health, while advocates say chronic underfunding of mental health services has thrust police into a role for which they’re ill-equipped.

“There aren’t good supports for mental health to begin with, so people end up in distress and their only resort is to call the police it seems, or to call 911,” said Margaret Eaton, CEO of the Canadian Mental Health Association.

Officers have a high degree of discretion when it comes to using force and their presence during wellness checks is rooted in stigma and fear that people with mental illnesses are dangerous, Eaton said in an interview on Thursday.

Meenakshi Mannoe, a campaigner with Pivot Legal Society, said police intervention in mental health crises too often leads to people being funnelled into the criminal justice system.

The Vancouver-based organization works with communities affected by poverty and social exclusion, with a focus on police accountability, drug policy, homelessness and sex workers’ rights.

“We see it in the statistics of who’s incarcerated, whether it is Indigenous people who have survived intergenerational trauma, or people with mental health issues who were acting in ways that were criminalized,” said Mannoe, who is also a registered social worker.

“Yet we continue to invest in the most crisis-oriented, escalating approach, which is law enforcement, when we could be investing in foundational institutions that actually prevent crisis.”

In Surrey, B.C., RCMP officers say they’re doing things differently. The detachment has been working with nurses specializing in mental health for 20 years through its Car 67 program, born from a partnership with the Fraser Health Authority.

The car operates from 1 p.m. to 1 a.m., when police say the volume of calls related to mental health tends to be higher.

Surrey RCMP officers attended more than 7,600 calls related to the Mental Health Act last year, and Car 67 handled just under 900 of them.

Car 67 may be dispatched directly or called in by other front-line officers, explained Tina Baker, a nurse who’s worked with the mobile unit for the last decade.

Either way, police assess the situation first to make sure it’s safe for Baker or another nurse to attend.

When she is called, Baker checks the person’s health records, which police cannot do. That provides a baseline understanding of what the person may be grappling with and what treatment they’ve already had, she said.

Whether a person is getting help can influence if they are taken into custody under the Mental Health Act, said Baker.

If they have support in the community, “we can liaise with them as opposed to going to the hospital,” she added.

Apprehending under the act can be traumatizing and confusing, said Baker, especially since it involves handcuffs. When she’s on duty with Car 67, Baker said she works with the officer she’s paired with to de-escalate the situation.

“A lot of people can be quite calm and then the minute you change their environment, whether it be into the police car or into the hospital setting, then they can become agitated. So, we have a role to keep everybody safe until we know that client is going to be OK.”

Cpl. Scotty Schumann, who leads the Surrey detachment’s mental health outreach team, said police are probably taking people to the hospital more often than necessary when a nurse isn’t present.

The outreach team receives specialized training from the Fraser Health Authority, which team member Const. Maciej Roszkowski said builds compassion and offers insight into the root causes of people’s behaviour.

“I always picture what if this was my family member in distress,” he added.

Roszkowski is among a group of officers specially selected based on their interest in working with vulnerable people, said Insp. Wendy Mehat, who oversees the outreach team.

“Our policing strategy is not based on arresting and handcuffing our way out of situations. It’s developing bonds, negotiating with our clients and getting them the support and referrals and help that they need,” she said.

At Pivot Legal Society, Mannoe said specialized police training is not a substitute for preventative measures and crisis services that are led by people who have experienced mental health challenges, or in other cases homelessness or substance use.

People and communities who tend to be criminalized don’t associate the police with safety, she noted, and external accountability can be limited when it comes to police officers’ own conduct while responding to mental health crises.

“The police attendance at these wellness checks can, in fact, escalate situations and put people at real risk. For people who are using substances or experiencing homelessness or who are racialized, that risk is compounded by systemic racism and bias.”

Mannoe points to a program in Oregon called Cahoots, which stands for crisis assistance helping out on the streets, as a good example of a community-based program that works. It’s dispatched through the local emergency communications centre but doesn’t necessarily involve police.

Wellness stems from dignified access to health care and basic needs, “not a uniformed officer banging on your door,” she said.

254,"The APD is seeking 30-year-old Matthew Roy in relation to a stabbing incident. (Submitted)

The Abbotsford Police Department is looking for 30-year-old Matthew Roy after a suspected stabbing incident that occurred on July 13.

APD patrol officers were called to the 1600-block of Riverside Road in response to a stabbing and arrived on scene to discover a 34-year-old man suffering from stab wounds to his upper body. That man was then transported to the hospital with serious but non-life threatening injuries.

Police were told that a verbal altercation had occurred between two men, one then produced a large knife and stabbed the other. The suspect then fled on foot before the police arrived.

Abbotsford Police General Investigation Section investigators have identified the suspect as Roy. He is now wanted on a warrant of arrest for this incident, and now faces new charges of aggravated Assault and breach of court conditions (two charges).

Roy is described as standing five foot nine and weighing 161 pounds. He has short dark hair and a brown goatee.

Anyone with information on Roy and his whereabouts is asked to contact the APD at 9-1-1 or 604-859-5225. The public is advised to not approach Roy if he is spotted in public.

257,"BC Rugby has green lit the sports return across the province, but full contact is not yet permitted, nor is the touch version of the sport. (Don Wright photo)

Rugby officially received the green light to return to the pitch earlier this month, but real games – or something resembling them – are still a long way off.

That’s the message Bayside Rugby Club president Kevin Whitmarsh took from BC Rugby’s return-to-play policy, which was released July 7 and lists a number of new rules and regulations for rugby clubs to follow as they re-engage after a months-long COVID-19-related shutdown.

Any form of tackle rugby is currently still not allowed, and even touch rugby is still forbidden, Whitmarsh said, adding that he wasn’t surprised by much in the return-to-play plan.

“Essentially, we definitely won’t be playing any sort of contact rugby until next year, and that’s what we were expecting to hear.”

Surrey Beavers’ player Paul Kelly echoed Whitmarsh’s feelings in an interview with Black Press Media earlier this month.

“It’s nice to see a plan,” he said. “But it won’t look like the sport we know until probably the fall of 2021.”

In the meantime, Whitmarsh said they’ll “make lemonade out of these lemons” and are forming a plan that would see Bayside players – at both the youth and senior levels – return to action in new formats.

One of the new regulations is a ban on activities between different clubs, which rules out games even if touch rugby was allowed. However, Whitmarsh said the junior/youth levels will focus on skill development and practice when programs return later this summer, while plans for senior teams are still being considered, but “we’re getting creative.”

Return to Rugby information for players, coaches and referees is online now. Prepare to Re-Engage. https://t.co/8CJuTURCdC pic.twitter.com/9G7SSJIg7H — BC Rugby (@bcrugbyunion) July 13, 2020

One likely option for Bayside’s adult players, Whitmarsh said, would be an in-house touch rugby league, with player drafts, weekly standings and “anything else we can do to make it feel like a real product even though you’re not playing other teams.”

BC Rugby’s plan includes five phases, and Whitmarsh is hopeful touch rugby could be allowed possibly by late August, with something near contact – perhaps tackling, but without scrums – allowed to go ahead in 2021, though he admits that is “an optimistic guess” at this point.

According to the plan, full-contact rugby would only return in Phase 5 – when a vaccine or treatment for COVID-19 is available.

“Rugby is coming back but it’s up to all of us to make sure it’s brought back in a safe and responsible manner,” Annabel Kehoe, B.C. Rugby CEO, said in a news release.

“While we won’t be returning to full-contact rugby for the foreseeable future, we’re excited to support clubs delivering modified training before progressing to non-contact rugby.”

Kelly suggested that “it’s gonna be a challenge to keep players interested” without traditional games, and while Whitmarsh agreed that some players may continue to sit out – and some longtime senior players may retire altogether – he’s also optimistic that a casual fall program will bring new players out of the woodwork.

He always expects that some players will be itching to come back, and will return with vigor and renewed excitement.

“Our guess is it’ll be kind of a wash,” he said. “You can see that (enthusiasm) on our internal Facebook pages – people are itching to get back. So we think a lot of people will come back revitalized. But at the same time, there will be some people who were maybe just hanging on at the end (before the pandemic) and this may have been the last straw for them to say ‘OK, time to hang ‘em up,’” he said.

“Sometimes if you have a forced break, you fill your time with other activities and maybe you realize you like those other activities. So we’re prepared for that, but we’d love to supplement some of that lose with this trial period here in the fall that will hopefully bring out new bodies.

“Because you can’t run a successful rugby club with the same 15 people every year.”

With competitive action – touch or tackle – pushed to 2021 at the earlier, Whitmarsh also noted that it could be a good opportunity for local clubs, and the BC Rugby Union league as a whole, to adjust its competitive senior schedule permanently, moving from a fall-to-spring setup to one that begins in the spring and wraps up in the summer.

Bayside’s senior men’s coach Andy Blackburn first floated the idea in an interview with PAN back in April, citing numerous benefits, including better weather.

Whitmarsh admitted it might be difficult to get every B.C. club on board.

“This new (reality) kind of aligns with what we’ve wanted for awhile now… but it seems split 50-50 – a lot of clubs say, ‘No way, there’s no way we’ll get field space in the summer.’ So I don’t know what will happen.”

Whitmarsh was also hopeful that football – which also recently received the go-ahead to return, with a bevy of new safety guidelines – could provide a road map for rugby, considering minor football will be returning, with full contact, when the season begins on Labour Day weekend.

“Maybe football will be a great example for us. Maybe that will be the test case that makes BC and Canada Rugby happy with a full-contact product come spring. Maybe they see that there was no (virus) transfer through football and we can (return to full contact).”

259,"EDMONTON -- Edmonton's CFL team has decided to change its name, TSN reports, with an announcement coming as soon as next week.

TSN Edmonton reporter Ryan Rishaug tweeted Thursday afternoon the Edmonton Eskimos made an internal decision to change the controversial team name.

Sources tell TSN an internal decision has been made, the Edmonton Eskimos will be changing their name. An announcement could come as early as next week. — Ryan Rishaug (@TSNRyanRishaug) July 16, 2020

The decision comes after major team sponsors including Belairdirect and Sports Interaction put pressure on Edmonton to change its name.

CTV News Edmonton reached out to the team which said it has no updates at this time.

SPONSORS PUSH BACK

Two of the team's 12 ""premier sponsors"" have publicly stated they want the team to change its name.

On July 7, CTV News was the first to reveal Belairdirect, a national home and auto insurer, had said it would end its relationship with the team if the name wasn't changed.

""At Belairdirect one of our core values is respect, which is founded on seeing diversity as a strength, being inclusive and collaborative,"" reads a statement from the company.

""In order for us to move forward and continue on with our partnership with the Edmonton Eskimos, we will need to see concrete action in the near future including a name change. We have shared our position with the team.""

Belairdirect is a longtime sponsor of the team's 50/50 draw at Commonwealth Stadium.

Earlier Thursday, Sports Interaction, an online sportsbook operated out of Quebec by the Mohawk Council of Kahnawake, told CTV News it also wanted a name change.

""Sports Interaction will be asking the Edmonton Eskimos to change its name so that we can continue supporting the club and its fans,” spokesman Ryan Stetson wrote in an email to CTV News.

Jiffy Lube told the Canadian Press it supports the further engagement.

""We look forward to hearing feedback from their ongoing discussions,” spokeswoman Kelly McClung said.

A spokesman for TFB & Associates, the Canadian brand owners of lozenge manufacturer Fisherman's Friend, said the issue is ""something we have been following closely.""

""We support Edmonton’s CFL team’s re-engagement in discussions with the Inuit communities and are looking forward to the timely and respectful progression of those conversations along with a positive outcome for all.""

Although it is listed as a premier sponsor, Boston Pizza said its relationship with the team came to an end due to a shift in corporate marketing strategy, and not necessarily due to the team's name.

""Our decision to end the sponsorship was made prior to recent events in society, and as part of a larger shift in our marketing strategy away from legacy sponsorships of professional sports teams,"" a company spokesperson told CTV News.

Remaining premier sponsors The Brick, Molson Coors, Discount Car and Truck Rental, James H. Brown and Associates, Save on Foods, Servus Credit Union, Telus and Tim Hortons all have not responded to multiple media requests filed by CTV News over more than week.

The team has said it is accelerating its review of its team name and will report back by the end of July.

In a statement, the team says ""we acknowledge and appreciate the feedback and input regarding our name"" and that it takes the naming issue seriously.""

""We will be seeking further input from the Inuit, our partners and other stakeholders to inform our decisions moving forward. We’ll continue to listen carefully and with an open mind.""",Edmonton CFL team decides to change its name: TSN,3,0.09168312261651779

262,"CAMBRIDGE — She’s scheduled to cross the border in late July and her first taste of competition is supposed to happen a couple of weeks later. Specifics are in short supply as Emily Penney looks ahead to her freshman campaign as a student-athlete at Oakland University in Auburn Hills, Mich. Penney accepted a scholarship last fall to compete for the Golden Grizzlies soccer team and is now waiting for word from head coach Juan Pablo Favero on whether the season will transpire. The uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic is unfamiliar territory for the 17-year-old Penney, a soon-to-be Galt Collegiate graduate who has played competitive soccer for more than a decade and is excited about taking the next step to an NCAA Division 1 program. “We might not even be able to move in on our original report date because we don’t know what’s happening with this thing,” said Penney, a personable honour-roll student. “I don’t know anything yet and the coach doesn’t know anything yet, but, when he does, I will be one of the first to know, especially with me being an international student.” Penney, a technically gifted midfielder, made an impression on Favero at a one-day showcase camp in December 2018 and a connection was made. The two discussed how scholarships worked during their initial meeting, stayed in touch through emails over the next few months, and Penney made a verbal agreement during a return trip to Oakland in March 2019. She signed a national letter of intent during a ceremony at her high school in November. “Emily is a strong and athletic midfield player who will add much-needed depth to our central midfield,” Favero said on Oakland’s athletic department website. “She is a ball winner and will be able to cover a lot of ground and will give us the flexibility of playing in different midfield shapes. We are superexcited to see her in our uniform.” The well-travelled Penney — she has played for rep teams in Kitchener, Cambridge, Burlington, Waterloo and, most recently, Hamilton — said she “fell in love” with the campus during her visits and was excited about the “intense, fast-paced and physical” style of play she witnessed in an exhibition game between her future team and the Michigan State University Spartans. Penney planned to play for Hamilton United’s League 1 reserve team before making her way to Oakland, but the global pandemic has changed everything. She last played an indoor game in March and has since been training on her own, juggling the ball, kicking it against a wall, dribbling through cones and setting aside plenty of time for running to stay as fit as possible. “We just got our fitness packets from the coach, so I started that for the month of June, but that’s really it,” said Penney. “It’s kind of weird. You have to push yourself a lot harder because there’s no one to compete against.” Penney has been a fierce competitor during her four years at Galt and was a key player on the basketball team that won a Waterloo County (WCSSAA) championship in October, the school’s first senior girls title in 40 years. Hopes of taking Galt’s soccer program to similar heights this spring were dashed by the pandemic, as were plans to attend an athletic banquet, graduation ceremony and senior prom. “It’s kind of sad how it ended,” she said. On the soccer pitch, Penney’s career highlight to this point took place in the summer of 2016 when the Waterloo U14 team she was playing for captured the Ontario Cup and finished third at the national championships in New Brunswick. Greater achievements, she hopes, are around the corner at Oakland. The Golden Grizzlies compete in the 10-team Horizon League and last year reached the conference semifinal. The young squad lost just three players to graduation and Penney was one of seven added during the fall signing period. Regardless of whether there’s a season or not, Penney will study health sciences in her first year of university.",Cambridge soccer standout prepares for the unknown,3,0.04002353689016469
263,"Nick Nurse knows how he would like to use the eight games the Raptors will play leading up to the NBA playoffs, and it sounds like a well-scripted exhibition season. The Raptors head coach plans to use the first two or three to get his entire roster familiar with the speed of NBA games again, with lots of players getting time on the court; the middle three or so would be to fine-tune the rotation and extend the minutes for the players Nurse will rely on in the post-season; and the last couple would be to taper a bit, calm down, try to avoid injury and get some rest for the workhorses. It makes sense, but in this nonsensical resumption to a season delayed four months, when everything is new and no one knows how it will all unfold, it may not be possible to pull off. “That would be my initial game plan, but obviously the ball goes up and everything changes, usually,” Nurse said on a conference call.  Figuring out how to use the “seeding games,” as the NBA is calling the final segment of the aborted regular season, will be a struggle for each of the 22 teams gathered near Orlando, Fla.  For 12 of those teams, the playoffs are already a guarantee and the only things to play for are seeding — starting with a doubleheader on July 30 — and game rhythm. How much seeding really matters is debatable since no team will have anything close to a “home-court advantage” on any of the three floors the NBA will use at the Disney/ESPN campus. The Raptors have a difficult schedule for the eight games left in the season. They will open against the Lakers on Aug. 1 and also face the Milwaukee Bucks, Boston Celtics and Philadelphia 76ers, all tremendous opponents. It should give them a good indication of where they stand. “I like the schedule,” Nurse said. “I like to see the Lakers again and Milwaukee again, just to get a feel for them again. I think we’re playing really quality teams. I think every team we’ve got is a playoff team. Obviously those are quality teams. “I like it.” The players would like Nurse’s approach to ease into the final eight games with little or no pressure. None of them have played meaningful five-on-five basketball since the middle of March. “You can’t try to adjust this, that and the other. You have to have that same approach each and every game and figure it out as you go,” Raptor Norm Powell said. “It’s going to be a different feel with no fans and all of that, but the main focus is getting ourselves back to the level where we want to be and be able to compete and fight for a championship.” The Raptors are counting on their experience to get them through the most unusual circumstances, because every key member of the rotation went through 10 weeks of intense competition in the championship run of 2019.  “(The players) came here in great shape and, as soon as we got here, everyone was starting to put in work,” Serge Ibaka said. “I’ve been in the league for 11 years. You can see when people (are) locked in and they are ready mentally and when they are not. “So I can tell you right now, mentally, everybody is ready.” The Raptors, who opened camp in Orlando on Saturday after training in the Naples/Fort Myers area, were limited to small group workouts before joining the NBA bubble. It was frustrating not to have five-on-five time, but it’s not like it was going to change what the Raptors are or what they do before the games begin. It’s the same for their eight opponents: all good teams, legitimate championship contenders, staying true to themselves. “The teams that we’re going to face are probably going to be consistent toward who they were during the season,” assistant coach Adrian Griffin said. “When we play Milwaukee, you’ve got to prepare for Giannis (Antetokounmpo). He’s going to be Giannis. When we play the Lakers, LeBron (James) is going to be LeBron, Anthony Davis is going to be Anthony Davis. “We know these guys. They know us. We’ll prepare the best way we possibly can and let the chips fall where they may.”","The Raptors still have eight games before the NBA playoffs, but ‘everybody is ready’",3,0.2396333648675093

The awards were originally scheduled to be handed out March 31 during a Waterloo County Secondary School Athletic Association all-star game doubleheader that was cancelled because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Townes, a Grade 11 centre, led the Ghosts to an undefeated season in the WCSSAA senior girls basketball league that ended with a 41-27 win over the Bluevale Knights in the championship game. It was Galt’s first championship since 1979.  The Devenny most valuable player award is named after the former star player at Waterloo Collegiate and the University of Waterloo who died from cancer in 2012 at the age of 30. Townes is joined on the league’s first-team all-star unit by Galt teammate Maddy Brown, Adri Kellerman of WCI, Malak Dahawy of Sir John A. Macdonald, Rachel Deans of Bluevale and Yang Oyual of Glenview Park. The second team is comprised of Jillian Bernard-Jardine of KCI, Jordan Hamm of Bluevale, Kennedy Robinson of Galt, Maddy Sousa of Waterloo-Oxford and Rhiannon Braid of WCI. Ujullu Obang is the first repeat winner of the Moser award as the top player in the WCSSAA senior boys basketball league. The fifth-year point guard was a dominant force throughout his team’s undefeated campaign that ended with a 65-48 win over the Sir John A. Macdonald Highlanders in the championship game.

267,"Hockey players, bless ’em, are creatures of routine. But this Maple Leafs training camp — in July, with its nasal swabs and masks and social distancing — is anything but routine. They won’t go out at night. They won’t carpool. The only time they’re allowed to get close to each other are those bodychecks in the corner. The Leafs are doing their best to make it all sound so normal, a camp to prepare for an expanded summer-fall Stanley Cup tournament in which teams will share hotels while locking themselves away from their families and friends. “For the most part, we’re trying to keep it as normal as possible, the routines. You have to get out of your comfort zone a little bit. Might as well get used to it,” said centre Auston Matthews. “We’re wearing masks and social distancing, but around the rink we’re kind of doing the same thing (as usual),” said winger William Nylander. “It’s almost like normal to come in and get tested,” added winger Zach Hyman. “It’s the new normal. It’s a part of the process. It’s going to be part of the Stanley Cup playoffs. You can’t avoid it.” So the players have adapted to the realities of the COVID-19 pandemic as it affects their livelihood. For now, they are being tested every second day. It will ramp up to every day come July 26, when Toronto and Edmonton will host 12 teams each. All players were also tested and cleared before training camp. The dressing room, exercise facilities and bench are frequently sanitized. Winger Andreas Johnsson and defenceman Timothy Liljegren — listed as unfit to play — were seen wearing masks as they exited the locker room to watch teammates practise. Coaches and officials involved in the scrimmage did not wear them. All players must wear a mask whenever they aren’t working out or skating. “I’ve been wearing a mask as much as I can, and you almost want to desensitize yourself to it,” said veteran centre Jason Spezza. “The more you comply with it, the more you wear it, the more normal it feels and the less of a distraction it becomes, so that’s been the message. “You have to get on board quick, and then we’re able to play hockey.” Interactions with the media, and even team officials, are more or less off limits. Media access is limited to 22, each designated an X on the floor to stand — six feet apart — at the two rinks in use at the Ford Performance Centre. Media must also answer a health questionnaire and pass a temperature check before entering, and scrums are by teleconference. No one-on-ones. Players are discouraged from doing anything that would contribute to the spread of the virus. The league is asking them not to carpool, for example, and players are encouraging each other to avoid patios for dinner. And no one beyond their family (for the camp portion) and teammates should come into contact with them. They’re supposed to put their jerseys and anything else that needs laundering into a washing machine themselves, rather than a bin at the centre of the locker room. Hot tubs, saunas and steam rooms? Off limits. Showers? At home, not the rink, is preferred, and no shared towels or toiletries. Like the rest of us, they’re encouraged to wash their hands frequently, avoid handshakes, sneeze into a tissue or an elbow, and avoid anyone who might be sick. “Close contact” with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 — at a patio bar filled with strangers, for example — could sideline a player for 48 hours or more while waiting for test results. The league defines “close contact” as “15 minutes or longer at six feet or less.” The only exceptions to the distancing rule are for medical or therapeutic reasons and, of course, “scrimmages that involve body contact.” The Leafs are indeed scrimmaging. On Monday, coach Sheldon Keefe staged 20-minute mini-games with shortened benches, three lines aside. On Tuesday, Keefe played his power-play lines against his penalty-killing units for 30 minutes — complete with referees enforcing the rules, while players got back to changing in the fly and spacing on the ice. Eventually, Keefe will hold a full game scrimmage. When players are asked about the big differences at camp, they don’t talk about masks and social distancing. They focus on hockey answers. “It’s different in the sense that the urgency is there to hit the ground running,” said Spezza. “There’s no kind of dipping your toe in the water and then ramping up. We have a short camp, one exhibition game and then into the playoffs (starting Aug. 2 against Columbus).” So this new normal — designed to get the Leafs and the other 21 playoff-bound teams into game shape safely — is simply part of the furniture. “Strict adherence by all participants to preventative measures, diligent hygiene practices and enhanced testing will be key,” is how the NHL put it in guidelines sent to teams prior to training camp. “I don’t know if it’s normal, but it’s something we have to deal with,” said goalie Frederik Andersen. “To give ourselves a chance at winning, small precautions like that are going to be part of it, and something we’ll have to do as a team. “Putting a Q-tip up your nose every day is not so fun, but I think (we’re doing) the best thing we can and it’s our responsibility to keep each other safe.”","Laundry, showers and a Q-tip up the nose.

270,"For everything that has been denied golf fans in this period of quarantine —access to courses for many, the Masters for all, freedom from Peloton updates for an unlucky few — one thing remains soothingly constant among the social media commentariat: begrudgery.

That much was evident with the news that former PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem will join Tiger Woods and Marion Hollins in the next class to be inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame. The announcement was greeted with griping that was as predictable as it is tedious, an exercise in collective eye-rolling intended to suggest not only that Finchem is undeserving but that his inclusion dilutes the Hall’s credibility.

That argument is familiar and has been leveled against more deserving targets who got a call to the Hall, like George H.W. Bush, Bing Crosby or Bob Hope. But there’s no sound basis for raising it against Finchem.

There is a sentiment that says lockers in St. Augustine ought to be earned for exploits on the field of play, and the only field of play that matters is a golf course. Not a boardroom or a factory or a production trailer or a media center. It’s an absolutist position that would disqualify plenty of current Hall of Famers.

Like C.B. Macdonald or Pete Dye, who only designed those fields of play,

Like Karsten Solheim, who innovated the instruments used on those fields.

Like Dan Jenkins or Herb Graffis, whose only mastery was of a typewriter on the sidelines.

The reality is that most sports halls of fame are intended to acknowledge not just quantifiable achievement but immeasurable impact. Charlie Sifford wasn’t inducted for his two PGA Tour victories but for what his presence, courage and determination symbolized in golf’s ugliest era. Frank Chirkinian wasn’t given a locker to store his Emmy awards, but because the legendary CBS producer’s influence far exceeded that of most players he put on living room TVs.

It’s why the football and tennis Halls have “contributor” categories to enshrine non-players, and it’s why the golf Hall is welcoming Finchem, just as it did his predecessor Deane Beman, Augusta National’s Billy Payne and the European Tour’s Ken Schofield before him.

This is hardly to say Finchem is beyond criticism. He forged a colorless culture at Tour HQ and enforced a level of secrecy around disciplinary proceedings and drug testing that would have been envied in Pyongyang. But it can’t be argued that he didn’t leave the Tour in a considerably better place than he found it.

When he took over as commissioner in 1994, total prize money on Tour was $56.4 million. Toss in the Champions and then-Web.com Tours and the fund was just over $90 million. This season the Tour’s prize money is nearing $400 million, before bonuses at least until COVID-19 upended things. He created the oft-maligned World Golf Championship events, which if nothing else helped temper Greg Norman’s plans for world domination, and the FedEx Cup playoff system 13 years ago.

It’s a popular though specious suggestion that Finchem owes his success to coat-tailing on Tiger Woods. Sure, he was dealt a strong hand, but he played it well for what was demanded of him. If subsisting on crumbs from Tiger’s table was sufficient to earn a spot in the Hall, then Mark Steinberg would have his own wing.

Arguing over Hall of Fame inductees is a staple of most every sport, moreso during a quarantine when we’re happy for any meat to chew on, no matter how lacking in nutrition it is. And golf’s Hall has richly deserved much of the criticism it has received over the years. The last class inducted Peggy Kirk Bell. The famed teacher was eminently worthy, but she was deserving of the honor when she was alive. She lived for 95 years, but the Hall only saw fit to induct her three years after her death. That kind of standard can’t be encouraging to others who deserve a spot and have been thus far denied, like Tom Weiskopf or Butch Harmon.

There are obvious shortcomings surrounding golf’s Hall of Fame. There are those who deserve the honor who have been overlooked and those who’ve been given a spot they didn’t merit. But whatever his failings, Tim Finchem doesn’t belong on either list.","19th hole: World Golf Hall of Fame has its blind spots, but Tim Finchem isn’t one of them",3,0.1028341459863098

The Oilers Entertainment Group in Edmonton confirmed ""Rogers Place has suffered some water damage to the terminus of Ford Hall, along with some smaller leaks in other parts of the building.""

A video posted and later deleted from the Oilers subReddit showed water cascading through the ceiling and pooling on the floor of the 104 Avenue entrance.

""We are assessing the damage and at this time are confident that it will not hamper our planning and preparation and we will be ready to host the return of NHL hockey as hub city,"" spokesperson Tim Shipton wrote in a statement.

""We will share more information as it becomes available.""

The arena is owned by the City of Edmonton and has been open since 2016. It can accommodate crowds of 18,500 for hockey games, and 20,700 for concerts.

According to TSN Insider Darren Dreger, the NHL was not concerned about the Thursday storm.

The new commissioner of Pacific Junior Hockey League says he’s confident its teams could be playing games sooner than other local junior circuits.

White Rock-raised Trevor Alto took the reigns of the PJHL at the start of May, in the midst of a COVID-19 pandemic that put an end to sports competitions of all kinds, including the mid-March league final between North Vancouver and Aldergrove.

The 13-team league includes Surrey Knights and White Rock Whalers.

As rinks begin to reopen for skills sessions this summer, Alto said the fall months could feature PJHL league games – if and when a green light is given by health and hockey authorities in the province.

“With a long-term view, I’m very positive about us being able to operate a game in a safe manner,” Alto told the Now-Leader.

He said the PJHL is pretty well structured for a return to play.

“We don’t have to deal with things like the WHL does, of going across provincial boundaries and into the States to play,” Alto said. “Our players travel on their own, in their own vehicles, to games, so there’s no bus situation, and no hotel stays in our league either, so there’s no issue there, and no buffets, team meals, that other leagues will have to deal with, in order just to operate.

“We’re lucky enough to deal with just the arrival at the arena and how we go about conducting a game, and then how we exit the arena,” Alto added. “Possibly we’d also have to look at how fans can attend in a safe manner, so our focus is on each of the individual facilities. They’re coming back online with various speeds and various expectations. I think we have to be very flexible with how each team comes back.”

The Knights’ pre-season training camp is planned to start Aug. 24 at Langley Sportsplex, and the Whalers have word of “identification skates” posted to the club’s website, as a way of “building our future pod.”

In mid-May the PJHL announced the arrival of the Chilliwack Jets as the league’s latest expansion franchise. Majority owner Clayton Robinson will also serve as the club’s first head coach and general manager.

“We’re excited about that franchise joining the league,” Alto said. “The league was making some big moves and a time when other leagues weren’t, so that’s very much a positive for our league and what it has been able to accomplish in recent years under Ray Stonehouse’s leadership.”

Stonehouse, the outgoing league commissioner, will stay with the PJHL in a senior advisor role for the next two seasons. Earlier this year he was named an inductee to the BC Hockey Hall of Fame, Class of 2020, as a builder.

During Alto’s first couple of months on the job, his work has involved a good number of conference calls as opposed to in-person meetings.

“This has all been a shock to the system for everyone,” he said. “It’s been really good to see the hockey community come together at all levels. Being involved in junior hockey for awhile, we kind of live in our own bubble sometimes, but it’s been great to collaborate with some of the minor hockey associations. I’ve been on quite a few calls, including with Pacific Coast Amateur Hockey Association.

“As hockey administrators it’s our duty to get these kids back on the ice as soon as possible,” Alto added. “What that’s going to look like, we’re still working on that. There are lots of ideas. At the end of the day we’re all just following orders of the health authorities and Dr. Bonnie Henry, and also Hockey Canada. And the end of the day it’s a huge collaborative effort.”

The 2019-20 season was another difficult one for Surrey Knights, who finished with a single win in 44 games, well behind other teams in the PJHL standings.

Alto says he’s confident the team can rebound with the guidance of Gerry Leiper, head coach and general manager.

“He has done an excellent job,” Alto said. “Gerry’s passion for building that program is second to none, in my opinion, and it’s been a breath of fresh air in a time that’s been difficult. So I think the Knights have a coach and GM there who is doing a great job and I look forward to where he can take the team.”

276,"A prolific goal-scorer in college, Canadian forward Evelyne Viens has kicked off her pro career at the NWSL’s Challenge Cup in Utah. And after a stop-start pre-season due to the coronavirus pandemic, the 23-year-old from L’Ancienne-Lorette, Que., is savouring her time with New Jersey’s Sky Blue FC. “It was a special feeling, for sure,” Viens said of making her league debut off the bench against the OL Reign. “Being new in the league and just being able to play (soccer), I think it’s an amazing feeling. “But with everything (that happened), with the coronavirus, not knowing if we were even going to have a season, just being able to see soccer and play soccer with the best players in the world, it was a great feeling for me.” Sky Blue (1-1-1) faces the unbeaten North Carolina Courage on Monday at Zions Bank Stadium in Herriman. The Courage (3-0-0) have already advanced to the tournament quarterfinals as top seed. “Everyone knows how good they are,” Viens said of the Courage, who won the league title in 2018 and ‘19 and were runners-up in 2017. “But I think just being able to put a good game plan and just being able to do what we do best and play our style of soccer, we can go there and hopefully win the game.” The game could be a battle of Canadian goalkeepers, pitting North Carolina’s Stephanie Labbe against Sky Blue’s Kailen Sheridan. Sky Blue is coming off a 2-0 win Wednesday over the Houston Dash that saw Viens come off the bench in the 82nd minute. Viens entered in the 77th minute of Sky Blue’s tournament opener — a 0-0 tie June 30 with the OL Reign. She started the next game, playing the first half of Sky Blue’s 1-0 loss to the Utah Royals on July 4. Viens was taken fifth overall at the Jan. 16 NWSL draft in Baltimore. Defender-midfielder Rebecca Quinn is the only Canadian to go higher, selected third overall in 2018 by the Washington Spirit. Viens’ first crack at training camp lasted just five days because of the pandemic. She rode out the lockdown with other Sky Blue rookies before the teams returned to training. “When we came back to soccer, it was such a great feeling just being able to do our job and what we love,” she said. Viens turned heads at the University of South Florida, scoring 73 goals in 77 career games to set school and American Athletic Conference all-time records. Her 25 goals as a senior also set school and conference single-season marks. She showed time and time again that she can beat defenders and score from distance with a powerful shot. Her career 169 points and 360 shots were also school and conference records. She also set conference records for points per game (2.19), goals per game (0.95) and shots per game (4.68). Viens, a three-time all-American and 2019 Scholar all-American, was named AAC Offensive Player of the Week a conference-record six times in 2019. It’s all the more impressive given Viens’ English was limited when she started school in Florida. Former roommate Aubrey Megrath described Viens’ English as “zero.” “Every time we would talk like ‘Hey, how are you?’ every (answer) was, ‘Good.’ Anything you’d say to her, ‘Good,’” Megrath told the Tampa Bay Times. Hard work and help from the school changed that. She had not planned to go to a U.S. college but caught the eye of a USF assistant coach who saw her play while scouting a player on the opposing team. They invited her to come see the school. “One visit and I was like ‘I think the Florida’s the place for me.’ It was a great chance to develop as a person and as a soccer player. It really turned my life around.” Part of the reason Viens flew under the radar was she was not part of Quebec’s provincial team, because it would have meant leaving her family to go to Montreal. Viens was selected for Canada’s provisional roster for the CONCACAF Olympic qualifying tournament in January but did not make the final roster. She hopes she can play her way into a Canadian camp invitation. “I would like to represent my country but at the same time I just want one chance in camp, just to be able to learn from the best there and be able to compete with them. That would be a great opportunity.” North Carolina defeated Sky Blue 3-2 when they met in the 2019 regular-season finale.",Canadian forward Evelyne Viens savours NWSL debut at Challenge Cup,3,0.2534101360411267
277,"The Philadelphia Eagles announced Friday that they are penalizing DeSean Jackson for “conduct detrimental to the team,” following anti-Semitic posts the veteran wide receiver made on Instagram. Jackson accepted the consequences and apologized, the Eagles said. “In our many conversations with him, it has also been made clear that this is only the beginning. We have discussed a concrete plan for how he and we can heal moving forward. He understands that in order to remain on the team, he must also commit to supporting his words with actions,” the Eagles’ statement read in part. Because the Eagles are not announcing a suspension, it’s likely they have fined Jackson. Teams typically don’t announce the amount when they fine players. Jackson had initially posted a fake quote attributed to Adolf Hitler over the Fourth of July weekend. He reposted the fabricated quote on his Instagram story Monday attempting to clarify why he posted it. Following significant backlash to the posts, Jackson issued two apologies (one a video on Instagram, and one on Twitter), saying he would work to educate himself. Earlier Friday, Jackson virtually met with Edward Mosberg, a 94-year-old Holocaust survivor. “I’m taking this time to continue with educating myself and bridging the gap between different cultures, communities & religions,” Jackson wrote in his post about the meeting on Instagram. “I know he’s under the fire,” Eagles teammate Lane Johnson said of Jackson. “With everything that’s happened in the past months, I know his heart’s in a good place as far as helping the community and helping his people. Ultimately, whenever you make mistakes, you have to own up to it and I think the best thing about it now is get educated and try to make all the wrongs you did right. That’s all you can do.” “We appreciate (Jackson’s) desire to educate himself, but we all understand there is still a lot of work to be done,” the Eagles said in their statement. “We will continue to assist DeSean in this process, and we also know all of us in our organization need to listen and learn more about things that are unfamiliar or uncomfortable to us. “We must continue to fight against anti-Semitism and all forms of discrimination, while not losing sight of the important battle against systemic racism.”",Eagles penalize DeSean Jackson for ‘conduct detrimental to the team’ following anti-Semitic posts,3,0.47701009597226784
278,"It’s been an eventful off-season for Patrick Mahomes. The Super Bowl MVP recounted his life over the past few months — the post-season obligations, buying a new house, confronting a pandemic, supporting countrywide protests and signing a record-breaking contract worth up to $503 million (U.S.) — for a GQ story and photo shoot that published Tuesday. Mahomes revealed another important detail: rapper Post Malone now has the Kansas City Chiefs quarterback’s signature tattooed on his body. The 24-year-old told the magazine he and Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce went backstage at Malone’s show in Kansas City. A few (several) games of beer pong later, Malone bet the duo that if they won again he’d get tattoos of their names. Post Malone stuck with his word and Mahomes claims the inking took place right backstage. Here’s some more insight about Mahomes from the story: “I understand my platform,” Mahomes told GQ. “I understand that my part in the video is a big part of it.” He’d spent time with NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, who sought his perspective. Mahomes informed the commissioner of his desire to promote voter-registration efforts and that the league should have one person dedicated to helping players tap into their community activism endeavours. “So whenever you wanna help out the community, you have someone that works with the team that can help,” Mahomes told GQ. “It was a great conversation. It lasted, like, 30 minutes to an hour.” “I’ve seen how people, on Twitter, have tweeted and said, ‘Oh, you’re not full Black,’” he told GQ. “But I’ve always just had the confidence and believed in who I am. And I’ve known that I’m Black. And I’m proud to be Black. And I’m proud to have a white mom too. I’m just proud of who I am. And I’ve always had that confidence in myself.” As the son of a former Major League Baseball player, Mahomes also is aware of his privileged upbringing. “The more I mature,” Mahomes told GQ, “I’ve learned that I was blessed to be in the situation that I was in.” “I’m nowhere near where I can be,” he told GQ.",Why does Post Malone have a Patrick Mahomes tattoo?

281,"Logan Warkentin, a longtime former Delta Sungod Swim Club athlete, is a fixture on the deck these days as a coach of the club’s Dragons Learn to Compete group. Facebook

If you’re thinking of enrolling your child or teen in a sports group, the first benefit that may come to mind is the physical activity they’ll enjoy.

But Kurt Murphy, director of swimming with the Delta Sungod Swim Club in North Delta, believes a sports organization can and should do even more for a young person.

“The goal of our swim club is to create good citizens through the sport of swimming, by giving them a skill set and a methodology to succeed,” he says. “It’s embodied every day in practice and there’s an accountability factor they may not have in other areas of life.”

Coaches help athletes succeed

From Murphy through the rest of Sungod’s coaching ranks, contributing to the growth of young athletes – in age-appropriate ways – is a common theme, whether it’s teaching more effective stroke technique or helping ensure they get to practices on time. “When you enrol your children in sport, especially where there’s a level of competition, it teaches them real-world skills in real-world situations,” he says.

Valuable training for post-secondary and beyond

For swimmers preparing to attend university or college, lessons learned at Sungod Recreation Centre come in handy now and later on, Murphy says, pointing to lifelong time management skills learned from balancing swimming commitments with exams or homework.

Learning coping skills through sport or practising the discipline to achieve goals are life skills that often stay with young student-athletes, he adds. “I’m not sure if it’s cause and effect, but it’s definitely correlated that kids who strive at a high level in sport strive to reach a high level in other things in life.”

Looking for an activity for your pre-teen?

Delta Sungod Swim Club has plenty of room for swimmers in the 10-under category, and with registrations ongoing throughout the season, now is a good time to consider enrolling your child into a swim program in North Delta. If they’re more interested in individual activities and like the idea of learning competitive swimming, the club’s Dragons – Learn to Compete program, with its flexible commitment level, can be an ideal place to start.

To learn more, visit the club online, or drop by the pool between 4 and 8 p.m. on Monday, Wednesday or Friday to chat with a club representative. You can also stay up-to-date on their Facebook page.

283,"Thursday night’s 401 Derby — Disney Edition — was wildly entertaining, with goals aplenty, coach Greg Vanney’s colourful vocal contributions on the TSN broadcast, a hat trick by the Reds’ 20-year-old scoring sensation Ayo Akinola and another outstanding performance by TFC midfielder Alejandro Pozuelo.

TFC out-gunned its Canadian rival Montreal Impact 4-3 in a wild MLS Is Back match at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex in the Walt Disney World Resort near Orlando. Brampton native Akinola now has five goals in two games at the tournament. Toronto native

Richie Laryea also scored for the Reds. Pozuelo picked up three assists in the match and has five total at the tournament.

“Pretty happy to get a hat track,” said Akinola. “But this game is in the past and I’m already thinking about the next one.”

Akinola’s hat trick was the first one recorded in the 401 Derby in MLS play.

The Impact’s Saphir Taïder scored on a penalty kick in added time to make it a one-goal game after Toronto defender Laurent Ciman was nailed with a hand ball. The Impact continued to press hard in the final few minutes, but couldn’t come up with the equalizer.

Akinola has displayed such a tremendous scoring touch and pace in Orlando that even when veteran forward Jozy Altidore is ready to play, Vanney is going to have a tough time taking the youngster out of the starting XI, though the coach said later that he can foresee getting both in at the same time.

There are no fans allowed at any of these games and, because of that, you can hear the comments and shouting by the players and coaches in the broadcast, with Vanney’s insightful contributions being particularly entertaining. Even with the match played at a neutral site without fans in the stands, TFC captain Michael Bradley said the importance of the game was still felt by the players.

“We wanted to step on the field and play in a way that (our fans) could be proud of,” said Bradley. “It’s a special night. It’s a big three points, it’s a bizarre night as well, given the circumstances, the lack of crowd, the score line, but it’s Toronto-Montreal, and that speaks for itself.”

The goals in the first half came fast and furious, starting with Canadian international Laryea who put TFC on the board in the eighth minute with a brilliant rush down the left side before stopping in his tracks, cutting back on Montreal defender Shamit Shome and then right-footing a blast past Montreal goalkeeper Clément Diop. Laryea was playing at the left back position, across the field from his normal spot.

The Impact tied it six minutes later when Romell Quioto got behind Toronto centre back Omar Gonzalez, whose speed is not exactly his strength, after a brilliant pass from Emanuel Maciel downfield and steered a shot past TFC keeper Quentin Westberg on the breakaway.

TFC jumped ahead in the 25th minute with a beautiful tic-tac-toe passing play originating from the club’s new DP, Pablo Piatti, to Pozuelo on the right side. The Spanish midfielder then fed a perfect pass to Akinola in the box for the easy left-footed tap-in.

Taider tied it again for Montreal on a penalty kick with a shot to the left side of the goal as Westberg guessed the wrong way. The penalty shot was the result of TFC defender Chris Mavinga taking Quioto out in the box.

That goal seemed to cause the Impact to suffer a collective brain cramp. Seconds after Taider’s goal, Pozuelo found Akinola down the pitch with a long pass and the young U.S. international finished off a good run with a strike to the far side of the goal.

The heat seemed to sap some of the energy from the teams in the second half, though Rod Fanni had a good header off a free kick early for the Impact as the Reds held back. Piatti created a chance in the second half with a clever left-footer after a good run that forced Diop to make a leaping save. Westberg made a solid save in the 75th minute on a Anthony Jackson-Hamel header.

Akinola’s third goal came in the 83rd minute after Westberg kicked the ball downfield to Nick DeLeon, who headed it to Akinola. The Brampton native, who plays for the U.S. youth squad, knocked over a Montreal defender and chipped a shot over Diop.

Toronto blew a 2-0 lead in the club’s tournament opener on Monday morning after Akinola, playing in place of Altidore, scored two first-half goals. But D.C. United scored in the 84th minute and added the equalizer seven minutes later in added time. even though D.C. United was down to 10 men.

The disrespect 😩…. too strong and a classy finish. 🔥🔥🔥 https://t.co/o19PudqcYH — Jozy Altidore (@JozyAltidore) July 17, 2020

Veteran defender Justin Morrow, who has Achilles tendinitis issues, did not play on Thursday. TFC midfielder Jonathan Osorio missed his second consecutive MLS is Back match with quad strain, though Vanney is hoping to have him back for the third match of the group stage, next Tuesday night against the New England Revolution. Altidore, who joined his teammates late in training at the BMO Training Ground last month, did not dress as Vanney wants to wind him up into match shape.

The Impact opened the tournament with an uninspiring 1-0 defeat to the New England Revolution and are without a point in two MLS is Back matches and face elimination.

TFC remains undefeated in 2020, opening the regular season with a 2-2 draw in San Jose on Feb.29 in the season opener – another match where the Reds led 2-0 before giving up two late goals for the draw – followed by a 1-0 victory over New York City FC at BMO Field on March 7 and then, following the suspension of play because of the COVID-19 pandemic, Monday’s 2-2 draw with D.C.

285,"It was five months ago when GM Marc Bergevin asked Ilya Kovalchuk where he wanted to spend the playoffs.

At the time, staying in Montreal wasn’t an option. The Canadiens were six points back of the final wild-card spot on Feb. 23. But they had already traded Marco Scandella to St. Louis and were in the process of moving Nate Thompson to Philadelphia and Nick Cousins to Vegas.

So the 37-year-old Kovalchuk, who had never won a Stanley Cup, decided to join Alex Ovechkin in Washington.

Five months later, with the Habs included in a 24-team expanded playoff, it’s pretty clear that Montreal, which received a third-round pick in the Kovalchuk trade, regrets the decision to part ways with the Russian sniper.

“Unfortunately, we didn’t have a crystal ball,” head coach Claude Julien told reporters earlier this month.

As for Kovalchuk, he isn’t looking back. But he is looking forward to a possible reunion of sorts.

“You know, it’s all history already,” he said on a conference call on Wednesday. “I’m glad that I’m in Washington and hopefully we’ll see them in the conference final.”

That might sound ambitious.

While the Capitals won a Cup two years ago and were the top-ranked team in the Metropolitan Division when the season was cut short, the Canadiens were ranked 12th in the Eastern Conference.

Then again, with Carey Price in net and an up-and-coming roster that seemingly has nothing to lose in a qualifying round match-up against the Pittsburgh Penguins, there’s a reason why Montreal has become everyone’s dark horse team.

“It’s a crazy time,” Kovalchuk said. “Nobody can predict anything like that. That’s why we play in the regular season — to play in the post-season. I think it’s a great opportunity for all 24 teams.”

Kovalchuk only spent two months with the Canadiens, but he made the most of his limited impact by scoring six goals and 13 points in 22 games. Fans who grew up watching Alex Kovalev instantly gravitated to the highly skilled winger, who showed a passion for the game while playing in Montreal that had been lacking during his time in Los Angeles.

With a Capitals team that is much deeper up front, Kovalchuk has taken on a more reduced role. But with one goal and four points in seven games, he’s more than happy to play whatever role it takes to help win a championship.

“It’s easy,” he said of fitting in with his new team. “Especially with all those Russians here and with Ovie, he’s the captain and he brings all the energy and he wants the guys hanging out together and be like a family. So it’s a key to the success and I think he’s doing the right things.”

That being said, Kovalchuk still has a soft spot for the Canadiens, who reportedly haven’t closed the door on re-signing him in the off-season.

“Yeah, we talked all during the time,” he said of his former teammates. “But it is what it is right now. Like I said, it’s all history. I’m very happy to be here. We know we have a great team and a great chance, so we just need to work hard as a team and be as well-prepared as we can as a team.”

KUBALIK DESERVES CALDER CONSIDERATION

It was no surprise that Vancouver’s Quinn Hughes and Colorado’s Cale Makar were announced as finalists for the Calder Trophy as the league’s top rookie on Wednesday. And while the third name included on the ballot probably didn’t receive many — if any, at all— first-place votes, what Chicago’s Dominik Kubalik did this season was pretty special.

The 24-year-old, who led all rookies with 30 goals, scored more than Elias Pettersson and Mathew Barzal did when they won the Calder Trophy in 2019 and 2018, respectively. In fact, in the past nine years, only Auston Matthews (40), Patrik Laine (36), Kyle Connor (31) and Artemi Panarin (30) scored as much in their rookie season.

That’s a pretty impressive group.

TORTORELLA EARNED HIS JACK ADAMS NOD

I’m not sure Panarin would have been named a finalist for the Ted Lindsay Award (“most outstanding player”) had the league not expanded its playoffs to include the Rangers. But that same logic does not apply to Columbus’ John Tortorella, who along with Boston’s Bruce Cassidy and Philadelphia’s Alain Vigneault, was named as a finalist for the Jack Adams Award as coach of the year.

While Cassidy led the Bruins to the best record in the NHL this year and Vigneault had the Flyers improve from sixth to second in the Metropolitan Division, Tortorella’s Blue Jackets were on the bubble of making the playoffs when the season was cut short on March 12.

Technically, they were amongst the top eight teams in the conference. But based on point percentage, they were not a playoff team. And yet, with all the players they lost in the off-season and all the injuries they accrued — no team lost more man-games and at more crucial positions — no coach did more with less this season.

RUSSIA’S WEAKNESS NO LONGER IN NET

From Ovechkin and Evgeni Malkin to Nikita Kucherov and Panarin, Russia’s strengths as a country has always been in its forwards.

But with 25-year-old Andrei Vasilevskiy and a young crop of goalies that includes Ilya Samsonov (23), Igor Shesterkin (24) and Ilya Sorokin (24), who signed with the New York Islanders on Tuesday, the future looks just as bright in net.

“It’s great to have all those goalies, because before this was a problem (with Russia),” said Kovalchuk, who was part of the team that won gold at the 2018 Olympics with Shesterkin and Sorokin as the backups.

“But now we have so many great goalies. It’s good. It’s says that the hockey system is growing in Russia.”",TRIAKOS: Kovalchuk hopes to reunite with the Habs in the Eastern Conference Final,3,0.44984453463009777
286,"WATERLOO — Volleyball Canada reached out with the invitation and Cory Schoenherr marked the dates on his calendar. The Waterloo native, a six-foot-seven middle blocker and occasional right-side hitter with the Kitchener Waterloo Predators Volleyball Club, has been awarded a roster spot for virtual training sessions with Canada’s Under-19 men’s team. The program, according to a news release, aims to further connect, educate and continue the development of select athletes as Canada looks ahead to world championship qualification in 2021. Thirty players will take part in the U19 virtual camp and Schoenherr, a three-time Team Ontario selection, is one of 11 players to hail from this province and the only one from Waterloo Region. The soon-to-be Grade 12 student at Bluevale Collegiate has mixed feelings about his initial foray into Team Canada territory.  “It’s obviously not what I was expecting for my first national team experience but it’s pretty surreal to be up there with the top athletes in a country that is sending a team to the Olympics next year,” said the 17-year-old Schoenherr. “Unfortunately, the (U19) team was supposed to be going to Colorado and then Honduras, but that’s not going to happen because of COVID. It might eventually happen, maybe they’ll push it back a year, I really don’t know.” The virtual camp runs Monday through Friday of next week and participants will attend two sessions daily. After a weeklong break, the camp resumes July 27 for another week of a two-a-day video gatherings. The fact Schoenherr views the camp as a learning opportunity will come as no surprise to anyone who has seen him go about his business with the Predators. He played on two teams for the club last season — U16 Ubuntu and U18 Chaos — and excelled with both while paying attention to details that could make him a better player. “He is just an absolutely fabulous human being, teammate, competitor, leader, you name it. I can’t say enough good things about this kid,” said U18 Chaos coach Duncan Cairns. “He keeps a notebook that he writes down all of the things that he’s trying to work on and accomplish. He’s very attentive to detail in terms of fixing minutiae when it comes to his arm swing or his approach angles. He asks everybody in the gym for advice and help, but he’s discerning enough to know who to listen to and who not to listen to.” Schoenherr hasn’t been on a volleyball court since March when the pandemic hit and caused the cancellation of a trip to Poland as part of a Team Ontario Elite (17-18) team that had been selected in January.  Since then, he’s played a bit of beach volleyball while finding various ways to stay fit. “It’s safe to say this is the longest I’ve gone without playing since I started to play volleyball (at age 14),” he said. “The national team is training again in Gatineau (Que.) but we’re still waiting in Ontario.” Schoenherr has aspirations of playing volleyball at the university level in the fall of 2021 and down the road hopes to achieve the loftiest of goals by playing for Canada’s senior men’s team. Cairns is optimistic he’ll do both. “He could throw a dart at a map of North America right now and he could go to any school he wants ... and he has the marks to do it as well,” Cairns said. “He could be an international sensation for us.” Schoenherr is a well-rounded athlete who has played many other sports during his time at Bluevale, including hockey, basketball, badminton and track and field in discus, shot put, javelin and long jump. He won an Ontario Federation of School Athletics Association bronze medal in the discus in his Grade 9 year.",Canada calls on Waterloo volleyball sensation Schoenherr,3,0.31328086106892794
287,"It has been a long road back for veteran Canadian midfielder Diana Matheson.

It was a road fraught with injury setbacks and heartbreak, but one Matheson was determined to trek, looking to represent Canada in one final Olympics and her club team in a unique summer tournament.

“To be honest, I’m at a point in my career where I did think about whether it was time to retire or not,” said the 36-year-old product of Mississauga, Ont. “I think the fact that I play a team sport has been a part of it; teammates on the Canadian team that I still want to play with and hopefully win an Olympic medal.

“I have teammates that are in similar circumstances like Erin McLeod, who also has kept going and hasn’t hung up the boots yet, and if she hasn’t hung up the boots then I won’t either. I felt like I still have a bit more to give on the field and I really wanted to get back and push and keep competing. We’re all competitors and I don’t think anyone wants to end it on an injury note.”

Matheson has been part of the Canadian national team for the past 17 years. Only Christine Sinclair has played more games for her country than Matheson’s 206.

Matheson scored the winning goal in the bronze-medal game of the 2012 Olympics in London and won a second bronze medal four years later in Rio. She has a total of 19 goals for her country.

There is a spot reserved for Matheson in the Canada Soccer Hall of Fame when she does decide to call it a career and perhaps a job as a television analyst, which she performed so well for TSN during last summer’s FIFA Women’s World Cup.

“That panel was a great mix of personalities and I ended up enjoying it a lot more than I expected to,” Matheson said. “I would do it again in a second. And I think if you’re talking of some longterm goals, I’d love to be involved commentating on some men’s tournaments as well and do some analysis from that side.”

For now, however, Matheson is focused on getting Utah Royals FC to the semifinals of the National Women’s Soccer League Challenge Cup tournament. The Royals finished the round robin with a win, two losses and a tie, and will play the Houston Dash in a quarter-final (10 p.m. ET, CBC All Access) on Friday.

The two teams played to a thrilling 3-3 tie in their opening game of the round robin with Matheson scoring the opening goal of the game having returned to the field with the Royals for the first time in over a year due to a nagging toe injury, which also kept her off the Canadian World Cup squad last summer.

“It was nice to get back on the Canadian team in February, so that kind of felt like my first chance to get back in after my injury,” Matheson said. “Like everyone else, it was a bit annoying and unfortunate to have to take a break again. I felt like I just got back and then it was another three months off.

“I’m like everyone else, it was just nice to get playing again and scoring a goal is always nice.”

The NWSL was the first professional league in North America to get back to playing after the lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The league decided on a tournament format in a central location in Utah where players and coaches could be kept in a secure zone and safe from the virus.

Despite an early setback when the Orlando Pride had to pull out of the tournament because of a COVID-19 outbreak at training camp, the tournament has been a huge success. There are over a dozen Canadian players participating in the event, which wraps up with the final on Sunday, July 26.

“I think it’s gone as well as we could have hoped,” Matheson said. “The league has done a good job of communicating with us and getting feedback from players.

“There were a lot different concerns coming in, but things have gone quite smoothly. All the teams seem happy with their accommodations, and I think there were some logistical things early on, but everyone has settled in and the games have been good and the players have done a good job to manage the schedule. I think everyone feels safe and secure in our bubble and I think we’ve exceeded expectations so far.”

The Royals have been somewhat inconsistent through the first four games of the tournament. After their thriller against Houston where they battled back from a 3-1 deficit, Utah defeated Sky Blue FC 1-0, then lost 1-0 to both the OL Reign and Chicago Red Stars.

“I think we’re happy with how we’ve performed, there are just a few defensive things we have to tidy up,” Matheson said. “Then there is having more quality and consistency in front of goal to put our chances away. That’s really the only difference right now between us and the top teams in the tournament. So we’re looking forward to showing a bit more than that in the knockout round.”

291,"EDMONTON—The CFL’s Edmonton Eskimos are refusing to confirm two published reports that the team will change its name.

TSN and Postmedia are reporting the Edmonton club will make the change, following the Washington NFL team’s decision to do the same earlier this week.

A spokeswoman for the Edmonton club said the team had no update Friday morning.

Pressure has mounted in recent weeks for sports teams to eliminate racist or stereotypical names.

Critics say the Edmonton team’s name is a derogatory, colonial-era term for Inuit.

Aaron Paquette, a city councillor in Edmonton, tweeted that he met with the CFL club on Thursday and, while he didn’t confirm the name will be changed, he was “very impressed with the potential coming out of our conversation.”

“I had an extremely productive meeting with (Edmonton’s) own football team today after they accepted my invitation to share ideas & perspectives,” Paquette wrote.

“I can’t say any more but we’ll see what develops.”

In February, the Edmonton club announced it was keeping the name following yearlong research that involved Inuit leaders and community members across Canada. The club said it received “no consensus” during that review.

On July 8, the Edmonton club promised to speed up another review of its name and provide an update by the end of the month. In that statement, the club noted “a lot has happened” since it made the decision in February.

One of the team’s sponsors, national car-and-home insurance provider Belairdirect, had announced a day earlier that it was rethinking its relationship with the team because of the name.

Other sponsors also said they would welcome a review of the name.

Boston Pizza said “as part of a larger shift in our overall marketing strategy, Boston Pizza recently ended its sponsorship of Edmonton’s CFL team.” It tweeted the statement as a response to someone asking about whether it planned to follow the lead of Belairdirect.

All this happened as NFL’s Washington team said it would undergo a thorough review of its name. A similar announcement was made by Major League Baseball’s Cleveland Indians.

It is unclear when Edmonton would play its first game with a new name, if the change goes through. The CFL in June postponed the start of its 2020 season because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and there is no guarantee the league will play this year.

There have been repeated calls in the past for the Edmonton team to change its name.

Canada’s national Inuit organization in 2015 said it was time for a change.

“It isn’t right for any team to be named after an ethnic group,” said Natan Obed, president of Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, which represents Canada’s 60,000 Inuit. Obed has said that Inuit people are not mascots.

Edmonton Mayor Don Iveson, citing Obed’s statement, said in 2017 that the team should take steps toward a name change.

Although American Inuit continue to use the word Eskimo, Canada’s northern people left that name behind about the same time they began negotiating their land claim in the 1970s.

Many historians believe the origin of Eskimo comes from an Algonquin term meaning “eaters of raw meat.” Others believe it comes from another Aboriginal term that refers to people wearing snowshoes.

The people themselves have used the word Inuit for centuries. It means “the people” in Inuktut.

Founded in 1949, the Edmonton team has won the Grey Cup 14 times, second only to the Toronto Argonauts at 17. The community-owned club’s impressive history on the field includes a record five consecutive Grey Cups from 1978 to 1982.

Edmonton set a North American pro sports record by qualifying for the playoffs in 34 straight seasons from 1972 to 2005.

Other sports teams in Edmonton used the Eskimos name before the CFL club was founded.

There is no indication whether Edmonton has considered any possible new names.

The team applied for the trademark “Edmonton Empire” in 2018 for use on souvenir items.

292,"We’ve seen Maple Leafs bench bosses outcoached in the playoffs before. Last year comes immediately to mind.

So where does an NHL neophyte in the head honcho ranks go, mano a mano against the crafty John Tortorella?

Sheldon Keefe has just over a fortnight to figure that out before the play-in series with Columbus launches at Scotiabank Arena.

They have history, Keefe and Tortorella, a lot of it filthy. From their days together in Tampa, even if that’s all silty water under the bridge circa 2020.

“Well, playing for him as a young guy, it was difficult. He made it tough to earn your way as a young player and I was caught up in that,” Keefe admitted on a Zoom call Thursday.

As a 19-year-old Keefe was drafted in 1999 by Tampa Bay in the second round but he never found a firm playing niche when Tortorella assumed the reins, toggling between the NHL and the minors, at one point suspended after refusing a minor-league demotion before his career petered out as journeyman, ultimately on the scrap heap with a shredded knee. Long gone by the time the Lightning captured their first and only Stanley Cup title, in 2004, under Tortorella’s tutorship.

But Keefe’s regard for Tortorella — a coaching throwback in temperament, yet able to navigate the modern NHL — has risen, particularly since Keefe metamorphosed to coaching himself.

“Certainly as I made the transition from playing to being a coach and started to think about what you want, what you’re going to do, how you’re going to put together your program, (that’s) when you really learn to respect the process of how he put together a team concept.

“I didn’t get to play on that Stanley Cup championship team in Tampa but I was there through the process of that team growing from one year to the next to the next, eventually to the point where it was too good for me to play on.”

Making his own bones behind the bench in his second act, Keefe drew upon that education, using it as a “foundation” for his salad days in Pembroke and beyond, from Junior-A to an AHL triumph with the Marlies.

“I learned a lot from him,” Keefe continued, with a tip of the hat to a man who once tormented him, yet looms as an exemplar for messaging and methodology. “Fortunate to reconnect over the last few years.”

It has been mainly through text messages back and forth, including a congratulatory cable when Keefe replaced the jettisoned Mike Babcock last November. His resumé now has 47 games compared to Tortorella’s 1,327, plus 110 playoff games. Keefe, of course, is a playoff virgin at the NHL coaching level.

This series could be a chess match between the two men, it could be a mosh pit wrangle in the best-of-five opener.

“I’m ready,” Keefe avowed. “One thing about Torts is he’s an ultimate competitor. I’d like to believe that I’m a competitor at the same time. The greatest way to show somebody respect is to make sure you’re ready to compete.” At which juncture Keefe clearly had enough of that line of inquiry. “That’s about all you’ll hear from me in terms of talking about Torts and our past.”

Tortorella, by the by, is among the three finalists for coach of the year, fifth time around.

Keefe has been using this training camp 2.0 to craft his own playoff concept, facing a post-season that will be even more of a whirlwind, coronavirus-compressed and misshapen. That process was already underway when the NHL pulled the plug in March. “I don’t think it has to be altered in terms of the playoffs or anything like that. But it’s an opportunity for us to have a training camp to establish a real foundation.”

After catching a mighty long breath during the hockey furlough.

“In the race of the regular season, it’s relentless. It’s difficult to really nail down and get to work on things that you need to do … It’s kind of patchwork mid-season. So now it’s really a chance for us to get to work. Identify the areas that we really wanted to target and then build a plan. We’re fortunate to have this chance to reset ourselves.”

Keefe’s NHL coaching debut began with a squall of success, going 15-4-1 to start, but the Leafs were in a hardscrabble battle by the time the calendar flipped to March. It’s impossible to understate Keefe’s playoff rookie-ness, on top of across-the-board unknowns in this oddball world of sports recommencement.

“First of all, the NHL has its own unique challenges,” Keefe noted. “The calibre of the coaches is better, the calibre of the players is better. This event in itself is unique, not just for me but for everybody. So there are some things where nobody has an advantage.

“Playoffs are playoffs, the ups and downs, the emotions of it. You’re so invested, one game to the next, how things go, the chess matches that happen between the two teams, the adjustments you have to make. From my perspective, as I’ve gone from one level to the next, it’s the same. And I am expecting that to be much the same here.”

Those emotions will likely be accentuated — exacerbated — within the NHL playoff bubble in hub-city Toronto, where opposing players, all staying in the same hotel, might meet each other over breakfast after a vehement game the night before.

“You can go from one excellent game, feeling like you’re really on your way and you can win the whole thing, to getting down and you start to have doubts. That’s what you have to manage with your team. Recognizing key moments when you really have to rally your team. Through a playoff run, you have to identify them, make sure that you approach each one appropriately and you’re making the proper adjustments throughout.”

295,"KITCHENER — There were parties. Like most teenagers, members of the Kitchener Rangers would get together once in awhile to bond. Sometimes alcohol was involved. But life outside of the Aud was not party central, former players who donned the red, white and blue say. “There wasn’t a big party atmosphere,” said 21-year-old winger Jonathan Yantsis, who played with the Rangers for the past four years. “But let’s say we did have a day off, the older guys might go out for drinks. But the younger guys would stay at home and get ready for school. “It wasn’t like we were going out every night drinking. You choose your spots when you’re older. You’re still trying to make the NHL and be a professional.” The culture surrounding the Ontario Hockey League club was questioned earlier this week when ex-winger Eric Guest posted a video on Instagram alleging an older unnamed player forced him to use cocaine when he was a rookie at a nonsanctioned team party in 2016. “So he takes me and this other kid into the bathroom,” Guest, who was 16 at the time, recounted in the video. “He locks the door and … he said you guys aren’t leaving this bathroom until you do this. He said you’re not leaving the bathroom until you do cocaine, basically is what happened.” The OHL has since launched an investigation and, along with Rangers brass, will not comment on the alleged incident, at this time. When reached, Guest, now 20, said he too did not want to comment further and would continue communication through his personal videos. Like Guest, Yantsis also joined the Rangers in 2016 but not until later in the season when he inked a deal as a free agent. “I wasn’t around for the rookie party or anything,” he said. “I don’t know what he experienced personally. For myself, I’ve never seen that or heard of that going on with our team. No one has ever pressured me or put me in a situation where that has happened. “Sure, there is some pressure to drink at a party with older guys but it’s not like they’re forcing liquor down your throat. Most teenagers are going to drink but nobody was forced into anything they were uncomfortable with, from my experience.” In his video, Guest said the teammate who had the cocaine was a drafted NHL player. There were only five players who fit that profile with the Rangers at the time. Blueliner Connor Hall, a former Pittsburgh Penguins prospect, was one of them. “It wasn’t me,” he said. “I don’t want to comment too crazy on it. Looking at the other guys, they’re all on NHL deals. It’s not going to look good on anyone until the actual name of the person who did it comes out, whether it was a drafted player or not.” In the video, Guest, who played with the Rangers from 2016-19, also said: “... It’s like a partying lifestyle almost going through junior hockey and whatnot. I’ve seen it. Drinking problems, drug problems. It’s super common.” Hall admitted players got together for parties probably “four to five times a year.” Older players, of age, would also go to bars on days off, at times. But players had to adhere to a rotating curfew, depending on the day of the week. The 22-year-old also said the reality that someone could just text Rangers general manager Mike McKenzie, or other team staff, curtailed nights out. “From my five years being there we were pretty squeaky clean outside of hockey,” said Hall. But management can’t be everywhere. Guest didn’t feel comfortable sharing his negative experiences with the team, at the time. “You can’t go to your coaches, your GMs and say this stuff is happening in the locker-room,” he said, in the video. “They just don’t know about it. But this kind of stuff happens.” Hall said he can sympathize. “I feel like it (the alleged cocaine incident) would be a tough thing to go to someone about while you’re on the team, like he said,” said Hall. “As a 16-year-old you’re scared. Until you get comfortable with the guys you’re scared in the room. You don’t talk, you don’t do anything. “But in saying that, if it hurts you that bad … and if it hurt me in the way it hurt Guesty, I’m telling someone. I’m going into Mike McKenzie’s office, whether I’m 16 or 21, and saying something.” Jacob Cascagnette played parts of four seasons with the Rangers, before moving on to stints with the Mississauga Steelheads and Ottawa 67’s. He was at the party in question, but didn’t see any cocaine or hear about the story until this week. “I treated the rookies with respect and the rookies treated me with respect,” said the Kitchener native, who was a 19-year-old veteran at the time. “It’s just disappointing. I’m not sure who did it. I know the Rangers are a first-class organization and for something like this to happen, it shouldn’t happen in any locker-room. “My experience with off-ice stuff is that we had a close group with the Rangers each year and ... there was nothing along the lines of hazing or anything.  “But for this to happen is just sad. When the news came out it was just unbelievable. I was just embarrassed to even be a part of a roster where that happened.” Yantsis said he was close with Jay McKee, who coached the Rangers from 2016-19, and current assistants Dennis Wideman and Andreas Karlsson. “I knew I could go and talk to them if I had any problems,” he said. “I could go in there and talk about the stress of playing or if I had any problems at home that I needed to talk about. Personally, I had a great experience there (in Kitchener). There are people that are going to take care of you and care about you.”",Ex-Kitchener Rangers react to cocaine allegation,3,0.5429131974847156
298,"The CFL has sent Canadian Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault a revised financial request. A CFL source said Friday the league is seeking roughly $42.5 million in aid. In April, it asked the federal government for up to $150 million in financial assistance in the event of a cancelled 2020 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic. At the time, CFL commissioner Randy Ambrosie said the league was anxious “to be accountable to taxpayers,’ and would attempt to repay a portion of government assistance through “community programs, tourism promotion, the Grey Cup, our digital channels.” The source added the new request is to cover operating costs and player salaries for a shortened 2020 season. The proposal also includes a letter of support from the CFL Players’ Association. The source spoke on the condition of anonymity because neither the government nor CFL have confirmed the request. Last month, the CFL and CFLPA began talks to amend the current collective bargaining agreement to allow for an abbreviated season. The two sides must sign off on any changes for any games to be played. But prior to the start of negotiations, the CFL presented the union with a memo outlining the conditions it wanted and a completion deadline of July 23. When asked about the revised financial request, the CFL said, “We continue discussions with the federal government including discussions on our possible return to play.” While the revision is for substantially less money, the CFL’s situation hasn’t changed much. It still requires financial assistance with revenues having dropped drastically due to the COVID-19 pandemic and expenses expected to continue to rise if it tries to play a season with no fans The CFL’s initial request of Ottawa consisted of three tiers: It called for $30 million immediately to manage the impact the outbreak has had on league business; additional assistance for an abbreviated regular season; and up to another $120 million in the event of a lost 2020 campaign. When Ambrosie spoke to a federal standing committee on finance in May, he was roundly criticized for failing to stipulate where the funds would go and not involving the CFLPA in the process. But the source said the revised proposal mirrors an authentic financial offer and contains more specific details than the original one did. The earliest an abbreviated ‘20 season will begin is September, but Ambrosie has stated a cancelled campaign also remains possible. If the CFL holds a shortened season, it’s expected to do so in a hub city. Winnipeg has been mentioned as a strong hub candidate, but the source said Regina also is under consideration.","CFL submits revised financial request to federal government, source says",3,0.259085991853645
299,"KITCHENER — The walls of silence are up. Which is ironic, since speaking out was one of the hurdles one-time Kitchener Rangers forward Eric Guest faced while playing in the Ontario Hockey League. And I get it.  The OHL and the Rangers are refusing to comment because there is an ongoing investigation into the alleged hazing Guest says he dealt with while playing for the Blueshirts in 2016. It would be premature for them to discuss the allegations Guest made last week in an Instagram video. When the investigation wraps up, league and Rangers officials can have their say about his claim that a veteran teammate pressured him and another youngster to use cocaine in a locked bathroom at a nonsanctioned party during his rookie season. But Guest’s 15-minute video also raised a myriad of issues that all players can relate to. Things that, regardless of the outcome of the investigation, need to be examined. Look, the Rangers run a tight ship. I’ve seen it firsthand for more than a decade. I can’t tell you how many players, parents, agents, scouts and coaches rave about the club. The team’s reputation is that solid. General manager and coach Mike McKenzie is approachable and a real student of the game. Jay McKee, who was behind the bench for Guest’s tenure, might just be the nicest and most level-headed person I’ve met in junior hockey.  They both clearly care about their players. So, I don’t think there is malice, ignorance or ego driving things on East Avenue.  But despite efforts to create an inclusive environment, there is a palpable disconnect between veterans and rookies — here and around the OHL. Guest captured the dynamic well in his video. “When you’re young in that league ... you listen to what the older guys tell you,” he said. “You don’t really have a voice.” Former Rangers defenceman Connor Hall echoed those feelings when reached last week: “As a 16-year-old you’re scared. Until you get comfortable with the guys you’re scared in the room. You don’t talk, you don’t do anything.” Guest also said he found it hard to leave home to play hockey. And he’s not alone. “Moving away from home is a big culture shock for a 16-year-old,” said Rangers alumnus Jacob Cascagnette. “I experienced that when I was 19 moving to Mississauga (after being traded by Kitchener). I know what Guest was going through (in that respect).” Guest said he “hated” his billet house during his rookie season, so much it made him cry. And while the Rangers vet and have some amazing billets, not all pairings mesh. “There have been multiple guys that have had different billets just because it wasn’t a right fit,” said ex-Rangers forward Jonathan Yantsis. “Some families want you to be a complete part of their family and go to family gatherings and stuff, whereas other people are more laid back and let you do your own thing.” But the biggest takeaway from Guest’s video is that he didn’t feel comfortable speaking to coaches, management or even his parents about some of the hardships he was going through. “I lied to my parents for years when I lived there (in Kitchener) and said like ‘Oh, I’m fine, I’m doing well, like I’m mentally OK’,” he said, in the video.  “I lied to them because I wanted to play in the NHL. When you’re in that situation you’re going to do anything you can. You’re going to bury your feelings, your thoughts and try and make that dream come true. That’s what I was doing.” He didn’t want to complain or be seen as a problem. He wanted to “fly under the radar.” That kind of pressure seems suffocating. And it’s heartbreaking to hear. While the investigation into Guest’s allegations of a cocaine incident is ongoing, his video goes deeper than illicit drugs. It speaks to larger issues that every player can relate to, some more than others. They are issues that aren’t unique to the Rangers. They likely run through every OHL club — and they need to be talked about.",Issues in junior hockey go beyond cocaine allegation,3,0.5416022629129655

Surrey-area minor hockey associations are aiming to hit the ice again later this summer, as always.

Registration has opened for play in the Surrey, Cloverdale, Semiahmoo and North Delta associations that comprise the Valley West zone in B.C.

The regional Pacific Coast Amateur Hockey Association said it is “well positioned for a successful season start in September, following prescribed return-to-play protocols from our sport governing bodies, the public health authorities and provincial government.

“It is our intention to have both recreational and rep hockey,” the association said in a July 3 statement. “This includes preparing game schedules for various return-to-play scenarios. We are pleased that we are now in Phase 3 of B.C’s Restart Plan, and we are beginning to see some of our municipal arenas reopen with programming run by our member associations.”

Local minor hockey associations are looking to start on-ice sessions in mid-August, as in previous seasons, but in Surrey it’s not yet clear when city-operated rinks and rec centres will reopen during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The city is looking at a “phased” re-opening of rec centres starting in the fall “if conditions stay the same,” City Manager Vincent Lalonde told Surrey council at its June 29 meeting.

Meantime, hockey practices organized by individuals have been held at private rinks including Langley Sportsplex and Delta Planet Ice. No Hockey Canada-sanctioned events are currently allowed.

The PCAHA says it has been working with its member associations on plans for a safe return to hockey. Regular meetings with all parties “have been occurring since April to plan and prepare for next season.”

• RELATED STORY: New PJHL boss is game for the return of hockey this fall, if green light given.

The Now-Leader was on a recent Zoom conference with executives from Valley West minor hockey associations, including Surrey president Harbs Bains, Cloverdale president Deanna Cox, North Delta president Robert Reid and Semiahmoo executive director Dave Newson.

“We know we have to work together to make this game come back this fall, and also make it comfortable and seamless for our members,” Bains said.

In early June, Hockey Canada said the best approach for a return to hockey in Canada is to allow each of its 13 provincial organizations “the opportunity to work with authorities in their respective regions to determine when it is safe to return to the ice in areas that fall under their jurisdiction.”

Minor hockey registration has since begun, and pre-season camps planned.

“With our registration patterns,” Newson said, “we’re getting good numbers and very little negative feedback about plans to return – just a couple of emails from people wondering what the season’s going to look like and if it’s a good time to register, that type of thing. But I think people are sensing that there will be some hockey in some form, and that it might look different but they want to be part of it when the time comes.”

Reid said “the rumour mill kind of took over for a few weeks there, with people saying there’d be no hockey, no games, nothing,” due to the pandemic.

“Unless we hear otherwise, our game is going ahead the way it always has. If we have to modify it once we do get direction, we have a contingency plan in place.

“We spend so much time chasing our kids off the XBoxes,” Reid added, “and for a couple months there’s been nothing but that, but I get the impression that parents are itching, absolutely itching to get back to what we know and love.”

Cox, who was elected president in Cloverdale in the spring, said the issues include tournaments and how they would be played.

“I had one of my rep coaches asking about registering for a fall tournament in the States, and we agreed that that’s a bad idea,” Cox said. “It’s about finding something local, and hopefully by the spring they can go back into the U.S. for tournaments, places out of town.”

For associations across Canada starting this coming season, divisions of minor hockey will no longer be known as Peewee, Bantam, Midget and similar names. In a change announced last November, Hockey Canada has moved to U7, U9 and other alpha-numeric, age-specific division names.

“We just have to keep getting the message out with the new branding, and be consistent,” Bains said. “The kids will get used to it right away, but it might take longer for the parents.”

COVID or no COVID, Newson said all of the local associations are interested in gaining more access to city-operated rinks and using private facilities less, for financial reasons.

New to Surrey at the start of last hockey season was North Surrey Sport & Ice Complex, a three-sheet arena built near Pattullo Bridge as a replacement for the two-sheet North Surrey Recreation Centre.

“For us,” Bains said, “it was a great new building and the anticipation and excitement was there. Some found it a long ways to travel because they got used to the other rink location, but as the season progressed it was fine. The kids loved playing there.”

For those in Cloverdale, the new rink provided some relief in an area where the city cancelled plans to build a two-sheet arena.

“We found that we could do more practices closer to home, and didn’t have to buy as much ice in Langley, for example, that early-morning ice,” Cox said.

“We found this past year that they expanded their adult hockey even more (at Surrey Sport and Leisure, in Fleetwood), and I get that the city has to make their arenas profitable, but we get complaints every single week about kids having such bad ice times,” Cox continued.

“It’s hard on the kids when they’re practicing at 10:30, 10:45 at night, or 5:30 in the morning, just to get on the ice here in Surrey. We could get better times in Langley but then we’d be paying three times the rate we’d pay in Surrey. We have kids at the Bantam and Midget ages who quit because the ice times are so bad.”

In other hockey news, BC Hockey says it will be operating a zone program for the 2020-2021 season, putting to rest rumours that the program would be scrapped during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The BC Hockey Zone AAA/AA Program provides elite-level development for players aged 13 to 18. The focus of this program is to prepare them for the next level of hockey through expanded draw zones.

302,"KITCHENER — National Basketball League of Canada owners want to be up and running in late December. This country’s oldest professional league, which was forced to halt its 2019-20 schedule in March because of COVID-19, has announced eight teams will participate in the 10th season that is tentatively slated to start Boxing Day. “We’ve been subject to a lot of inquiries in terms of what’s happening with our future and whether we’re coming back, so now with the economy opening up and regions moving into Phase 2, we felt it was a good time to tell our fan base that we are very much excited about coming back,” said league deputy commissioner Audley Stephenson. “Health officials are going to guide us and give us direction ... but we thought now was a good time to inspire a little confidence as we turn around as a society if you will.” Kitchener-Waterloo Titans owner Leon Martin is on the record as saying his team would return for its fifth season if the league returns from the coronavirus. Stephenson said teams in London, Sudbury, Windsor, St. John’s, Halifax, Charlottetown and Moncton will also return. A league that requires gate receipts to survive, Stephenson admits the season won’t happen without the green light from health officials to play in front of spectators. The Titans play at the Aud and last season averaged 1,587 spectators in 11 home games. A crowd of 3,766 took in the Jan. 14 school-day game against the Island Storm and a season-low 938 were in attendance two days later for a Thursday night game against the Windsor Express.

The panel, which was unanimously agreed to by the CHL’s board of directors on Thursday, will also examine the allegation that players don’t feel comfortable reporting such incidents. The announcement comes in the wake of a series of allegations of abuse made by former players, including ex-Kitchener Rangers forward Eric Guest, who said he was pressured to use cocaine by an older teammate at a party during his rookie season in 2016. Former NHL player Daniel Carcillo is also at the forefront of a class-action lawsuit against the CHL after outlining a list of disturbing allegations he said he endured while playing for the Sarnia Sting in the early 2000s. The lawsuit alleges rookies were forced to sit in the middle of the dressing room shower naked while older players urinated on them, had their bare buttocks hit with a goalie stick, were forced to strip naked and crammed in a bus bathroom and had to bob for apples in a cooler filled with urine and saliva, among other things. “We are deeply troubled by the allegations in the recently announced class action, many of which are historic in nature and we believe are not indicative of the leading experience our players receive in the CHL today,” the statement said. “Regardless of the timing, we are taking the claims very seriously as the protection of our players has been and will always be our primary concern.” The CHL plans to appoint a chair to the panel in the weeks ahead and to have “a review process” completed by the beginning of next season. “We welcome the findings of the independent review panel to ensure we are providing the safest player experience in hockey and amateur sport,” the statement said. The CHL oversees 1,400 junior hockey players in its three leagues — the Ontario, Quebec and Western hockey leagues. “The CHL is committed to ensuring them an environment that is Players First and free of hazing, abuse, harassment and bullying, and that provides zero tolerance for any of these behaviours,” the statement said. “To the extent that the allegations relate to criminal conduct we encourage those involved to contact the police.” Over the past two decades, the CHL has been working with groups such as the Canadian Mental Health Association, Canadian Red Cross and Respect in Sport to help deal with hazing, abuse, harassment and bullying. Currently, players are encouraged to reach out to their coach, general manager, police liaison, player liaison or governor/member or league officials, if they have any concerns about the way they are being treated.",Canadian Hockey League appoints panel to review hazing,3,0.2807867235646755
305,"WATERLOO — Julie Karn is eager to get back on the soccer pitch. The Waterloo athlete achieved her dream of playing professional soccer this past season when she landed a gig with FF USV Jena, a club on Germany’s top women’s circuit. “It was a very eye-opening experience,” said the Bluevale Collegiate Institute graduate. “It was cool to see something that was my passion become my profession.” But Karn only got a taste of the top level. An injury sustained in training limited her to just three games. When she was nearing a return, the COVID-19 pandemic hit. “My whole season was a little bit chaotic,” she said. “It wasn’t the first professional season that I wanted to have but it motivated me even more to have a better season this year.” And that will likely be on a different team, after Jena was relegated to the second division in Germany. Karn’s agent is currently scouring top women’s leagues abroad to find her next job. Once travelling restrictions ease up, she expects to head overseas to resume her kicking career. “I’m hoping to stay in the first division in whatever country I go to,” she said. “That’s the goal.” And Karn is used to achieving her goals. Besides playing soccer, she’s also a professional dancer after honing her craft at studios in Kitchener (Bojangles Dance Arts) and Bolton (Joanne Chapman School Of Dance). She starred in her first music video alongside pop star Shawn Desman when she was just 14 and has danced in TV shows and the Much Music Video Awards, among other things. When she wasn’t dancing, she was using her fancy footwork on the soccer field as a standout at Wilfrid Laurier University and the semi-pro Kitchener-Waterloo United FC. Through it all, Karn got a degree in kinesiology from Laurier and a master’s degree in human health and nutritional sciences from the University of Guelph. She also waits tables at Vita Lounge and Bistro, Kitchener’s new Italian hot-spot. And she’s only 24. “I’m someone that is productive when I’m busy,” she said. Soccer has always been a big part of the Karn household. Dad Dennis played in his younger days and the clan’s German roots meant the black, red and gold flag was waved when the World Cup was on TV. So, playing in her ancestral home was a huge honour. Getting there took some work. It started with Karn landing a training stint with Bristol City in England’s top women’s league for two summers while at Laurier. From there, she went to Frankfurt for more practise. A coach from that squad ended up running Jena and offered her a job last July. “I want people to know that if you put your mind to it and put in enough work, regardless of what you want to do, it’s possible,” said Karn, who credits her dad, mom, Shelley, and sister, Tanya, for helping her achieve her soccer dream. “I want to motivate girls from Canada and Waterloo Region so that they know it’s actually possible.” One day, Karn wants to crack the national women’s soccer squad. For now, she continues to train locally with a former Laurier teammate, workout from home and tend tables while waiting for the call to her next stop in soccer.",Waterloo soccer star eager to keep kicking at top level in Europe,3,0.4479022405332955
309,"EDMONTON -- The CFL's Edmonton Eskimos are refusing to confirm two published reports that the team will change its name.

TSN and Postmedia are reporting the Edmonton club will make the change, following the Washington NFL team's decision to do the same earlier this week.

A spokeswoman for the Edmonton club said the team had no update Friday morning.

Pressure has mounted in recent weeks for sports teams to eliminate racist or stereotypical names.

Critics say the Edmonton team's name is a derogatory, colonial-era term for Inuit.

Aaron Paquette, a city councillor in Edmonton, tweeted that he met with the CFL club on Thursday and, while he didn't confirm the name will be changed, he was “very impressed with the potential coming out of our conversation.”

“I had an extremely productive meeting with (Edmonton's) own football team today after they accepted my invitation to share ideas & perspectives,” Paquette wrote.

“I can't say any more but we'll see what develops.”

In February, the Edmonton club announced it was keeping the name following year-long research that involved Inuit leaders and community members across Canada. The club said it received “no consensus” during that review.

On July 8, the Edmonton club promised to speed up another review of its name and provide an update by the end of the month. In that statement, the club noted “a lot has happened” since it made the decision in February.

One of the team's sponsors, national car-and-home insurance provider Belairdirect, had announced a day earlier that it was rethinking its relationship with the team because of the name.

Other sponsors also said they would welcome a review of the name.

Boston Pizza said “as part of a larger shift in our overall marketing strategy, Boston Pizza recently ended its sponsorship of Edmonton's CFL team.” It tweeted the statement as a response to someone asking about whether it planned to follow the lead of Belairdirect.

All this happened as NFL's Washington team said it would undergo a thorough review of its name. A similar announcement was made by Major League Baseball's Cleveland Indians.

It is unclear when Edmonton would play its first game with a new name, if the change goes through. The CFL in June postponed the start of its 2020 season because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and there is no guarantee the league will play this year.

There have been repeated calls in the past for the Edmonton team to change its name.

Canada's national Inuit organization in 2015 said it was time for a change.

“It isn't right for any team to be named after an ethnic group,” said Natan Obed, president of Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, which represents Canada's 60,000 Inuit. Obed has said that Inuit people are not mascots.

Edmonton Mayor Don Iveson, citing Obed's statement, said in 2017 that the team should take steps toward a name change.

Although American Inuit continue to use the word Eskimo, Canada's northern people left that name behind about the same time they began negotiating their land claim in the 1970s.

Many historians believe the origin of Eskimo comes from an Algonquin term meaning “eaters of raw meat.” Others believe it comes from another Aboriginal term that refers to people wearing snowshoes.

The people themselves have used the word Inuit for centuries. It means “the people” in Inuktut.

Founded in 1949, the Edmonton team has won the Grey Cup 14 times, second only to the Toronto Argonauts at 17. The community-owned club's impressive history on the field includes a record five consecutive Grey Cups from 1978 to 1982.

Edmonton set a North American pro sports record by qualifying for the playoffs in 34 straight seasons from 1972 to 2005.

Other sports teams in Edmonton used the Eskimos name before the CFL club was founded.

There is no indication whether Edmonton has considered any possible new names.

The team applied for the trademark “Edmonton Empire” in 2018 for use on souvenir items.

TORONTO - Walking into the Maple Leafs' practice facility represented a small return to normalcy for John Tavares.

Toronto 's captain also got an immediate glimpse of how different life looks as the NHL moves forward in hopes of completing its pandemic-hit season.

Testing, hygiene, masks when not exercising and observing physical distancing rules are all part of a new normal as the league enters Phase 2 of its return-to-play protocol - the second of four steps with an eye towards resuming play this summer.

But Tavares quickly realized the time constraints of having roughly 45 minutes for off-ice workouts and 40 minutes of skating for these voluntary sessions with a small groups of teammates.

“The intensity is there. There's a ton of benefit, there's no doubt,” he said on a video conference call with reporters Tuesday. “But to just give you an example, after (Monday) I brought my sticks home so I could tape them up (and) save time at the rink. And even for guys to get some manual therapy after developing some soreness on the ice, the windows are fairly small.

“But overall, the actual work we were able to get in and being out on the ice and in the gym is going to go a long way in helping us prepare and get ready.”

Tavares skated with Ilya Mikheyev, Jake Muzzin and Jack Campbell on Monday and Tuesday, with Cody Ceci and Mitch Marner expected to join later this week to complete their six-man group.

Six other Leafs - Zach Hyman, Alexander Kerfoot, William Nylander, Morgan Rielly, Travis Dermott and minor-league goalie Joseph Woll - make up the other group confirmed to have hit the ice for the sessions that are closed to the media.

“There's a lot of excitement from the guys to get back in a little bit of what we're used to,” Tavares said. “Going back to the rink, seeing each other.

“Even with things being different, it's been such a breath of fresh air.”

What's also going to be different is the 24-team format should the league get the green light from health and government officials to complete the 2019-20 campaign in two centralized hub cities this summer. If all goes well, the league aims to hold training camps sometime after July 10 before resuming the season later that month or in early August after the schedule was originally paused nearly three months ago because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

So with all that in mind, will teams get a free pass if things don't go according to plan in these extraordinary times?

“We're still competing for the Stanley Cup, and to win it is obviously going to be extremely difficult,” Tavares said. “The urgency from our group ... is extremely high.”

The Leafs sat third in the Atlantic Division at the time the NHL paused its schedule, but will now have to beat the Columbus Blue Jackets in the best-of-five qualifying round just to make the playoffs before potentially having to navigate four best-of-seven series.

“This is an opportunity to win the Stanley Cup,” Tavares added. “Don't take any of those chances or those opportunities for granted.”

A member of the NHL/NHLPA Return to Play Committee that hammered out details for the 24-team plan, the 29-year-old said it makes sense for Phase 2 to eventually be expanded so that groups of more than six will be allowed in the building at one time.

But all players in their current groups must stick together - no subbing in and out - meaning there's a decent chance the Leafs see a line of Tavares, Mikheyev and Marner as a potential fit if the games resume. Coaches and management, it should be noted, are only allowed to observe Phase 2 workouts from afar.

“This is the way we're starting,” said Tavares, who had 26 goals and 60 points in 63 games this season. “We can use this time to get better, get familiar with each other again, and build some positivity and continuity.

“We want to be firing on all cylinders as best we can be once competition begins.”

The captain added although it's only a fraction of the roster, there's a chance to start rebuilding chemistry and camaraderie.

“You're being more cautious about how close you are to each other,” Tavares said. “(But) being with each other, passing the puck, getting a good workout in, being on the ice, everyone's pushing each other ... it's been a blast just being around that again.”

And like the normalcy he's felt this week, it isn't lost on Tavares what hockey's return will eventually mean for fans - many of whom have gone through trying circumstances during a pandemic that's killed more than 7,800 people across Canada and impacted millions around the world.

“So many people are going through tough times,” he said. “The impact it can have on our communities and society, to help a lot of people through a tough time ... it's an opportunity for us to do many great things.”

311,"EDMONTON -- Don’t worry, Edmonton Oilers fans: Despite the thunderstorm that flooded Rogers Place, the team says the arena will be ready to host hockey games scheduled to begin in two weeks.

A massive rainstorm hit Edmonton Thursday night and caused water damage to a number of public and private buildings, Mayor Don Iveson said Friday.

Videos circulating social media during the storm showed water pouring into Rogers Place and pooling on the floor of the 104 Avenue entrance.

Oilers Entertainment Group determined ""the damage experienced from last evening's rainstorm was due to significant water flow, mixed with hail, which led to excess pressure on the facility's storm drainage system causing two pipe couplings to fail.""

One of the pipe couplings that failed is located above the terminus of Ford Hall, OEG said. That area, which the videos show, suffered the most damage.

Iveson called the images ""very concerning"" but assured Edmontonians the situation is well in hand.

""They've said publicly and also to us that it shouldn’t imperil the hub city activity that is pending… it won't jeopardize the ability to host NHL activity in our city in the coming weeks.""

OEG said: ""We do not foresee any significant delays or barriers to either the Edmonton Oilers Training Camp or preparations and activities related to our hosting as the NHL Hub City for the 2020 NHL Playoffs.""

312,"TORONTO -- Norm Powell is angry at the NBA for limiting players to a ""cookie-cutter"" list of social justice messages.

Social and racial justice is a theme of the NBA's restart in Florida, and part of that was permitting players to substitute Black Lives Matter messages, or the names of Black people killed such as George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, on the backs of their jerseys in place of their names.

Powell had hoped to replace his name with ""Am I Next?"" But the league has drawn up a list of approved messages for players to choose from, and the Toronto Raptors guard is frustrated that the NBA is limiting their voice on an issue that involves freedom of speech.

""I was really disappointed in the options that were given to us,"" Powell said on a Zoom video call Thursday. ""With a topic just like this -- social justice -- that we're fighting for, the fact that we were boxed-in to a list of 28, 29 sayings was really unfortunate.

""We've got a lot of guys in this league that . . . have been using their voice through this time and we're really excited about the whole thing, about being able to change our last names, and put a quote there that represents where we stand and what we want to say and how we feel about this, and I was really upset about the whole change and how we're really limited.""

Powell will wear ""Black Lives Matter"" on his jersey, choosing that from a list that he called ""cookie cutter"" and said doesn't truly touch on the topics of what players are trying to achieve.

Among the 29 slogans to choose from are: ""Say Their Names,"" ""Vote,"" and ""I Can't Breathe.""

""I wish there wasn't even a list,"" Powell said. ""It's a topic where it's freedom of speech, and you're taking your name off the back of your jersey that matters to you. That speaks volumes to how you view things and your approach to life and you shouldn't be boxed in to say you can only say this much, this is OK for you to say.""

Powell said, as long as players didn't use any explicit language, they should have been free to choose whatever they liked.

Rondae Hollis-Jefferson will wear ""Speak Up"" on his jersey.

""It sticks out to me, personally, because I think a lot more of us on this platform should definitely speak up, they should say something, especially if they believe and care about what's going on right now in our world as a whole,"" he said. ""I feel like we all should speak up and say something, bring somebody closer together, take it one step at a time, one person at a time and then watch that trickle effect as we rub off our energy, our love, our positivity on somebody. That goes a long way.""

Some NBA players such as New Orleans' Jrue Holiday have announced they're contributing their remaining game cheques to social justice causes and Black-owned businesses.

""I think what those guys have done is amazing,"" Powell said.

The 27-year-old, who signed a four-year, US$27 million contract extension in 2017, announced Wednesday that 100 per cent of proceeds from July orders of his Understand the Grind spring/summer line would go to two foundations: Toronto-based Black Women in Motion and Color of Change in the U.S.

""These are organizations that need our support now more than ever,"" Powell said on his Instagram page.

Canada West announced on July 15 that via a vote of all 17 members that conference competition will proceed this fall.

Whether the championships are ultimately staged is contingent on health and safety considerations across Western Canada, as British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba continue to manage COVID-19 in their respective provinces.

The CW Golf Championships, hosted by UBC Okanagan in Kelowna are scheduled for the Okanagan Golf Club, Oct. 2 to 4.

Canada West had previously announced on June 8 that all first term team sports – soccer, football, field hockey, and rugby 15s – wouldn’t proceed, and that all two-term sports – basketball, volleyball, and hockey – would start no sooner than January 2021 with reduced schedules. A decision on the commencement of two-term sports and second term championship sports – including wrestling – will be made no later than Oct. 8. Of the sports listed, UFV competes in soccer, basketball, volleyball and wrestling.

Golf has weathered the COVID-19 pandemic better than most sports, as an outdoor activity where physical distancing is relatively easy to maintain. Golf courses have been able to remain open in B.C. during the pandemic, with modifications.

“I’d like to thank our COVID-19 Task Force along with the scheduled hosts of our fall championship sports for the work that went into informing today’s vote,” stated CW President Clint Hamilton. “While we are disappointed that cross country champions won’t be crowned this fall, we will proceed optimistically with plans for the CW Golf Championships and remain hopeful for delivering swimming in the second term.”

Kawaguchi is the first UND captain to hail from British Columbia since Powell River’s Brad Bombardir led the team in 1993-94.

The 23-year-old forward bypassed National Hockey League opportunities to return to the Fighting Hawks in 2020-21. This will be his fourth campaign.

Abbotsford’s Cole Brandsma has received a prestigious invite to Volleyball Canada’s U21 men’s virtual training group.

The 2019 Abbotsford Christian Secondary grad will join 26 other players from all across the country at the virtual camp, which aims to prepare the program to further connect, educate, and continue the development of the selected athletes as Canada looks towards World Championship qualification in 2021.

The athletes will be engaged through various sessions in July and August including support from Team Canada staff on technical, tactical, physical, and mental skill development.

Brandsma finished up his first year with the UBC Thunderbirds men’s volleyball team earlier this year, with UBC finishing third in the Canada West with a record of 17-5. The Thunderbirds eventually fell in the Canada West semifinal to Alberta back in March.

He is a gold medal winner at both the U16 provincial club level and at the 2016 BC Summer Games with the Fraser Valley team. Brandsma also has a U18 club provincial silver medal and a national bronze.

He is also a three-time provincial high school all-star, a three-time ACS male athlete of the year, and was named to the Abbotsford Sports Wall of Fame. He also helped lead ACS to a provincial silver medal in volleyball.

“While every coach and athlete would love to be in the gym, we recognize the significant challenge we all are facing during the pandemic. It is critical that our coaches and athletes continue to develop athletes through high performance pathways toward the men’s and women’s indoor national teams,” stated Dawna Sales, Director of Athlete and Coach Pathways for Volleyball Canada. “To work with world-leading professional staff that traditionally wouldn’t be available in July to our youth and junior athletes is just one of the opportunities to extend our programs.”

321,"The Canadian Elite Basketball League has shown itself to be open to innovative ideas, and that trend will continue when the second-year circuit tips off its Summer Series later this month.

The seven-team 15-day tournament begins July 25 and will include the ‘Elam Ending’ in all 26 games.

The concept caught the attention of hoops fans at the most recent NBA all-star game. Created by Ball State University prof Nick Elam, the end-of-game rule takes away the score clock inside the final four minutes, replacing it with a target score.

At the first stoppage of play at or under four minute mark of the fourth quarter, timed play ends and a target score is set, equal to the leading team’s score plus nine. For example, if Abbotsford’s Fraser Valley Bandits lead the Edmonton Stingers 77-71 at the stoppage, the target score after adding nine points to the Bandits’ total is 86.

The first team to reach the target score wins the game.

Only two timeouts per team can be used during untimed play, with Elam striving to eliminate the lack of flow that comes from intentional fouling, seemingly endless timeouts and rushed possessions.

“I am excited about the CEBL’s bold vision to implement the Elam Ending, and to be the first to do so in FIBA play,” Elam said. “Whether at the NBA All-Star Game, TBT: The Basketball Tournament, or countless grassroots-level leagues and events throughout the basketball world, the Elam Ending continues to prove its ability to preserve high-quality, fluid, and intense play all the way through the end of the game.”

CEBL commissioner Mike Morreale is excited to see the Elam Ending in action.

“The Elam Ending ensures that every contest ends on a winning basket,” the basketball boss said. “We will have 26 heroes for all 26 of our CEBL Summer Series games. It greatly enhances the viewing experience for fans, and the game experience for players and coaches.”

The CEBL Summer Series sees the Bandits tipping off against Edmonton, Ottawa, Hamilton, Guelph, Saskatchewan (Saskatoon) and host Niagara at the Meridian Centre in St. Catharines for a round robin competition leading to a playoff bracket and title game.

322,"WINNIPEG -- Patrik Laine said back in May there was a good chance he'd look ""terrible"" if the NHL resumed its season this summer.

Like most players locked down during the COVID-19 pandemic, the always-blunt Winnipeg Jets sniper hadn't been on skates in more than two months. He also scoffed at the idea of strapping on rollerblades.

With training camps now in full swing eight weeks later, and the league's restart fast-approaching, that feeling of not being ready hasn't really changed.

""Still kind of far away,"" Laine said Wednesday when asked about the current state of his game. ""It's kind of hard to see myself playing playoff hockey in two weeks.

""But just trying to make the most out of it and trying to be as well-prepared as I and as we can ... just try to work hard these next couple of weeks so we'll be ready when the puck drops.""

Those games are coming quick for the 24 teams involved in the resumption of play, including the Jets, who are set to meet the Calgary Flames in the only all-Canadian matchup of the best-of-five qualifying round beginning Aug. 1 in the Edmonton hub for spot in the traditional post-season bracket.

In truth, the entire league is scrambling to get back up to speed. Certain players had access to home gyms and ice sooner than others. It's simply a reality of the times.

And all things considered, Winnipeg head coach Paul Maurice said Laine, who eventually got skating back home in Finland, isn't as far away as the winger made it sound.

""Kind of looks exactly like everybody else,"" Maurice said. ""I don't think anybody looks the way they're going to in about two weeks. We all expect that. It's part of building.""

Building is also what Laine did with his own game this season before the NHL was shuttered in mid-March by the novel coronavirus.

Coming off a disappointing 50-point campaign in 2018-19 -- he'd scored 80 goals and added 54 assists in his first two seasons after being picked second overall behind Auston Matthews at the 2016 draft -- Laine focused on becoming a more complete player.

""You always want to get better at everything you're doing, but I think just try to add some consistency,"" said the 22-year-old. ""The difference between a bad night and a good night -- that gap -- just try to get that a little bit smaller and try to get the better overall game in better shape.""

Laine missed training camp back in September while working on a two-year, US$13.5-million contract extension, but shot out of the starting blocks after rejoining the team, having put up 28 goals and 63 points in 68 games when the season was suspended.

""Development and growth,"" Maurice said of what Laine showed from October through March compared to his three previous campaigns. ""It's hard to explain when you get a young man that has such success in something specific like scoring goals. But in so many ways, he wouldn't be any different than any other 18-year-old, especially coming from Europe. (The NHL is) a different style of hockey.

""It's a far different level of the game. It happens so much faster.""

Maurice said Laine's biggest jump came at 5-on-5 and understanding the need to work as part of a unit.

""There's a big chunk of the game of hockey where nothing actually happens unless you don't do your job,"" said the coach. ""He's gotten to be quite a bit better at just doing the job, plays without the puck more.

""If he's the first guy on the forecheck, he needs to do something so the four players can move. Most skilled players or uniquely-skilled players that you get into the NHL, they've never really had an awareness of that -- that what they do changes what everybody else around them does.""

Laine made waves during his contract impasse when he told a Finnish reporter he deserved to play with the Jets' best players, namely Mark Scheifele and Blake Wheeler.

""I think I've been able to show everybody that I'm capable of playing top minutes and against top players,"" Laine said Wednesday. ""Hopefully I'm going to get more responsibilities in the future.""

Maurice, meanwhile, made it clear at no time did he have a problem with Laine's comments.

""Had I taken offence to that, I would've been greatly offended 20 years ago and every year since,"" said the veteran of exactly 1,600 regular-season NHL games. ""I wonder a lot of times if it's not requisite to greatness. These guys want more. They want to play more. They want to play more minutes.

""The great players have to have that belief in themselves that they deserve to be on the ice all the time.""

That belief is surely still there for Laine, even though it might be a little shaky at the moment.

323,"The University of the Fraser Valley Cascades men’s basketball team announced the addition of two more players earlier this week.

The club inked forward Aidan Wilson and guard Jake Willemsen, and new head coach Joe Enevoldson’s initial recruiting class now stands at eight players.

Wilson, a Burnaby native, has excelled at both the high school and college levels.

In 2017-18, his Grade 11 season, he helped the Burnaby South Rebels win the B.C. 4A high school crown. Two years later, as a freshman at Douglas, he was part of a Royals squad which won the Pacwest conference title and was ranked No. 1 in the nation heading into the CCAA national championships, which were ultimately cancelled due to COVID-19.

Last season, playing limited minutes on a veteran-laden Douglas team, Wilson averaged 5.1 points, 4.3 rebounds, and 0.7 blocks in 12.2 minutes per game, on his way to Pacwest all-rookie honours.

“He’s a big-time recruit for us, both in the short term and in the long-term,” Enevoldson stated. “His ceiling is quite high, and he makes plays that contribute to winning basketball. He’s a very good athlete at 6’10”, he can really run the floor, and he has great timing blocking shots. His per-40 stats were off the charts for us last season. The physicality of the U Sports level will be a challenge, but I think he’ll be up to it. We’re looking for big things from him.”

Willemsen, a Tsawwassen native, spent the past two years with the Lane Titans, a powerhouse U.S. junior college program. As a sophomore, he averaged 9.9 points while shooting a scorching 42.9 per cent from beyond the arc on a high volume of attempts (6.2 per game).

During his prep career, Willemsen was selected to the B.C. 4A all-star team in 2018 as a senior, and was part of Team B.C. at the Canada Summer Games.

“Jake was top-10 in the NWAC (Northwest Athletic Conference) in three-point shooting percentage, and at a high volume, so he can really shoot it,” Enevoldson noted. “Shooting was something we needed to address, and that’s what he can do for us. He’s a bigger, stronger guard, and he’s got some good post-secondary experience. He played on a Lane team his first year that had four or five Division I prospects and a coach (Joe White) who went on to Idaho State. Then last season, he shot the heck out of it and averaged close to double figures. We think he can help us from Day 1, and we’re looking for him to make an immediate impact.”

The decision on whether or not there will be U Sports basketball in January will be made by Oct. 8.

324,"CALGARY -- The team at the Common Crown Brewing Company in Calgary has pulled its Karen Cherry Sour and issued an apology after concerns were raised regarding the beer's name.

The Calgary brewery released its first sour beer this month as a celebration of 'Karen', the internet-coined name given to the stereotypical entitled, privileged white woman. The brewery's social media promotion of the beer used phrases that included 'Can we speak to a manager?' and the depiction on the label was of a fair-skinned woman with the crown of the Common Crown Brewing logo resting on her head.

The misguided attempt to be humorous drew swift criticism on social media as the name appeared to exonerate the actions of a select group who have stood in opposition to the Black Lives Matter movement.

On Friday, Common Crown announced its decision to remove the beer from store shelves and issued the following apology:

We wish to thank those who reached out and brought to our attention the error we have made in our recent release. We realize that our intent of the Karen label is insignificant at this juncture. Unfortunately, The Karen Cherry Sour missed the mark, and we promise to do better. Being tone deaf to racial developments is not an excuse, and we will work harder to stay informed and up to date on escalating situations. Thank you to those who sought to educate and inform us, and help us to recognize our error. We read through all of your comments and messages as a team. Moving forward, we will be working to do better, educate ourselves and collaborate with communities who support inclusion and diversity.

The Karen Cherry Sour has been pulled from shelves and is no longer available for sale. While this is just a small step in understanding our wrong, we are committed to moving forward and doing better.

Thank you.

CTV News reached out to the owner of Common Crown Brewing Co., Damon Moreau, for comment on the situation and he said the decision on the product name was made as a result of a team effort and the entire team apologizes for the mistake.

""We recognize the issue and the error,"" he said.

A majority of the product line was pre-sold and scheduled for delivery Friday, but Moreau says that's no longer happening. He says he's spoken with the company's licence holders that would have received the shipments and they have expressed their understanding of the situation.","Calgary brewery pulls Karen Cherry Sour beer recognizing entitled, privileged white women",3,0.551204754915506

In a statement, the team said it takes issues of employee conduct seriously and added, ""While we do not speak to specific employee situations publicly, when new allegations of conduct are brought forward that are contrary to these policies, we address them promptly.""

Meanwhile, three members of the front office are no longer with the organization, and owner Dan Snyder hired a District of Columbia law firm to review the club's culture, policies and allegations of workplace misconduct.

328,"EDMONTON—The Edmonton Oilers returned to the ice Monday, but not before taking time to remember and pay tribute to teammate Colby Cave, who died in April after suffering a brain bleed. “It’s the first time we’ve all been together in a big group since Colby passed. Obviously those emotions are still fresh,” team captain Connor McDavid told reporters on a Zoom call after practice at Rogers Place. “It makes it even more real now that we’re all together and he’s not able to join us. “He’s obviously going to be in our thoughts and in our hearts as we go forward.” Cave, from Battleford, Sask., died April 11 in a Toronto hospital while in a medically induced coma following surgery to remove a colloid cyst that was causing pressure on his brain. He played 67 career NHL games for the Boston Bruins and the Edmonton Oilers. The centre was called up for 11 games by the Oilers last season. When the Oilers skated out before for their first official return to play practice, the scoreboard above centre ice displayed a picture of Cave in his orange Oiler uniform high-fiving fans beside the message “We Skate for Colby.” Head coach Dave Tippett said the team held a meeting about Cave’s death prior to practice. “Colby was an unbelievable young man, great teammate. Obviously a friend to everybody in our locker room,” said Tippett. “He would be with us today if he hadn’t passed. He planned to be with our group (for the upcoming Stanley Cup tournament). “He’s with us in spirit.” The COVID-19 virus kept Cave’s wife Emily from his bedside and continues to cast a long shadow over the NHL as it prepares to finish the season with 24 teams playing in isolation in two hub cities: Edmonton and Toronto. Players are allowed to opt out without sanction. Oiler defenceman Mike Green has already announced he will sit out, citing personal family health reasons. Asked about it, Tippett said, “(The decision) didn’t catch me off guard. “(Green) was really struggling with the decision, but he decided that for personal reasons with his family it was the best situation for him, and you have to respect that. “This is unprecedented times. You’ve got to allow for flexibility.” The first day of camp saw Ryan Nugent-Hopkins playing on a wing with Connor McDavid and Zack Kassian. The Oilers open the best-of-five qualifying round Aug. 1 vs. the Chicago Blackhawks. Their fortunes will rise or fall with McDavid and Leon Draisaitl, who was crowned the regular season scoring champ after the season was suspended March 12, around the 70-game mark. Nugent-Hopkins said while on hiatus he used some weights from his brother, did some roller blading and then began skating once the smaller rinks opened up in British Columbia. The tournament will be a whirlwind, sometimes with three games a day in each of the hub cities with no fans cheering them on. Nugent-Hopkins said there won’t be any home ice advantage. “We know it’s going to be intense,” he said. “There’s going to be a lot of energy. Without the fans we’ll have to find ways to create our own energy.” Kassian said the practices are critical because there is very little runway before the games resume. “There’s no team that’s ahead of any other team in this thing.

Nick Taylor, also of Abbotsford, was in a group of four golfers two shots behind back at 5 under, while Roger Sloan of Merritt, B.C., shot a 4-under 68 Thursday. He is in an 11-way tie for seventh place. Taylor is playing in his first tournament on tour since the PGA restarted last month during the COVID-19 pandemic. Hadwin, who shot his eighth consecutive round in the 60s, is coming off a tie for fourth last week at the Rocket Mortgage Classic in Detroit. Mackenzie Hughes of Dundas, Ont., shot 2-under 70, while David Hearn of Brantford carded a 71. Hadwin bogeyed his first hole before reeling off seven birdies. “Even the first two weeks back, I felt like I played some pretty decent golf. I just kind of made some rusty mistakes,” Hadwin said. “I’d hit a ball out of bounds or in the water where I shouldn’t have or maybe try to get too much out of a shot, whereas I think last week it kind of came together. I was doing a lot of the similar things, but I didn’t make any of the mistakes. I felt like there were times last week where I probably could have gotten a few more shots, but I really didn’t have any risk. It was kind of a free-flowing easy-type round and just not a lot of stress. When you can do that through multiple weeks, it helps a lot.” Taylor took time off as the tour restarted to be with his eight-month-old son. “Obviously the break was great timing for a lot of reasons ... Have a bit of a cushion, take some more time off, I just really enjoyed being home, so just waiting an extra few weeks, (it) was great to be home,” Taylor said. “Yeah, I’m excited to get back out here and play, but it was nice to be home.” Correction - July 10, 2020: This article was edited from a previous version that mistakenly said Adam Hadwin posted the highest score among Canadian golfers with a 6-under 66.

TORONTO - Two-time Olympic gold medallist Rosie MacLennan battled body-image issues as a teenager.

But the 31-year-old from Toronto stuck with her sport of trampoline, beating odds that, according to a recent report by Canadian Women & Sport, see one in three Canadian girls drop out of sports during adolescence.

“It was through sports that I went through phases where body image was a challenge, but it was also through sport that I learned to value what my body was able to do for me in that, even though it wasn't necessarily the same as my competitor, it was part of my strength,” MacLennan said.

Canadian Women & Sport, in partnership with Canadian Tire Jumpstart Charities, released The Rally Report on Thursday, the first national study in four years on sport participation for girls aged six to 18.

The results were bleak. And at this rate, Canada won't see parity between girls and boys for at least the next 15 years.

The study found participation levels for Canadian girls are much lower than boys, and there is a dramatic dropout rate with one in three girls leaving sport by late adolescence - a number that has barely budged since the 2016 report, according to Allison Sandmeyer-Graves, the CEO of Canadian Women & Sport.

By comparison, the dropout rate for teenage boys - aged 16-18 - is only one in 10.

“That is saddening to see, because, particularly for girls, whether it's at a recreational level or competitive level, there's a ton of skills and value that sport can bring with respect to leadership and resilience, a lot of skills that you would can take off the field of play into other aspects of your life like education and careers.”

“And (sport) can be a valuable tool . . . whether it's physical health or mental health or social health, there's a lot of conversations that you can bridge through sport and activity, if you have the proper mechanisms in place.”

The federal government set a target last year of achieving gender equity at all levels of sport by 2035. Canada isn't on track to hit that target, said Sandmeyer-Graves.

“I remember at the time, it was like '2035, gosh, that's so far away,”' she said. “But when you are talking about something that is as systemic as this, that has so many different components to it, 2035 is going to be here before we know it.”

While Canadians in general are living less active lifestyles, Sandmeyer-Graves said, the numbers are particularly alarming for females. Currently, as many as 62 per cent of Canadian girls aren't participating in sport.

In 1992, just over half of women aged 15 or older were participating in sport. That dropped to 35 per cent by 2010. Only 18 per cent of women age 16-63 are currently involved in sport.

Among the barriers that affected girls' continuation in sport, one in three listed low confidence, negative body image, perceived lack of skill, or poor perceptions of belonging and feeling unwelcome.

“Many of barriers to participation (boys and girls) face would be quite similar,” Sandmeyer-Graves said. “But the fact that there is such a gender difference (in dropout rates) really underscores the fact that we need to pay particular attention to how we're designing and delivering sports for girls and for young women.”

MacLennan said she was fortunate to grow up in an active family. She was encouraged to try a variety of sports.

“So from a young age, building out those fundamental skills, but also exposing me to sports that I wouldn't necessarily have the chance to do in school, and so kind of giving me the chance to explore and find something that I really connected with and became passionate about,” MacLennan said. “Put me on a field with a soccer ball, and I'm not particularly strong. But put me in the air and I'm a lot more comfortable.”

Girls who aren't introduced to sports at a young age are far less likely to be physically active as adults.

“If you are exposing kids at a younger age to those fundamental skills, I think that they become more comfortable and confident with a lot of different movement patterns,” MacLennan said. “And then try to introduce them to as many activities as possible, whether it's through watching the Olympic Games and the variety of sports there, or local programming, that can be really important too.”

The study found differences in participation based on different ethnicities and religions, physical abilities, and socio- economic statuses as well. Caucasian, South Asian, Asian and Black girls are more likely to participate in sports than Indigenous girls. And girls from households with an annual income of over $100,000 are more likely to participate than households under $50,000.

Women are still under-represented in coaching ranks. Just 24 per cent of head coaches of women's teams in Canadian universities and colleges are women. Just 18 per cent of head coaches of mixed teams are women.

Some of Canada's biggest sports stars - Brooke Henderson, Bianca Andreescu and Kia Nurse to name just three - are women. Women captured 16 of Canada's 22 medals at the 2016 Rio Olympics.

Sandmeyer-Graves said there is reason for optimism.

“Anecdotally there's more attention being paid to women's sports,” she said. “Government commitments obviously have been quite strong over the last while. There are lots of initiatives happening in sports all across the country. People are reviewing their policies, we are seeing improvements at least at the national level of more women on the boards. So there are things happening. They might just not be translating yet into these large statistical analyses,” she said.

She hopes the Rally Report's takeaway for people already working on achieving gender equity is to keep going. And for those who haven't started paying attention, “there's no time like the present.”

“We need to start if we're going to see the kind of change we want to see frankly - I don't know at this point - within a few generations if we're lucky,” she said. “There's stuff happening, and we don't want the big numbers to obscure that fact. It's just not happening at scale, and it's not enough to turn this ship yet.”

The Rally Report: Encouraging Action to Improve Sport for Women and Girls was conducted with IMI International, and collected data from over 10,000 Canadians aged 13 to 63.

The game, called EndeavorRx, requires a prescription and is designed for children ages 8 to 12 with certain symptoms of ADHD.

It's the first time the FDA has cleared a digital therapy for improving ADHD symptoms, and the first time the agency has ever authorized marketing of a game-based therapy for any condition.

The FDA says it looked at data from multiple studies in more than 600 children. A video of the game shows a character travelling a racecourse-like path in a hover board.

335,"NEW YORK -- Ottawa Senators forward Bobby Ryan, Philadelphia Flyers forward Oskar Lindblom and Dallas Stars defenceman Stephen Johns are the finalists for the 2020 Bill Masterton Trophy.

The award is given out annually to the player who best exemplifies the qualities of perseverance, sportsmanship and dedication to ice hockey.

Ryan entered the NHL/NHL Players' Assistance program on Nov. 20 to get help for alcohol addiction. After going public with his story in an effort to help others with addiction issues, an emotional Ryan returned to the ice Feb. 27 and scored three times in a 5-2 win over visiting Vancouver.

""My journey started in November, but the process of getting there began a long time before that,"" Ryan said Thursday on a videoconference. ""Wasn't healthy, wasn't doing the right things for myself and wasn't treating a lot of things that were left unchecked by myself, my group around me for a long period of time.

""Once I started to identify those things, the sobriety part of it was the easy part. It's about having conversations now and letting go of some things that have hindered me for a very, very long period of time that I put away and tried to get away from with alcohol with avoidance, with whatever it might have been.""

Ryan said he still has tough days, but that the down times are farther apart.

""I feel like I'm in a much better place than I've ever been in my life,"" he said. ""And that only comes with doing the work. I've been doing that and feel good.""

Johns missed all of last season and the first 47 games of this one with painful headaches due to post-concussion syndrome. He scored four games into his return on Feb. 3 against the Rangers, with his parents in attendance at Madison Square Garden.

""My journey was a long one. Throughout the first five or six months, I was doing anything I could possibly to get back on the ice as soon as possible,"" Johns said. ""I never in my wildest dreams (thought) it would take 22 months to fulfil that. But I think about a year in I started to lose a lot of hope because every doctor I was going to see or every specialist I was going to see they were telling me one thing and then the other was telling me a different thing. A handful of them told me that they would probably never tell me to play hockey again.

""I leaned on my support system a lot, probably too much at times. But that was probably the biggest thing that helped me get through.""

Lindblom was diagnosed in December with Ewing's sarcoma, a cancerous tumour that grows in the bones or in the tissue around bones. He completed radiation treatments on July 2.

The rising star had 11 goals and 18 points in 30 games this season. While he has recently skated at the Flyers' complex in Voorhees, New Jersey, he has been ruled out of playing when the NHL season resumes.

""It's incredible what he's been through,"" Johns said of Lindblom, who wasn't on the call because he underwent a procedure as part of his recovery.

""Very different from our situations. It was a story that we you know, everybody NHL was following. It's just incredible to see how well he's doing.""

337,"BARCELONA, SPAIN -- After seeing Barcelona's Spanish league title defence come to a disappointing and meek end, Lionel Messi didn't hold back.

Messi blasted his team for being ""weak"" after Real Madrid wrested the league title away from Barcelona for the first time in three years on Thursday, and said it must quickly change course to have a chance at winning the Champions League.

Real Madrid clinched the title by beating Villarreal 2-1 but would have lifted the trophy regardless of that result after Barcelona slumped to a 2-1 loss to an Osasuna side that finished with 10 men.

""This game represents the entire year. We have been an erratic and weak team,"" Messi said in a rare TV interview just after the final whistle sounded at an empty Camp Nou. ""Madrid did its part by winning all its matches, which is impressive, but we also helped them to win this league. We have to be critical of how we have played, starting with the players, and the rest of the club.""

Barcelona led the league by two points over Madrid when the league was stopped in mid-March for three months while Spain's reined in its coronavirus outbreak.

Madrid returned to the competition motivated and in shape, reeling off 10 straight wins.

Barcelona looked flat, drew three matches to lose the lead, and on Thursday hit a new low when it lost its first home match since November 2018.

""The feeling on this team is that it tries, but that it cannot get the job done,"" Messi said. ""Today in the first half they were better than we were and it seems we have to fall behind to react like we tried to do in the second half.""

Messi scored his league-leading 23rd goal from a free kick in the second half to cancel out Jose Arnaiz's opener.

And Barcelona got a man advantage when the visitors lost substitute Enric Gallego to a straight red card for bloodying the mouth of Clement Lenglet with an elbow to the face in the 77th.

But Osasuna's Roberto Torres scored in stoppage time with Barcelona pushing forward searching for a late goal.

""I said it some time ago, that playing like this we had no chance of winning the Champions League, and it turns out we didn't even have enough to win la Liga,"" Messi said. ""We need to take a breather, let some air in, and clean out minds of all that has happened since December.""

Barcelona must regroup for the second leg of its Champions League round-of-16 match against Napoli on Aug. 8. The first leg finished 1-1 in Italy.

341,"Many players said it’s been the longest they’ve gone without playing

Toronto Raptors head coach Nick Nurse directs play from courtside during first half NBA basketball action against the Brooklyn Nets, in Toronto, Saturday, Feb. 8, 2020. Nurse wasn’t sure to expect from his players after nearly four months off, but the Toronto Raptors coach said they “look fantastic,” particularly the “chiseled Marc” Gasol. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Frank Gunn

In the more than three months since the Toronto Raptors stepped off the court, the players have been scattered abroad.

Besides regular weight checks and virtual workouts, it’s been on them to stay in shape in less than ideal conditions. In these unprecedented times, many players said it’s been the longest they’ve gone without playing.

Coach Nick Nurse — who had noticed a few weeks ago how fit Marc Gasol appeared on team Zoom calls — still didn’t know what to expect when his team convened last week in Naples, Fla., to hopefully resume their quest for a second consecutive NBA championship.

“Players look fantastic, I mean absolutely,” Nurse said on a conference call Tuesday. “When you see them with the eyeball test they look great.

“I came in here open-minded. I didn’t know if we were going to be not really in the right frame of mind or whatever… But I am pleasantly surprised with the frame of mind, I am pleasantly surprised with the conditioning, and I just think you have a bunch of guys who have a high care factor.

“They love to play, they’re concerned about getting better individually, about their own careers, it just seems like they are doing a really professional job. I just think there is a strong love of the game there for a lot of these guys.”

Gasol, who missed 28 games this season with a hamstring injury, and veteran guard Kyle Lowry have looked noticeably leaner in recent photos circulating on social media.

“The chiselled Marc. Cut up. He looks great,” Nurse said of the big Spaniard.

Nurse said as highly as he already thinks of the cerebral Gasol, his improved fitness is motivating for Raptors teammates, might get him a few more rebounds a night and could give his legs more life down the stretch of games.

“If his conditioning improves him as a player it’s going to be a super added bonus for us,” Nurse said.

Raptors guard/forward Norm Powell called the physical change in Gasol ”drastic.”

“I make fun of him all the time, looking like a soccer player in Barcelona,” Powell laughed. ”He looks great, man, he’s moving great, he’s feeling great.”

Powell and Gasol have a tennis match scheduled for the next couple of days.

“Hopefully I’ll still be able to give him a run for his money,” Powell said.

Because of Canada’s requirement of a 14-day quarantine period for people entering the country, the Raptors were the first team to arrive in Florida ahead of next month’s restart at Disney World.

Despite the Raptors’ positive mindset, Powell said there was some trepidation travelling to Florida, which has seen a startling surge in COVID-19 cases. The more than 6,000 new cases reported Tuesday pushed the total over 150,000 in the Sunshine State. Deaths have climbed past 3,500.

More than 8,500 new cases were recorded on three consecutive days late last week.

The NBA announced last week that 16 players had tested positive for the coronavirus. ESPN reported Tuesday that the Nuggets had closed their practice facility after positive tests within Denver’s group travelling to Orlando.

Brooklyn’s Spencer Dinwiddie and DeAndre Jordan have also tested positive. Jordan won’t be with the team when it resumes play while Dinwiddie is still experiencing symptoms, so his status is uncertain.

Powell said he’s not particularly concerned about his well-being or that of his teammates, because the Raptors are following coronavirus safety guidelines “to a T.”

“I’m concerned about it just from a general standpoint of numbers increasing,” Powell said. “Outside (the NBA’s planned quasi-bubble), I’m very concerned about just how dangerous it is. I’m more concerned about my family members that are out, having to deal with going out in public, going back to work and putting themselves in danger of catching the virus.”

A week into what could be three months in Florida, Nurse said the Raptors have managed to stave off homesickness and boredom.

“The first week has gone by in a snap of a finger. That’s a really good sign,” he said.

The coaches are up early, and spend all day in the gym, with players arriving in staggered groups of four to practise — one player and two coaches per net.

“The days go by pretty quickly, we’re trying to mix in some days off, we’re trying to mix in a lot of different activities,” he said.

The team had a barbecue recently. They play ping-pong and pool.

“There are a few other things we’re trying to mix in, too. I don’t really sense much anxiety or people worrying about, ‘Man, this is going to be a long time,’” he said. “They seem really good. You can ask me that again in a month if you want. I’ve said that a lot, how much I’ve missed coaching these guys. I just sense that these guys like being around each other and like to play.”

The Raptors were 46-18 and second in the East when the league shuttered on March 11. They tip off the restart on Aug. 1 versus the Los Angeles Lakers, and face among the toughest eight-game seeding schedule of the 22 teams that will be in Orlando.

“I like the schedule, I think it’s great to see the Lakers again, (No. 1) Milwaukee again, just to get a feel for them again,” he said. “We’re playing really quality teams, I think every team we’ve got is a playoff team, so that’s going to be obviously those are good teams, so I like it.”

The NHL says 35 total players have tested positive for the novel coronavirus over roughly the past month.

The NHL says 35 players have tested positive for the novel coronavirus over roughly the past month.

The league says 23 of 396 players checked for COVID-19 at team facilities have tested positive since voluntary Phase 2 workouts began June 8 — a rate of just under six per cent. In that same time period, the NHL added it is aware of 12 additional positive test results.

That’s an increase of eight players in Phase 2, and one from outside the NHL’s testing system, over the last week.

The NHL says it has administered more than 2,900 tests at team facilities.

READ MORE: NHL says 26 players have tested positive for COVID-19 since June 8

Ten additional players were confirmed to have tested positive in the spring — five from the Ottawa Senators, three from the Colorado Avalanche and one each from the Pittsburgh Penguins and Boston Bruins. That brings the total number of NHLers with confirmed positive tests to 45 since the schedule was suspended in mid-March.

The league is no longer providing details on the players or clubs with positive tests. There was no word on the health status of the 35 players in question, including whether or not they experienced symptoms or have recovered.

“All players who have tested positive have been self-isolated and are following (government) protocols,” the NHL said in a statement released on Twitter.

The league and NHL Players’ Association on Sunday night agreed on protocols to start training camps and resume the season. That includes daily testing once games get under way for players, coaches and staff.

Resuming is contingent on each side approving an extension of the collective bargaining agreement and the return-to-play protocol.

The Canadian Elite Basketball League will be the first professional sports league to return to action in Canada, with games occurring later this month.

The stage has also been set for the Abbotsford-based Fraser Valley Bandits, as the league released its Summer Series schedule earlier this week.

Games tip-off in St. Catharines, Ont. starting on July 25, with the Bandits opening the six-game initial round robin against the Edmonton Stingers on July 26 at 1 p.m. local time.

The Bandits schedule then sees the club challenge the Saskatchewan Rattlers on July 28 at 4:30 p.m., the expansion Ottawa Blackjacks on July 30 at 4 p.m., the Hamilton Honey Badgers on Aug. 1 at 10:30 a.m., the Niagara River Lions on Aug. 2 at 1 p.m. and then finish with the Guelph Nighthawks on Aug. 5 at 2 p.m.

The CEBL team with the worst record will then be eliminated and and a six-team playoff will begin. The top two teams will receive byes, with the third ranked team taking on sixth and four and five squaring off. The CEBL championship game is set for Aug. 9.

Games will not be played in front of fans and teams will be separated from the general public with screening and COVID-19 protocols under the supervision of medical officials in place. Health and safety measures will be maintained for the participants, including social distancing and other specialized practices designed to limit interactions amongst participants.

A handful of games will be broadcast on CBC television, with the Bandits lone TV appearance occurring on Aug. 1 against Hamilton. All other games can be viewed on the CBC Gem streaming service.

“We are excited to bring live sports back to audiences in local communities across the country, who are just as hungry for the return to play as we are,” stated Chris Wilson, Executive Director, Sports & Olympics, CBC. “Our partners at the CEBL have come up with a plan that not only adheres to health and safety restrictions, but takes the competition to the next level. The condensed season means each game means that much more, and we are thrilled to be able to provide a national stage for these athletes and the league. This tournament will be exciting summer entertainment for Canadians at just the right time.”

The 2020 CEBL season has been on delay since mid-April with its originally scheduled tipoff date of May 7. Each club had been scheduled to play a 20-game schedule leading to a final four CEBL Championship Weekend in Edmonton, August 14 to 16.

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File)

The NHL’s plan appears robust and detailed.

Once players enter so-called “bubbles” in two hub cities later this month as part of the league’s blueprint to resuscitate its pandemic-halted season, teams should — at least in theory — be fairly well-protected from the threat of COVID-19.

A 28-page document released earlier this week outlines a grocery list of health and safety measures where no stones seem left unturned, including mandatory daily testing and the wearing of masks whenever possible, all the way down to banning high-fives and advising against talking in elevators.

Getting to the bubbles largely unscathed by the coronavirus, however, could be the biggest challenge of all.

There will be strict rules once the 24 clubs set to compete in the league’s return-to-play plan head to the hubs and are quarantined from the general public — Toronto and Edmonton are the expected destinations — but players will be free to come and go as they please during training camps slated to begin early next week.

And while the league touched on the need to be prudent with regards to physical distancing outside team activities during camps in a separate document, it’s potentially a soft underbelly players, coaches and executives know could pose a risk.

“The rink is the safe spot, it’s clean,” Calgary Flames general manager Brad Treliving said. ”You’ve got the protocol that really is enforceable.

“The recommendation and the messaging to the players is going to be, ‘You’ve got to keep that (personal circle) as tight as you can.’”

The NHL plans to test players every 48 hours during camps, and Penguins head coach Mike Sullivan said there have already been conversations amongst his group about the possible pitfalls of the next 2 1/2 weeks as the league looks to kickstart a campaign that was suspended in March as the coronavirus swept across North America.

“Exercise common sense,” Sullivan said. ”It’s to everyone’s benefit, whether it be our players or the public in general.”

Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease specialist at Toronto General Hospital, said that message will be crucial for the league during this upcoming period of vulnerability.

“You’re not in a bubble, and players, just like everyone else in the world, are susceptible to this infection,” he said. “People have to be very careful to avoid going out and mingling with others in the world around them.”

While the virus is relatively under control in Canada, the explosion of cases south of the border, including hot spots like Florida, Texas and Arizona, represent a red flag. Of the 24 franchises tabbed for the restart, 18 are located in the United States and won’t head north until the end of the month.

“I’m not going to put words in anyone’s mouth,” Bogoch added. ”But you can be sure teams will be reading the riot act to their players on the importance of ensuring they stay safe and healthy.”

Canucks defenceman Quinn Hughes has been holed up in a Vancouver hotel since arriving back in Canada from the U.S. in late June as part of the cohort quarantine plan approved by health officials. He’s able to skate with a few teammates, but has otherwise mostly been confined to his room and is looking forward to a level of freedom.

“At a certain point we’re going to have to live our lives and we’re going to have to go to the restaurants and do these things,” he said. ”But I think you can be calculated and smart staying away from people and doing the best you can wearing a mask and washing your hands.”

And although British Columbia has been commended for its response and control of the virus, risks remain just like anywhere else.

“It’s on the players,” Hughes added. ”The players have to be responsible.”

Montreal Canadiens head coach Claude Julien, who’s 60 years old and in a high-risk age group for COVID-19, said his team will do whatever it can to assist players during camp, including getting groceries delivered.

“They’re taking this very seriously,” he said. ”They know the danger of it for them, for their teammates, for their families.

“We all have to do our jobs as far as being diligent.”

Of the 396 NHLers tested at team facilities between June 8 and Monday during small, voluntary workouts as part of Phase 2 protocols, 23 results — in the neighbourhood of six per cent — came back positive. The league said it’s also aware of 12 other positive tests for players not taking part in Phase 2.

Phase 3, which represents the start of camps, will see roughly 750 players report to team facilities next week, as long as the NHL’s return-to-play protocol and extension to the collective bargaining agreement are approved in the coming days.

That means nearly half of players set to compete had yet to be tested by the league as of earlier this week.

An outbreak within a team or teams could wreak havoc on the league’s return-to-play plans. Major League Soccer, which started its summer tournament this week, has seen both FC Dallas and Nashville SC pull out due to 20 combined cases of COVID-19.

Bogoch, who commended the NHL for its attention to detail inside what should be tightly-controlled bubbles, said even if every precaution is taken during camps, there’s a chance the virus will find a way through.

“You’re relying on people’s good judgment,” he said. “That might work out the vast majority of time, but it might not work out 100 per cent of the time.

“One case can certainly beget more cases.”

Exactly what the NHL is hoping to avoid.

347,"Teams and duos with trials berths already in hand will keep them

Curling Canada has been forced to re-think qualification for the Olympic team and mixed doubles trials after cancellations and postponements due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Teams and mixed doubles duos ultimately must win events or collect enough points at events to earn berths in the 2021 Tim Hortons Roar of the Rings and the national mixed doubles trials in early 2022.

The Roar of the Rings men’s and women’s champions and the victorious mixed doubles duo will represent Canada at the 2022 Olympic Games in Beijing.

The trimming of the Grand Slam of Curling from six events to two next season impacts teams’ opportunities to earn Olympic qualification points.

So Curling Canada declared the qualifying process on “hold” on Friday.

“The safety of our athletes is our prime consideration and we don’t want to put them under any kind of duress to be trying to participate in events to pursue qualifying points until we know they can do so safely,” Curling Canada high-performance director Gerry Peckham said in a statement.

“Until that time comes, we will look closely at the qualifying process and consult with our athletes to fine-tune the system to make sure it identifies Canada’s most deserving nine men’s and women’s four-player teams and 16 mixed doubles teams.”

Teams and duos with trials berths already in hand will keep them.

Teams skipped by John Epping, Brad Gushue, Rachel Homan and Kerri Einarson have qualified for the Roar of the Rings in Saskatoon from Nov. 27 to Dec. 5, 2021.

The pairings of Jennifer Jones and Brent Laing, and Jocelyn Peterman and Brett Gallant own berths in the mixed doubles trials Jan. 3-6, 2022, in a city yet to be named.

Given the gravity of the new coronavirus pandemic and the abrupt decision to place the NHL season on pause in March, it didn’t take commissioner Gary Bettman and union chief Don Fehr long to realize they were going to have to work together if play was to resume any time soon.

Nearly four months to the day since the last puck dropped, the two sides put aside past differences to have a return-to-play plan in place, and the assurance of labour peace through September 2026 to go with it.

“When we got to March 12 and decided to take the pause, that began a period of perhaps unprecedented collaboration and problem solving,” Bettman said during a Zoom conference call with reporters Saturday, a day after the league and players ratified a 24-team expanded playoff, set to begin Aug. 1, and a four-year extension of the collective bargaining agreement.

“It was a recognition by both sides that we were being confronted with an incredibly difficult, a novel, unprecedented situation. I believed we would get to this point because it was the right thing to do for the game and for everybody involved in the game.”

Fehr, the NHL Players’ Association executive director, not only agreed with Bettman, but went out of his way to credit the owners for the approach.

“I was persuaded well before the end of March that not only was this different, but it was being approached in a fundamentally different way. I always thought we would find a way to reach an agreement,” Fehr said.

The bond established between the two was apparent during the 55-minute session, with Fehr agreeing with Bettman and then acknowledging how unusual that was by by saying: “I think that indicates something about the approach that was taken in these talks.”

Training camps are set to open Monday, which also represents the deadline for players to determine whether to opt out without penalty. If all goes as planned, teams will depart for their two respective hub cities, Toronto and Edmonton, Alberta, on July 26 to open a two-month playoff leading to the awarding of the Stanley Cup.

Many uncertainties remain, with Bettman and Fehr unable to provide definitive answers.

While acknowledging the likelihood of players testing positive for COVID-19, deputy commissioner Bill Daly was unable to say how many players would have to do so for the league to postpone or cancel the playoffs altogether.

Though conference playoffs and Stanley Cup Final are scheduled to be held in Edmonton, a person with direct knowledge of the plans told The Associated Press the site might change if the pandemic spikes in Alberta’s capital. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because it is an alternate plan that’s not been discussed publicly.

Bettman and Daly, who are based in New York, weren’t even sure if or when they could cross the border to personally attend games because those entering Canada are required to self-isolate for a 14-day period.

The only certainty is the NHL became North America’s latest professional sport to forge a path back to playing, but minus the public hiccups experienced by its counterparts.

Major League Baseball’s season was nearly scuttled before the two sides agreed to a 60-game format. Less than three weeks before NFL training camps are set to open, the league is experiencing push-back from its players on whether to play preseason games next month. Major League Soccer has had two teams already withdrawing from competition because of the number of players testing positive for the coronavirus.

And not only is hockey on the verge of returning, the CBA extension assures 12 straight years of labour peace, the NHL’s longest stretch since Bettman took over in 1993. During that time, play has been halted three times by lockouts, the last in 2012-13, when the season was shortened to 48 games.

“I think Don and I both recognize labour peace was something we couldn’t even quantify how important it was,” Bettman said. “But we both knew that for the business of the game to come back strong, there was enough disruption going on in the world that we didn’t have to add to it.”

Fehr said the months-long talks to reach a solution were a matter of perseverance.

“This is a very bad analogy, but you have to sort of navigate the kayak in a storm until the storm’s over, and then make sure the kayak isn’t full of holes so that you can go on and sail it in calmer seas,” Fehr said in a separate interview with The AP. “Or to put it another way there was never any pretense that this was business as usual.”

Owners benefit because they can generate much-needed revenue through sponsorships and advertising, even though games will be played in empty arenas.

Though players will likely lose a portion of their salaries for seasons to come to make up for 50-50 split of revenue, they benefit from a CBA that includes the possibility of returning to the Olympics, after the NHL opted out from the 2018 Winter Games in South Korea. The new labour agreement also addressed players’ demands to gain a post-career subsidy for health care.

Signs for the Washington Redskins are displayed outside FedEx Field in Landover, Md., Monday, July 13, 2020.

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh)

The Washington NFL franchise announced Monday it is dropping the “Redskins” name and Indian head logo, bowing to recent pressure from sponsors and decades of criticism that they are offensive to Native Americans.

A new name must still be selected for one of the oldest and most storied teams in the National Football League, and it was unclear how soon that will happen. But for now, arguably the most polarizing name in North American professional sports is gone at a time of reckoning over racial injustice, iconography and racism in the U.S.

The move came less than two weeks after owner Dan Snyder, a boyhood fan of the team who once declared he would never get rid of the name, launched a “thorough review” amid pressure from sponsors. FedEx, Nike, Pepsi and Bank of America all lined up against the name, which was given to the franchise in 1933 when the team was still based in Boston.

The team said it is “retiring” the name and logo and that Snyder and coach Ron Rivera are working closely to develop a new moniker and design. The announcement came on the old letterhead with the Redskins name because the team technically retains it until a new one is chosen and approved.

Native American advocates and experts have long criticized the name they call a “dictionary-defined racial slur.” Over a dozen Native leaders and organizations wrote to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell last week demanding an immediate end to Washington’s use of the name. Goodell, who has fielded questions on the topic for years, said he supported the review.

Protests against the name predate Snyder buying the team in 1999, and, until now, he had shown no willingness to consider a change. Strong words from sponsors — including a company run by a minority stakeholder of the team — changed the equation.

FedEx earlier this month became the first sponsor to announce it had asked the organization to change the name, particularly important because CEO Frederick Smith owns part of the team. FedEx paid $205 million for the long-term naming rights to the team’s stadium in Landover, Maryland.

The lease at FedEx Field expires in 2027, and dropping the name keeps open various possibilities in Maryland, Virginia and Washington for the team’s new stadium and headquarters. District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser has said the name was an “obstacle” to Snyder building on the old RFK Stadium site, which is believed to be his preference.

The team recently started cutting ties with racist founder George Preston Marshall, removing his name from the Ring of Fame and renaming the lower bowl at FedEx Field for the team’s first Black player, late Hall of Famer Bobby Mitchell. Marshall, who renamed the Boston Braves the Redskins in 1933 and moved the team to D.C. four years later, was a segregationist and the last NFL owner to integrate his team. The current logo shows the profile of a red-faced Native American with feathers in his hair.

Major League Baseball’s Atlanta Braves and the National Hockey League’s Chicago Blackhawks have said they have no inclination to change their names. Some advocates would like to see all Native American names, mascots and imagery out of sports.

Long removed from the glory days of winning Super Bowl titles in the 1982, 1987 and 1991 seasons under coach Joe Gibbs, Washington’s NFL team has just five playoff appearances in 21 years and no postseason victories since 2005. The team has lacked a nationally marketable player since Robert Griffin III’s short-lived stardom, and the 2020 schedule features zero prime-time games for a franchise that used to be a draw.

Re-branding with a new name and logo — and perhaps the same burgundy and gold colours — coupled with turning football operations over to Rivera could be a boon for Snyder on and off the field. Even if a segment of the fan base opposes the change in the name of tradition, winning would more than make up for those losses.

Oilers fans pack the square during the Edmonton Oilers’ Orange Crush community rally in Sir Winston Churchill Square in Edmonton on Thursday, April 20, 2017. Hockey fans in Canadian cities with NHL teams have a reputation for expressing their exhuberance in the streets during the playoffs, and some admit the temptation to ignore physical-distancing guidlines may prove too great as the pandemic-postponed season resumes next month. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Codie McLachlan

As hockey fans gear up for a truncated season to begin next month, some in Canada’s two “hub cities” say the temptation to celebrate — and flout physical distancing guidelines — may prove too great.

“I can’t say no to a good time,” said Edmonton Oilers fan Jeet Jermana. “I’d be hard-pressed not to jump into a big party.”

On Friday, the NHL board of governors and NHL Players’ Association said they had ratified the return-to-play plan, paving the way for the league to resume its pandemic-hit season later this summer.

Toronto and Edmonton were also officially unveiled as hub cities where all games will be played, beginning Aug. 1. Training camps start Monday in the 24 cities with teams still in the running for the Stanley Cup, including six in Canada.

In 2017, when the Oilers nearly advanced to the Western Conference final, Jermana was among the thousands of fans who partied in Ford Hall at Rogers Place arena and in bars along the popular Whyte Avenue district.

But with COVID-19 this year, where teams will play in empty arenas, Jermana said he’ll likely watch more games at home, maybe with just a few friends.

That is, he said, until the Oilers advance and he and other fans won’t be able to resist going out.

“Once it becomes the ‘real playoffs’ I think more and more the momentum will grab,” he said.

Matt Black of Hotel X Toronto, located west of the city centre where multiple media outlets have reported that several teams will be based, said the prospect of any accommodation for celebratory fan gatherings, even outdoors, seems unlikely.

Nevertheless, Black said he expects citywide excitement will be palpable, even with empty arenas.

“You look back to those scenes of Jurassic Park and Maple Leaf Square and all of that … it would be great for people to be able to get together again but you just need to make sure that you’re doing it in a safe manner,” said Black.

The players themselves aren’t to have any contact with the general public.

Dr. Vinita Dubey, Toronto’s associate medical health officer, said in an emailed statement that players and staff arriving from abroad will also have to serve a modified 14-day quarantine as well as undergo rigorous screening and daily testing protocols, wear masks in indoor settings, physically distance and wash hands often.

An Edmonton police spokesperson said the service wouldn’t be able to comment over the weekend on what sorts of preparations they might make for crowds when the season resumes.

Geoff Grimble with the City of Edmonton said the city’s civic events management team would likely discuss the issue during a scheduled meeting on Monday.

“The City of Edmonton’s first priority is public safety and we’ll continue to follow the advice and requirements of the Chief Medical Officer of Health to ensure fans, players, coaches and staff remain healthy,” Grimble said.

Oilers fan Brendan McLeod admitted he may be lured to a street celebration when — not if — his team advances, but said he still wants to maintain physical distancing.

“We have to get through this together or else it’s not going to change,” said McLeod.

But Shadi Merhej, who said he enjoys both hockey and the Oilers, noted the sport doesn’t have quite as strong attraction for him in the summer.

“It’s daylight ‘til 11 o’clock. You don’t want to spend half your day watching hockey,” Merhej explained.

“I’d rather go for a bike ride, or rollerblade or golf.”

All seven Canadian Elite Basketball League teams, including Abbotsford’s Fraser Valley Bandits, have descended onto St. Catharines, Ont. this week to begin preparation for the Summer Series event, which runs from July 25 to Aug. 9.

It’s the first semblance of pro sports in Canada and in the COVID-19 era that means safety, precautions and testing.

Bandits management told The News they are bringing a total of 15 people to the tournament, which includes players, coaches and other staff. They stated that ordinarily that number is usually over 20, but medical support is being sourced from the St. Catharines region so the team is not bringing a doctor, athletic therapist or a physiotherapist.

It’s a similar case for the other six teams in the league, as Bandits management said it is a very exclusive list of essential people that will be arriving and participating in the tournament.

Bandits vice president Dylan Kular said the tournament came to be after much consultation with Ontario health officials.

“All of our plans have been subject to the measures put in place by provincial, federal, and local public health and government officials,” he said. “Without their blessing we cannot move forward. We have been fully compliant with every requirement and will continue to be. Public health officials have worked closely with us to put in place exceptionally detailed medical protocols designed to keep our players, coaches, staff, local public and tournament officials safe.”

Every player and staff member at the tournament was tested for COVID-19 on Monday (July 13) after arriving. The test involves inserting a six-inch long swab into the cavity between your nose and mouth for approximately 15 seconds and rotating it several times. The swab is then inserted into a container and sent to a lab for testing. Niagara health authorities will then analyze the findings.

Anyone being tested will remain self-isolated until they receive word that they have tested negative and after receiving a negative test the individual will be allowed to train or work in the approved areas. A positive test will force the person to immediately adhere to the rules and supervision of local health authorities.

All players and staff who had arrived from outside of Canada for the tournament have been quarantined for two weeks as per the federal policy.

Kular said that testing and screening will be ongoing throughout the tournament.

“There will be daily screening and frequent testing of all individuals participating in the Summer Series,” he said. “There will be exhaustive cleaning measures at all times and in all areas of the arena, training facility and hotel. Also, each team will have someone designated to monitor their social distancing practices to make sure they conform to the six-foot rule. People will wear masks unless they are involved in the actual game or practice session. If an individual shows symptoms of COVID then they are given to the Niagara region health authorities for testing and contact tracing. Prior to round robin games commencing there will be another test administered.”

Players who test positive during the tournament will be immediately removed and provided a course of action by local medical officials. The CEBL has also created three safe zones: the Meridian Centre (where games are being played), a local training facility and a nearby hotel that is not open to the public during the tournament. The names of the hotel and the training facility will not be made public by the league.

“There will be very tight restrictions around who can enter the parameters of where we will live and work for the four weeks,” Kular said.

The names of those testing positive will not be made public, but the league may reveal the amount of players or staff that tested positive.

359,"Vancouver side gives up 2-0 and 3-1 leads in wild tilt against San Jose

Vancouver Whitecaps players including Patrick Metcalfe (centre) work out in a gym in Lake Buena Vista, Fla. on Monday, July 13, 2020. Vancouver’s wait ended at the MLS is Back Tournament against the San Jose Earthquakes on July 15. Vancouver, the last team to see action, was originally slated to open July 9 against FC Dallas but the game was scrapped when Dallas withdrew due to a rash of COVID-19 positive tests. THE CANADIAN PRESS/HO-MLS Mandatory Credit

LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. — Substitute Shea Salinas scored in the 98th minute as the San Jose Earthquakes rallied from 2-0 and 3-1 deficits to defeat the Vancouver Whitecaps in a wild 4-3 win Wednesday at the MLS is Back Tournament.

Goals by substitute Chris Wondolowski, in the 72nd minute, and Oswaldo Alanis, in the 81st, tied the game at 3-3.

Vancouver was reeling during the nine minutes of stoppage time before Salinas administered the coup de grace. The former Whitecap dribbled through the Vancouver defence, got a fortunate bounce and knocked the ball past goalkeeper Maxime Crepeau.

The Earthquakes dominated possession and had eight corners in the first 30 minutes but found themselves down 2-0 to the opportunistic Whitecaps, who led by two despite having just one shot on target.

Ali Adnan and Cristian Dajome scored for Vancouver, which also benefited from an own goal.

Andy Rios also scored for San Jose, which had plenty of the ball but lacked clinical finishing most of the night against a depleted Whitecaps side. Still, Crepeau had a busy night.

Adnan, Vancouver’s Iraqi international left back, opened the scoring in the seventh minute, curling a shot past a diving Daniel Vega from just inside the penalty box.

Vancouver made it 2-0 in the 22nd minute on an own goal when Dajome, after a San Jose corner went horribly awry, stole the ball from Brazil’s Judson and fed Yordy Reyna behind the Quakes defence. Reyna tried to slip the ball back to Dajome in the box but instead it bounced off Judson’s leg into the goal.

San Jose came on in waves and Rios cut the lead to 2-1 in first-half stoppage time off the Quakes’ 12th corner of the half, deflecting the ball in with a delightful flick of his foot with his back to goal.

Dajome capitalized in the 59th minute when a dreadful pass from Vega went straight to David Milinkovic, who found the Colombian alone in front for his first MLS goal.

The 37-year-old Wondolowski made an impact off the bench, flicking in a header to cut the lead to 3-2. The goal was the 160th of his career, adding to his MLS-record regular-season total, and his 14th against Vancouver.

Alanis then rose high to score off San Jose’s 19th corner, which tied a league record, to tie the game.

The Quakes outshot Vancouver 31-7 and also led the Whitecaps 11-2 in shots on target. San Jose also set a league mark with 22 corners and had 67.9 per cent possession. The Whitecaps lived dangerously on defence but made the most of their few chances at the other end, helped by San Jose blunders.

Vancouver was the last team to see action at the tournament, taking the field at ESPN’s Wide World of Sports complex after Orlando City and Philadelphia had already qualified for the knockout rounds.

The Whitecaps were originally slated to open July 9 against FC Dallas but the game was scrapped when Dallas withdrew due to a rash of COVID-19 positive tests.

San Jose opened the tournament last Friday with a 0-0 tie with the Seattle Sounders.

It was 26 C at the 9 p.m. ET kickoff after showers swept through the area.

After Vancouver went ahead, Crepeau made a fine save in the ninth minute to deny Jackson Yueill. Crepeau then had to deal with a powerful Cristian Espinoza shot.

Crepeau had to be sharp again in the 26th minute, clawing away a looping long ball from Espinoza that was destined for the top corner. The Whitecaps ‘keeper was fortunate in the 41st minute when a deflection off a defender following a corner went right at him.

San Jose outshot Vancouver 17-4 in the first half and had 73.4 percent possession.

Espinoza was yellow-carded in the 56th minute when he returned the ball for Vancouver throw-in head-high, hitting Adnan who tumbled theatrically to the turf. The card remained yellow after video review.

The Whitecaps are missing some key pieces at the tournament.

Forwards Lucas Cavallini, Fredy Montero and Tosaint Ricketts, defender Andy Rose and defender/midfielder Georges Mukumbilwa did not make the trip to the Florida tournament for personal or medical reasons.

Cavallini, Ricketts and Rose all started in Vancouver’s last league outing — a 1-0 win at the Los Angeles Galaxy on March 7 — while Montero came off the bench.

Wednesday’s starting 11 came into the game with a combined 29 MLS regular-season goals with Reyna accounting for 19 of those.

Backup goalkeeper Bryan Meredith left the team Tuesday to be with his family in New Jersey after the death of his mother Beth. Whitecaps player wore black armbands with B.M. on them with fullback Jake Nerwinski walking out holding Meredith’s jersey with Beth Meredith’s name written under the number.

Janio Bikel (adductor strain), who started at right back against the Galaxy, and defender Eric Godoy (quadricep strain) were injured in training Sunday.

Whitecaps midfielder Leonard Owusu, 23, made his first start while centre back Ranko Veselinovic, 21, made his MLS debut.

Captain Russell Teibert made his 200th first-team appearance. Whitecaps midfielder Patrick Metcalfe, a 21-year-old from Richmond, made his MLS debut off the bench.

Vancouver plays Seattle on Sunday before facing Chicago, which replaced Dallas in Group B, on July 23.

Group games at the tournament count in the regular-season standings, leaving Vancouver at 1-2-0 and San Jose at 1-1-2.

363,"There were smiles on their faces as the Maple Leafs, with a jump in their strides, reformed in full — and more — for the first time since the NHL paused on March 12. Half of the 34 players on the first day of training camp worked out at 11 a.m. on the Marlies’ ice at the Ford Performance Centre, the other half about two hours later. In between, they played three mini-scrimmages. “It was a lot of fun,” said forward Mitch Marner. “You miss being around the guys. It was great to be back out there. You want to be back in the same room together, chirping each other.” There was hockey again. “Conditioning-wise, it wasn’t great,” said star centre Auston Matthews, who was off the ice for a couple of weeks after testing positive for COVID-19 in Arizona. “It was just great to be back here, back in Toronto, back with your teammates, doing what we all love.” There were some nifty goals by Marner and Ilya Mikheyev. Some nice saves by Frederik Anderson. A classic dipsy-do from Matthews. A shootout where William Nylander was the difference. And rookie Nick Robertson, wearing No. 89, undressed Jake Muzzin to create his own scoring chance. “He’s got that dogged mentality. He’s a hard-working kid,” Marner said of Robertson, the 18-year-old winger from the OHL’s Peterborough Petes who was the team’s second-round pick last year. “He’s not afraid to get in the dirty area. His shot’s pretty amazing. He was impressive to watch.” Sheldon Keefe had as healthy a lineup as he’s seen since taking over as head coach in November, with Mikheyev and Muzzin back from injuries. Andreas Johnsson (knee) remains out. Timothy Liljegren also missed practice, deemed unfit to play with no other information available. “Mikheyev looks excellent, and Muzzin as well,” said Keefe. “Those guys really haven’t had any time off. They continued to rehab their injuries and skated all the way through for the most part. It’s exciting to see them. Obviously we still miss Andreas. He’s an important piece of our team and we’re happy that he’s making progress toward a return. It was nice to see everybody else out there, otherwise.” Keefe said he designed the day to push the players’ conditioning. He expected things to get sloppy as the day went on. “We were trying to make the conditions difficult out there for the players,” said Keefe. “We had some important things we wanted to get accomplished in terms of our structure and our system. The parameters we set out — practising with just three lines, scrimmaging with just two lines — we wanted to make it difficult from a conditioning standpoint, so the overall pace of play went down as a result. That’s what I designed. They pushed through it.” They were tired at the end. “We’re all happy to be back at work,” said defenceman Morgan Rielly. “It’s a bit different in terms of some protocols, but as players we’re willing to do whatever it takes. The attitude is good. We’re excited to be back, to hang out together. “The main focus is to compete for a championship, but you’ve got to start somewhere.”",Frisky Leafs have an ice day after four-month wait,3,0.0644141933476613

TORONTO -- The Toronto Maple Leafs say they will not comment on reports that one of their star players has tested positive for COVID-19.

The Toronto Sun and The Toronto Star report that centre Auston Matthews has tested positive for the novel coronavirus.

The Leafs say a player's medical information in this regard is private.

The team says it is deferring to the NHL's policy on handling test results, with the league providing updates on testing totals and positive tests without disclosing the identities of affected clubs or players.

Judd Moldaver, Matthews's agent, did not respond to requests for comment from The Canadian Press.

According to the Sun, the 22-year-old Matthews has self-quarantined in his Arizona home and hopes to be ready to play if the NHL season resumes as planned next month.

Toronto goaltender Frederik Andersen stayed with Matthews in Arizona for the first stages of the COVID-19 pandemic but, according to the Toronto Sun, he tested negative for the novel coronavirus and is no longer in Arizona.

The NHL season is on pause due to the global pandemic.

Arizona has seen a recent spike in COVID-19 cases.

On Friday, the Arizona Department of Health Services reported 3,246 new positive cases of COVID-19, exceeding Thursday's single-day high of 2,519 cases.

The NHL hopes to open training camps next month, and finish off the 2019-20 season later this summer.

The league said Friday that it has tested more than 200 players at club facilities during voluntary training since June 8, with 11 testing positive.

Matthews had 47 goals and 33 assists in 70 games before the suspension of the season on March 12.

Toronto FC coach Greg Vanney, a good judge of his team, liked what he saw in training this week at the MLS is Back Tournament.

It helped that it rained Friday morning in Florida, making for cool conditions.

""We trained relatively light, did some things tactically and then the guys just had some fun,"" said Vanney. ""We did a finishing game. There was a lot of laughing, guys were relaxed a little bit and settled in.

""For me that was really kind of a great moment in an environment that at times can feel a little bit tense and obviously very sterile ... It was nice for guys to just kind of let their guard down for a little bit out on the soccer field and just enjoy themselves. Because that's what it's all about in many ways.

""So I feel good with where we're at. I think guys are getting excited to play.""

Toronto opens the World Cup-style tournament Sunday morning against D.C. United. New England defeated Montreal 1-0 in the first Group C game.

Striker Jozy Altidore, always willing to share, took to social media Saturday to dump on the kickoff time.

""These 9 a.m. games are not the way. Way too hot out here for all that,"" he tweeted.

The forecast calls for 28 C at kickoff, feeling like 32 C (rising to 30 C and 37 C at 11 a.m.) at ESPN's Wide World of Sports complex near Orlando.

It's the first game for Toronto since a 1-0 home win over New York City FC on March 7. The league ground to a halt five days later due to COVID-19.

Since then, the players suffered through the pandemic lockdown before gradually resuming training -- first individually, then in small groups and finally as a full team.

The world has changed in the interim, with the death of George Floyd triggering a worldwide response to racism and police brutality.

Toronto has helped lead the way on the MLS front, will fullback Justin Morrow executive director of the newly former Black Players for Change group. Altidore, Richie Laryea and the injured Ifunanyachi Achara are among the TFC players who have spoken out eloquently.

GM Ali Curtis has also played a significant role behind the scenes while assistant coach Jason Bent's voice also carries weight.

""It'll be difficult to be playing these games with everything that's happened but I'll be honoured to be out there as always representing Toronto, which is such a great city, and I've felt incredible support from them,"" said Morrow.

On the field, Toronto FC fans are looking forward to a first glimpse of winger Pablo Piatti, the Argentine designated player whose start to the season was delayed by a hamstring injury.

The combination of Piatti and Spanish playmaker Alejandro Pozuelo could be mouth-watering.

For Michael Bradley, Sunday will mark his first action since Nov. 10 when he injured his ankle in the MLS Cup final loss in Seattle. The 32-year-old skipper underwent surgery in January after the ankle failed to respond to rehab.

Altidore may well still be a work in progress, however. The burly U.S. international forward spent most of the lockdown at his Florida home and had to self-quarantine, training on his own, upon returning to Toronto.

With Toronto scheduled to play again Wednesday, against Montreal, Vanney is likely to dig deep into his roster.

There is plenty to choose from. Toronto retained 17 of the 18 players that dressed for the MLS Cup final, missing only French winger Nicolas Benezet, now with Colorado.

The reserves are young, however. Ten members of Toronto's tournament roster are 22 or younger.

While all 24 remaining teams at the tournament -- FC Dallas and Nashville SC were forced to withdraw after COVID-19 ripped through their rosters -- remain works in progress given lack of serious preparation time, Toronto is a known quantity.

""You know you're going to get quality,"" said D.C. United coach Ben Olsen. ""And you know you're going to get a team that, in some ways, is less a work in progress because of the lack of turnover that that team has had over the last few years.

""There's a lot of returning players and a lot of returning players of quality. So that part is an exciting challenge for our group.""

D.C. United also remembers the 5-1 first-round playoff loss to Toronto last season. After sending the game to overtime with a stoppage-time equalizer, Olsen's team conceded four goals in rapid fashion at BMO Field.

""Not that we need any extra motivation but we certainly wouldn't mind getting back at them,"" said Olsen.

D.C. United says veteran playmaker Federico Higuain, who signed in March as a free agent after eight seasons with Columbus, is ready to play after recovering from knee surgery.

Peruvian international midfielder Edison Flores is also one to watch.

""He's a special player,"" said Olsen. ""He's exciting, he's dynamic, he can score, he can provide. He will help us in the way we attack.

""Now the trick is with him is we got to find him the ball, because when he has the ball at his feet good things happen and he makes real plays.""

That vision will be welcome to a team that lost offensive weapons up front with the departure of Wayne Rooney, Lucas (Titi) Rodriguez and Luciano (Lucho) Acosta.

Teams will play three group games at the tournament, which will count in the regular-season standings, with the top two from each of the six pools plus the four best third-place finishes advance to the knockout round of 16.

Toronto went 1-0-1 in the first two games of the season while D.C. United was 1-1-0.

Being in a bubble is nothing new to Toronto, thanks to trips to hostile territory in the CONCACAF Champions League -- albeit without the threat of COVID-10.

""It wasn't like we were getting out of the hotel much when we were in some of those places in Mexico,"" said Bradley. ""None of this fazes us.""

TORONTO - The NHL remains on course to resume its pandemic-delayed season north of the 49th parallel later this summer, and has the labour peace it needs to ride out the unprecedented economic storm brought on by COVID-19.

The NHL and NHL Players' Association announced Friday the return-to-play protocols - featuring Toronto and Edmonton as hub cities - and a four-year extension to the current collective bargaining agreement have been ratified.

The NHL board of governors and the union's full membership gave the documents, which were tied together in an all-or-nothing bundle, the thumbs up in separate votes.

Bringing the hubs to Canada, where coronavirus infection rates are largely under control, proved to be the logical choice after a significant spike in cases across the United States in recent weeks.

“While we have all worked very hard to try to address the risks of COVID-19, we know that health and safety are and will continue to be our priorities,” NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said in a statement. “We know that all of our fans are excited about our return to the ice.”

Training camps for the 24 teams primed to compete in the league's blueprint to kickstart the 2019-20 campaign that was suspended March 12 are scheduled to begin Monday in each franchise's home market.

The plan will then see Eastern Conference clubs report to Toronto on July 26, while those from the Western Conference will head to Edmonton before the games resume Aug. 1.

Once in Canada's largest city and Alberta's capital, players are set to be kept away from the general public in so-called “bubbles” that include strict health measures, daily testing, and mostly confine teams to hotels and empty arenas.

The extension of the current CBA, which was scheduled to expire in September 2022 and now runs through at least the 2025-26 season, provides both players and owners clarity on a number of challenging financial realities caused by COVID-19.

It also give the green light for negotiations with the International Olympic Committee and the International Ice Hockey Federation on participation at the 2022 and 2026 Winter Games. The NHL skipped the 2018 Olympics after taking part in five straight between 1998 and 2014.

The salary cap's upper limit will remain at US$81.5 million in 2020-21 and stay there until hockey-related revenue returns to $4.8 billion - this season's projected total prior to the pandemic. Players have agreed to defer 10 per cent of next year's salaries, and have owners pay that back over three consecutive seasons starting in 2022-23.

“This agreement is a meaningful step forward for the players and owners, and for our game, in a difficult and uncertain time,” NHL PA executive director Don Fehr said. “We are pleased to be able to bring NHL hockey back to the fans.”

Escrow payments, a consistent thorn in the side of players that guarantees a 50/50 split of HRR with owners, will be capped at 20 per cent in 2020-21, and decrease throughout the deal. If teams are still owed money following the 2025-26 campaign, the CBA will be extended another season.

The agreement marks the first time since Bettman was hired in 1993 that the NHL has bridged two CBAs without a work stoppage. Both the 1994-95 and 2012-13 seasons were cut to 48 games because of lockouts, while the 2004-05 campaign was completely wiped out.

“It was pretty civil,” Vancouver Canucks captain Bo Horvat, his team's NHL PA rep, said of negotiations. “We're happy to get things going.”

Alberta Premier Jason Kenney was the most outspoken politician with regards to having his province host one of the hubs, pointing to a low infection rate and Edmonton's facilities.

“It's the obvious choice to bring the NHL to Edmonton,” Kenney said on Twitter last month.

He also penned a letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in hopes of securing a waiver for the NHL when it came to Canada's mandatory 14-day quarantine for anyone arriving in the country. The federal government approved the league's proposal of a cohort quarantine last month, granting an exception that paved the way for Toronto and Edmonton to get the nod as hubs.

Each team's travelling party will be capped at 52, including a maximum of 31 players.

Much like Kenney, Ontario Premier Doug Ford supported the idea of Toronto's hub potential, as long as it could be done safely.

Toronto Mayor John Tory said recently he was impressed with the league's plans.

“They had incredibly detailed disinfection and health protection measures that were in place even within the bubble to make sure they covered every angle they possibly could from the standpoint of making sure they met our public-health objectives,” Tory said.

Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease specialist at Toronto General Hospital, said the NHL choosing to hold all games in Canada reduces the risk, but it's far from a fool-proof endeavour.

“We'd be blind to think that there isn't COVID-19 in Canada, there's just significantly less of it here compared to parts of the U.S.,” he said. “Everyone has to pay close attention to COVID-19 because even with the best laid plans, there still can be small weaknesses that might be exploited by this virus.”

Vancouver was the other Canadian city originally in the hub running, along with seven American markets, before the provincial government expressed concerns about the NHL 's protocols with regard to health and safety.

Ford was asked prior to Friday's announcement why the plan worked for his province when it didn't for British Columbia.

“They have very stringent rules and regulations for their players,” Ford said of the NHL . “When they told me (players are) getting tested every single day, I'm no medical professional, but I don't think they need testing every day. Maybe every third day or whatever.

“I think people would like to see a few hockey games on television.”

The 24-team format - which includes every Canadian franchise, save for Ottawa - will see the top-4 clubs from both the East and West play mini-tournaments to determine playoff seeding, while the other 16 will battle in a never-before-seen qualifying round.

Boston, Tampa Bay, Washington and Philadelphia will compete for the No. 1 slot in the East, while defending Cup champion St. Louis, Colorado, Vegas and Dallas will do the same out West.

The East's best-of-five qualifying series include No. 5 Pittsburgh vs. No. 12 Montreal, No. 6 Carolina vs. No. 11 New York Rangers, No. 7 New York Islanders vs. No. 10 Florida and No. 8 Toronto vs. No. 9 Columbus. In the West, the matchups are No. 5 Edmonton vs. No. 12 Chicago, No. 6 Nashville vs. No. 11 Arizona, No. 7 Vancouver vs. No. 10 Minnesota and No. 8 Calgary vs. No. 9 Winnipeg.

The four winners of the best-of-five matchups in each conference will then be pitted against the top-4 seeds to fill out the usual 16-team playoff bracket. The league says Oct. 4 is the last possible date for the Stanley Cup final.

There could, however, still be some choppy waters before the 2019-20 season can actually resume.

Players won't be quarantined during training camp, but instead asked to practise physical distancing when not at the rink in hopes isolation and testing will be enough to avoid any outbreaks.

Of the 396 NHL ers tested at team facilities between June 8 and Monday during voluntary workouts, 23 results - in the neighbourhood of six per cent - came back positive. The league said it's also aware of 12 other positive tests for players not taking part in those optional sessions.

That's on top of 10 other positive tests announced in the spring.

The NHL has awarded the Stanley Cup every year since 1893, except for 1919 because of the Spanish flu outbreak and in 2005 when the lockout scratched the entire season.

A morning that had promised to start and end early Sunday turned into a stressful all-day marathon for Toronto FC and D.C. United.

The teams were slated to kick off their MLS is Back Tournament at 9 a.m. ET at ESPN's Wide World of Sports Complex in the Orlando area. Minutes before the scheduled start, Major League Soccer called off the game - citing two problematic COVID-19 tests.

A round of pre-game testing Saturday had returned a positive test for a D.C. United player and an inconclusive test for a Toronto player. The positive test was considered unconfirmed until backed up by a second test.

While D.C. United made it to the playing field, Toronto never left the league hotel.

“Both teams participated in another round of testing (Sunday) and all players from the two clubs tested negative,” the league said in a statement issued Sunday evening. “Based on those results, the game will be played (Monday) morning at 9 a.m. ET.

“The player who received an initial positive test and the player whose test was inconclusive will undergo additional testing and will not play in (Monday's) match.”

The league did not identify the players in question. Neither did Toronto FC, although GM Ali Curtis did say his player was asymptomatic.

The tournament, which marks the league's first action since it shut down March 12 due to the global pandemic, has already lost FC Dallas and Nashville SC due to a rash of positive COVID-19 tests.

Sunday was another day of drama and doubt in the pandemic sports world.

“These days nothing's really normal. If anything the normal is kind of uncertainty,” Curtis told a virtual conference call Sunday evening.

“There's a different situation each different day, for each different week,” he added. “And you just have to adapt.”

It marked the second delay for both Toronto and D.C. United. They were supposed to meet Friday night but the game was pushed back to Sunday due to Toronto's late arrival at the tournament because of the need for additional COVID-19 testing in the wake of a player reporting symptoms.

Players and staff were tested Saturday in advance of the game. Curtis said the team learned of the inconclusive test around midnight, prompting another test in the player's room that proved to be negative. The Toronto player has been isolated pending the result of another test.

The rest of the Toronto team produced negative results in the latest batch of testing.

Curtis, meanwhile, started his Sunday with a 6 a.m. Zoom call, the first of many.

With the game expected to start at 9 a.m. Monday, both teams faced another early morning wake-up call. Toronto's pre-game meal Sunday was scheduled for 5:30 a.m.

Toronto's second game against the Montreal Impact, originally scheduled for Wednesday, has now been pushed back to Thursday. And D.C. United's game against the New England Revolution will now be played on Friday instead of Thursday.

Wednesday's game between the Vancouver Whitecaps and San Jose Earthquakes will now start at 9 p.m. instead of 10:30 p.m.

After the threat of lightning delayed Atlanta's game against the New York Red Bulls on Saturday night, there were more delays and drama Sunday.

“We believe the tournament can still be conducted safely,” MLS deputy commissioner Mark Abbott told a virtual conference call Sunday morning. “And if at the point we determine it can't, obviously we would make a decision then.

“In the case of Dallas and Nashville, the decision was made that based on the extent of the positive tests in those teams (and) their ability to train, that the more prudent course was to withdraw them.

“But we had established a set of protocols that are working as they were designed, which is to identify players that have had positive tests for COVID-19, to remove and separate them from the team and isolate them. And to continue the process of testing the other players ... We view this (case) as the process working.”

Under league protocols, players who test positive are isolated while those who test negative “move forward.”

Abbott said because Toronto only arrived last Monday, the decision was made to await the results of tests conducted Sunday morning before playing the game.

Curtis said his team is still on task at the tournament.

“It's an important competition. A lot of people have put a lot of work and effort into (it) ... It's important that we represent the club and we represent our city as best as we can.”

It all added to an already stressful morning for the teams given the unusually early kickoff time - made to avoid the Florida heat. Both Toronto captain Michael Bradley and striker Jozy Altidore had criticized the 9 a.m. start, saying it was not conducive to good football.

D.C. goalkeeper Bill Hamid suggested it was an inconvenience to fans, too.

“To every DC United supporter, our families & friends, I'm sorry you woke up so early to see us play, to then have the match postponed AGAIN,” he tweeted. “Especially after so many people planned originally to watch the game which was meant to play on Friday! Have a beautiful Sunday regardless.”

Curtis said while Toronto had always planned to show up late for the game, to avoid the heat for as long as possible, the team was on a group Zoom call abut what was going on with the COVID-19 test when he received the call from the league that the game was off.

While all 24 remaining teams are staying in the same hotel, they are isolated from each other in the MLS tournament bubble. Players and other personnel are tested every other day.

Curtis said his confidence level in the MLS protocols remains “very high.”

“When you look at the data, if you strip out the outliers of Dallas and Nashville, I think the numbers are fairly favourable” he said. “And then when you're in the bubble you see some of the measures that are taken and that gives you confidence.”

But outside, the number of positive cases continues to climb.

On Sunday, Florida reported 15,300 new cases over the last 24 hours - a single-day record in the U.S. since the start of the pandemic.

There were some surprises in Toronto's planned starting 11 Sunday.

While it fielded the same back five as it had in its last league game March 7, there were four changes further forward. Bradley and Argentine newcomer Pablo Piatti, who both missed the opening two games of the season, were to return from injury.

Tsubasa Endoh and Ayo Akinola were also in the starting 11.

Altidore did not make the matchday 23. He was late joining the team after spending the lockdown at his Florida home and had to train on his own while fulfilling quarantine.

Canadian midfielder Jonathan Osorio was a surprise omission from the matchday 23.

Sunday evening's Sporting Kansas City against Minnesota United game went ahead despite confirmation Friday by Kansas City that one of its players had tested positive.

It didn't seem possible the MLS is Back Tournament could start any worse for Toronto FC after its first match was postponed twice due to COVID-19 concerns.

But a late collapse, with 10-man D.C. United scoring the tying goal in stoppage time, proved different as Toronto had to settle for an unsatisfying 2-2 tie when the teams finally took the field Monday morning at ESPN's Wide World of Sports Complex.

“We're angry with ourselves, we're frustrated,” sad Toronto captain Michael Bradley. “For a team that wants to be as good as we do and for a team that holds ourselves to the standards that we do, there's no way that you should let a team like that back in the game today.”

“We were in position to win the game, we should have won the game and we collapsed,” echoed Toronto coach Greg Vanney.

Ayo Akinola, in a rare start, scored twice in the first half to give Toronto a 2-0 lead.

D.C. United played the second half down a man after midfielder Junior Moreno received a second yellow for going through the back of Marky Delgado in first-half stoppage time.

Toronto used its man advantage in the second half, stroking the ball around the field, and seemed cruising to a commanding win until the bottom fell out.

It started in the 84th minute when D.C. United scored against the run of play.

Substitute Federico Higuain, in his D.C. United debut after knee surgery and a decorated career in Columbus, cooly chipped the ball over Quentin Westberg after the heart of a reshuffled Toronto defence was sliced open by a pass from Brazil's Felipe.

Defender Frederic Brillant completed the comeback in the 91st minute, heading in the tying goal from a Felipe free kick.

Akinola came close to restoring the Toronto lead in the 96th minute but Bill Hamid got a hand to his header.

“Overall, just in general, a gutsy performance from what I think is a mentally tough group,” said D.C. coach Ben Olsen. “It has not been an easy 10, 11 days since we got here. A lot of moving parts, a lot of cancellations and games being moved. So to get something out of that game, I think, says a lot about our group.

“Yes we can get better. But this is a marathon and the trick at these tournaments is to keep pushing and getting better throughout the tournament.”

Vanney shuffled three-quarters of his backline in the second half, changes he said were due to physical issues he did not want to exacerbate in the Florida heat and humidity.

Fullback Justin Morrow came off at halftime after experiencing some Achilles tendinitis. Centre backs Omar Gonzalez and Chris Mavinga were replaced in the 64th minute after both started cramping.

Replacement centre backs Eriq Zavalata and Laurent Ciman were victimized on both goals.

On the first, D.C. could have driven a fleet of Mack trucks down the centre of the pitch without hitting anything after a Ciman giveaway at midfield triggered the counter-attack.

Substitute Richie Laryea then gave away an unnecessary free kick just inside the Toronto half that led to the tying goal. Steven Birnbaum rose high to beat Zavaleta, who protested he had been fouled, and sent the ball to Brillant, who got between Bradley and Ciman to head the ball home.

Toronto outshot D.C. United 18-8 (7-5 in shots on target) and had 66.4 per cent possession - helped by its second-half numerical advantage.

There was some bad blood after the final whistle of a game that saw some ugly tackles. Bradley said some of it seemed to come from D.C. players blaming them for the match postponements.

The two teams were originally scheduled to meet Friday night but that was pushed back to Sunday due to Toronto 's late arrival (July 6), caused by the need for additional COVID-19 testing after a member of the travelling part reported symptoms.

Sunday's game was called off minutes before the 9 a.m. ET kickoff in the wake of a positive test for a D.C. United player and an inconclusive test for a Toronto player.

All other players tested negative in a round of new testing. The two players in question, neither of which were identified by their clubs, were isolated pending receipt of a second negative test.

The tournament, which marks the league's first action since it shut down March 12 due to the global pandemic, has already lost FC Dallas and Nashville SC due to a rash of positive COVID-19 tests.

The game finally kicked off at 9:08 a.m. in 28 C heat. Both teams arrived wearing masks and Black Lives Matter T-shirts, taking a knee before kickoff.

There was no evidence of rust as Toronto pressed D.C. and attacked on multiple fronts despite the absence of star striker Jozy Altidore.

Akinola scored in the 12th minute, beating one defender and then splitting two more before hammering in a right-footed shot from the edge of the box. The goal came after Hamid's goal kick went straight to Bradley in the D.C. end, with an Alejandro Pozuelo pass eventually finding Akinola.

The 20-year-old scored again in the 44th minute after Pozuelo beat Brillant to the ball following an 11-pass Toronto sequence. Pozuelo floated the ball to the far post where an unmarked Akinola tapped it in.

Akinola came into the match with one goal in 12 career MLS appearances (including two starts) spread over three seasons. It was his first MLS game action since June 29, 2019 - and first start since May 8, 2019.

Westberg made a remarkable one-handed save to stop Ola Kamara's header from point-blank range in first-half stoppage time.

On the plus side, Argentine newcomer Pablo Piatti looked sharp in his Toronto debut, showing a good rapport with Pozuelo and Brazil's Auro on the right flank. Akinola also made the most of his opportunity.

And Bradley, in his first outing since injuring his ankle in the Nov. 10 MLS Cup final, was a force in midfield.

“I thought he was fantastic,” said Vanney.

Toronto has not lost a regular-season game since Aug. 3, 2019, when it was beaten 2-0 by the New York Red Bulls. Vanney's team has gone 5-0-8 since.

Toronto 's next Group C game is Thursday against the Montreal Impact, who lost their opener 1-0 to the New England Revolution last Thursday.

The three group games count in the regular-season standings with Toronto now at 1-0-2 and D.C. United at 1-1-1.

Altidore did not make the matchday 23. He was late joining the team after spending the lockdown at his Florida home and had to train on his own while fulfilling quarantine.

Canadian midfielder Jonathan Osorio didn't dress due to a quad strain.

Vanney said Altidore could get some minutes against Montreal with the third game targeted for Osorio.

Toronto knocked D.C. United out of the playoffs the last time they met, scoring four goals in extra time in a 5-1 first-round win in October.

TORONTO - Jaime McMillan, who became a key member of Toronto FC's front office after coming on board in 2010, has joined Columbus Crew SC.

Columbus announced Thursday that it has named McMillan vice-president, soccer administration and operations.

McMillan stepped down as Toronto's senior director of administration and operations in March. So did husband Corey Wray, who was Toronto's assistant GM, team operations and strategy. Toronto did not announce the departures at the time.

The latest move reunites McMillan with Columbus president and GM Tim Bezbatchenko, who stepped down as Toronto's senior vice-president of soccer operations and GM in January 2019 to join his hometown club in Ohio.

“We are thrilled to welcome Jaime McMillan to the club,” Bezbatchenko said in a statement. “Jaime played a critical role in the front office, simultaneously managing and executing high-level projects during her time with Toronto FC as it became a perennial MLS Cup contender, and I know she will be a great asset to the Crew as we continue to grow our ambitions and elevate the club in this new era.”

McMillan will oversee Columbus' administration and management in non-technical areas, including soccer operations administration, facilities and budgeting.

The Crew said her role “will also include a focus on player and staff administration, academy administration and other club support areas.”

Toronto enjoys a reputation as one of MLS' best teams at helping players settle off the field, with McMillan leading the way.

McMillan joined Toronto in 2010 as co-ordinator for business operations. She went on to become senior manager of team development (2013-15), director of team development (2015-16) and director of administrations and operations (2016-18) before taking on the role of senior director of administration and operations.

Toronto won one MLS Cup (2017), one Supporters' Shield (2017) and six Canadian Championships (2010, 2011, 2012, 2016, 2007, 2018) during McMillan's tenure.

“Absolutely one (of) the best in the business,” tweeted Toronto striker Jozy Altidore.

“Columbus Crew SC has been making some great moves. Jaime will make the entire organization better. Congrats Jaime!!!”

TORONTO - Auston Matthews felt safe in Arizona - until he wasn't.

The star centre for the Toronto Maple Leafs confirmed Monday that he tested positive for COVID-19 last month in his home state.

Matthews shared the news as the team opened training camp ahead of the NHL's restart after the league was shut down by the novel coronavirus back in March.

“Yea, I did,” the 22-year-old said on a video conference call following practice when asked about the initial report by The Toronto Sun. “(It) didn't really enter my training. I was able to do stuff at home, obviously wasn't able to leave or skate or anything.

“That's really the only thing that took a hit for me. I was skating beforehand, and having to take 2 1/2, three weeks off the ice catches up to you, but pretty much asymptomatic, felt for the most part pretty normal for the two weeks. I did my quarantine and I'm feeling healthy now, so it's all good.”

The Sun first reported June 19 that Matthews contracted the virus while at home in Scottsdale, Ariz., and was in quarantine.

The Leafs declined to confirm the report at the time, citing the privacy of players' medical records.

Arizona is among the U.S. states that has seen a recent spike in positive tests for the novel coronavirus.

“It was not a hot spot for like two months,” Matthews said. “It was like the safest place to be and then obviously things flipped pretty quickly there. I don't really find it too different than it is here. Lots of stuff, for the most part, closed other than outside seating and essential services.”

Leafs winger Mitch Marner said he learned of the positive test the same way fans did, and immediately texted his friend and teammate.

“This (virus) is not a joke and something you can't take lightly,” said the 23-year-old. “He was feeling well and not really feeling (many) of the symptoms.

“It's great to have him back out there.”

Toronto head coach Sheldon Keefe said hearing the news was a reality check.

“That happened right around a time when it started to hit the NHL in general with bigger numbers, and it was right there,” said the rookie bench boss. “That was just a bit of a bump to all of us in terms of paying attention to the protocols, taking this very seriously.

“That really allowed everybody to just kind of tighten up and make sure we were doing all the right things to stay healthy ourselves and then of course making sure that we're doing our part to keep our room healthy and keep everybody that comes in healthy so that we can continue to work towards a safe return.”

Matthews , who isn't able to pinpoint where or how he got the virus, finished the regular season tied for second in the NHL with 47 goals to go along with 80 points in 70 games.

The Leafs are set to open a best-of-five playoff qualification series with Columbus on Aug. 2 in Toronto.

The NHL has updated its COVID-19 numbers, stating 30 players tested positive during the voluntary Phase 2 of the league's return-to-play plan from June 8 through Sunday. Another 13 tested positive outside of the league's protocol.

The NHL added that over 600 players reported to their club's training facilities for Phase 2 - which featured players training in small groups at their teams' facilities - and that 4,934 COVID-19 tests were administered.

Despite his own personal experience, Matthews said he believes the league's 24-team restart can succeed.

“The NHL and everybody have tried their best with the information that they have to make it as safe as an environment as possible.”

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Tampa Bay outfielder Austin Meadows has been placed on the injured list after testing positive for the coronavirus.

The Rays announced the move Thursday night.

Left-handed reliever Aaron Loup was added to the 40-man roster in place of Meadows, who was a first-time All-Star and batted .291 with 33 homers and 89 RBIs last season.

Meadows had not been seen at Tropicana Field since working out with the Rays on July 3, the first day of summer camp.

TORONTO - The defending champion Toronto Raptors will resume the 2019-20 NBA season on Aug. 1 against the Los Angeles Lakers.

The Raptors, along with the NBA, announced their revised eight-game schedule on Friday.

Under the format for the restart, the 22 participating teams will have eight 'seeding games,' selected from their remaining regular-season matchups.

Toronto will also play Miami, Orlando, Boston, Memphis, Milwaukee, Philadelphia and Denver, with the 'seeding games' concluding by Aug. 14.

All games will be played at ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex at Walt Disney World Resort in Florida with no fans in attendance.

The Raptors held down the second seed in the Eastern Conference when play was suspended in March due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The NBA's re-opening night on July 31 will see New Orleans against Utah and the Clippers versus the Lakers.

With the start of Major League Baseball's shortened season a week away, games in empty stadiums and strange extra-inning rules are on the verge of becoming reality.

Now that players have gotten used to COVID-19 tests, social distancing and wearing masks in the clubhouse, it's just about time to see if 30 teams can handle a 60-game schedule amid a pandemic.

""Obviously, it's going to feel a little different the way things are going with no fans and what-not,"" Brewers infielder Eric Sogard said, ""but we're all excited to get going and get back out there.""

The season begins next Thursday night with the defending World Series champion Washington Nationals hosting the New York Yankees, and the Los Angeles Dodgers welcoming the rival San Francisco Giants. The rest of the league joins the fray Friday, the common thread being that all games will be played without fans in the stands, each team will have a designated hitter and that a runner will be placed on second base during extra innings.

When summer camp began earlier this month following an extended layoff due to the coronavirus outbreak, there was plenty of doubt whether the quest to salvage the season would ever get this far.

Several stars chose not to participate from the start, and rarely a day goes by without a positive COVID-19 test in one camp or another. But here we are, mere days from launching a season that's unique in almost every way.

""I've been keeping my fingers crossed every day. So far, we're doing fairly well,"" said Orioles manager Brandon Hyde, whose team opens in Boston next Friday night. ""We still have a ways to go before the 24th, and I'm nervous as anybody that we're going to be healthy.""

But Hyde remains hopeful the season will start on time and go the distance.

""People are feeling positive about how it's worked so far and going forward,"" he said.

Brewers general manager David Stearns noted the reduced rate of positive tests recently ""is a really encouraging sign.""

""That gives all of us confidence in all segments of the industry that if we continue to do the right things, follow the proper protocols, that we're going to give ourselves a pretty good chance,"" Stearns said.

While there's reason for optimism, the stark truth is that COVID-19 is not going away.

Tampa Bay outfielder Austin Meadows was placed on the injured list Thursday night after testing positive for the coronavirus.

Meadows was a first-time All-Star last season, batting .291 with 33 homers and 89 RBIs. He had not been seen at Tropicana Field by reporters since working out with the Rays on July 3, the first day of summer camp.

The 25-year-old is the second Tampa Bay player known to have tested positive for the coronavirus. Right-hander Tyler Glasnow joined the team Tuesday after missing 11 days of summer camp.

Star third baseman Yoan Moncada rejoined the Chicago White Sox after missing the start of their summer camp because he tested positive for COVID-19. He said he didn't experience any major symptoms but it was a difficult time for him and a little scary.

White Sox manager Rick Renteria also is back with the team after leaving camp last week to go home to California for a family funeral.

Texas Rangers reliever Brett Martin was placed on the injured list because of his positive coronavirus test before the start of summer camp.

Martin, already at higher risk because he has Type 1 diabetes, had a positive reading during intake screening two weeks ago. He experienced mild symptoms of COVID-19, including congestion and fatigue.

Because Martin is on the injured list due to coronavirus, he doesn't count toward the team's 40-man roster limit while on the IL. The 25-year-old lefty was 2-3 with a 4.76 ERA as a rookie last season.

In Miami, outfielders Matt Joyce and Lewis Brinson were put on the 10-day injured list by the Marlins. No reasons were given, but both have been sidelined since coronavirus testing began at the start of camp.

They still have a chance to play this season, manager Don Mattingly said.

The Braves are awaiting the return of four players who tested positive: four-time All-Star Freddie Freeman, setup reliever Will Smith, right-hander Touki Tousssaint and infielder Pete Kozma.

The Pirates have been very quiet in general in terms of potential health issues related to COVID-19 or otherwise.

""There's things that happen that we don't discuss,"" first-year manager Derek Shelton said. ""We just have to adapt and adjust, and that's what we're doing every day.""

In Atlanta, left-hander Cole Hamels (triceps tendinitis) threw a side session and will be evaluated after an off day on Friday. Right-hander Kyle Wright appears set to open the season as the fifth starter after pitching three innings in an intrasquad game.

In New York, two-time Cy Young Award winner Jacob deGrom still plans to pitch on opening day for the Mets. He left an intrasquad game Tuesday with back tightness, but a precautionary MRI came back clean.

The delay to the start of the season has worked to the benefit of the Houston Astros, who were booed unmercifully during spring training in the wake of their sign-stealing scandal.

""I see more smiles. Actually I see more joy,"" manager Dusty Baker said. ""Four months ago, that was a tough time. A lot has happened. We're at a different time and space than we were four months ago.""

With no fans in the stands, the Astros won't hear any jeers. MLB is providing each club with an array of crowd sounds and a touchpad device that can be integrated into their ballpark public address system to help manage the playing of those sounds.

Marlins outfielder Corey Dickerson isn't keen on the crowd noise being played during workouts.

""It sounds more like a sound machine to me,"" Dickerson said. ""I'd rather have some music playing.""","As MLB 60-game season draws near, careful optimism prevails",3,0.062321630803521044

LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. - Ayo Akinola scored three goals, upping his tournament total to five, and Spanish playmaker Alejandro Pozuelo had three assists as Toronto FC defeated the Montreal Impact 4-3 Thursday at the MLS is Back Tournament.

The win moved Toronto atop the Group C standings, at least for the night, with four points from two games, while the future looks bleak for pointless Montreal.

It was another wild night involving Canadian teams at ESPN's Wide World of Sports complex, although this time the fireworks were largely limited to the first half. San Jose rallied late Wednesday to edge the Vancouver Whitecaps 4-3.

Algerian international Saphir Taider made things interesting, converting his second penalty on the night in the 95th minute after video review confirmed a Laurent Ciman handball.

Richie Laryea also scored for Toronto. Honduran international Romell Quioto had the other Montreal goal.

Akinola, who had one goal in 12 games spread over the two previous seasons, has made the most of the chance to fill in for Jozy Altidore so far at the tournament. The 20-year-old joins Tosaint Ricketts as the only TFC players to score two or more goals in consecutive MLS matches. Ricketts, now with the Whitecaps, did it in September 2017.

Pozuelo, meanwhile, has set up five of the six Toronto goals at the tournament.

Laryea opened the scoring in the eighth minute, taking a fine pass from Pozuelo down the left flank before eluding Shamit Shome to fire a low right-footed shot past Clement Diop.

Quioto replied in the 14th minute after Argentine midfielder Emanuel Maciel, in his first Impact start, sliced open the Toronto defence with a long ball. Quioto outpaced the chasing Omar Gonzalez and slid the ball past Quentin Westberg.

Akinola restored the TFC lead in the 25th minute, capping off a slick nine-pass sequence that started back in the Toronto end when Gonzalez headed away a Montreal cross to Laryea, who had to fight his way out of the corner.

Michael Bradley eventually found Auro on the right flank and the Brazilian combined with Pablo Piatti and Pozuelo, who slid in a perfectly weighted low cross for Akinola to knock in.

Montreal was awarded a penalty when a sliding Chris Mavinga brought down Quioto. Taider converted the spot kick in the 37th minute.

Toronto scored less than a minute later from the ensuing kickoff, with Akinola taking another perfect Pozuelo pass and outmuscling a defender before beating Diop.

Akinola scored his third in the 83rd minute, bundling aside a defender after taking a Nick DeLeon flick-on from a Westberg goal kick before chipping Diop.

Toronto took a more defensive approach as the second half wore on, with Toronto looking to absorb the pressure. Unlike the opening game, the defence stood tall with Westberg leading the way.

Both teams were coming off disappointing opening matches. The Impact managed just two shots on target in a 1-0 loss to New England while Toronto gave up a pair of late goals, including a stoppage-time equalizer, in a 2-2 tie with 10-man D.C. United.

Montreal had six days preparation for Thursday's match while Toronto, whose opener was pushed back because of the team's late arrival in Florida, had two.

Toronto made one change to its starting 11 with Laryea in at left fullback for Justin Morrow, who exited at halftime of the D.C. United game because of Achilles tendinitis. Altidore, who is working his way back to fitness, and midfielder Jonathan Osorio, who has a quad strain, did not dress for the second game in a row.

Thierry Henry made four changes, taking out Maciel, Quioto, Shome and Jorge Corrales for Rudy Camacho, Rod Fanni, Orji Okwonkwo and Spain's Bojan.

Kenyan international Victor Wanyama dropped into the backline from the midfield.

Camacho returned to Montreal to be with his wife who is about to give birth.

Toronto had a couple of early chances with Pozuelo's shot deflecting off a defender after a nifty backheel from Piatti in the fifth minute. Bradley fired wide off the ensuing corner. Impact defender Luis Binks' header hit the post off a corner just before halftime.

Henry brought on Fanni at halftime in a bid to steady the defence.

Both teams wrap up group play Tuesday with Toronto facing New England and Montreal meeting D.C. United.

The three group games count in the regular-season standings, leaving Toronto at 2-0-2 and Montreal at 1-2-1.

Toronto is now unbeaten in its last 13 regular-season outings (5-0-8). Its last regular-season loss was Aug. 3, 2019 - a 2-0 defeat at the New York Red Bulls.

In other tournament news, MLS reported Thursday there had been no positive COVID-19 tests from the 1,124 people tested Tuesday and Wednesday.

Norm Powell is angry at the NBA for limiting players to a “cookie-cutter” list of social justice messages.

Social and racial justice is a theme of the NBA's restart in Florida, and part of that was permitting players to substitute Black Lives Matter messages, or the names of Black people killed such as George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, on the backs of their jerseys in place of their names.

Powell had hoped to replace his name with “Am I Next?” But the league has drawn up a list of approved messages for players to choose from, and the Toronto Raptors guard is frustrated that the NBA is limiting their voice on an issue that involves freedom of speech.

“I was really disappointed in the options that were given to us,” Powell said on a Zoom video call Thursday. “With a topic just like this - social justice - that we're fighting for, the fact that we were boxed-in to a list of 28, 29 sayings was really unfortunate.

“We've got a lot of guys in this league that . . . have been using their voice through this time and we're really excited about the whole thing, about being able to change our last names, and put a quote there that represents where we stand and what we want to say and how we feel about this, and I was really upset about the whole change and how we're really limited.”

Powell will wear “Black Lives Matter” on his jersey, choosing that from a list that he called “cookie cutter” and said doesn't truly touch on the topics of what players are trying to achieve.

Among the 29 slogans to choose from are: “Say Their Names,” “Vote,” and “I Can't Breathe.”

“I wish there wasn't even a list,” Powell said. “It's a topic where it's freedom of speech, and you're taking your name off the back of your jersey that matters to you. That speaks volumes to how you view things and your approach to life and you shouldn't be boxed in to say you can only say this much, this is OK for you to say.”

Powell said, as long as players didn't use any explicit language, they should have been free to choose whatever they liked.

Rondae Hollis-Jefferson will wear “Speak Up” on his jersey.

“It sticks out to me, personally, because I think a lot more of us on this platform should definitely speak up, they should say something, especially if they believe and care about what's going on right now in our world as a whole,” he said. “I feel like we all should speak up and say something, bring somebody closer together, take it one step at a time, one person at a time and then watch that trickle effect as we rub off our energy, our love, our positivity on somebody. That goes a long way.”

Some NBA players such as New Orleans' Jrue Holiday have announced they're contributing their remaining game cheques to social justice causes and Black-owned businesses.

“I think what those guys have done is amazing,” Powell said.

The 27-year-old, who signed a four-year, US$27 million contract extension in 2017, announced Wednesday that 100 per cent of proceeds from July orders of his Understand the Grind spring/summer line would go to two foundations: Toronto-based Black Women in Motion and Color of Change in the U.S.

“These are organizations that need our support now more than ever,” Powell said on his Instagram page.

LEXINGTON, Ky. - Serena Williams is planning to make her return to competition at a new hard-court tournament in Kentucky next month.

It'll be the 23-time Grand Slam singles champion's first action since playing for the U.S. in the Fed Cup in February, before all sanctioned tennis was shut down the next month because of the coronavirus pandemic.

The women's and men's professional tennis tours are scheduled to resume in August.

The Kentucky event, called the Top Seed Open, announced Thursday that Williams and 2017 U.S. Open champion Sloane Stephens will be in the field when play begins there Aug. 10.

Williams already has said she will enter the next scheduled Grand Slam tournament, the U.S. Open, which is supposed to begin in New York on Aug. 31.",Serena Williams to return to action in Kentucky next month,3,0.12512901528549036

Tim Shipton lets out a deep breath. A laugh quickly follows.

The Edmonton Oilers senior vice-president of communications and government relations is pondering a question about how long the team has been working on its bid to serve as an NHL hub city, should the league return to action sometime this summer.

“It feels like months, if not years,” Shipton said. “Time works in a funny way right now. We've been deep on this thing.”

That thing is trying to convince NHL, which paused its season March 12 because of the COVID-19 pandemic, that their city is the right spot to host 12 teams as part of a plan to complete the 2019-20 season and award the Stanley Cup.

It could also wind up being entirely out of their hands.

The NHL, which unveiled its return-to-play plan Tuesday that would feature 24 teams if the league is able to resume, announced that Vancouver and Toronto are also in the running along with Chicago, Columbus, Dallas, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Pittsburgh and Minneapolis/St. Paul in the U.S.

The goal is to name two cities, but deputy commissioner Bill Daly said the Canadian government's mandatory 14-quarantine for anyone entering the country would make markets north of the 49th parallel a non-starter.

“If we're not able to really get an interpretation of the quarantine consistent with our players' ability to travel in and not have to do a strict self-quarantine in a hotel room ... we won't be in a position to use any of the Canadian cities as a hub,” Daly said. “So we're faced with having to find a solution to that. And hopefully we can.”

The NHL said it will wait another three or four weeks before announcing its hub plans.

“We are having various discussions with various different departments in the Canadian government,” Daly added. “We don't have a resolution there, but it's an ongoing dialogue.”

Alberta Premier Jason Kenney penned a letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Wednesday where he encouraged the federal government to deem professional athletes and team staff as essential workers - meaning they would not be subject to a quarantine - similar to what U.S. officials announced late last week.

“Such an exemption from the Canadian government would be necessary for the (Oilers') bid,” Kenney wrote. “The Government of Alberta believes there are effective strategies in place to mitigate any risk to our province if such an exemption was granted.”

Weeks, not months or years, is what it took for the Oilers to prepare and submit hundreds of pages of documents to the NHL on everything from Rogers Place - their state-of-the-art home that opened in 2016 - to practice facilities, accommodations, and the province's and city's low novel coronavirus infection rate.

“We've really laid the groundwork on all fronts, with the government in particular, on what's most important, health and safety,” Shipton said in a phone interview. “We've developed a comprehensive framework with the government on how we would run this thing in a safe way.”

The Vancouver Canucks put in a bid similar to the Oilers, with a document trumpeting the benefits of that city as a hub, including its infrastructure and temperate summer climate, according to a team source granted anonymity because they weren't authorized to comment publicly.

“We see this as something that could be a positive initiative in a challenging time,” Canucks COO Trent Carroll said in a statement. “Maybe bring a bit of hope and a spark back to the community.”

British Columbia Premier John Horgan has been vocal about Vancouver as a hub, but struck a more cautious tone than his Alberta counterpart on Wednesday.

“We have rules in place today that we worked very hard to establish. Because the NHL made an announcement that involved Vancouver, we're not going to go rushing to change that,” Horgan said. “Two weeks from now, four weeks from now, it could be a completely different situation provided we continue to see the progress that we've seen here in British Columbia.

“I don't want to rule out the NHL coming here. They haven't presented a plan to us. ... Today there's a 14-day self isolation period in place and I expect that will be there for the foreseeable future.”

Horgan's comments are in line with Dr. Bonnie Henry, the province's health officer, who said the government won't be making any concessions in a jurisdiction that has done well to minimize infections.

“I would love to have hockey, but we have been very clear, and the premier has been very clear, that we're not bending the rules in any way that would put what we have achieved here in B.C. at risk,” Henry said Tuesday. “I've yet to see a plan. I'm happy to see what we can do, but we won't be changing rules that would put anybody at risk or would undo the good work that we've done.”

A spokesman for Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment, the parent company of the Toronto Maple Leafs, previously declined to comment their bid, but Canada's biggest city has all the amenities the league would require, although Ontario's infection numbers are considerably higher than Alberta and B.C.

Leafs president Brendan Shanahan was asked about Toronto's chances on Wednesday.

“The National Hockey League will choose a city in which it is not just safe for the NHL players, but also a safe environment for the people in that community that are hosting this tournament,” he said on a conference call. “We think we put together a pretty comprehensive program that would involve that kind of safety, but those are decisions that the NHL will make.”

Back in Edmonton, Shipton said the Oilers have been thoroughly impressed with Kenney, describing him as an “all-star” throughout the process.

“We talked to him very early about this as an opportunity for the province,” Shipton said. “It aligns with his government's vision for reopening.”

“We've got a tremendous pitch,” Kenney said during a recent media availability. “I think we are the safest place they could find in the continent to come and, in a very thoughtful and careful way, finish off the season with the playoffs.”

While other cities have gone about their pitches relatively quietly, Shipton said there's a reason the Oilers are more vocal about Edmonton.

It's no secret that like some other colder locales, the Alberta capital is viewed as an undesirable landing spot for some NHL players.

But that's in the winter.

“Edmonton in the summer is beautiful,” Shipton said. “There's so many things going for the city that we feel like we're a little underrated in that category.

“It's important for us to get out and not be shy about it - be proud that we've got a beautiful city.”

And for a province that's been hit with the double economic blow of cratering oil prices and a crippling pandemic, hosting 12 NHL teams and helping get hockey back on track could be a shot in the arm.

“We're such a passionate hockey province,” Shipton said. “There's no doubt that it's been a very difficult time for a lot of individuals and a lot of businesses.

“We think it's not just an economic boost, it would be a really significant morale boost for the province at a time when maybe we need it the most.”

TORONTO - S.J. Green is getting a head start on CFL free agency.

The Toronto Argonauts granted the veteran American receiver's request to be released Friday. He was scheduled to become a free agent Tuesday.

“He asked for his release to pursue other opportunities,” Argos GM Mike (Pinball) Clemons said in a statement. “We grant his request with a pint of sorrow and a gallon of gratitude, and a gentle reminder that the door is still open.”

Green, 34, spent three seasons with Toronto after being acquired from the Montreal Alouettes in April 2017. He was a 1,000-yard receiver throughout his Argos' tenure and last year became the 18th player in CFL history to top 10,000 career yards.

The six-foot-two, 217-pound Green's best season with Toronto came in 2017 when he had 104 receptions for 1,462 yards and 10 TDs. He helped the Argos win a Grey Cup title that year.

Riders sign former Jaguars receiver Greene

REGINA - The Saskatchewan Roughriders signed former NFL receiver Rashad Greene on Friday.

Greene, a 2015 fifth-round pick of the Jacksonville Jaguars, appeared in 25 regular-season games with the NFL squad. The 27-year-old had 30 receptions for 185 yards and two touchdowns while also returning 41 punts for 448 yards and a TD.

Greene played collegiately at Florida State and helped the Seminoles capture the '13 BCS title. He registered 270 catches for 3,830 yards and 29 TDs, becoming the school's all-time leader in receptions and yards.

The Toronto Raptors' return to basketball has them living in an otherwise empty hotel in the Fort Myers area of Florida, a COVID-19 hotspot that has seen new cases skyrocketing.

They wake up to almost daily testing for the coronavirus before driving in staggered small groups to Alico Arena, home of the Florida Gulf Coast University Eagles, for the closest thing to a practice that's allowed - one player and two coaches per hoop.

They return to eat in a dining room with tables widely spaced out.

“Everybody stays safe, stay put in your room, and obey the rules,” said team president Masai Ujiri . “They go to the gym, and do their practices, and come back.”

The Raptors were the first team to arrive in the Sunshine State ahead of the NBA's scheduled July 30 restart, choosing to convene in Florida because of Canadian laws that would have required players to self-isolate for 14 days in Toronto.

“You have to make plans, right? You have to set things in motion and we decided that this was what we were going to do and it was a safe environment, we continue to think that it's a safe environment for us and it has been so far,” Ujiri said on Monday's conference call.

“This pandemic has been very unpredictable, especially in the States. . . (We just didn't) want it to be a situation where guys were just sitting down for 14 days and not being able to do anything, so we kind of came up with this idea.”

Group workouts can begin once the Raptors check into the “NBA campus” at the Disney complex in the Orlando area. All 22 teams, which can bring 37 players and staff members apiece, arrive at the quasi-bubble - Disney employees won't be subject to the NBA's quarantine procedures - between July 7 and 9.

There's been over 145,000 positive cases of the novel coronavirus in Florida as of Monday morning, with 5,266 new cases reported Monday. Over 3,500 Floridians have died from the virus.

The league announced 16 players have tested positive, but when asked whether any Raptors were among that list, Ujiri deferred to NBA protocol. The league isn't expected to divulge which players tested positive.

While NBA commissioner Adam Silver acknowledged on a conference call Friday that “the level of concern has increased,” Ujiri is confident in the league's ability to keep his team safe.

“The NBA is a seriously well-oiled machine,” Ujiri said. “They're going to try and make this whole event or the campus hopefully a great experience for everybody that has the opportunity to experience it.

“And then for people outside, everybody wants to see the game come back. . . sports has just been something missing in our lives, and makes us happy, brings people together, I think it will help restart some sort of happiness or some sort of joy in seeing the game back again.”

The defending champion Raptors, who open the eight-game seeding round on Aug. 1 versus the Los Angeles Lakers, were second in the Eastern Conference and had just clinched a playoff spot when the league shuttered on March 11 after Rudy Gobert's positive COVID-19 test.

If the Raptors go all the way to this year's Finals, they'd be at the Disney campus for three months. Players will be permitted to have their families join them after the first round of the playoffs.

Ujiri believes his team has what it takes to manage the unique challenge that sort of isolation poses.

“Mental toughness, chemistry, just the way our guys are built, the experience we've had being together for a long time,” he said. “The chemistry of the team is so important, and the belief in themselves. I think there's great camaraderie with them.

“And yes, there's going to be concerns, but our guys are being responsible as much as we can in these situations. Yes, there's family concerns, everybody is going to miss their families, and these are tough situations. But there's a passion for basketball and a love for the game, to play the game at a high level.”

Fred VanVleet, who was the first player to arrive last week at Toronto's eerily-empty hotel - it was closed prior to the team's arrival, so they're the only guests - plans to have his partner and their two young kids join him when permitted.

“I've been gone a week and I miss my kids already,” VanVleet said.

The 26-year-old guard said he was “pretty concerned” about convening in Florida, but he's trying to remain optimistic.

“It sounded good a month or two ago, not so much right before we got ready to leave. I think for the most part I just put the trust in the organization and understand that I don't think they would put us in extreme risk, trust the NBA,” VanVleet said. “Hopefully they prove me right and not wrong. It's not the most ideal situation but it's kind of the times we are in. It hasn't been ideal for anyone.”

VanVleet said he spends his free time catching up on sleep and playing video games. What does he see as the biggest challenge of being cooped up in a confined space for three months?

“There's a long list,” VanVleet said. “If you want to find a million different little things to be wrong they will be there for you.”

VanVleet said food was one of his first concerns. Being fed by the same chefs every day, the food options will become “bland” pretty quickly.

“My hope is once we start playing we just get back into the flow of what we are used to and you will play and eat a sleep and hang out and then play again and before you know it, it will be over.”

The Raptors also face Miami, Orlando, Boston, Memphis, Milwaukee, Philadelphia and Denver in their tough seeding round.

“We're going to have to beat great teams no matter what the situation is, there's no cupcakes in this thing so it's going to be tough for anybody, but I like our chances,” VanVleet said. “I love the group that we have.”

“We have a team that's going to take it seriously and we're all excited to get back to playing - whatever that looks like - and I know we've got a lot of hungry, driven guys that want to win no matter what it is; it could be ping-pong or FIFA or whatever. Guys want to win around here so I'm looking forward to it.”

If all goes well, the playoffs would begin in mid-August. Game 7, with the Finals going to mid-October.

Coming off a heady few months of an NBA title and a FIBA World Cup win, Marc Gasol couldn't replicate that success with the Toronto Raptors this season.

The frustration gnawed at him.

And so when COVID-19 shut down the NBA on March 11, the Raptors veteran forward reached out to his personal training staff and vowed to make good use of the down time.

While Gasol wouldn't divulge how much weight he'd shed from his six-foot-11 frame - he said it “wasn't relevant” - his trimmed-down physique is obvious.

“It was a frustrating season for me personally because I could never get a rhythm and help the team the way that I should be helping the team,” Gasol said Wednesday, in his first comments to the media since the league shuttered four months ago.

“As soon as. . . we got informed the (Toronto training) facility was closing down, I got together with my team on a phone call and got going on a plan to resolve these ongoing issues.”

Those issues kept Gasol on the bench for 28 of the Raptors' 64 games with a nagging hamstring injury.

The 35-year-old credited consistency with part of the weight loss - eating and sleeping with more regularity at home in Spain, removed from the rigours of NBA travel.

“(Consistency) goes with training regimen, goals, sleeping habits, everything,” he said. “Obviously when you're at home, everything is a lot easier than when you're on the road and travelling and trying to make everything work and winning games, which at the end of the day, that's what you're judged for.”

Soon after Toronto's historic championship run, Gasol punched in with Spain's national team, which won the World Cup in China in August. He figures his hamstring troubles were a product of those gruelling few months.

“You have to put in the time, you have to put in the work if you're going to use that much energy,” he said. “If you only take money out of the bank and never put money in the bank, you're going to go broke.”

Gasol's teammates have raved about his transformation.

“I was shocked seeing him. It was like 'Sheesh,”' Patrick McCaw said. “I couldn't really recognize him because he had a new haircut. I think he thinks he's my age (24) again now, but he looks great, moving well, moving fast, handling the ball, just the change that he made is super . . . it's good and I'm excited to see him play.”

Gasol isn't the only Raptor who showed up in Florida for the NBA's restart in terrific shape. Coach Nick Nurse has praised the hard work of team leader Kyle Lowry, who looks fit and trim. And Chris Boucher put a much-needed 15 pounds of muscle on his long-limbed frame.

Gasol said beyond the fitness component, he and his teammates are itching to play. He can see it in the competitiveness on the court and off.

“We compete amongst each other every single day and try to go at each other's neck a little bit. I think that's always positive,” he said. “That is one of the things we missed the most during confinement - the competition. Some guys like to compete at computer games. Some of us are not really into those things. We missed competing against other human beings in real life.”

Gasol said there's been some cutthroat video games between players.

“You don't want to play me in video games, I'll tell you that much,” Gasol said.

Pascal Siakam then jumped into the frame on the Zoom call and told reporters “FIFA king right here. Make sure you get that on camera.”

The 22 teams in the NBA restart are being housed at Walt Disney World in Orlando under strict health and safety protocols. While there are social activities such as a players lounge, boat trips, fishing, and water parks, the Raptors know one of the toughest challenges over what could stretch into three months on the campus will be loneliness.

Gasol appreciated the photos of his family Raptors staff had placed in his room before he checked in.

“Obviously it's not ideal to be separated from your family but once you know they are well, also understanding and explaining to them the risk and make sure they follow all the protocols that they have to follow,” said Gasol, whose wife and two kids are in Spain.

“(The photos) were a great gesture.”

While there've been complaints from players about the food and accommodations, and a couple of players have been quarantined for inadvertently straying outside the campus bubble, Gasol said they're all in the same boat, and “trying to make the best out of it.

“I'm sure if you want to you can find millions of excuses of why this is not a good idea, you just have to find a good reason to stick with it and try to win another championship,” he said.

“So, whatever that is for, for each player, I hope that they can really hold it strong and lean on one another when the tough time comes, because they will come and things will get a little bit tougher on the mental aspect, and just knowing that you have your teammates, always next to you to support you.”

Gasol lived under full lockdown in Spain, which was one of the hardest hit countries in the pandemic's early days.

Now, the NBA sits virtually in one of the epicentres of the coronavirus. Florida reported more than 10,000 new cases Wednesday, surpassing 300,000 cases.

The Raptors play the Houston Rockets on July 24 in their first of three scrimmages. They play the Los Angeles Lakers on Aug. 1 in the first of eight seeding games.

TORONTO -- The Toronto Argonauts have signed veteran American defensive back Tommie Campbell and Canadian receiver Natey Adjei.

Campbell, 32, was released by the Alouettes last week after spending two years in Montreal. He began his CFL career with the Calgary Stampeders in 2016 after five years in the NFL with Tennessee and Jacksonville.

Last season, Campbell was named a CFL East all-star after recording 66 tackles, three interceptions and two forced fumbles in 16 games.

""He's a very good fit for how we plan to play,"" said Argos vice president of player personnel John Murphy. ""What we're asking him to do, he'll ideally fit in. We know how productive he's been.""

Adjei, a native of Mississauga, Ont., spent the first two seasons of his CFL career with the Argos after being drafted 22nd overall by Toronto in the 2013 draft.

The 30-year-old Adjei spent the past four seasons with the Edmonton Eskimos, who released him recently.

Last season, Adjei set career highs in receptions (58), receiving yards (534) and touchdowns (two).

The Argos also signed American defensive lineman Obinna Iheoma and released Canadian receiver Alex Charette.

BOMBERS SIGN PAIR

WINNIPEG -- The Winnipeg Blue Bombers have signed American offensive linemen Kevin Lawrence and Jarell Broxton.

Lawrence started all 12 games in his senior year last season at Rhode Island.

Broxton is a former Big 12 all-star at Baylor. He signed with the NFL's Baltimore Ravens as an undrafted free agent in 2016, and spent most of that season on their practice roster.

Toronto FC heads to Florida with some unease given recent positive tests there by FC Dallas players and the rising numbers of COVID-19 cases state-wide.

“There's concern, no doubt,” said head coach Greg Vanney. “Because it's showing that the ( MLS ) bubble is not impenetrable and there are some issues that are going on. The question is how quickly can the protocols that are in place down there get things under control so it doesn't start to spread inside of the bubble.

“That remains to be seen.”

Vanney says if he could, he would delay his team's departure to the MLS is Back Tournament at Disney's Wide World of Sports complex in the Orlando area.

“I don't know where it's going to go,” he said of the departure date.

Vanney said given the team feels comfortable and safe in Toronto and the situation is less stable in Florida, “it just makes sense ... that we don't go barrelling down right now until they know that have everything under control.

“Maybe they do.”

The TFC delegation is scheduled to leave Friday, the latest allowed by Major League Soc cer which has mandated teams have to arrive at least a week before their first game. Toronto opens July 10 against D.C. United.

The seven-day requirement is presumably to allow players time to be isolated if they test positive in Florida.

Not everything has been smooth in the leadup to leaving. Vanney said training had to be scrapped Wednesday because of a delay in getting COVID test results back.

Still, Vanney says his players wants to take part in the tournament and are motivated to go deep into the World-Cup style event.

“At the same time, obviously they're not oblivious to what's happening,” he told a media conference call Thursday.

Asked if staging a tournament during the pandemic was worth it, Vanney replied: “it's a tough one.”

“I don't know. For me, if it's my call, there's a lot of things at play here,” added the father of four. “I have my concerns for our guys and for our team and our families and all that kind of stuff. But we're doing it. And if we're going to go do it, we're going to go do it with the intent to be successful.”

Still, what is going on south of the border is worrying.

“The challenge that we all have on the human side of the group (is) we see what's going on down in the U.S.,” Vanney said. “People are not taking things serious and it's completely, in a lot of ways, out of control. And with very little leadership going on down there, outside of the bubble that is whatever MLS is trying to create.

“The problem is the bubble is only as good as what gets into the bubble. And that's obviously becoming an issue, which is concerning for all of us. Our guys are very aware of it. Are they concerned? Yes. Are they right to be concerned? Yes, I guess.”

The league said Wednesday that two FC Dallas players tested positive upon arrival Saturday at the league's host hotel in Florida. Another four tested positive within the last few days.

The entire Dallas party went into isolation pending additional testing. While teams are staying in the same hotel, they are supposed to be isolated from other squads.

The Columbus Dispatch, citing a source, reported Thursday that a Columbus player had also tested positive in Florida. The Crew arrived Sunday.

Vanney says his team wants to “the best of our ability” create its own bubble with the MLS bubble.

“What we can control is what we do,” he said. “That's the first and foremost thing that we've got to try to do.”

Vanney says all MLS players coming into the bubble bear a responsibility to do the right thing leading into entering the controlled environment.

“I think some players have failed in some ways of keeping themselves quarantined and away from what's going on around them and not bringing it into the bubble ... The problem is we all rely on each other. That's the way this works.”

Florida reported a record 10,109 new cases Thursday, more than all the cases reported to date in Norway (8,865) according to the world Health Organization.

Toronto is bringing 29 players - all of its first-team players with the exception of rookie forward Ifunanyachi Achara, who is gone for the season after tearing his anterior cruciate ligament in practice Friday.

Star striker Jozy Altidore, who has been training on his own while fulfilling his mandated quarantine after returning from his home in Florida, is due to rejoin the full team Friday for practice.

Vanney said they will be careful with his return, saying it would be asking a lot to be ready for the first game.

The Vancouver Whitecaps were slated to leave Wednesday. But their departure was postponed after two inclusive tests that later turned out to be negative. The Whitecaps were undergoing additional tests Thursday.

The Montreal Impact, who open July 9 against the New England Revolution, were slated to leave Thursday.

While the Canadian MLS teams head south to the COVID hot spot of Florida, NHL teams reportedly will be coming the other way to play.

Canada, Vanney said, seems to have “a lot better control of the situation.”

“To be able to go into that environment as a team would be a lot more comfortable than going down to what has essentially become the epicentre of the virus,” he said. “So for sure, that (coming to Canada) is a smart move.”

In the more than three months since the Toronto Raptors stepped off the court, the players have been scattered abroad.

Besides regular weight checks and virtual workouts, it's been on them to stay in shape in less than ideal conditions. In these unprecedented times, many players said it's been the longest they've gone without playing.

Coach Nick Nurse - who had noticed a few weeks ago how fit Marc Gasol appeared on team Zoom calls - still didn't know what to expect when his team convened last week in Naples, Fla., to hopefully resume their quest for a second consecutive NBA championship.

“Players look fantastic, I mean absolutely,” Nurse said on a conference call Tuesday. “When you see them with the eyeball test they look great.

“I came in here open-minded. I didn't know if we were going to be not really in the right frame of mind or whatever. . . But I am pleasantly surprised with the frame of mind, I am pleasantly surprised with the conditioning, and I just think you have a bunch of guys who have a high care factor.

“They love to play, they're concerned about getting better individually, about their own careers, it just seems like they are doing a really professional job. I just think there is a strong love of the game there for a lot of these guys.”

Gasol, who missed 28 games this season with a hamstring injury, and veteran guard Kyle Lowry have looked noticeably leaner in recent photos circulating on social media.

“The chiselled Marc. Cut up. He looks great,” Nurse said of the big Spaniard.

Nurse said as highly as he already thinks of the cerebral Gasol, his improved fitness is motivating for Raptors teammates, might get him a few more rebounds a night and could give his legs more life down the stretch of games.

“If his conditioning improves him as a player it's going to be a super added bonus for us,” Nurse said.

Raptors guard/forward Norm Powell called the physical change in Gasol “drastic.”

“I make fun of him all the time, looking like a soccer player in Barcelona,” Powell laughed. “He looks great, man, he's moving great, he's feeling great.”

Powell and Gasol have a tennis match scheduled for the next couple of days.

“Hopefully I'll still be able to give him a run for his money,” Powell said.

Because of Canada's requirement of a 14-day quarantine period for people entering the country, the Raptors were the first team to arrive in Florida ahead of next month's restart at Disney World.

Despite the Raptors' positive mindset, Powell said there was some trepidation travelling to Florida, which has seen a startling surge in COVID-19 cases. The more than 6,000 new cases reported Tuesday pushed the total over 150,000 in the Sunshine State. Deaths have climbed past 3,500.

More than 8,500 new cases were recorded on three consecutive days late last week.

The NBA announced last week that 16 players had tested positive for the coronavirus. ESPN reported Tuesday that the Nuggets had closed their practice facility after positive tests within Denver's group travelling to Orlando.

Brooklyn's Spencer Dinwiddie and DeAndre Jordan have also tested positive. Jordan won't be with the team when it resumes play while Dinwiddie is still experiencing symptoms, so his status is uncertain.

Powell said he's not particularly concerned about his well-being or that of his teammates, because the Raptors are following coronavirus safety guidelines “to a T.”

“I'm concerned about it just from a general standpoint of numbers increasing,” Powell said. “Outside (the NBA's planned quasi-bubble), I'm very concerned about just how dangerous it is. I'm more concerned about my family members that are out, having to deal with going out in public, going back to work and putting themselves in danger of catching the virus.”

A week into what could be three months in Florida, Nurse said the Raptors have managed to stave off homesickness and boredom.

“The first week has gone by in a snap of a finger. That's a really good sign,” he said.

The coaches are up early, and spend all day in the gym, with players arriving in staggered groups of four to practise - one player and two coaches per net.

“The days go by pretty quickly, we're trying to mix in some days off, we're trying to mix in a lot of different activities,” he said.

The team had a barbecue recently. They play ping-pong and pool.

“There are a few other things we're trying to mix in, too. I don't really sense much anxiety or people worrying about, 'Man, this is going to be a long time,”' he said. “They seem really good. You can ask me that again in a month if you want. I've said that a lot, how much I've missed coaching these guys. I just sense that these guys like being around each other and like to play.”

The Raptors were 46-18 and second in the East when the league shuttered on March 11. They tip off the restart on Aug. 1 versus the Los Angeles Lakers, and face among the toughest eight-game seeding schedule of the 22 teams that will be in Orlando.

“I like the schedule, I think it's great to see the Lakers again, (No. 1) Milwaukee again, just to get a feel for them again,” he said. “We're playing really quality teams, I think every team we've got is a playoff team, so that's going to be obviously those are good teams, so I like it.”","Players look fantastic, I mean absolutely,' Nurse says as Raptors reconvene",3,0.4383169556417158
394,"Kyle Lowry leads in his own inimitable fashion. He is a bit prickly and something of a contrarian, not one to suffer fools gladly, and completely unwilling to bend to authority when he feels something is amiss. It makes him the perfect leader for this group of Raptors in this most unusual of NBA seasons: a veteran who questions everything that he feels needs to be questioned, someone the other players want to follow because of what he does on the court and, really, the conscience of the team. Ha arrived at the NBA’s Florida campus on the Disney grounds in excellent shape and ready to work. He showed up having played a significant role in the entire operation — from medical testing protocols to living conditions — and if he’s ready to go and content, the whole organization is ready to take its lead from him. For a team chasing a second straight championship, having the undisputed alpha male on board is immeasurably important. “I think Kyle is an incredibly smart, intelligent person, so when something isn’t quite right he’s going to bring it to your attention,” coach Nick Nurse said Monday. “I’m good with that. Listen, this is a partnership and a communication thing. It’s ‘we’ trying to get to some place. Feedback is important.” Lowry is certainly going to give it. In all matters. As a member of the players’ association competition committee, he worked with the league in setting up every facet of life for the 22 teams that are now gathered near Orlando for the resumption of the suspended season later this month. He was involved in developing testing protocols, scheduling, what is allowed and what’s not, and has made it clear to his teammates how important that is. He is the franchise’s conduit to a healthy existence. “It was interesting to come up with some of the concepts and to talk that over, and understand (not just) what we’re trying to do but how we’re trying to do it, and make sure that it’s done the right way for all the players, coaches, and it’s (as safe as) we possibly can do it,” Lowry said in his first group interview since the league suspended the season in March.  “I think that we’ve done a good job so far with the safety aspects, the health aspects. I think there’s definitely going to be some adjustments that need to be made, but that’s the one thing about our league and our professionals, is that we make adjustments on the fly and we’re able to.” So far, Lowry’s been more than pleased with how things are going and the Raptors have been more than pleased with his actions — on and off the court. They want him to lead and they need him to be the same player who helped Toronto to a championship more than a year ago. In the latter regard, they’ve never had a healthier, more rested Lowry going into the playoffs than they have now and they plan to ride him hard. “He’s just smarter in that way, and I think he’s got tremendous confidence,” Nurse said. “And I think as well he knows he’s got to be kind of a main cog, right? … You know he’s always going to play hard and make the defensive plays, but he’s got to be a main factor in the offence and he kind of carries himself that way this year a lot more.” There is an undeniable joy to the way Lowry conducts himself on the court, even if it is sometimes masked in an intensity that’s off the charts. The way he plays — taking charges and making big shots when he has to, but ceding the spotlight when that’s needed, too — rubs off on his teammates and now that he’s back among them, he’s whole again. He loved the break to spend time with his wife and two young sons at their Philadelphia home, but he’s happy to be back on the court with his peers. “You wanted to be more careful. You wanted to be in a situation where you want it to be safe, and understand that you have to be safe with your family,” he said. “But right now, it feels great to be able to get back on the basketball floor with your guys, your teammates — kind of getting the camaraderie back together and being around, and knowing that you’re about to do your job.” And safely. First and foremost, safely. “I think our protocols and our health and safety measures have been top notch. I think this thing will work perfectly,” he said. “The league, the players’ association, (have done) a phenomenal job of making sure that we’re doing everything that we can possibly do to make sure that we’re healthy, we’re safe and we’re in an environment where we can be successful and do our jobs at a high level.” And if he’s a bit thorny at times — like the four or so instances where he mocked reporters in a 13-minute conversation — that’s divorced a bit from his persona as a teammate. “I think he’s only thorny with you guys,” Nurse joked. “He is in tremendous shape. He’s practising hard, shooting the ball at an incredible rate. He looks great. I haven’t sensed the thorniness, so there you go.”","How Kyle Lowry, the Raptors’ undisputed alpha male, helped write the rules for the NBA’s return",3,0.23837467516202382

Pascal Siakam has watched the number of COVID-19 cases climb in the United States, particularly in Florida, where the Toronto Raptors convened more than a week ago.

But the Raptors forward feels that, with the team carefully following the NBA coronavirus protocols, he and his teammates are as safe there as they would be anywhere.

“Obviously Florida is one of (the U.S. states) that's pretty high at the moment, but . . . the team has been doing a fantastic job in terms of making sure we're kind of isolated, ”Siakam said Friday during a videoconference. “Obviously, you're kind of scared seeing the cases rise but you trust the team's going to do everything, the NBA is going to do everything to make sure we're safe.”

Because of Canadian guidelines that required people arriving from out of country to self-isolate for two weeks, the Raptors went to Naples, Fla., to prepare for the July 30 season restart. Toronto and the 21 other teams in the restart will centralize at Disney World in Orlando between next Tuesday and Thursday.

The NBA chose Florida before COVID-19 exploded in that state. There were nearly 9,500 new cases of the virus Friday, a day after topping a record-10,000 new cases.

“But at the end of the day, even being home and going to the grocery store is not that safe,” Siakam said. “So we've just got to do everything, do our best in making sure we have everything in place for us to be as safe as possible and hopefully we get the season back and it goes as smoothly as possible.”

Siakam, who was averaging a career-high 23.6 points a night when the season shut down March 11, figures he went three months without playing or even shooting a basketball, his longest break since taking up the game in high school.

“During the summertime I usually take like two weeks break tops,” he said.

Since the Raptors all went to their various homes during the coronavirus lockdown, the 26-year-old forward said it was great to finally see his teammates last week.

“It kind of feels like training camp again and the beginning of the season, you're excited seeing guys and playing on the floor and stuff,” he said.

The Raptors are still limited to four players on the court at once, each shooting on their own basket. They'll resume normal practice when they move to Disney World next week. They could be there for up to three months if they have another long post-season run.

It's an unprecedented situation, but one OG Anunoby believes the Raptors can adapt to.

“I think we're all going through the same thing, so we'll all just adjust as it goes on,” he said. “It may be uncomfortable at first but we know these are the circumstances you have to deal with right now. I think yeah, we'll just figure it out as we go.”

The six-foot-nine Anunoby was having a terrific season when the coronavirus brought the sports world to its knees. He'd been looking forward to the post-season after missing last year's championship run - he had his appendix removed right before the playoffs tipped off.

“I wish I could have played, but now I can this year,” he said. “So yeah, I'll use it as motivation and hopefully play well, (and hope) we reach all our goals.”

Anunoby said he spent the three-month break working on shooting, handling the ball and passing. He also spent of a lot of time getting stronger in the weight room.

He didn't pick up any new hobbies during the down time, but has enjoyed doing his own cooking.

What's his favourite meal to cook?

“Depends what I'm trying to eat for dinner,” he deadpanned, before adding his favourite meal is shrimp linguine.

The NBA restart has been a polarizing issue among players coming amid the racial unrest in the U.S. A few prominent players such as Dwight Howard have said it's not the time to focus on basketball.

But the NBA plans to make social and racial justice a theme of the restart, and Anunoby said the players can have an impact.

“I think just spreading awareness, letting people know what's going on. . . speaking up, people are doing stuff in their cities and their states,” he said. “So just using our platform.”

The Raptors, who were second in the Eastern Conference when the season shut down, will face the Los Angeles Lakers on Aug. 1 in their first of eight seeding-round games.

Toronto FC pushed back its departure to Florida for the MLS is Back Tournament to Saturday, saying more time was needed to complete pre-travel COVID-19 testing.

The MLS team had been scheduled to leave by charter Friday. Toronto opens the World Cup-style tournament on July 10 against D.C. United.

The New York Red Bulls also delayed their Friday departure, saying a staff member had produced an inconclusive COVID-19 test result. It said all other staff and players had tested negative on Thursday.

The Red Bulls said they would reschedule their flight once all the test results were confirmed.

Toronto did not immediately respond to a request for more information about its test result issue.

While some teams are having issues getting to Florida, establishing a secure MLS bubble there has also proved challenging.

Six players from FC Dallas and one from Columbus Crew SC have already tested positive in the Sunshine State. They have been isolated and are receiving care while the other members of their delegations are in quarantine pending more testing.

Major League Soccer had required teams to arrive in Florida no later than a week before their first game at the tournament, which runs July 8 to Aug. 11 at Disney's Wide World of Sport Complex in the Orlando area. But issues with test results have caused several delays.

Nashville SC delayed its Florida flight until Friday due to delays in getting results of its pre-travel screening tests.

The Vancouver Whitecaps were slated to fly Wednesday but held off after the inconclusive COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test results required follow-up tests.

The club said subsequent test results were confirmed to be negative. Still the Whitecaps postponed their flight to permit additional testing.

Toronto was forced to call off training Wednesday after problems getting test results in time.

FC Dallas made it to Florida last Saturday, only to have two players test positive upon their arrival at the league's host hotel. Four other players tested positive soon after.

All six were assessed and moved to the isolation area of the hotel where they continue to receive “remote care from a health-care provider,” the league said.

Coincidentally, Vancouver and Dallas meet Thursday in the first match at the tournament for both.

On Thursday, Columbus confirmed that one of its players had tested positive in Florida.

The Montreal Impact arrived Thursday. They open next Thursday against the New England Revolution.

Eleven other teams had arrived in Florida as of Thursday: San Jose Earthquakes, Orlando City, Dallas, Columbus, Minnesota United, FC Cincinnati, Chicago Fire, Inter Miami, New York City FC, Philadelphia Union and New England Revolution.

While all 25 teams are staying in the same hotel, they are not supposed to have contact with each other.

League protocols include regular screening, testing, social distancing, personal protective equipment and a mandatory quarantine for all individuals upon arrival at the hotel until they have a negative test.

MLS has been on hiatus since March 12 when play was suspended two weeks into its season.

Four months to the day after COVID-19 shut down the NBA, the Toronto Raptors were finally back on the floor together.

The Raptors , who'd been based in Naples, Fla., for the past two weeks, but limited in practice to one player per hoop, took the floor for the first time Saturday at Walt Disney World for the NBA's restart after the team passed its COVID-19 tests.

It felt partly like the first day of training camp, they said. But also a little like the NBA champions had never been apart.

“For the most part it was really good . . . the trust factor really, really showed up,” coach Nick Nurse said. “A lot of guys are doing a lot of things that we normally do, just right from the get-go here which was great.

“Obviously there was some rust and some things that stick out that you have to keep an eye on, or that we're going to have to change, but from a starting point it seems like a really good jumping off point today for us.”

The defending NBA champions made the two-hour trip from Naples on Thursday in style, pulling into Disney World in two black buses that, unique to the Raptors , had “Black Lives Matter” painted in huge white block letters.

They were immediately tested upon arrival in the NBA semi-bubble, which is home to 22 teams. They were tested again at 7 p.m. local time on Friday, then got the all-clear Saturday at 10 a.m.

Nurse said the testing protocol has become the new normal.

“I think the first couple times we did it here and certainly going way back to March 11 (the day the league suspended play), when we went off and got tested, your level of anxiety was a lot higher then for sure,” Nurse said. “But I think it's always: cross your fingers, knock on wood, good thoughts, all that stuff every time.”

The Raptors , who tip off the eight-game seeding round on Aug. 1 versus the Los Angeles Lakers, could be at Disney World for the next three months. Nurse packed his guitar. Marc Gasol arrived with his own Nespresso coffee machine. The players checked into rooms decorated with family photos - courtesy of Raptors staff.

Pascal Siakam said he spent the 36 hours of hotel quarantine playing video games, and thinking about “being ready mentally and being excited about being back together as a team.

“We just wanna play, man. I miss playing basketball. It definitely felt like a basketball atmosphere, and that's all I really care about.”

Nurse said he felt his way through the first practice he'd coached in four months.

“I had some thoughts about what the structure of the practice would look like and we did it totally different than we normally would,” he said. “Again just based on the situation I think it's important for us to play, but I also think it's important to kind of ease in or taper in a little bit because we're conscious of health in general.”

The coach, who'd raved last week about the fitness level of his players, went heavier than he'd expected to, and “I just told the guys to please self-monitor and let's not let's not get carried away, we got a long way to go here today.”

Siakam said while there was some rust, the Raptors , who were second in the Eastern Conference when the league shut down, were all excited to be back on the floor together.

“That's what you wanna see, you wanna see people wanting to play,” he said. “It doesn't matter how long you were off, once you get on that floor, the competitive spirit comes out and everyone wants to win, and that's what you wanna see from a team.”

Fred VanVleet said there was a “first day of school type” feeling for the entire team.

“We've got to flush some things out these next couple of weeks and get ready to play, but kind of take a marathon approach still, we've still got a long way to go,” the guard said.

In Naples, the Raptors hadn't left the hotel grounds except for practice. They had gotten in a few rounds of golf and tennis games on the hotel grounds.

Siakam got a new appreciation for tennis.

“I love tennis. I watch tennis all the time. Even back home, I used to watch tennis a lot,” he said. “I thought it was fairly easy to be honest until I got there. They're definitely some tough athletes in the things that they do. I definitely respect it more. It's hard. I don't think it's for me. Marc is pretty good, actually. I feel like Marc is definitely the best that I have seen play.”

The Raptors will have a chance to explore their new digs in the next few days.

“I think there will be a little bit more stuff for us to do as time goes by, and everybody gets tested and safe and locked in, I think we'll have more things to do,” VanVleet said.

Florida has been ravaged by COVID-19 in the past few weeks. The Sunshine State has topped 250,000 cases with about 10,300 new cases reported on Saturday.

VanVleet said there's a greater sense of safety in the NBA bubble.

“When we were in Naples, we couldn't control everybody else,” he said. “I think everybody inside of this bubble is under the same guidelines, so that's probably the biggest difference.”

402,"TORONTO -- Ontario Premier Doug Ford says that municipalities won’t have to wait long to find out what their share will be of the billions in federal funding that was announced on Thursday.

The Liberal government has said that it will provide provinces and territories with $19 billion in funding to help them restart their economies in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic with at least some of that money earmarked for municipalities and transit providers facing large operational deficits.

Speaking with reporters during a press conference in Kitchener on Friday afternoon, Ford said that his government is in the process of “crossing the Ts and dotting the Is” on the allocation of the money right now and expects to be “rolling it over the next week.”

He did not directly answer a question about whether Toronto would receive enough money to cover the entire $1.35 billion shortfall it expects to face by the end of 2020 but did say that his government will do everything it can to “cover as much” of the operational deficits faced by Ontario’s 444 cities and towns as possible.

“I want to work with the City of Toronto. They are the big white elephant in the room of the 444 (cities and towns) and I understand that,” he said, noting that the losses faced by the TTC alone make Toronto’s challenges particularly acute. “But everyone needs money. We are going to split it up equally and make sure that the people that need it get the money.”

Ford has previously indicated that Ontario will receive about $7 billion in funding from the feds but that money also has to go towards a number of other areas, including expanding testing and contact tracing and acquiring personal protective equipment.

For his part, Tory has said that he is “cautiously optimistic” that the city will get enough money to stave off major cuts but he has also said that it would be “premature to declare victory” without “reading the fine print.”

On Friday, Ford credited city officials for finding more than $500 million in savings in Toronto’s budget and reducing the expected deficit from $1.9 billion to $1.35 billion.

He said that while it would be “hogwash” for any municipality to suggest that it can’t find savings in its budget, the financial challenges faced by the municipal level of government as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic are very real.

In Toronto, the TTC alone faces a $700 million budgetary pressure, mostly due to reduced ridership during the COVID-19 pandemic. The city also expects to lose out on $249.2 million in budgeted Municipal Land Transfer Tax revenue in 2020 as a result of real-estate slowdown that accompanied the pandemic.

“We have to work together,” Ford said. “We are going to do everything we can to cover as much as we can in all areas and I just want to thank the municipalities that have been prudent fiscal managers.”",Ontario premier won't say if province will cover $1.35B deficit faced by Toronto,2,0.27522536346579907
404,"A smart city needs all the bells and whistles — the sensors and signals, computers and robotics that its skin-and-bones architecture demands.

But its blood — its human plasma — is the data of our lives.

And should Toronto attempt another smart-city project over the next decade, it’s the control and distribution of that human data — its governance — that will make or break the venture, experts say.

“A smart city at its core is about getting use out of data and limiting harm from that data,” says Richard Lachman, director of research development at Ryerson University’s faculty of communication and design.

Thus, Lachman says, a successful smart city in Toronto 2030 will likely find its roots in the failed Sidewalk Labs project in the Port Lands, which finally fizzled out in May after years of hype.

That Google-backed plan was sunk in large part by its narrow focus on technology — the skin and bones of a smart city — rather than the data that would course through its chips and circuits, he says.

That fixation on unfettered technology fed by unchecked human data caused many to fear their privacy would be imperilled and to balk at the whole enterprise, Lachman says.

“As a result of that — the backlash against Sidewalk and then them pulling out — we’re able to see much more (what we) need to do first,” he says.

“We need to figure out what benefits we want and what risks there are and what we’re willing to do in order to gain extra utility.”

While most experts agree the privacy of data is paramount, there is also a strong belief that Toronto’s future could rest largely on growing a smart city over the decade and that there is both the untapped real estate and sociological climate here to do so.

At its core, a smart city spreads a net of electronic hardware, algorithms, apps and technologies that allow for the tracking of information and the use of that data to affect — hopefully — positive changes.

“It’s really about being able to track more information and then make more intelligent decisions about where we deliver services and what kind of services we want to deliver,” Lachman says.

The COVID-19 crisis provides an unfortunate but apt example of the dilemma presented in that smart city scenario.

That is the possibility of using cellphone location data to track a person’s movements and interactions over a set period time in the event they test positive for the virus.

“Six months ago I think all privacy activists, all technology activists would have said ‘that’s crazy, I don’t want all my movements tracked,’ ” Lackman says. “But because of COVID I can say ‘I do want that benefit.’ ”

The key to a successful smart city then is to — transparently and with force of law — lay out what data can be tracked, in which situations, who gets to use it and for how long, Lachman says.

Where marketers can stalk every keystroke or credit card purchase to hawk mattresses or patio furniture on your internet feed, a city has far more weighty fare to deal with, he says.

“As a city we connect with law enforcement, we connect with public health, we connect with immigration status,” Lachman says.

“So we have to be much more deliberate and say if we want a public health benefit, like contact tracing, then I want to limit where that data goes and not make it available to, say, law enforcement or public school truancy officers.”

Data can allow the city to automatically change traffic lights or highway signage to instantly ease traffic flow or to close roads to automobiles and create pedestrian malls and patios.

It can also be instrumental in making long-term decisions about transit routes or bike lane construction.

“It’s just there can also be other things that we don’t want driven by that data,” Lachman says.

For example, while using cellphones to track a motorist’s speed might be permissible and even desirable in determining where to build traffic calming structures, no one would want to see speeding tickets showing up in the mail because of that surveillance, he says.

Indeed, Lachman says, many of the decisions on data dissemination should be made at the individual level in a smart city scenario, with people being able to enter or withdraw from data streams at will.

“You may be a person of colour and you don’t believe carding has gone away, you might not want to share the same data as some other members of society,” Lachman says. “Those rights and that reality need to be protected.”

While such opt-out options can weaken any data set’s predictive power — making intelligent decisions less certain — they are essential to gain a consensus that would allow smart city plans to go forward here, Lachman says.

However the governance of such issues is structured, a smart city should certainly be built here, says the University of Toronto’s Tamer El-Diraby, who has studied such projects intensely.

El-Diraby, an expert in infrastructure asset management, says smart city growth is inevitable around the world.

And, he says, Toronto would lose its ability to lead the country economically and wade into the urban backwaters globally should it forgo a smart city project.

If it were to get out front, however: “it will drag Ontario, it will drag Canada with it,” he says.

“And more importantly ... it will be the shining example of the best way to do this. It’s our duty to jump in and make the smart city example.”

El-Diraby sees three layers to a smart city — the first and, surprisingly, easiest being the Jetsons-like hardware it would operate.

“That includes the internet of things, the ... driverless car, the smart bridge, the smart sidewalk and so forth,” he says, adding many of these technologies are currently available.

The second layer, El-Diraby says, consists of the ever-improving data streams that will fuel and direct the hardware — data that was rife with errors in the past.

“Now we have this (improved) data and now we have the ability to be on the cusp of major breakthroughs with what to do with our data,” he says.

“And that inherently means we can help the city to be more efficient ... more sustainable and the communities to be more informed.”

But the third layer, El-Diraby says, is the most important though most uncertain and challenging — one he labels governance and community empowerment.

In this more ephemeral layer, he says, lies the real potential for Toronto to achieve enormous technological and economic advancements through the opportunities — many not yet dreamed of — the smart city will offer as it evolves.

“The smart city will open new horizons for new business models, new companies, new industries,” he says.

“And if we are in a reactive mood to these new developments then we will be missing the post.”

A smart city evangelist, El-Diraby uses as an example from late 18th-century Britain to illustrate his point.

Then, he says, a cabal of English businessmen and economists predicted the growing city of London’s economy would be stuck fast in horse manure in a matter of years, even as the automobile was making its noisy debut.

“And eight years later Henry Ford completely removed this fantastic, smart (manure) estimation because a complete new horizon opened,” El-Diraby says.

His point is not so much that smart city denialists have their heads stuck in horse manure. It’s more that the car also brought with it mammoth yet unforeseeable new industries — such as auto insurance and repair, highway construction, courier services, drive-throughs, motels and long-distance trucking to name a few.

In the same way, Toronto would miss out on the industries and innovations that smart cities will surely inspire.

“If we end up (concentrating) on what the smart cities will look like or how the data is going to be available or not available and neglect this huge opportunity, Canada will be left behind,” El-Diraby says.

“We need to encourage the community at all various levels to take on this new advantage.”

El-Diraby looks to the lowly pothole to illustrate his thinking.

He says a smart city network of driverless cars could detect and report any encountered pothole in a matter of nanoseconds.

“But what would they do? They will send a request to the city to fix that pothole,” he says.

“How long will it take the city to fix that pothole?”

The answer, by current standards, is likely many quadrillions of nanoseconds (or about 11 days).

“But we could have a new business model for running the streets where they can provide instantaneous service to (the smart-car operator) instead of waiting for the city to do that,” El-Diraby says.

“We open an industry for street management that never existed before.”

Just as governments are traditionally slow with pothole repairs, El-Diraby also worries that they are not nimble enough to be custodians of the data a smart city needs to run full throttle.

“When it comes to cities, data is in the hands of government, which is the slowest player of them all,” he says.

“When it comes to the municipal, city level, the data is not there, it is not reliable and the government does not have a model, a plan, a future where they will not only adapt to the evolution, but will make that evolution.”

El-Diraby says data would be better off handled by a separate entity that could collect and disseminate it with the same efficiency that banks have to run financial transactions.

Data needs to be instantaneous and agile, if smart city visions like this are to be are to be achieved, El-Diraby says.

“If you have this data about my phone, but also you have data about my schedule and also data about the weather but also more data about the current pollution, you can advise me about what to do,” he says.

“Maybe you can tell me ‘if you walk today from here to here, then instead of taking a taxi you’ll be able to take the subway and you’ll save this money and this much emissions.’ ”

More than many other municipalities, Toronto is in a position to build a smart city from the ground up, says Natasha Tusikov, an assistant professor in York University’s social science department, who has studied the subject extensively.

Many cities embarking on such projects, especially in Europe, are fully built out and will have to retrofit new technologies into densely packed streets and neighbourhoods, Tusikov says.

“Toronto is different because it (has) a large swath of former industrial land with really nothing on it,” she says, referring to the Port Lands.

“Land where an entity could start fresh.”

Tusikov, however, says a smart Toronto should respond to the needs and desires of its residents, rather than offer the splashy, but often superfluous features that Sidewalk Labs was schilling.

“The way Sidewalk Labs approached it was to create a sensor-embedded smart city that would collect a lot of data and address issues that maybe people didn’t think were priorities,” she says.

“They started with what they could build or sell, instead of real problems.”

And rather than the Sidewalk Labs model — where Google would own all the innovation and toss local industries bit work — a new smart city here could spread the wealth, Tusikov says.

“A different vision would be to have a variety of ... entities, maybe some non-profit, local or multinational,” she says.

“And all of the different entities could provide different products and services.”

In the vast, built stretches of Toronto, smart city technologies could help solve transit and housing problems, Tusikov says.

But such enduring problems would still require the multi-level political commitment and funding that they’ve lacked for decades.

“Affordable housing? You can’t simply solve that by adding technology,” Tusikov says.

Regardless of its eventual configurations, a smart city might find a warmer sociological environment in Toronto than in many other cities, says David Soberman, Canadian National Chair in strategic marketing at the U of T’s Rotman School of Management.

Soberman, an expert in Big Data, agrees that privacy will of paramount importance in any smart-city project.

But Toronto may sit in a sort of Goldilocks zone between a resistance to any intrusions on personal information and an accepted or enforced lack of privacy that exists in other nations.

“So we’re in a middle ground and when you’re in a middle ground it gives you a lot of chance to experiment,” Soberman says.

“You can experiment with collecting information, you can do tests to see what people will accept. (It) gives us a chance to experiment and learn and to find ways of using this information that people and Canadian will find acceptable.”

As well, Soberman says, Canadians have a greater respect for government — a belief that it would protect privacy rights in particular — than people in many other nations.

“I think that creates a positive environment. If something’s got the stamp of approval by the government, people are going to feel protected,” he says.

In the end, Lachman says the experience of COVID-19 in hard hit Toronto might well make residents here more open to the idea of group tracking, and it’s potential to improve lives.

“We’re thinking of one another, we’re realizing our group decision making might affect one another,” he says.

But that does not diminish the need for intense, expert debate on smart-city governance, prior to the first sensor embed.

“There absolutely may be an appetite,” Lachman says.

“What I want to caution is you don’t make a decision with a gun to your head.”

405,"The stories emerging from long-term-care facilities across Ontario are nothing short of harrowing. Nearly half of COVID-19 deaths in Canada are linked to long-term care homes.

In a recent report on five nursing homes in Ontario, details emerged of elder abuse and neglect, unsanitary conditions and severe burnout among personal support workers (PSWs) in the throes of the pandemic.

But the challenges in the way Ontario cares for its seniors extend beyond recent months. PSWs in nursing homes feel chronically undervalued by the health-care system, receiving low pay for long hours and strenuous working conditions.

The Star asked students and recent graduates specializing in senior care and public policy what they see as solutions to Ontario’s nursing home crisis.

Lamia Aganagic, University of Toronto

We’re facing a big demographic challenge in Ontario. The number of seniors in need of care is expected to increase significantly by 2030. Provincial governments in particular are facing higher costs and spending on service provisions because we’re seeing an increasing number of seniors with one or more chronic conditions. You may find that patients are not only dealing with dementia and Alzheimer’s, but also a mobility impairment or mental illness. This all impacts the care they need to receive.

One way to alleviate the challenges is to look to virtual care; care that generally happens over the phone or through video. The Ontario Telemedicine Network (OTN), which functions as a virtual-care network in Ontario, does this well — but the system could be expanded significantly.

Virtual care becomes especially useful when considering things like patient transfers at long-term care homes (LTC). Senior patients being transferred from an LTC home to the emergency department are at an increased risk of death because they’re exposed to a whole bunch of other things on the way, and they may end up in a state that’s worse than when they left. These transfers are often unnecessary. With virtual care, doctors could identify patients who need a consultation, then notify their regional hospital, helping to reduce unnecessary transfers. In this way, virtual care works as a kind of preventative measure by eliminating unnecessary transfers and the risks associated with them.

Sara Clemens, University of Toronto

I’ve worked as a nurse and as a health-care aide in long-term care facilities. I’ve worked as a director of care and I’ve worked in policy and research for LTC homes. Certainly, low staffing and lack of resources is a major concern for this sector. This has been a problem for decades, but it’s become especially obvious during the COVID-19 pandemic.

We need to look at alternative models. Some of the recommendations for adequate staffing levels at these homes come from reports that are 20 years old. They’re outdated and don’t reflect our current reality. We’ve become accustomed to having fewer registered nurses in LTC homes, while we’ve seen acuity go up, meaning that people are coming into LTC homes with more illnesses, more medications and closer to death. So, although we’re seeing that individual residents need multiple people taking care of them, the number of registered nurses in these facilities have gone down.

Our government will feel the economic repercussions of this pandemic for a while, so we shouldn’t expect them to start pouring money into better funding for senior care. Instead we need to cost our solutions. We need to consider how many beds we can actually afford and then fund those beds at 100 per cent quality of care instead of underfunding more beds.

We need to look to robots and automation, and how they can be part of the solution. Our workers are overwhelmed physically and mentally. Automation that helps do certain aspects of their jobs — giving medication, assessing pain — will help staff infinitely. This way, we can stop tying quality of care to staffing levels and consider other factors that will help.

Meghan McMahon, University of Toronto

The pandemic has put a spotlight on the immediate and long-term problems facing LTC homes. There are at least three major issues we need to address in order to get back on track: pandemic preparedness, the regulatory framework and staffing levels, and investment in data and research.

We need to address pandemic preparedness in long-term care homes. We need to learn what went wrong in Ontario, what went right in other jurisdictions, and to have plans and the capacity in place to ensure the devastation that unfolded here doesn’t happen again. This means full-time pay and benefits for workers, PPE for all staff, capacity to isolate and cluster, and ways for family members to visit loved ones while maintaining safety in the home.

We also need to look closely at the legislation and regulatory frameworks that underpin this sector. We often hear criticism that senior care is the most heavily regulated sector — but it’s also underregulated in some ways. There are very few requirements, for example, on the supply and skill mix of staff in facilities. In Ontario, LTC homes are required to have a registered nurse on duty 24/7, but the rest of the staffing supply and skill mix is left to the individual facility to decide. Our staffing levels in Ontario are considerably lower than international recommendations, and this is in the context of a population that is elderly, frail and has increasingly complex care needs.

Lastly, we need to invest in data and research. We need data to help us understand what’s happening on the ground, which interventions are working for whom and where the gaps in quality care are. While we have publicly reported data on quality of care at LTC homes, we don’t have quality of life indicators. We don’t adequately capture things like resident experience or satisfaction with care. If anything, the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on resident isolation has revealed the importance of assessing and monitoring these issues. If we don’t have this data, we’re hindered in our ability to design effective systems.

Research is needed to inform the design and implementation of LTC solutions, drawing on the evidence of what’s worked and what’s failed elsewhere. We have a talented health research community in Canada and their skills can be harnessed to help fix LTC homes in the future.

Aaron St. Pierre, Laurentian University

Irrespective of the COVID-19 pandemic, there are several major problems facing senior care in Ontario. One of the biggest has to do with staffing and recruitment; there aren’t enough people taking care of the elderly.

In Ontario, we have a minimum wage for PSWs that’s a few dollars higher than standard minimum wage. Plenty of PSWs make little more than those amounts. So that’s one huge barrier that dissuades people, especially young people, from pursuing a career in this area. Given the work PSWs have to do — taking care of people at their most vulnerable — they deserve to make much more.

Organizations across the sector also need to think about how they recruit. Going to universities and colleges, doing the leg work to bring in more young people, would help significantly. Nursing students and even PSW students are not always aware of the jobs that might be available to them. Going directly to these places, informing students of their job options, would help resolve some of these major staffing issues.",Virtual care and other fixes for the COVID-19 long-term-care catastrophe,8,0.07155138822789708
408,"Uber Technologies Inc. pledged to double Black leadership by 2025, becoming the latest tech company to answer national calls for racial and economic justice with measurable goals.

Uber chief executive officer Dara Khosrowshahi plans to announce the target in a blog post on Friday. The ride-hailing company is also revamping its services to be more inclusive and equitable, while offering anti-bias training for riders and drivers. It will also tie executive compensation to diversity metrics and increase support for Black-owned businesses.

The moves are similar to those made by Microsoft Corp., Facebook Inc. and Google in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd and the burgeoning Black Lives Matter movement.

The largest U.S. tech companies are still heavily white and male, although the percentage of Black employees has increased slightly in recent years, according to company reports analyzed by Bloomberg.

San Francisco-based Uber increased Black employees to represent 9.3 per cent of the total U.S. workforce, according to the company’s 2019 diversity report. But just 3.3 per cent of leaders — those with a director title or higher — were Black.

Uber eliminated a quarter of its workforce in May in response to lower ride demand during the COVID-19 pandemic. That delayed the company’s 2020 diversity report to later this year, a spokeswoman said.

Khosrowshahi, an Iranian-born immigrant who has led Uber since 2017, said he’s optimistic the changes Uber is making will ensure people who work at, and with, the company will be treated equally. But he realizes sustained work on this is required.

“It is more important that we follow through, even after it feels like the outrage has cooled and business as usual has returned,” he wrote in the blog.

421,"TORONTO -- Jobs lost during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic are coming back – but not all at once, and not in the same order they disappeared.

Statistics Canada reported July 10 that more than 950,000 jobs were added in the country in June. While only a small fraction of the three million or so positions that were lost as lockdowns were imposed in March and April, the number represents a record increase as those measures are lifted.

""There's a lot of places that are still hiring amidst all the doom and gloom that we've been experiencing over the past few months,"" Carolyn Levy, president of the technologies division of staffing and recruitment agency Randstad Canada, told CTVNews.ca on Monday via telephone from Calgary.

Breaking down the numbers by industry yields clues into where the first wave of rebound hiring is taking place. More than 20 per cent of the added jobs were classified as wholesale and retail trade – with 16 per cent in accommodation and food services, 12 per cent in health care and social assistance, and eight per cent apiece in construction and manufacturing.

This suggests that the retail and restaurant workers who were among the first to be let go when their establishments were ordered to close were also among the first to be hired back when limited activity was allowed to resume.

There is still a long way to go before those sectors can be back to normal, though. In food services alone, it is believed that 400,000 Canadian jobs eliminated during the pandemic have yet to return. Many businesses in the broader service sector say they do not expect to ever return to pre-pandemic staffing levels.

Also notable, StatCan found, is that there were more wholesale jobs in Canada in June than there were in February, before the pandemic hit. Levy chalked this increase up to the surge in online shopping, which has left companies needing extra staff in warehouses and other parts of the supply chain.

On manufacturing, Levy said the increase could be due to companies retooling their lines to produce personal protective equipment or other items suddenly in demand due to the pandemic.

EMPLOYERS RETHINKING OLD ROLES

For the nearly 2.5 million Canadians who remain unemployed, though, knowing where hiring has recently happened only paints part of the picture. More helpful is information about where hiring is happening now.

According to the federal government's job bank, the most in-demand jobs right now are sales associates, administrative assistants and customer service representatives, followed by truck drivers, general farm workers and light-duty cleaners.

A popular website used by job-seekers to connect with employers is seeing similar patterns. Brendon Bernard, an economist with the Indeed Hiring Lab, wrote July 7 that retail and customer service jobs are among those that saw the biggest drop in new postings on Indeed earlier in the pandemic, and have since seen some of the biggest rebounds.

""Sectors narrowing the gap relatively quickly in recent weeks include ones featuring lower-paying positions, like retail, and customer service,"" he wrote.

""Areas posting roles with many mid-wage jobs have also seen noticeable bounce-backs, like construction, as well as education and instruction.""

Levy said that some employers are also creating new roles as they look to respond to their customers' needs during and after the pandemic. Opportunities created by this include more positions for financial advisers, she said, as well as an even greater demand for tech workers.

Postings on Indeed for higher-paying jobs have been slower to bounce back, Bernard said. Indeed has tracked two categories where new job postings have fallen off since early May – security and public safety, and aviation.

Bernard reported that the number of new job postings on Indeed as of July 3 was 21 per cent lower than it had been one year earlier. That gap had been as large as 70 per cent in mid-April. Smaller provinces, which have generally been less affected by COVID-19, have kept job posting levels closer to where they were in 2019 than larger provinces.

Levy said she is seeing employers increasingly show interest in hiring for temporary contract positions. This benefits them because it allows them to avoid making long-term commitments in an uncertain environment, she said, but can also be good for those looking for jobs because it gives them a chance to find work that they might not otherwise have.

""Companies have had to take a step back and start to reimagine how they have to work in this new normal,"" she said.

""Businesses have to look at what do we need to do to reskill, what do we need to do to retrain, given the way we operated our business four months ago is not the way it's going to be … from now on.""",Where the jobs are: Some sectors rebounding faster as Canada emerges from lockdown,0,0.5712326942175455

423,"Johnson & Johnson had a surprisingly strong second quarter and bumped up its 2020 forecast even after COVID-19 contributed to a 40% drop in U.S. medical device sales.

Growing pharmaceutical sales, also in the U.S., helped the world's biggest health products maker counter damage from the pandemic, which forced patients to delay surgeries.

Worldwide medical device sales fell 34% in the quarter to $4.29 billion, but company leaders told analysts on Thursday morning that the segment's performance got better each month in the quarter.

""We are seeing signs of recovery and while the next few months and quarters contain uncertainty, the long-term underlying fundamentals remain solid,"" Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk said.

J&J's medical device segment is vulnerable to economic downturns because many of its products are for elective surgeries like hip and knee replacements that can be postponed. Plus the virus forced hospitals to halt scheduled surgeries, and fear of catching COVID-19 kept many patients away from hospitals.

Customers also bought fewer skin health and beauty products, and that hurt J&J's consumer health business, which saw worldwide revenue fall 7% to $3.3 billion in the quarter.

But the company's pharmaceutical sales grew nearly 6% in the U.S. and 2% globally. The immune disorder drug Stelara and cancer drugs Darzalex and Imbruvica helped that segment.

Overall net income fell 35% to $3.63 billion for the New Brunswick, New Jersey, based maker of baby shampoo and biologic drugs. Adjusted earnings totalled $1.67 per share. Total revenue also fell 11% to $18.34 billion.

Industry analysts expected J&J to take a bigger hit from the pandemic, having projected per-share earnings of $1.49, and $17.61 billion in revenue.

J&J on Thursday said it expects 2020 earnings of $7.75 to $7.95 per share. That comes a few months after the company surprised investors by cutting its profit forecast for the year by about 15% and slashing its sales forecast because of the pandemic.

The new forecast tops Wall Street expectations on the top end. But it still falls short of the earnings of $9 per share or more that J&J predicted at the start of the year.

Analyst surveyed by FactSet are projecting per-share earnings of $7.75 per share.

Company leaders said Thursday that they expect to start human testing next week on a potential COVID-19 vaccine. They plan to start a study July 22 in Belgium and then expand to the U.S. the next week.

They hope to start a late-stage clinical trial, the final phase before a drugmaker seeks regulatory approval, in late September.

Our elders built this country and we reap the benefits of their hard work.

Yet not only are elders often overlooked, they face troubling levels of abuse from physical to financial to emotional.

And now, amid a global pandemic, seniors are bearing the brunt of the illness, made worse by further abuse. Outbreaks at retirement homes have been particularly devastating, and the consequences of public health advice to stay home and employ physical distancing mean many seniors are left more alone than ever.

Even worse, B.C.’s seniors advocate Isobel Mackenzie says the pandemic forcing many to remain isolated is increasing their likelihood of experience elder abuse.

• READ MORE: All your local, regional and national COVID-19 coverage in one place

“Recognizing the signs of elder abuse and knowing who to report it to is key.”

The provincial government recently announced $1.89 million in grants, $550,000 of which is going to Seniors First BC to try to help with the problem of elder abuse.

“We are using this funding to educate and protect seniors from malicious COVID-19 related frauds and scams that try to trick seniors into giving out their personal information online or over the phone,” executive director Rick Gambrel said. “We also run a seniors abuse and information line… a victim services program and referrals to an in-house lawyer.”

Elder abuse, including neglect, is defined as a single or repeated act, or a lack of appropriate action, that causes harm or distress to an older person.

It can take place in a senior’s home, a care facility or in the community, and often involves a person in a position of trust or a situation of dependency. The abuse can be physical, emotional, verbal, financial, sexual, spiritual or neglectful.

According to statistics from Seniors First BC, approximately eight per cent of seniors in B.C. experience some form of abuse, but this number may be even higher due to under-reporting. Pay attention to the elderly people in your lives and do your best to ensure elder abuse is not impacting them.

It’s the least we can do.

Premier Doug Ford says that municipalities won’t have to wait long to find out what their share will be of the billions in federal funding that was announced on Thursday.

The Liberal government has said that it will provide provinces and territories with $19 billion in funding to help them restart their economies in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic with at least some of that money earmarked for municipalities and transit providers facing large operational deficits.

Speaking with reporters during a press conference in Kitchener on Friday afternoon, Ford said that his government is in the process of “crossing the t’s and dotting the i’s” on the allocation of the money right now and expects to be “rolling it over the next week.”

He did not directly answer a question about whether Toronto would receive enough money to cover the entire $1.35 billion shortfall it expects to face by the end of 2020 but did say that his government will do everything it can to “cover as much” of the operational deficits faced by Ontario’s 444 cities and towns as possible.

Toronto Mayor John Tory had warned earlier this week that the city would have to begin implementing a series of “grim” cuts as early as later this summer without help from the other levels of governments.

“I want to work with the City of Toronto. They are the big white elephant in the room of the 444 (cities and towns) and I understand that,” Ford said on Friday, noting that the losses faced by the TTC alone make Toronto’s challenges particularly acute. “But everyone needs money. We are going to split it up equally and make sure that the people that need it get the money.”

Ford has previously indicated that Ontario will receive about $7 billion in funding from the feds but that money also has to go towards a number of other areas, including expanding testing and contact tracing and acquiring personal protective equipment.

For his part, Tory has said that he is “cautiously optimistic” that the city will get enough money to stave off major cuts but he has also said that it would be “premature to declare victory” without “reading the fine print.”

On Friday, Ford credited city officials for finding more than $500 million in savings in Toronto’s budget and reducing the expected deficit from $1.9 billion to $1.35 billion.

He said that while it would be “hogwash” for any municipality to suggest that it can’t find savings in its budget, the financial challenges faced by the municipal level of government as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic are very real.

At the same time, Ford said that it wouldn’t be fair not to share the money with cities and towns that might be facing less significant financial challenges.

In Toronto, the TTC alone faces a $700 million budgetary pressure, mostly due to reduced ridership during the COVID-19 pandemic. The city also expects to lose out on $249.2 million in budgeted Municipal Land Transfer Tax revenue in 2020 as a result of real-estate slowdown that accompanied the pandemic.

426,"The death toll from an increasing toxic drug supply killed 175 people in B.C. in June

B.C. has reached a grim milestone, seeing record numbers of illicit drug overdoses for a second straight month.

In June, nearly 12 people died of a fatal overdose every two days across the province for a total of 175 lives lost.

In the first six months of 2020, B.C. has seen 728 deaths due to the toxic street drug supply. That’s compared to 543 during the same time period last year.

A majority of the deaths, or 70 per cent, are people aged 19 to 49 years old.

Broken down by health authority, there have been 488 overdoses in Vancouver Coastal, 556 in Fraser Health, 254 in Interior Health, 296 on Vancouver Island and 115 in the Northern Health region.

Vancouver, Surrey and Victoria continue to see the lions share of overdose deaths.

The concerning death toll comes as the province continues to grapple with two ongoing health crisis: the COVID-19 pandemic and the overdose crisis.

In a statement, chief coroner Lisa Lapointe said that the novel coronavirus has limited access to harm reduction services and called on doctors to follow the province’s guidance on prescribing legal opioids to drug users to support those at risk of overdose on the toxic drug supply.

“For those using substances – opioids or otherwise – please make sure you use only in the presence of someone who will call for immediate help if you need it, use at an overdose prevention or supervised consumption site, and have your drugs checked before using, if you can,” Lapointe said.

“The drug supply in our province is highly toxic and the risk of using alone is too high. Buddying up could save your life.”

Following the 170 deaths in May, provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said the pandemic has worsened the toxicity of the street-level drug supply, exacerbated by social contact restrictions forcing many to use drugs alone.

In an emotional address, the top doctor urged family and friends to reach out to drug users in their lives.

“Check up on your friends. Check up on those people, those workmates that you have that you may not be seeing as often. This is another time while we need to, while physically apart, connect with each other and support each other.”

More to come.

Imagine that, over the past couple of months, you have devoured most of the food in your kitchen. You, your spouse, and your children are growing hungry. You drive to the local grocery store. But when you walk up to the entrance, an attendant says, “sorry, COVID-19 restrictions require us to only allow 50 people into our store at a time. We are already at our legal 50-person capacity. Please sign your name to the bottom of this waiting list and we’ll call you next week when it is your turn to enter the grocery store.”

You return home hungry.

Of course, we all recognize this scenario as absurd – some things cannot wait for another day. While following rules and taking precautions are necessary during a pandemic, essential services must continue for the good of society.

This denial of basic necessities is not so different from what is happening to people of faith throughout British Columbia. Although grocery stores, hospitals, and many other sectors of the economy deemed “essential” are not subject to a cap of 50 persons on their premises, this restriction continues to apply to worship services. But worship services are an essential service to hundreds of thousands of Christians, Jews, Sikhs, Muslims, and other faith groups across the province.

In the Bible, Jesus says that, “Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.” Christians require more than food, medical treatment, or employment income to thrive. Christians thrive by hearing the Word of God and by gathering together with fellow believers.

• READ MORE: B.C. faith leaders, Horgan discuss need for virtual religious ceremonies

• READ MORE: COVID-19: B.C. church services resume with public health limits

The Apostle Paul also describes how members of the church are like parts of the body. The human body cannot thrive if major parts of it are missing. Similarly, a church cannot thrive if a majority of its members are missing. Weekly, in-person worship services are a vital opportunity to hear this life-giving Word of God and participate in the sacraments.

The case for the essential nature of worship services was recently made in an open letter sent to Premier Horgan, Health Minister Dix, and Provincial Health Officer Henry. This request to Expand BC Worship Services was signed by 143 churches in British Columbia in early June. That letter, to date, remains unanswered.

Some people, perhaps including our leaders in British Columbia, may doubt that corporate worship services are essential, but this mentality betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of the Christian religion. Just as medical treatment is to the injured, food is to the hungry, and work is to the unemployment, so the participation in collective worship services – hearing the preaching of God’s word, receiving the promise of baptism, participating in holy communion, praising God collectively in song and prayer, and fellowshipping with other believers – is to the spiritually deprived Christian.

Although Christians can derive some benefit from online worship services or in small groups, such worship services are akin to feeding someone a bread-only diet for months. It will sustain a person for a while, but it will eventually result in serious health complications. Similarly, Christians are starving for the nourishment that comes from full worship services.

I recognize that, given the reality of COVID-19, mass gatherings remain limited in general. But worship services are not just typical gatherings. Nor are they hobbies akin to yoga. Although worship services are considered similar to concerts, sporting events, and festivals in the explicit order against mass gatherings, worship services are categorically different than these activities in that they are – or are supposed to be –constitutionally protected, and doubly so.

The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees the freedom of peaceful assembly and freedom of religion, both of which are seriously infringed upon by the limit of 50 people for worship services. According to these freedoms, British Columbians have a double constitutional right to attend religious worship services. They do not have a similar constitutional right to camp overnight, attend a movie theatre, dine at a restaurant, or stay in a hotel. Yet, Phase 3 of British Columbia’s Opening Plan removes restrictions on these activities, while maintaining the cap of 50 people at a worship service, even when some churches can seat thousands.

In light of the essential and Charter-protected nature of worship services, the leaders of British Columbia’s pandemic response should immediately change the Order of the Provincial Health Officer on Mass Gatherings to specifically allow for larger worship services. Raising the limit of people to 100 or allowing a certain percentage (e.g. 50%) of a church’s capacity to gather for worship would be a good first step, and in line with what other provinces are successfully doing.

As much of society re-opens around us, the provincial government must trust churches to operate safely and cautiously. It’s time for people of faith to declare that our spiritual food, distributed in weekly worship services, must not be rationed. It’s time for the provincial government to respect the freedom of the hundreds of thousands of people of faith in our province. It’s time to expand worship services in British Columbia.

428,"Jennifer Kuiken says cost of in vitro fertilization is too high for most people

Jennifer Kuiken, with husband Eric, has started a petition urging the provincial government to assist with coverage for in vitro fertilization. (Submitted photo)

An Abbotsford woman has started a petition to get in vitro fertilization (IVF) covered – at least in part – by the provincial government.

Jennifer Kuiken said she started the petition due to the prohibitive costs of IVF – around $20,000 each time – for couples who are having difficulty conceiving.

She said she and her husband began trying to conceive a family in 2016, but due to abnormalities with the embryos/fetuses, they have suffered through six miscarriages.

“Recently, we’ve had to explore other avenues in hopes of becoming parents,” Kuiken said.

She said this has had led to them considering private IVF. The couple are both employed, but neither of their extended medical plans nor the provincial Medical Services Plan cover any of the costs.

ALSO READ: In limbo: Leftover embryos challenge clinics, couples

Kuiken’s petition on change.org has so far reached almost 1,800 signatures towards her goal of 2,500.

Her petition states that one in six couples experience difficulties conceiving, and most are not financially able to consider IVF.

“Because of the lack of support from our government, IVF has become big business, and B.C. couples like us are travelling to find access to affordable IFV solutions every day,” the petition states.

Kuiken said the World Health Organization recognizes infertility as a medical condition, and four other provinces – Manitoba, New Brunswick, Ontario and Quebec – offer government support for IVF.

She would like coverage to extend to B.C. and, eventually, all of Canada.

“Not everyone wants to be a parent, but those who do should have access and options available,” Kuiken states.

430,"OTTAWA -- The Liberal government will extend the wage subsidy program until December, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced on Monday.

This marks the second extension of the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS). On May 15, the government added an additional 12 weeks to the program, extending eligibility to August 29.

""For the last three months, you’ve seen me come out to talk with Canadians about what we’re doing to help you and your family, your employer, your local businesses deal with this pandemic. We’re going to continue to do that vital work,"" said Trudeau during a press briefing outside Rideau Cottage in Ottawa.

Announced on March 27, the CEWS provides qualifying businesses and non-profits funding for 75 per cent of employee wages, retroactive from March 15.

The objective of the program is to keep employees on the payroll so businesses can rebound more quickly when restrictions are lifted and the economy restarts. The CEWS had a slow uptake, but has increased in popularity as more Canadians transition off of the Canada Emergency Response Benefit.

In an interview on CTV’s Question Period in May, Employment Minister Carla Qualtrough attributed the program’s rocky start to barriers in the application process.

""It’s been slower than expected. I think businesses are having to put a lot of time and effort into their applications because you have to dig into your payroll – who earned what and when,"" she said.

Since then, the government has been consulting with the business community and promoting its benefit amid calls from opposition that the Liberal’s are disincentivizing Canadians from returning to work as CERB application numbers balloon.

As of July 5, just under 19 million Canadians had applied for the benefit and more than $54 billion had been paid out.

The new $82. 3 billion CEWS projection, outlined in last Wednesday’s fiscal snapshot, is a stark increase from the original $45 billion estimate.

As of July 6, 581,800 out of a total of 587, 060 submissions had been approved. This equates to slightly more than $18 billion.",Feds to extend wage subsidy program until December,2,0.3479815079568077
431,"Consumer goods giant Unilever PLC said it will halt U.S. advertising on Facebook Inc. and Twitter Inc. for at least the remainder of the year, citing hate speech and divisive content on the platforms, a significant escalation in Madison Avenue’s efforts to force changes by the tech companies.

Unilever, whose many household brands include Dove soap, Hellmann’s mayonnaise and Lipton tea, joins a growing list of companies that are boycotting Facebook for varying lengths of time, including Verizon Communications Inc., Patagonia Inc., VF Corp., North Face, Eddie Bauer and Recreational Equipment Inc.

“Based on the current polarization and the election that we are having in the U.S., there needs to be much more enforcement in the area of hate speech,” said Luis Di Como, Unilever’s executive vice president of global media, in an interview.

“Continuing to advertise on these platforms at this time would not add value to people and society,” the company said in a statement. Its Facebook ban also will cover Instagram.

The Facebook advertising boycott came after civil-rights groups including the Anti-Defamation League and NAACP called on brands to pull ad spending from Facebook for July. The groups said the social-media giant hadn’t made enough progress enforcing its policies on hate speech and misinformation.

Twitter was not a target of the civil-rights group’s boycott call, but it has also come under scrutiny on Madison Avenue.

Representatives from Facebook and Twitter were unavailable for immediate comment

Facebook has taken some steps in recent years to better police its platforms, adding workers and developing new technology. That has resulted in the removal of hate speech and other objectionable content.

“We acknowledge the efforts of our partners, but there is much more to be done, especially in the areas of divisiveness and hate speech during this polarized election period in the U.S.,” Unilever said in the statement. “The complexities of the current cultural landscape have placed a renewed responsibility on brands to learn, respond and act to drive a trusted and safe digital ecosystem.”

Mr. Di Como said Unilever would like to see a reduction in the level of hate speech on the platforms and wants independent companies to measure and confirm that progress has been made.

As long as tenants keep up current rent as of September, they will have until July 2021 to pay the arrears in instalments, Municipal Affairs and Housing Minister Selina Robinson announced July 16. A ban on rent increases during the pandemic is extended until December 2020.

“Recognizing that many renters and landlords worked together to make arrangements during this crisis, the framework will also leave some flexibility for landlords to work with renters to further adjust the payment amounts,” the ministry said in a statement. “For example, allowing lower payments in the beginning of the agreement and gradually increasing the payment amounts over time or extending the duration of the payment process past July 2021.”

This summer, Surrey’s SuperChefs Cookery For Kids program has gone online with camps that teach kids about cooking, nutrition and sports activities.

The first virtual camps, free for children between 8 and 12 years of age, were launched on Monday (July 6).

Each camper will “attend” the camps for two weeks, and participate in cooking, nutrition and sports activities through mid-August, said Dr. Greg Chang, a local dentist and culinary educator who founded SuperChefs.

“Having been out of their regular school routine since March, campers and families appear eager to participate,” said Dr. Chang. “SuperChefs enrollment is nearing capacity – and those attending the ingredient pickup on July 5 (from outside Johnston Heights Secondary) were enthusiastic and anxious to get cooking.”

(Story continues below)

The COVID-19 pandemic prompted the shift online for the camps, now in their 12th year. Registration is done through the website superchefs.org.

The virtual format sticks to the program goal of promoting a healthier generation of youth, with added interactive polls, games and activities. It’s all based on the FACES acronym of making kids Food literate, Aware of food systems, Competent in cooking skills, Engaged in physical activity and able to Savour balanced food choices.

Former BC Lions receiver Geroy Simon, now the football club’s director of scouting, has gotten involved by creating a full-body, family-friendly workout video for the camps.

“As a former professional athlete and a father of two active children, I know the importance of keeping you and your family fit and healthy,” Simon said in a news release. “I am happy to provide tips to be a champion both on and off the field because a fit family is a happy family.”

Chang created the online program with the help of local university students, many of whom are keen to have careers in dietetics, healthcare, education and business. Two of the SuperChefs co-ordinators — Hannah Bailey and Skye Moore — have been accepted into the UBC Dietetics program in September, he said.

Dr. Greg’s SuperChefs Cookery For Kids is a non-profit arm of SuperChefs, described as an entertainment lifestyle private company.

The program receives funding from several community and corporate partners, in addition to federal agencies including the Canada Summer Job program and the federal Emergency Community Support Fund administered by the SurreyCares Community Foundation.

“SurreyCares helps facilitate that strengthening of community capacity, and we can’t say enough about the initiatives of SuperChefs Cookery for Kids,” said Michael Bose, chair of SurreyCares’ grants committee.

441,"As the country continues its struggle to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic, a challenging accounting is underway. The nation’s unemployment rate is extremely high. The number of permanent small business closures is frightening. Long-established major firms are closing down. The Government of Canada, which responded quickly and effectively to quell financial panic, now has to show it can be as fast and adept at restarting a traumatized economy. In no part of Canada is the reboot more critical – and more uncertain – than in the nation’s rural areas and small towns.

For generations, rural and small-town Canada has been struggling. The sharp decline of many single-industry towns is well-known, as has been the fall off in the country’s agricultural workforce through a combination of technological innovation and the consolidation of farm properties. There has been no shortage of revitalization plans, community empowerment processes, and regional economic development efforts. Some have worked; most have had trouble stemming the flow of young people, families and businesses from these areas. Resilience is a key characteristic of agrarian life and Canada’s many small towns have fought back from economic despair in the past. But this feels different.

Several key forces have already lined up against rural Canada. Technological change has made some rural businesses more competitive, but lowered labour requirements in others. E-commerce and e-services improved the quality of life in remote centres but undercut the business model for many small local firms. The carbon tax hit rural Canada disproportionately hard and is harming already vulnerable operations. In Western Canada, the multiple factors undermining the oil and gas industry have buffeted the many small towns in the region. Pre-COVID, in a world increasingly dominated by city-state economies, rural and small-town Canada was already experiencing serious difficulties.

READ MORE: B.C.’s essential grocery, hardware store employees should get pandemic pay: retail group

Even before the COVID-19 crisis hit, rural, blue-collar, and small-town Canada was already facing poorer outcomes than urban and white-collar Canada. As explained in a 2019 MLI report by Sean Speer titled Forgotten People and Forgotten Places: Canada’s Economic Performance in the Age of Populism, where a Canadian lives and the nature of their work was already a major determinant of economic success long before the pandemic. These divergent economic outcomes are all but certain to worsen in the Post-COVID world.

Canada now find itself in a midst of a deep economic meltdown. The country has many high priorities, from protecting and revitalizing Indigenous communities to supporting fishing villages on the East Coast. It needs to restart and expand the manufacturing sector, decide if it wants to revitalize the oil and gas sector, and try to revive retail, service and restaurant companies. The challenges facing rural and small-town Canada have largely escaped notice for the past few decades; now these communities have to vie for the government’s attention during a time of national crisis.

One rural sector – the tourism industry –reveals the extreme vulnerability of the small-town economy in Canada. Quite remarkably, the crises facing tourism have attracted limited attention countrywide. As the summer season approaches, a monumental economic meltdown is underway. Reservations at hotels, motels, fishing lodges, retreat centres have been cancelled en masse. Many have closed for all of 2020. In Yukon, which has worked exceptionally hard to build a vibrant, international market, the suspension of the West Coast cruise ship season has already caused widespread harm. So it is across the rest of the country, from cozy East Coast bed and breakfasts to world-class Saskatchewan fishing camps, the brilliant theatre towns of southern Ontario, and the spectacular wilderness operations in northern British Columbia and down the Mackenzie River valley.

READ MORE: Cross-border business interests call for joint Canada, U.S. post-COVID effort

The business losses in the tourism sector are serious but they do not explain the collective impact of the decline for rural and small-town tourism. If the travellers do not arrive – and they ae unlikely to come in the summer of 2020 and the crisis could persist into 2021 – the whole community suffers. Airline travel has stalled, hotels have closed, staff have been laid off, restaurants that are struggling to reopen will have fewer of the free-spending tourists, adventure companies are not hiring this year, and the thousands of companies that support the sector are struggling.

Over the last decade, tourism has been a hidden gem in the economic redevelopment of rural Canada. Indigenous tourism alone was slated to breach the $1 billion barrier in 2020, but hundreds of small and vulnerable Indigenous firms are facing bankruptcy. Canada has emerged as an attractive global tourist destination, capitalizing on the country’s spectacular scenery and compelling cultural attractions. This is all at risk as the world’s tourism industry struggles to find its feet in the wake of the pandemic. There is no easy path to the revitalization of tourism, but for small town Canada a great deal is riding on the rebirth.

Across the board, COVID-19 exposed serious weaknesses in rural areas. Poor quality Internet limited the community’s ability to respond to a succession of economic, educational, health and commercial crises. The inadequate health care services stood exposed during the pandemic, with Indigenous communities particularly nervous about the spread of the virus. As waves of layoffs swept across the country, job and income losses hit particularly hard at small-town businesses, tourist operations and resource projects, their economic vulnerability revealed.

There is no easy solution to the formidable challenges facing small town Canada. In a country awash with economic and social crises, and with the federal government sharply focused on the major difficulties facing the largest metropolitan areas, it is hard to imagine rural and small-town issues rising up high on the national agenda. Quite frankly, the country needs to think seriously about its commitment to the revival and revitalization of rural and small-town Canada, for the prospect looms large that a precipitous decline could easily follow on the heels of the devastation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

448,"By Judy Darcy, Minister of Mental Health and Addictions

B.C. is currently in the midst of two major public health emergencies. The first is the on-going overdose crisis, and while overall death rates have started to come down, it continues to take a heart-breaking toll on families and communities across B.C. The second, of course, is the COVID-19 pandemic, which has drastically changed all our lives.

During this unprecedented time, it is critically important that we take extra care of each other, especially the most vulnerable people in our communities. We need to protect individual and community health and safety, and that includes protecting people who are at dual risk of COVID-19 and fentanyl poisoning.

If you are struggling with addiction, if you are homeless or under-housed, or if you have to visit a clinic or pharmacy to receive medications every single day, following Dr. Bonnie Henry’s orders on physical distancing or self-isolation can feel almost impossible. And with an increasingly toxic street drug supply, people who use drugs are at considerable risk during the pandemic.

That’s why, as soon as Health Canada provided exemptions under the Controlled Substances Act, the Province and the BC Centre on Substance Use (BCCSU) acted quickly to release new clinical guidance for physicians, nurse practitioners and pharmacists to help people experiencing the symptoms of withdrawal, and people at risk of overdose and/or at risk of COVID-19 infection.

ALSO READ: Mental Health, we’re in it together

Now, across the province, safe prescription alternatives to the unpredictable and toxic drug supply can be safely prescribed and delivered to those in greatest need. Importantly, this includes providing safer alternatives for people with addictions to alcohol, opioids, tobacco, stimulants, and benzodiazepines. While we are making access to safer prescription medications easier – through virtual care, flexible delivery by pharmacies, and other measures – we are also helping to flatten the curve of COVID-19.

The new provincial guidance is practical and evidence-informed. It is rooted in the fact that addiction is a health issue, not a moral failing – and that people living with addiction deserve the same dignity, respect and access to quality care as people living with any other health condition. The provincial guidance is about safety and health during two public health emergencies – period.

It takes courage to reach out and ask for help. But I want to encourage anyone who is facing these challenges, or knows someone who is, to talk to their health care provider. In order to benefit from the new guidance, people don’t need to have been accessing substance use treatment already. People living with addiction shouldn’t have to risk their lives to get the safe prescription medication they need.

In the coming months, we will continue to work hard to make life safer for people at risk as we navigate dual public health emergencies. No matter where you might be on your own journey – if you are accessing an overdose prevention service, or have just started on medication assisted treatment, or have been in recovery for many years – each person should be supported on their own unique pathway to healing and hope.

At this time of so much uncertainty – with a global pandemic on top of a fentanyl poisoning crisis – we need to look out for each other now more than ever.

We can’t afford to stop caring about one health care crisis as we stare down another.

To find out if the guidance could help you or a loved one, talk to your doctor or nurse practitioner, or call 811 to be directed to supports in your region. A summary of the guidance can be found at bccsu.ca/covid-19.

452,"This April is the third annual Construction and Skilled Trades Month in BC, recognizing the skilled trades people who work to build and maintain the structures we all rely on every day, to keep us functioning safely.

And it’s more important than ever to recognize the hard work of this essential workforce

If we ever needed a reminder of how significant an industry construction is, and how important skilled trades people are to the lives we live, coronavirus is providing that reminder.

If you’re one of the many British Columbians who considers construction work as a lesser occupation, this article is for you.

We’re recognizing the essential services which are continuing to operate because they are “essential to preserving life, health, public safety and basic societal functioning…the services British Columbians come to rely on in their daily lives.”

This April is Construction Month and the 180,000 skilled trades people in BC have been officially designated as essential workers.

BC’s health care workers and emergency responders are on the front lines of the war on COVID-19. They’re out there every day fighting the virus and risking their own lives in doing so, to care for the British Columbians who are ill and need their help.

And make no mistake: the skilled trades people who work in construction are also out there on the front lines. The front lines of our economy and our resilience. They’re out there applying their hard-earned skills and experience to build and maintain the structures we all rely on every day, to keep us functioning safely.

At nearly 10 per cent of BC’s total workforce and GDP, construction is essential to the health of our communities. Not just because of the size of the payroll, but because the built environment is essential to our very functioning as a society.

While we’re isolated at home because our businesses have been closed, or because we are caring for a loved one, we are – often invisibly – served by our tradespeople. Their work keeps the electricity and water and Netflix coming. It keeps the rain out and the heat in. It keeps the walls up and lights on.

And BC’s construction industry is building the new critical infrastructure that will be essential to recovery.

So this April, the third annual Construction and Skilled Trades Month in BC, please join the BC Construction Association, four Regional Construction Associations, LNG Canada, and many other generous sponsors, in recognizing the efforts of the construction workers in your life and your community.

Next time you’re passing a worksite (from a six-foot distance), give the workers a nod and a thank you. They’re doing an important job. They are essential.

The B.C. exemption was announced April 2, initially for three months. It now includes the Canada Emergency Student Benefit that took effect May 1 as well as the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, Ottawa’s main program for people who have lost income due to the coronavirus pandemic.

For those not eligible for federal benefits, the province’s temporary COVID-19 Crisis Supplement of $300 per month is extended for two more months. It goes to low-income seniors receiving the B.C. Seniors Supplement and income or disability assistance recipients in special care facilities. The additional crisis supplement payments will be automatically applied to cheques distributed on July 22 and Aug. 26.

“The extension of these programs will allow some breathing room for people to get back on their feet as we move through the restart plan,” said Shane Simpson, B.C. social development minister, in a statement July 6.

457,"The minimum wage in B.C. jumped by 75 cents to $14.60 an hour on Monday, June 1. Stephany Garber Black writes the timing of the increase “couldn’t be better.” (Black Press File Photo)

By Stephany Garber Black

Special to the Cloverdale Reporter

I disagree with Jock Finlayson’s conclusions that when it comes to increasing the minimum wage, the timing couldn’t be worse.

The timing couldn’t be better. I say this because raising the minimum wage will protect human life and reduce poverty.

(Finlayson’s piece “Minister should look at financial carnage amid min. wage increase” ran in the June 4 issue of the Cloverdale Reporter.)

The minimum wage increased 75 cents to $14.60 per hour on June 1, an extra $6 for eight hours of work. These minimum wage employees are often working in restaurants and customer service where their interactions with the public make them more vulnerable to being exposed to COVID-19 than those in different industries. We need to trust these people to stay home when they feel ill to protect the rest of us.

Fighting poverty is part of protecting us collectively because minimum wage workers should not be forced to choose between working sick or being able to pay rent and eat. The increased minimum wage will help those workers protect themselves and others in the coming months.

The minimum wage historically has always been about protecting the vulnerable. According to our federal labour standards, the government has put minimum wage in place to protect non-unionized workers, reduce the number of low-paying jobs, alleviate poverty, create incentives to work and address inequality.

It is apparent the business community has organized and has advocates like Finlayson to protect their interests. Still, labour is discouraged from organizing to defend their wages because businesses can take away those coveted jobs.

SEE ALSO: COLUMN: B.C.’s labour minister should look at COVID-19 financial carnage amid minimum wage increase

Instead of mentioning that the minimum wage is in place to protect the vulnerable and reduce poverty, we have Finlayson reducing labour to a business expense. Talking about labour as a cost of production is problematic, because if working people are reduced to a business expense, what is a human life worth? I would argue that human life is precious and can’t just be looked at only in economic terms. This principle that human life is more than just a production expense is why we have a minimum wage in the first place.

Raising the minimum wage is not as bad as Finlayson makes it seem. Studies have shown that while raising the minimum wage may slightly increase unemployment; it also increases job stability. That means that it may be harder to find a job at first, but it is more likely to be a job you keep after you do. It also has a ripple effect of increasing other people’s wages, especially those close to minimum wage. If there is a time when we should protect the poorest and create more stable jobs, shouldn’t it be during a global health crisis?

Finlayson makes mention of the “calamity” and “carnage” the COVID-19 crisis has caused businesses. Perhaps we should remind ourselves why businesses closed in the first place—to protect human lives while we prepared and restructured our society during the pandemic. We chose to put the collective good before our individual needs as we listened to experts, voluntarily closed businesses, stayed home, and practiced social distancing.

As we look at the struggles of businesses, we must not forget the minimum wage workers and the working poor. The poor and the vulnerable need our help during a global pandemic when unemployment rates are rising and they have an increased chance of exposure to COVID-19.

Therefore, in the fight to protect human lives and decrease poverty, I politely disagree with Finlayson by saying that increasing the minimum wage could not have come at a better time.

459,"During the Second World War, many Canadian businesses retooled their operations to manufacture war materials for the Allied countries.

Canada (and the world) is now fighting a much different type of war, and Canadian businesses have stepped up to provide personal protective equipment (PPE) and necessary supplies for health-care professionals and other front-line workers.

Major auto manufacturers, in particular, are among the many industries that have made significant contributions to the fight against COVID-19. Auto manufacturers have leveraged their assembly plants, supply chain networks and expertise to provide face shields, ventilators and other items.

Although major auto manufacturers in North American have shut down production of automobiles, it is inspiring to see how quickly Ford and other manufacturers have pivoted from making vehicles to making medical supplies and equipment, and how our industry has rallied together during this difficult time.

The Ford Motor Company (the brand I represent), with support of Unifor Local 200, is producing face shields at its Windsor, Ont., engine plant and making them available to Ford dealers across Canada. Dealers are distributing the face shields to hospitals in their communities.

My dealership will receive a shipment of 100 face shields on May 4, which we will donate to Kirkland and District Hospital. We have requested more of these protective devices for a later date, which we plan to distribute locally.

In the U.S., Ford engineers are using their ingenuity and expertise to convert F-150 seat fans to manufacture much-needed respirators and ventilators. The company has teamed up with GE Healthcare and 3M to increase production of medical equipment and supplies.

Ford has a proud history of giving back to people and communities in need across Canada, and I am enormously proud to be a part of this company. (Other automakers have proud histories of providing support for communities at home and abroad as well.)

In 2016, the Ford Motor Company of Canada and Canadian Ford dealers donated more than $500,000 to the Red Cross for relief and recovery efforts related to the wildfires that impacted Fort McMurray and surrounding areas.

Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada has donated approximately 1,000 N95 ventilator masks, gloves, protective eyewear and sanitary boot protectors to four local hospitals. The company has used its production system expertise to streamline the design of the masks.

Toyota Canada is also working with InkSmith, a Canadian 3D printing company that is manufacturing face shields for medical workers.

GM Canada is preparing parts of the Oshawa, Ont., plant to produce face masks based on the GM production model already working in Michigan. The company plans to manufacture approximately one million masks per month, at cost, for the Canadian government with an estimated 50 employees supporting two shifts of production.

Some automakers have introduced relief programs and special financing arrangements to help customers affected by COVID-19.

For instance, Hyundai is offering existing finance and lease customers payment deferral options, and new customers have the option of a six-month deferral program on all new vehicles financed at a Hyundai dealership.

For Mazda customers whose leases are coming due but who are not “in a position to replace their vehicle at this time,” the automaker is offering lease extensions. Nissan Canada Finance will work with customers to discuss payment arrangements or deferments.

461,"Only 16 per cent of businesses were confident in B.C.’s restart plan and 47 per cent were not

Many restaurants have closed in response to COVID-19. (Ashley Wadhwani/Black Press Media)

The latest survey of businesses in British Columbia reveals few are confident the province’s $1.5-billion recovery plan will help them survive or succeed.

The survey of 1,401 member businesses from groups including the BC Chamber of Commerce, Greater Vancouver Board of Trade and Business Council of B.C. indicates owners want a bold, long-term recovery plan.

Only 16 per cent of businesses were confident in B.C.’s restart plan and 47 per cent were not.

Two-thirds of those surveyed were relying on some form of government support and owners were braced for a “second wave” of shutdowns or other problems if programs expire too quickly.

Some 28 per cent believed they’ll return to normal once programs end, 32 per cent expected to cut workers’ hours, 27 per cent anticipated layoffs, and one business in every 10 forecast either temporary or permanent closure.

Owners say payroll and wage supports must remain key components of B.C.’s recovery plan, along with fee and tax cuts.

The survey also identified expectations that the province must create better investment conditions.

Bridgitte Anderson, president and CEO of the Greater Vancouver Board of Trade, says business viability hinges on those measures.

Val Litwin with the BC Chamber of Commerce urges policy-makers to ”stay sensitive” to the vulnerability of the business sector.

“A bold economic recovery plan that helps small businesses compete is non-negotiable for a prosperous B.C., and when small businesses thrive so do communities and people,” Litwin said in a statement.

“Governments must keep focused on delivering their recovery plans swiftly.”

The survey, conducted with the Mustel Group, is the fourth in a series examining the effects on B.C. businesses since the pandemic flared in March.

462,"The Traction on Demand team, based in the Lower Mainland, appreciates the ease and flexibility of the Innovator Skills Initiative grant program, helping businesses and non-profits hire students.

Bringing in young, new talent can be vital to helping companies meet their evolving needs.

For BC businesses of all sizes, the Innovator Skills Initiative grant program, administered by New Ventures BC, can help make that happen.

“We love that the grant is flexible, encompasses lots of roles and has few restrictions. Even the whole application process is online,” says Craig Marsden, from the Lower Mainland-based Traction on Demand, which used the program to hire a finance intern who took on day-to-day financial tasks during her three terms.

“After our interns go back to school and graduate, we often have a full-time job lined up for them. In fact, 70 per cent of our interns come back as full-time employees. When we recognize talented workers we try to help them stick around,” Marsden says.

The non-profit New Ventures BC works to recognize, encourage and develop entrepreneurship and innovation in B.C.’s start-up technology sector, explains Rachel Burns, New Ventures’ ISI Grant Program Manager.

Results of these initiatives have included thousands of new jobs, enhanced entrepreneurial skills, increased investment, technology commercialization and economic growth for B.C.

Through the Innovator Skills Initiative grant program, tech companies, startups, businesses and non-profit organizations receive up to $10,000 a year to hire a BC post-secondary student.

Applications are open to all BC companies, with grants available for May 1, 2020 to April 30, 2021.

Here’s how it works:

Applications are accepted on first-come, first-served, rolling basis. During the current COVID-19 concerns, staff are evaluating grants remotely and processing as usual. For companies facing hardship due to COVID-19 that can’t meet certain eligibility requirements, Burns encourages them to check in. “We are here to support you and will provide exceptions on a case-by-case basis,” she says.

The program provides flexibility regarding start times, end dates and payouts, and can include hiring a student who is working from home or remotely.

Businesses provide students with entrepreneurial and business training, and match grant funding.

Students must be enrolled or returning to an accredited BC-based post-secondary school and cannot be in co-op.

The grant can potentially be stacked with other funding and can be stacked with Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS).

Funding is provided by Innovate BC and the Province of BC

464,"Every smart mountaineer knows that scaling a lofty summit is only half the job. Somehow, you’ve got to get back down again in one piece. There’s a lesson here for the federal government. After taking Canada to the historic and, frankly scary, twin peaks of deficit-spending and national debt to get through the COVID-19 pandemic, it has to guide us back to safer, more solid terrain. The greatest failing of the fiscal “snapshot” released by federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau on Wednesday is that it doesn’t do this. It doesn’t map out a plan for what’s going to be a very tricky descent.  To be sure, Morneau’s 168-report does a convincing job of showing us why the 2020-21 federal deficit had to hit the $343.2-billion mark — more than 10 times his original, pre-pandemic forecast.  While Canadians may experience a slight dizziness upon learning the federal debt will top $1 trillion — that’s 49.1 per cent of the country’s annual gross domestic product — for the first time ever this year, they should feel reassured all this unprecedented spending was necessary. To save Canadian lives, but also to preserve the Canadian economy from devastation, federal and provincial governments had to lock down the country, which left millions of people unemployed or coping with reduced hours. In the ensuing recession, the federal government lost $71.1 billion in tax revenues. It also ended up holding a $227.9-billion bill for the direct spending and tax measures necessitated by the lockdown crisis.  In taking such extreme actions, the Liberal government kept businesses alive, preserved jobs and prevented families from losing their homes. Trouble is, no Canadian government can keep spending at this rate indefinitely, and Minister Morneau knows it.  The federal debt load is  manageable, thanks to today’s low interest rates. But we can’t keep piling on more debt indefinitely without risking serious credit downgrades that will leave Canadians paying cripplingly high debt-servicing costs. Clearly, Canada has to get down from the deficit-debt mountain top it’s precariously perched on today. To do this Ottawa needs to wind back some of the pandemic spending while playing an essential role in the economic recovery. It will have to be choosy. It will also have to work closely with the provinces on many initiatives.  To start, and considering how difficult it will be for many parents, especially women, to return to or continue with their jobs, the Liberals need a plan to expand daycare. This should arrive before schools reopen, rather than after. Next, the Liberals need to provide assistance to retrain workers whose jobs have been lost to COVID-19. Federal incentives to encourage entrepreneurs to start new businesses could help fill the economic gaps left by businesses that have closed. When it’s safe, Canada should re-open its doors to the immigrants who can build new lives in this country as they help rebuild its economy. And because the pandemic hammered international trade — Canadian exports experienced an “unparalleled drop” in April — this is the perfect time to break down the interprovincial trade barriers that still hamper the movement of goods and services within this country. Finally, and this could prove unpopular, the federal government will have to seriously consider some kind of tax increase to help pay for the recovery. An increase in the GST — a consumption tax — might be the fairest way to do this. It was good to see the government’s fiscal “snapshot” of where Canada stands today. Next up, it should provide a detailed picture of where we’re headed.","Next up for Ottawa, a post-pandemic plan",5,0.004008955954045934
465,"This week Waterloo Region Chair Karen Redman issued a stark warning of what the future holds for this community unless the federal and Ontario governments deliver quick, emergency aid. Tax hikes, service-fee increases, cuts to essential services — they’re all up for grabs, she said, as not only the regional government but the seven other local municipalities struggle to cope with the financial devastation wreaked by COVID-19. And all the time, they must avoid the deficits forbidden by law.  That explains why local governments from this region, having bled tax and fee revenues, have banded together with municipalities across Canada in calling on the federal government to come through with a $10-billion pandemic bailout for local governments. But while there’s an overwhelming case that they should be tossed this financial lifesaver — there must be strings attached to it. Now is the time to do things differently. Now we should embrace what Kitchener, Waterloo, Cambridge, the four townships and the region itself have consistently and stubbornly rejected — a radical overhaul of local government. The way to achieve this can be found in a special report that was written last year for Ontario Premier Doug Ford and recommended ways to save money while improving life for millions of Ontarians.  After touring the province for months, former Waterloo Region chair Ken Seiling and former senior Ontario bureaucrat Michael Fenn handed Ford a blueprint for transforming 82 upper- and lower-tier municipal governments — including the ones in this region — in a positive way. By the time Ford got the report, however, his popularity had plunged. Aware that municipal reform would rile many vested interests, Ford beat a hasty retreat. The report in its entirety was kept secret. It was wrong for Ford to deny the public information they’d paid for and was in their interest. Suppressing it further would compound that error. While The Record recently received a $960 bill from the provincial government so it can gain access to just part of the report under Ontario’s Freedom of Information law, Ford should show some courage, stop his stonewalling and release it all. The Record will continue to seek disclosure of this report on behalf of taxpayers in this region and throughout Ontario. Aren’t Canadians constantly being told that life after COVID-19 will never be the same? Whether it’s enhanced child care, improved nursing homes, a universal basic income or a new agenda to stop climate change, we’re hearing the country we rebuild should be better than the one we had. The challenge is finding how to fund this new Canada. The nation is mired in the worst recession in generations while the federal government is on track to run the biggest annual deficit in Canadian history — $343.2 billion. Moving forward, every precious public dollar must be spent as efficiently and effectively as possible. The report Ford is keeping hidden could help accomplish this. Given that Waterloo Region is well enough served by a single police service, why does it need seven fire departments? Why is it in the best interest of local residents — as opposed to local politicians and civil servants — to have four library systems, eight sewer and water departments, four building departments and at least five economic development departments in a single region? Amalgamation — that long-dreaded word in some circles — is not the only choice. But the report Premier Ford is sitting on could surely offer other concrete solutions for the financial and service bind that local governments in this region and across Ontario are caught in. If they want help now from Ottawa and Queen’s Park, these local governments should help themselves by embracing, not fighting, reform. And Ford should insist they do.",Post-pandemic Waterloo Region must change,5,0.18983870393308366
466,"When news broke last month that Amazon.com Inc. was interested in buying Zoox Inc., observers assumed the e-commerce giant was looking to automate its delivery fleet. After all, Amazon already invested in an electric truck maker and is a major buyer of everything from planes to diesel vehicles.

But in a statement on Friday confirming its acquisition of the autonomous vehicle startup, Amazon touted Zoox for its ride-hailing ambitions. Ride hailing? Amazon?

“You say, does it make sense?” said Mike Ramsey, a Gartner vice president who tracks the auto industry. “Well, does it make sense that the package delivery company sells me streaming movies?”

Zoox is a corporate investment, not an acquisition to be folded into one of Amazon’s existing businesses, the company says. Aicha Evans, Zoox’s chief executive officer, and Jesse Levinson, co-founder and chief technology officer, will continue to lead the company as a standalone business.

“Zoox is working to imagine, invent, and design a world-class autonomous ride-hailing experience,” said Jeff Wilke, the head of Amazon’s worldwide retail business. “We’re excited to help the talented Zoox team to bring their vision to reality in the years ahead.”

Amazon’s corporate development team recently told bankers they wanted to look at any autonomous vehicle startup interested in selling, according to a person familiar with the situation, who requested anonymity to discuss a private matter.

Amazon shares were little changed Friday morning in New York, while Uber Technologies Inc. fell less than three per cent — in line with the overall market.

Terms of the deal, the latest indication of Amazon’s evolution from online bookseller to sprawling conglomerate, were not announced on Friday. But the Information reported earlier that Amazon would pay more than $1 billion U.S.

Autonomous vehicles have been a target of automakers, Silicon Valley giants and venture capital investors for years. But technical and regulatory hurdles have made getting self-driving cars and trucks on the road a longer slog than boosters had hoped.

Founded in 2014, Zoox had outsize ambition and financial backing. It aimed to not only build hardware and software capable of piloting cars, but to design autonomous taxis themselves.

The Foster City, Calif.-based startup wanted to build a fully driverless vehicle by this year. However, after a 2018 funding round that valued Zoox at $3.2 billion, the board voted to oust Tim Kentley-Klay as CEO. He criticized the move, saying directors were “optimizing for a little money in hand at the expense of profound progress.”

The company last year indicated it was seeking investors and potential strategic partners, a situation made more urgent by the disruption of the coronavirus pandemic, which led to layoffs that Zoox characterized as temporary.

In its statement, Amazon highlighted Zoox’s “ground-up vehicle” that “focuses on the ride-hailing customer.”

Despite its challenges, Zoox was one among a few independent companies working on credible autonomous vehicle technology, said Ramsey, the Gartner analyst. “Amazon is all of a sudden real close to being its own automaker,” he said.

The company could integrate future ride-hailing services into its Prime membership program, Ramsey added. And despite Amazon’s assertion that it was interested in Zoox because of its ambitions in ride-hailing — already a fiercely a contested market — Ramsey said Amazon would probably consider using the autonomous technology in delivery vehicles.

Bulking up in driverless technology represents an expansion of Amazon’s already sprawling interests in transportation and logistics. The company, which used to rely on delivery partners like United Parcel Service Inc. and FedEx Corp. to move packages from its warehouses to customers, in the last several years has invested heavily in its own capacity to move goods, acquiring planes, vans and long-haul trailers.

Seattle-based Amazon has also invested in delivery drones — though it didn’t meet the goal CEO Jeff Bezos set of having them flying packages to customers by 2018 — as well as sidewalk-crawling robots and autonomous carts.

Last year, Amazon invested along with Silicon Valley venture firm Sequoia Capital in Aurora Innovation Inc., a self-driving startup led by the former heads of Google’s driverless car project and Tesla Inc.’s Autopilot team. The company has also backed Rivian Automotive Inc., the electric pickup and SUV maker, and emerged as its biggest buyer, pledging to acquire 100,000 delivery vans designed in partnership with Amazon.

467,"At first glance, a pair of conservative-leaning entrepreneurs might seem like unlikely guardians of the progressive values of the Toronto Star.

But that’s just what Jordan Bitove and Paul Rivett say they are, after being anointed the preferred bidders for Torstar, the newspaper’s publisher, last weekend.

Barring an unforeseen twist, the company will be theirs, thanks to lock-in provisions in their latest 74-cent-a-share bid, submitted last Saturday through NordStar Capital, that prevent rival bids from being considered by the two main shareholders.

But questions are now arising about a second proposal to buy Torstar that became public late last week, from surprise bidder Canadian Modern Media Holdings (CMMH).

The second group of suitors say they were prepared to offer much more for Torstar, with investment banker Neil Selfe, a member of the bidding team, claiming they were ready to go as high as 80 cents per share — higher than NordStar’s 74 cents. He has publicly asked why Torstar’s owners would lock into a lower bid “if (they) were focused on maximizing shareholder value.”

Selfe’s claim has set off a public debate over who submitted what bid when: Both Torstar’s chair and NordStar say no firm bid was ever tabled for 80 cents.

Meanwhile, some industry observers say there might be another reason the NordStar bid was locked in 48 hours before this past Monday’s deadline: Sometimes, it’s not all about the money.

Torstar chairman John Honderich flatly disputes Selfe’s claim that CMMH made a firm superior offer. He says that Selfe’s group began with a proposal for 72 cents a share, plus contingent value rights (CVRs) that could be worth as much as 50 cents a share, and that they hadn’t improved the cash portion of the offer before the revamped NordStar bid came in, despite being given the opportunity.

“There was no 80-cent offer on the table when we made our decision. All we had was an offer for 72 cents and CVRs. We went back to Selfe twice on Saturday to urge him to increase the cash component of his bid. He didn’t. Only after the improved offer from NordStar became public did he then take a pen, scratch out 72 and put in 80, and then send it to us,” Honderich said.

By that point, the voting trust and Fairfax had already signed hard lock-ups guaranteeing their support for the improved NordStar bid, Honderich said.

Former Ontario premier David Peterson, who’s part of the NordStar bid, said in an emailed statement that the CMMH bid couldn’t have been better because it was never made official.

“There was no other binding offer on the table. A non-binding proposal is not a superior offer. A binding offer includes a legal commitment with financing. Unlike NordStar, CMMH group never made a binding offer and never publicly disclosed a source of financing,” said Peterson.

A source, who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly, said CMMH asked Torstar for an assessment of the value of the contingent value rights — which can mean extra money for shareholders if a specified milestone is met in the future — before considering a raised bid, but the group did not receive one. The source added that the only thing missing to make the CMMH bid legally binding was a “signature page” which was being held in escrow pending the value rights assessment.

Multiple sources have confirmed to the Star that CMMH’s bid was being financed by Canadian Western Bank, an Alberta-based business bank. Selfe declined to comment for this story, citing nondisclosure agreements.

Whether or not the owners of Torstar could have gotten a higher bid from CMMH — and whether that bid would actually be successfully financed — may never be known. But observers note that, as with any sale, money isn’t the only consideration.

Sources say the five families who have long controlled Torstar’s A-class shares were concerned that the new owners maintain the Star’s progressive values, in particular the Atkinson Principles which have guided the Star’s journalism for decades.

Torstar is more than a corporate entity, it is also one of the largest publishers in the country. If the decision to sell considered both principles and cold, hard cash, that’s fine with journalism industry watchers like Tim Currie, head of the journalism program at the University of King’s College in Halifax.

“It’s pretty clear that the legacy of the Atkinson Principles are very important to the families, and it certainly seems from the outside as though that’s a reason why they may have left some money on the table,” said Currie.

Not that the bottom line isn’t a factor, acknowledged James Compton, an associate professor at Western University’s Faculty of Information and Media Studies.

“Has Torstar been concerned with making money? Of course. But they’ve invested money in journalism, and like any good news organization, had a core set of values. … In their case, that’s the Atkinson Principles,” said Compton, a former journalist who specializes in studying the Canadian media industry.

Keeping up those progressive values and journalism also make solid business sense, argues Allan Thompson, director of Carleton University’s journalism program.

“I think the Star has enormous value as a brand … and that brand is as a progressive voice which invests in journalism,” said Thompson, a former Star reporter. “It’s not just the political perspective, it’s the fact they’ve been willing to invest in good journalism.”

That has meant, Compton said, that the Star has partly avoided the fate of many American media organizations which have cut staff to the bone after getting taken over by hedge funds and private equity firms. That trend is something Compton said has also loomed as a danger in Canada, where the majority of Postmedia shares are controlled by U.S.-based hedge fund Chatham Asset Management. (Last week, Chatham also won a bankruptcy court auction for the McClatchy newspaper chain in the U.S.).

The prospect of the Star falling into similar hands is something Compton worries about. In many cases, the debt loads assumed by new owners after takeovers have been crippling to newsrooms.

“This is a problem across North America. Value is being extracted and not put back into the newsrooms. Value is being extracted to make the debt payments. The business model is stripping assets, cutting costs and making debt payments,” said Compton.

The fact that NordStar’s bid financing comes from Canso Investment Counsel — also Postmedia’s largest debt holder — has stoked fears that NordStar plans to eventually sell the Star to Postmedia. That fear has been articulated by, among others, former Ontario finance minister Greg Sorbara, who’s part of the CMMH bid team.

NordStar has previously said through a spokesperson that it intends to pay back a “significant” amount of its Canso loan when the deal closes, and that the financing doesn’t mean there’s a merger coming.

“Let us be absolutely clear: The financing arrangements for the NordStar bid are not, in anyway whatsoever, connected directly or indirectly with any other media company,” a NordStar spokesperson said in late May, after Canso’s involvement became public.

Private equity executive Stuart Browne doesn’t think NordStar bought Torstar to merge the Star with Postmedia.

“I don’t see any evidence that there’s a consolidation play here. As long as they keep making their debt payments, there’s nothing that Canso could do,” said Browne, CEO of Pycap Venture Partners and a lecturer at York University’s Schulich School of Business.

Instead, said Browne, NordStar likely intends to boost the Star’s efforts to attract more digital subscribers, while selling some non-core assets, such as its stake in digital community discussion board VerticalScope.

It’s also not a coincidence, Browne argued, that the deal is happening during a global pandemic.

“The industry has been in distress anyway, and then COVID hit, so I think they saw value at these prices,” said Browne, adding that there could be some cost-cutting to reduce the company’s losses.

The NordStar team did not comment on their long-term plans for Torstar when approached for this story, but after news of their then-63-cent bid became public in late May, Bitove and Rivett said they planned to boost the Star’s digital offerings and said they weren’t planning big cuts.

“Our focus is on the Star’s journalism and digital transformation. And you need capital to support that,” said Bitove at the time. A report published in the Globe and Mail said Bitove and Rivett were seeking up to $100 million from the sale of non-core assets, but Bitove said there’s no exact number.

“You can’t grow revenue on the back of cuts. We don’t subscribe to cutting. But that said, we support management and we support (Torstar CEO) John Boynton and the team. So there’s no current focus on that. Our current focus is that we’re excited to bring new potential revenue sources and partners to the business and find ways to grow, not cut,” added Rivett.

While the Star doesn’t have the digital subscription base of U.S. outlets such as The New York Times or The Washington Post, there’s still hope for subscription growth, which could stem the losses Torstar has suffered over the last few years, University of King’s College’s Currie argued. Just because people have been used to getting news online for free doesn’t mean they won’t ever pay for it.

“As an industry, we made a huge mistake three decades ago in not monetizing online readership. But people used to get their music online for free. Now, they’re paying. Not as much as they should be, if you ask a lot of artists, but they’re paying,” said Currie.",Chair disputes claim that a higher bid was tabled for Torstar — and industry observers look at what’s next for the publisher,0,0.02103467308587126
471,"Dani Porter Bridges remembers first meeting him at a gaming convention in 2017. He was the creative lead for the wildly popular video game “Assassin’s Creed.” She had an Assassin’s Creed tattoo. He approached her about it, and the relationship went from there.

After about a year on and off, Porter Bridges found out he had been married the entire time. Realizing she might not be the only person in this situation, she shared her story on Twitter in June.

She was contacted by several other women who claimed to have had a similar relationship with him — even during the time they were together, she said.

And then she found out that the company he worked for, Paris-based Ubisoft, had a growing reputation for behaviour that was much, much worse — including harassment, sexual and otherwise. (The man in question has not been accused of harassment or assault.)

Porter Bridges said after she shared her experience online, she started receiving messages from women who work at Ubisoft — a major player in the Canadian video game world.

“The culture there is not ... friendly to people coming forward with their stories,” she said. “So (my story) has caused quite a change, because everything was publicized.”

She said many were afraid of losing their jobs if they spoke out about what they experienced at work.

“Most of what I’ve heard has been people saying that they felt like they couldn’t bring up issues and they weren’t safe,” she said.

Instead they relied on a “whisper network” to help each other stay away from known harassers within the company, she said.

“You learn who you can trust,” said Porter Bridges.

Some of those stories of sexual assault and harassment — as well as descriptions of a toxic, sexist workplace culture — are bubbling up to the surface now, and Ubisoft is bleeding top employees.

The situation at the video game giant has sparked a closer examination of the rampant discrimination and harassment in an industry dominated by white straight men, and notoriously hostile to anyone else.

Could the turmoil at Ubisoft finally lead to the systemic change that advocates have long been calling for?

A ‘highly sexualized culture’

Bullying. Sexual harassment. A “highly sexualized culture” rife with drinking and partying.

The allegations began swirling on social media in June, and it became quickly apparent that Ubisoft had a problem.

What soon followed was a string of exits — firings, resignations, disciplinary leaves — of top executives, both in Canada at Ubisoft’s studios in Montreal and Toronto, and at its Paris headquarters.

There was the promise of a total revamp of the company’s human resources processes, and an external company was brought in to investigate.

Ubisoft has not disclosed the nature of the allegations leading to the departures. The Star has not been able to independently verify the allegations, many of which were made on social media.

Among the many departures include at least two from Ubisoft’s Toronto studio: Maxime Béland, vice-president of editorial, who resigned, and an unidentified employee who was fired.

Gaming news website Kotaku quoted an anonymous woman in a July 6 article who said Béland put his hands around her neck at a party. Several other news sites have repeated these allegations. (The Star has not been able to contact the anonymous woman. Béland did not return the Star’s requests for comment through LinkedIn.)

Over at Ubisoft’s Paris headquarters, vice-president of editorial and creative services Tommy François has been placed on disciplinary leave. Chief creative officer Serge Hascoët has resigned, as has Cécile Cornet, global head of human resources.

French newspaper Libération reported allegations that François tried to coerce a woman into kissing him, again at a party. Allegations in the same article paint Hascoët as a perpetrator of misogyny and homophobia. The Star has not independently confirmed these allegations. François and Hascoët did not return the Star’s requests for comment.

The story about Béland allegedly choking a woman at a party was common knowledge, as were other such stories, according to a former Ubisoft employee who worked at the Montreal studio, who asked to remain anonymous as they still work in the industry.

But because powerful employees like Béland never saw consequences, these stories were just passed around like dark jokes, the former employee said.

“It’s not complicity, it’s helplessness,” they said.

The former employee told the Star that due to the size of the company, and the fact that most people work in small teams, some people have a great experience there.

Much of the problematic behaviour happened at parties and events, they said, and generally, cisgender straight white men were “protected” while women, people of colour and LGBTQ people would either hit walls or just be overlooked.

They stressed that this was not necessarily malicious, but rather a systemic issue — HR was “almost a running joke.”

(Ubisoft told the Star this week it had no “further updates to share at this time” when asked to comment on the former employee’s claims.)

The French company has had a Toronto presence for more than a decade, having received a $263 million grant in 2009 from the provincial Liberal government to open a studio and create 800 jobs over 10 years. It currently operates out of the old General Electric building in the city’s west end.

Ubisoft has five other studios in this country aside from Toronto, with its base of operations at a massive studio in Montreal that employs almost 4,000 people.

The growing number of serious allegations against Ubisoft’s Canadian employees led to the exit of its managing director for Canadian operations, Yves Mallat.

“The recent allegations that have come to light in Canada against multiple employees make it impossible for him to continue in this position,” company CEO Yves Guillemot said in a staff memo this week.

Montreal HR firm Relais Expert Conseil is heading an independent investigation open to current and former Ubisoft employees.

‘We have a problem’

Kim Belair, a gaming scriptwriter and narrative designer, said the game industry’s problems lie beyond misogyny in the workplace. She said the industry is rife with “crunch” culture, which relies on overworking underpaid beginners, and marginalized people feel the effects even more.

Get more business in your inbox Read the business news and analysis that matters most every morning, including the latest on what the coronavirus means for you, in our Star Business email newsletter. Sign Up Now

“Crunch” refers to unpaid or underpaid extra work above and beyond normal hours. Workers are pressured into doing it, she said, because they’re part of a team that’s racing to finish a project, and because they’re supposed to be at their “dream job.”

“We have a problem where we sell the dream to people and then tell them that if they want to live it, they have to go above and beyond,” she said.

The passion of young workers is often exploited, resulting in a “revolving door” of workers due to a high rate of burnout, said Izzie Colpitts-Campbell, director of programming at Dames Making Games in Toronto. And for anyone dealing with homophobia, racism or sexism, it’s even more likely they’ll get burned out, she said.

She said the higher-up creative directors whose names are often attached to well-known games are treated like stars while the teams doing the grunt work are seen as expendable, resulting in a “massive power imbalance.”

As a Black woman, Belair has experienced dismissal and casual racism in the game development industry both before and after co-founding her own company, Sweet Baby Inc.

Belair recalled an incident where she was called into a meeting with a client to justify the diversity of characters in a game she was working on, and was accused of “having an agenda.”

She said white male characters are often treated as the default characters, and she often has to do extra work — emotional, personal work — to fight to keep a more diverse set of characters in a game.

Could real change be on the horizon?

Experts said they were cautiously optimistic that the news coming out of Ubisoft will indeed lead to important structural changes they say have long been needed — including more diverse hiring practices, but also changing a culture that still views the primary video game audience as straight white men.

Cautiously optimistic, they said, because they point out the video game world has seen a similar situation to Ubisoft before, and fairly recently.

Riot Games, maker of “League of Legends,” offered to pay $10 million last December as part of a settlement to women who alleged harassment and workplace discrimination in a class-action lawsuit, the Los Angeles Times reported at the time. Earlier in the year, 150 employees at the company had staged a walkout over the allegations.

“Girls are still not afforded the same opportunity to play video games in the same way that boys are, for a host of socialization reasons, so when you look at an industry that really hires based on ‘Can you talk the talk, and walk the walk? Are you us?’ Women just don’t fit that consideration, and that I think is the real problem,” said Johanna Weststar, associate professor of labour relations at Western University.

Weststar also runs the voluntary Developer Satisfaction Survey in partnership with the International Game Developers Association, which in 2019 found that on the whole, developers are still “young, male, and white, and most of them do not have children or elder care responsibilities.”

The survey noted that 65 per cent of respondents felt there is not equal treatment and opportunity for all in the video game industry.

Respondents were also surveyed on whether their workplaces had equality and diversity policies — eight per cent said their workplace had no such policy, which was a decrease from 14 per cent in 2017. But among those who said their workplace did have such policies in place, 59 per cent felt they were not “adequately enforced,” and 31 per cent were not sure.

“I would say that there’s been a trend upward in terms of the studios that have something in the diversity and inclusion space,” Weststar said. “I think we could also say that over the last 15 years, there may be more women than there were in the industry, but it’s not overwhelmingly so.”

She said even at a big studio — where perhaps a quarter of its workforce is female — once you take out the HR, administrative and marketing jobs and look solely at programmers, artists and designers, “that number comes down in a hurry. It’s almost halved.”

The percentage of men and women who play video games is split 50/50, yet women only make up about 19 per cent of workers employed by Canadian video game companies, according to statistics from the Entertainment Software Association of Canada.

If the industry is really going to implement changes to its culture, it will have to change the way it has often viewed its audience, said Kenzie Gordon, a PhD student at the University of Alberta whose research includes examining gender-based violence in video games and the application of games as violence prevention tools.

“There’s this narrow group of white straight men who think that gaming belongs to them, and often I think companies feel beholden to them and view them as the market,” she said.

“They’re hesitant to do anything that that group — which tends to be quite vocal — will be upset about. So even though those people don’t represent the majority of gamers, they seem to have kind of this throttlehold on the public perception of gamers and companies often struggle to push back against that.”

Colpitts-Campbell said she thinks it’s “short-sighted” to think nobody will want games made by and about diverse people.

She said getting rid of the big names of the game industry won’t be enough to change its culture, and that diversification of not just workers but games themselves will be key to slowly overhauling the industry.

“It takes a long time to put in effort to learn these things and how to change these things,” she said. “Putting investment into actually telling the stories of marginalized voices. I think that’s a big one.”",Inside the ‘highly sexualized culture’ at Ubisoft: Will mounting harassment allegations finally result in real change?,0,0.20660581568518466
472,"It is always important to review your financial plan on a regular basis, but especially now, experts say

As governments roll out plans to reopen the economy in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, experts say individual Canadians need to update their own financial plan to move forward too.

The stock market crash in March and the plunge in interest rates left many investors feeling uncertain and vulnerable, while still more have been left without work.

Tina Cheung, a wealth adviser at Vancity, says it is always important to review your financial plan on a regular basis, but a review can be especially important during times like these.

“During these times of uncertainty it is important to have peace of mind, and to have that peace of mind, to achieve it, is to get a financial check up,” she said.

Investors who were shocked at the state of their investment portfolios at the end of the first quarter might breathe a sigh of relief when checking their statements for the second quarter as stock markets have rallied off their lows seen near the end of March.

However, Canada’s main stock index is still down from where it was a year ago and well off the highs it hit in February before the pandemic struck the markets.

“The effects of the pandemic on the market will eventually pass, like the global financial crisis did, but if these few months created any stress or loss of sleep, we need to go back and talk about your risk appetite,” Cheung says.

But she says if your risk appetite has not changed and your goal hasn’t changed, then it is critical to think long term and stick to your plan.

Before heading into a meeting with your adviser, it is important to have a firm grip of your budget and what your goals are for the meeting.

Cheung says you need to be prepared to have an open discussion and be ready with information like your monthly income and expenses.

For some, reviewing their financial plan may mean difficult decisions, facing depleted emergency funds due to the loss of a job and little prospect for a return to work at a level seen before the pandemic.

A poll done for TD Bank found that 38 per cent of those surveyed identified as financially vulnerable in April 2020 compared with 15 per cent in November last year. The poll also found that 13 per cent of those asked in April felt confident in their financial future compared with 20 per cent in November 2019.

If you have taken advantage of the payment deferrals offered by many lenders, you need to have a clear plan for when those deferral periods come to an end and you need to resume making payments.

Gio Bazile, a district vice-president at TD Bank, says some borrowers may start to struggle once the deferrals come to an end if their income hasn’t picked back up again.

“Part of what is going to be really critical is understanding what your future cash flow is going to look like and how do you work with your financial adviser with an impending financial hardship, how do you best balance your wants and needs,” he said.

Bazile says everyone is going to face their own situation, but it’s key to have a candid conversation with your partner or family to understand where you are financially.

“If your cash flow is low or if you are kind of over-leveraged from a debt perspective, then that’s probably a time to actually spend some time with your financial adviser,” he said.

“If you’re looking at your savings account and realizing, wait a minute, I may not be able to get through this next two, three months and beyond, that’s probably another really big trigger.”

473,"It’s called sticker shock: That moment of honesty and dismay when the final bill arrives. We’re not even close to that moment when it comes to Ottawa’s COVID-19 spending, but that feeling is starting to set in.

So far, deficit spending has reached $343 billion this year covering everything from wage subsidies and unemployment benefits to money for seniors, students, rent relief and loans to business.

It may look like some politicians believe we can spend our way out of the economic shock, recession, and, perhaps, depression headed our way.

But what if tax dollars aren’t the only way to free up much needed investment dollars? What if there was a way to encourage Canadians to use their own capital to provide stimulus and support Canadian business?

Wealthy Canadians and corporations are holding cash and there are few incentives for them to invest in private Canadian businesses.

While the 2008 global economic crisis hit the big banks hardest, today’s calamity has struck a death blow to small business with little in the way of assistance coming from Ottawa.

That’s not to say a few small loan programs haven’t been helpful; they just haven’t moved the needle, and many small business owners have been reluctant to take on the risk of additional debt.

A recent survey by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business found that 25 per cent of small businesses will close their doors if they sustain a 50-per-cent drop in revenue for a month.

Many Canadian business owners are already well past that point. This is a tragedy. Small businesses are the heart and soul of the Canadian economy.

If you are a successful small business owner who has built a nest egg over many years, it is unlikely you will double down during a pandemic and reinvest your savings to keep your business afloat.

If you are evaluating an investment in, for example, a tech company looking for additional capital, the risks have increased significantly.

Unlocking private capital would provide additional support from Canadians who are not only looking for a return, but are also emotionally invested in the business’s success.

We’ve seen grassroots, microscale economic support for small business in communities across the country, including from community crowdfunding platform Distantly.ca, which enables individuals to send funds directly to local businesses.

The platform was conceived to make sure Mainstreet was still open post lock down.

Businesses such as restaurants, salons and gyms, which are closing their doors daily, would benefit greatly from an incentive for Canadians to make a much bigger commitment with that support.

Small businesses have a desperate need for capital to invest in digital transformation, working capital, personal protective equipment and other modifications required to comply with new pandemic regulations.

If Canada is going to emerge from this crisis stronger and more resilient, we need tax policy to encourage Canadians to invest in our small businesses.

We are not looking for anything unique or groundbreaking here. A handful of Canadian provinces have tax policy that encourages private investment in small business. New Brunswick has the Small Business Investor Tax Credit program, the most generous in the country.

If you live in New Brunswick and invest in a small business, you get a personal income tax credit of 50 per cent of your investment up to maximum of $125,000 annually. Corporations, trusts, co-ops and local economic development agencies are entitled to similar benefits upon investment. In the last five years, the program has generated almost $450 million of investment, supporting 2,200 small businesses in New Brunswick.

The federal government needs a bold, game-changing tax policy that will encourage Canadians with capital, including small business owners, to step off the sidelines and invest in small business.

We must establish qualifying parameters that encourage small businesses to grow. We must set the bar high in defining “small business,” so we don’t discourage growth.

The U.S. does this well. Section 1202 of its tax code allows for tax-free capital gains of up to $10 million or 10-times the investment if it is in a private business with up to $50 million in assets.

It’s a bold idea. That is easy to implement, were Ottawa so inclined.

As New Brunswick did, the federal government could provide an income tax credit to Canadians for investment in small- and medium-sized businesses. Business owners who double down and reinvest in their own business, could get a tax holiday on income earned, or charge no tax on dividends paid, for up to three-times the invested capital. For investors looking to back potential high-growth entrepreneurs, the program could provide tax-free capital gains — up to tenfold.

Ottawa has the power to do all of the above.

High-income earners in Canada pay more than half of their income to the government, not including municipal and sales tax.

474,"Customers won’t have to separate alcohol and non-alcohol cans from each other

An Abbotsford recycling depot is among those across the province taking part in a six-month pilot program through which people can take in alcohol and non-alcohol beverage cans without having to separate them from one another.

Moe’s Bottle Depot at 2625 Gladys Ave. is among the Return-It depots participating in the program.

Aluminum alcohol cans are the responsibility of and covered under the Brewers Recycled Container Collection Council (BRCCC) and Brewers Distributor Limited (BDL) recycling system.

Only some Return-It depots have a BRCCC/BDL license to manage alcohol containers.

Currently, when consumers visit a Return-It depot and recycle their aluminum beverage containers for a cash refund, they need to separate their alcohol and non-alcohol aluminum cans because this material is managed by two different stewardship agencies.

RELATED: B.C. Return-It to double recycling deposits for pop cans, juice boxes

Only about half of depots have a BRCCC/BDL licence and can provide consumers with a full 10 cent deposit refund per can.

However, since consumers still bring and expect to return their aluminum alcohol and non-alcohol cans at the same Return-It depot for recycling, these small business owners still accept the aluminum alcohol cans but do not have the same financial resources to provide the consumer with a full deposit refund.

As a result, consumers may receive a partial deposit refund to cover the depot’s costs for the handling of these containers. (This is also the case for the Return-It Express system, in which customers can drop off bags of unsorted beverage containers and have their refund deposited into an account.)

Now, customers at participating depots in the pilot project no longer have to separate those cans and will receive the full 10 cent refund per can.

Visit return-it.ca/nosortingcans for a list of the initial participating locations. The list will continually be updated over the coming weeks.

Starting this fall, Return-It plans to implement a 10-cent unified deposit for all beverage containers, regardless of size.

The not-for-profit organization will also be partnering with the Salvation Army to expand Return-It’s textiles collection program to safely drop off used clothing for recycling.

476,"VANCOUVER - The union representing hospitality workers across the country says it fears staff laid off because of COVID-19 may not have a job when the pandemic is over.

The challenges facing workers are unprecedented, with more than 90 per cent of employees in hotels, airports, stadiums, universities and schools out of work since March, said Ian Robb, the Canadian director of Unite Here.

“That is why we’re putting forward three essentials that Canada’s hospitality workers need for a fair and safe recovery in our industry,” he told a news conference Thursday.

The union representing 300,000 workers says it wants to protect jobs, ensure it is safe for workers to return to their workplaces, and get income support for those who are laid off.

Too few employers are using the federal wage subsidy program to keep workers tied to their jobs, and all levels of government need to do to more to avoid long-term unemployment in the sector, Robb said.

Analysts predict the $102-billion industry may not fully recover until the summer of 2022, leading to uncertainty for tens of thousands of workers and their families, he said.

“We’re calling on various levels of government to be creative and to work with us, Unite Here, Canada, to avert long-term unemployment,” Robb said.

The Canadian Emergency Response Benefit is at the centre of the debate as employers recall workers who are concerned about the effects of the pandemic.

Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said the benefit has “created a disincentive to return to work for some staff, especially in industries like hospitality.”

The Hotel Association of Canada said the industry is eager to get as many workers back on the job as possible, but most hotels are hanging on by a thread with occupancy levels hovering under 30 per cent as a national average.

“The missing link here is access to liquidity. Most hotels do not qualify for the government’s loan programs and therefore can’t pay the bills during this period,” the association said in a statement.

“If you can’t pay the bills, you can’t survive and there will be no jobs to return to.”

The association wants the government to address its emergency response programs to give workers an incentive to return to work.

Nia Winston, president of Unite Here in Detroit, said Canada’s hospitality industry should heed the experience in the United States in handling unemployment benefits.

In the U.S., unemployment benefits of $600 a week are set to expire at the end of July, which will make it will be nearly impossible for workers to support their families, she said.

“I strongly urge you to hear our cautionary tale. So Canada can do it differently. So Canada can get it right,” Winston said.

Hotel worker Christie Spiteri said she’s worries the pandemic will be used to replace workers for a lower cost.

She echoed Robb, saying too many employers in the hospitality sector are not using the federal wage subsidy program to keep workers on the payroll.

481,"Vox Media, the publisher of New York magazine, the Verge and SB Nation, is laying off about 6% of its workforce—or some 70 people—as a result of the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, the company said Thursday.

The cuts will primarily affect employees who had been furloughed in April but also some who weren’t, Chief Executive Jim Bankoff said in a memo to staff. He said he believes the reduction “will be sufficient to weather this downturn and uncertainty, without need for significant additional measures.”

“It’s becoming increasingly clear that the second half of the year will not rebound anywhere near our pre-Covid forecasts,” he said. “Furthermore, as cases rise tragically across the country and many of our elected leaders avoid decisive action, we have very limited visibility into the timing or strength of a recovery.”

Mr. Bankoff also said the company was restoring full pay for those who had their salaries reduced in May. At the time, the company introduced a tiered pay reduction for those making more than $130,000 (U.S.) a year. He said his pay cut of 50% would continue, as well as the pay reductions of the company’s executive staff.

Like many media outlets, Vox suffered sharp revenue declines as the pandemic drove down advertising spending and caused it to stop producing lucrative events. Its total revenue in the second quarter was 40% below what the company had projected at the beginning of the year, a person familiar with the matter has said. For the full year, the company is expecting revenue to be 25% below its original target, the person said. Many of the cuts are expected to be to staff in the company’s events business as well as at its sports news site, SB Nation and its real-estate site, Curbed, the person said.

Most news outlets have had to enact some mix of layoffs, furloughs or pay cuts to help counter the economic effects of the pandemic.

482,"VANCOUVER -- People shouldn't expect a bump in births due to the COVID-19, according to a UBC professor leading a national study on sexual health during the pandemic.

Dr. Lori Brotto of the Faculty of Medicine said preliminary findings from her surveys show the opposite of a pandemic baby boom: people aren’t have as much sex, due to the amount of stress they are under.

“I think one of the assumptions was, well ... what are you possibly going to do with all of this time?” Brotto explained.

What is actually happening behind closed doors is that people are under incredible amounts of stress, whether it’s due to finances, childcare or homeschooling, taking care of elders, or fear of contracting COVID-19.

“We know that stress is a powerful deterrent to sexual interest and sexual activity,” Brotto said, calling the stereotype that people are having more sex during the pandemic “unhealthy,” because it can make people feel worse than they already are if they believe the myth.

The study is also tracking gender-based violence during the pandemic. Brotto said it’s too early to quantify, but the surveys are indicating that spending more time at home for some means spending more time with an abusive partner.

“This is unfortunate and it’s not surprising because we have seen this in past pandemics,” Brotto observed.

Earlier in the pandemic, local shelters and crisis lines saw alarming increases in calls for help.

The study is based on online surveys of more than 900 Canadians. Participants answer a confidential questionnaire every four weeks for a duration of six months. Topics include sexual behaviour, relationship status, anxiety and depression levels.

Brotto’s research will also track how sexual behaviour changes as physical distancing guidelines are relaxed, in hopes of learning more about the role stress plays in overall health and sexuality.

“It’s important that people seek out accurate evidence-based information when it comes to sexuality and not to believe the stereotypes that pervade our society,” she added.

485,"A combination of emergency pandemic spending and a steep drop in expected provincial taxes has B.C. projecting a potential deficit of $12.5 billion this year, Finance Minister Carole James says.

In an economic update July 14, James released projections of a $6.3 billion drop in sales and income taxes, natural resource revenues and Crown corporation income. Spending adds the rest to what started 2020 as a balanced budget with a $227 million surplus, adding a $6 billion more to the deficit.

James said the remaining $1.5 billion of the $5 billion emergency fund voted by the B.C. legislature will be allocated for economic recovery in September, after the government completes a public survey and continues meeting with business sectors on how to proceed.

Beyond the emergency spending for business and personal financial relief, more than $1 billion of the additional spending is in health care, including lab testing, supports for long-term care facilities, health prevention and contact tracing for COVID-19, and mental health supports. Another $250 million has been directed to maintain child care services.

Nearly $90 million has been directed to temporary housing, meal and health supports, in addition to $110 million to buy hotels to move people living in encampments.

Crown corporation income is projected to be down $882 million from the February budget forecast, which James said is mostly due to the shutdown of B.C. Lottery Corp. casinos due to the pandemic. ICBC costs have declined in the early part of the 2020-21 fiscal year due to a reduction in travel, but that could change as pandemic restrictions on travel are lifted and more people return to work, she said.

B.C. Liberal leader Andrew Wilkinson warned of the impact of B.C. tax deferrals that are expected to run out this fall.

“Back in May we suggested a 90-day break on employer health tax, sales tax and hotel tax to get the economy rolling again,” Wilkinson told reporters after the update. “And instead what we saw the NDP do is say, no, they’re just going to let it pile up until September, October and send a huge bill to all these businesses when they’re least able to pay it.”

486,"EDMONTON -- Mayor Don Iveson is welcoming the federal government's relief funding amid the pandemic, though he stressed Edmonton's finances are not out of the woods yet.

On Thursday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced the federal government would give a total of $19 billion to the 13 provinces and territories as part of the Safe Restart Agreement.

Municipalities across Canada are slated to receive approximately $2 billion to offset the losses caused by COVID-19.

""The City of Edmonton, like many big cities across the country, has faced immediate, significant and non-recoverable losses related to delivering essential services during this pandemic, such as transit, waste, emergency services, enforcement and other frontline services that Canadians depend on,"" Iveson said Friday. ""We've seen rising costs, plummeting revenue, and no responsible ability for us to run deficits.""

Iveson, along with the Federation of Canadian Municipalities, has been vocal about the need to receive federal funding to attempt to get the books in order.

""This agreement is a promising start at addressing the financial crisis municipalities face in this pandemic, as we work to protect frontline services for Canadians and prepare to help lead Canada's much-needed recovery,"" said FCM president Bill Karsten.

Iveson said the Alberta capital's financial gap is estimated to be $172 million by the end of 2020, with the pandemic especially pumping the brakes on transit revenue.

ETS shortfall revenue is expected to surpass $60 million by the end of the year, Iveson said, and nearly reach $50 million next year as Edmonton expects low ridership to continue.

The mayor is unsure how much money Edmonton will receive as part of the Safe Restart Agreement — he estimates it will be in the low nine figures — but specified transit funds will be included.

""A robust transit system is critical for Edmonton's economic restart, and in turn, Alberta's economic recovery,"" Iveson said.

He thanked Trudeau, Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland and Premier Jason Kenney.","Iveson says federal funding is helpful, but warns of ongoing financial issues",2,0.3832563847662638
487,"The federal, provincial and territorial governments have reached a deal on billions of dollars in transfers to continue reopening economies amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Thursday.

He said the federal government will contribute $19 billion under the “Safe Restart Agreement” to help provinces fund things like child care, contact tracing and personal protective equipment. There is also money to bail out municipal governments that saw soaring expenses and plunging revenues during the pandemic.

Trudeau had promised $14 billion in early June, but several premiers said they needed more money and also resisted some of the conditions the federal Liberals wanted to put on the deal.

Ontario Premier Doug Ford was one who didn’t like a federal demand that some of it fund up to 10 days of paid sick leave to discourage workers with precarious employment from going into work ill.

“This funding will support us as we get the economy going over the next six to eight months,” Ford said Thursday. “My friends ... it’s a great deal for Ontario.”

The agreement includes sick leave, fully funded by the federal government.

Manitoba’s Brian Pallister said he’s pleased with that provision.

“I think it’s very important we have a national program, and the prime minister obviously agreed,” he said in an interview with The Canadian Press.

“I think the important thing is that, as opposed to some past discussions where premiers were drawn away from supporting other premiers, the premiers stuck together and they stood for what they wanted and largely got it.”

British Columbia’s John Horgan said his province expects nearly $2 billion in transfers and emphasized the sick-leave program as a key move to make sure nobody feels pressured to go work sick.

Quebec’s Francois Legault wanted the money to be transferred without conditions so provinces could use it on whatever they considered most important. He also didn’t want the cash distributed purely by population, noting that Quebec had been hit harder by COVID-19 than other provinces.

Thursday, he echoed Pallister in saying that the premiers’ sticking together got them a deal they like. He credited Saskatchewan’s Scott Moe in convincing all the premiers to hold the line.

“Yes, we wanted the federal government to invest and help get us through the pandemic, but we also wanted the federal government to respect provincial jurisdiction and also give us the flexibility to choose our priorities,” Legault said.

For Quebec, spending money on protective equipment from Quebec suppliers is a key example, he said.

Trudeau said the agreement outlines seven priority areas, with some room for the provinces to apply the money to their particular needs over the next six to eight months.

“The provinces agreed to invest in the targeted sectors,” Trudeau said. “There are areas like support for vulnerable people where we will expect the provinces to declare publicly what they will do.”

At his side, Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland added the agreement includes standards in certain areas, such as COVID-19 testing, in exchange for the federal money.

Trudeau said workers can’t work if their children don’t have safe care, and many can’t get to their jobs if they don’t have access to safe transit systems.

“Until we find a vaccine, the daily threat of COVID-19 will not disappear,” he said.

Municipal governments, which deliver many of those services, have been begging for aid for months, warning their finances are careening toward brick walls. Many city revenue streams dried up during the pandemic, as recreational centres and programs closed, and transit riders stopped using buses and trains.

Toronto has reported that it’s facing a $1.35-billion deficit this year. Mayor John Tory said the federal money will help, though how much depends on how the Ontario government allocates it. Transit in Toronto and its suburbs is critical and the systems’ finances have been devastated by the pandemic, he said.

Montreal says it has a $500-million shortfall. Halifax expects to be short $85.4 million.

“If cities aren’t equipped for a safe restart, people will not be safe,” Trudeau said.

The Federation of Canadian Municipalities said it’s encouraged but wants to see the fine print.

“We’re optimistic this agreement will recognize the financial crisis municipalities face in this pandemic,” said the federation’s president Bill Karsten, a Halifax councillor. That means emergency funding that’s clearly identified and gets to municipal front lines fast — so we can keep vital services going strong and prepare to drive Canada’s economic recovery.“

Nova Scotia Premier Stephen McNeil said in a statement that he welcomes a deal that will bring his province more than $250 million.

“Provinces have borne the full impact of COVID-19 and individuals and businesses across Nova Scotia will feel the impact for months to come,” he said. “This funding will help to address those challenges.”

He said the funding will help with:

—Testing, contact tracing and data management

—Health care, including mental health and addictions

—Aiding vulnerable populations, including in nursing homes

—Personal protective equipment

—Early learning and child care

—Municipal budgets, including public transit

—Paid sick leave

Missing from the list is public education, which is administered by the provinces. Many provinces are struggling with how to reopen schools safely in the fall, and many parents won’t be able to go back to work fully if children aren’t physically in class.

488,"The B.C. government is pushing ahead with changes to increase insurable earnings under WorkSafeBC rules, and to give the insurer the ability to accept COVID-19 and other viral ailments as work-related without the current 90-day waiting period and investigation.

Labour Minister Harry Bains introduced amendments in the B.C. legislature July 14, emphasizing an increase in maximum disability benefits from $87,000 to $100,000, and authorizing WorkSafeBC to provide preventive medical treatment before a claim is accepted.

Changes to the Workers Compensation Act would also affect the rules for COVID-19 and other viral illness claims, which WorkSafeBC is already reviewing by the hundreds. Between 50 and 60 per cent of those claims are being accepted, Bains said.

A labour ministry statement on the changes puts it this way: “The legislation will fast-track the effective date of presumptions if established by WorkSafeBC board of directors for occupational diseases caused by viral pathogens. The presumption would simplify the process for workers who make a workers’ compensation claim if they contract viruses on the job. This would ensure that people who are at higher risk of contracting COVID-19 at work are able to access benefits more quickly.”

Employers have strongly opposed the change in “presumptions” that a coronavirus infection came from exposure at work. In a submission to WorkSafeBC, the Employers’ Forum argues that a better remedy is the national sick pay program proposed by Premier John Horgan and other premiers to deal with work lost due to pandemic rules and effects.

“Insufficient scientific information and the nature of this pandemic means the workers’ compensation system can only effectively address claims on a case-by-case basis, much as public health officials are currently doing win the contact tracing process,” the organization representing large and small employers said in its submission. “This pandemic – like all pandemics – is a public health crisis, not a workplace health crisis.

“Embedding public health costs in WorkSafeBC premiums could be ruinous for businesses who are unable to absorb any further fixed or variable cost increases because of the ongoing fallout from COVID-19, and could undermine the long-term financial stability of WorkSafeBC.”

Bains said the increase in insurable earnings represents a cost to employers, who fund the no-fault compensation system through payroll assessments. The government’s planned changes allow for “stability in premiums” for this year and the next two, Bains said.

490,"A union representing Ontario health-care workers says it’s planning a series of escalating political and legal actions, including brief work interruptions, in response to the province potentially extending its emergency powers. The Ontario Council of Hospital Unions, a division of the Canadian Union of Public Employees, says it’s pushing back against the province’s emergency order because it suspends their collective bargaining agreement. Union president Michael Hurley says his members are going to start by sending their MPPs emails this week, explaining how the order damages their workplace rights. The union says it’s also planning legal challenges and will hold rallies outside of its workplaces on Friday. Members of the union will vote on Monday night to see if it will be necessary to have a brief work stoppage the next day. Hurley says that while the emergency orders were acceptable in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, it’s now a detriment to health-care workers and the emergency is over in most of the province. A spokeswoman for the union confirmed on Monday that 98 per cent of its membership voted in favour of political action over the weekend. Hurley says that his members are “angry” and will be holding a series of news conferences in Hamilton, Sudbury, Ottawa and Toronto this week to bring attention to the issues at the community level. The Progressive Conservative government introduced a bill last week that would allow it to keep some emergency measures in place in the months ahead.

492,"B.C. recorded 175 overdose deaths in June, the highest monthly total for the second consecutive month.

The latest report from the B.C. Coroners Service shows a 130-per-cent rise in such deaths over June 2019, and a two-per-cent increase over May, when the service reported a then-record 170 deaths from illicit drugs.

That’s almost six deaths a day in June, as large fentanyl concentrations mixed into the drug supply continue to threaten the lives of users in the province as dealers try to maintain supply with border closures slowing smuggling.

“Today’s report clearly shows us that the tragedy of overdose deaths from the toxic street-drug supply in B.C. continues to escalate,” said Dr. Bonnie Henry, the provincial health officer. “While much effort has been made to reduce harm, remove stigma and provide the care that people living with addiction need, the impacts of the pandemic have made the situation dire for too many.”

There have now been more than 100 overdose deaths in each of the four months since the COVID-19 pandemic hit British Columbia, closing vital community facilities, isolating drug users from crucial support networks and creating the conditions for a more contaminated drug supply.

Chief coroner Lisa Lapointe is urging substance users to have someone present when using drugs or to go to an overdose prevention or supervised-consumption site where drugs can be checked for toxicity.

She says opioids, along with cocaine and the stimulants methamphetamine and amphetamine, have been detected among those who have fatally overdosed.

However, she says the illicit opioid fentanyl remains the most significant driver in the high number of deaths.

“We’ve been doing everything we can to address this issue, but during the pandemic the drug supply has been drying up because of closed borders and that means that the poisoned drug supply has intensified,” Premier John Horgan said in an afternoon address. “I want to lift my hands to those front-line workers — paramedics, firefighters and those in emergency rooms — that are doing everything they can to keep people well and to keep people safe during a pandemic and also addressing an opioid crisis.”

Horgan says he supports the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police proposal, made last week, for the decriminalization of the personal possession of illicit drugs and recognition that substance use and addiction is a public health issue.

“So, we take away the criminal stigma and focus on what this really is — a healthcare crisis,” Horgan said. “We don’t want people to be criminals, (we) want them to be patients and we want them to get well. And I know the federal government agrees with me on that.”

Overdose deaths in B.C. now sit at 728 for the year, which equates to roughly four per day. Meanwhile, the provincial death toll from COVID-19 totalled 189, as of Thursday afternoon.

The premier bristled at a suggestion that the province, based on its differing responses to the two health crises, values the lives of people with COVID-19 over the lives of those dealing with addiction.

“I just think that these are two separate things. We have an insidious virus that affects anyone at any time and we have an opioid crisis that involves people using drugs. Those are choices initially and then they become dependencies,” he said. “Once people make those choices they are no longer in a position to stop making those choices without intervention, without medical intervention. The COVID-19 crisis is a global crisis and we can already see in the United States what happens if you don’t follow basic guidelines.”

Solving the overdose epidemic, Horgan said, will require national leadership.

495,"VANCOUVER -- The province’s top doctor is pleading for compassion as she warns British Columbians they could have loved ones using drugs in secret.

B.C. once again saw a record number of overdose deaths, due in part to the pandemic.

The latest statistics from the BC Coroners Service found 175 people died from drug overdoses in B.C. in June, while the first six months of the year saw 176 deaths due to COVID-19.

""About 80 per cent of people who died are men between the ages of 19 and two-thirds of people died in their own home,"" said Dr. Bonnie Henry. ""We know from the conversations we've had with family, with friends, that most of their family and friends did not know that they were using drugs and many of them died alone.""

Analysis by the coroners service concludes the COVID-19 pandemic is making the overdose crisis, which has claimed thousands of lives in the province in the past five years, even deadlier.

""The one thing we know from our data is the people who are dying, many of them are dying alone and so the complications with the dual health emergency, with the COVID-19 pandemic and the illicit drug crisis -- we know that people have been isolated and we know there's been unintended consequences, too, for people who use drugs during COVID,"" said spokesperson Andy Watson. “We continue to advocate for people to buddy up, don’t use without somebody there to help you if you come across a toxic dose.""

When asked about the billions of dollars being spent on the pandemic in the past few months, compared to millions on the fentanyl crisis declared a public health emergency years ago despite many more deaths, Premier John Horgan insisted it’s not constructive to compare the two crises.

""These are two separate things. We have an insidious virus that affects anyone at any time and we have an opioid crisis that involves people using drugs. Those are choices initially, and then they become dependencies,"" he said. ""My first meeting with Bonnie (Henry) when she was first hired was about safe drugs supply, so we've been working on bringing these numbers down. We've seen a spike in the past couple of months -- it's very disturbing, particularly for those families affected. I want British Columbians to know we're not abandoning them. We're going to redouble our efforts to bring more resources, to bring more actions across the country working with the federal government so we can wrestle this to the ground just the way we have all collectively wrestled COVID-19 to the ground.""

Horgan also reiterated his support for a call by the nation’s police chiefs to decriminalize the personal possession of drugs, and treat illicit substances as a public health concern rather than a criminal matter. He also emphasized his support for a safe, clean drug supply – which he called particularly important since closed borders are widely blamed for the increased presence of fentanyl in street drugs, making them even deadlier.

The Liberal critic for mental health and addictions called the NDP approach a failure for not providing enough resources for those looking for help.

“There's waiting lists they can't get in, so there’s a very disjointed system in British Columbia that does not help people get into recovery -- even when they're ready to get into recovery,” said Jane Thornthwaite. ""You'd think after three years they could've come up with a comprehensive mental health and addictions strategy that would help prevent these tragic deaths.""

The coroners service, meanwhile, is emphasizing the need to destigmatize drug use so that no one is using alone behind closed doors, as well as medical-grade drugs.

""We need to create more access to safe supply and remove the barriers for people that are looking for help,"" insisted Watson.

The soft hands, long-term approach to battling drug dependency was the focus of Henry’s comments on the new overdose numbers, comments she made while visibly moved by the death toll.

""It's not a drug problem, it's a pain problem…whether it's physical pain, whether it's emotional pain, psycho-social pain, the pain of family drama and trauma you’ve gone through, those are things that lead people to use drugs. Nobody grows up thinking I want to be addicted to substances, I want to have a substance use disorder, I want to have this controlling my life,"" said Henry.

""This ongoing crisis reminds us we need to put as much time and effort and kindness and compassion into caring for people who use drugs as we have been successful in responding to the COVID19 crises.""",Many of them died alone': Most overdoses at home in B.C.'s deadliest month,8,0.9735197845800538
496,"VICTORIA—British Columbia’s balanced budget has been shattered by the COVID-19 pandemic, with the province forecasting a deficit of $12.5 billion for 2020-21.

Finance Minister Carole James said the numbers are staggering with job losses of 235,000 since February and a predicted GDP decline of 6.8 per cent by the end of this year.

“We were preparing for economic moderation, we were well-equipped to be able to weather the challenges,” James said at a news conference Tuesday.

“What came next was unprecedented. Mere weeks after Budget 2020 was tabled, our entire world changed.”

The government has provided $6.26 billion in financial aid to businesses and individuals. Among the losses it anticipates this fiscal year because of the pandemic are close to $1 billion in personal income tax, $973 million in corporate income tax and $1.3 billion in provincial sales tax, James said.

The projected GDP decline in 2020 would be the worst on record going back to the 1980s, although it is also projected to increase by 3.1 per cent in 2021.

James said for context, B.C.’s real GDP has only declined twice in the past 40 years, falling by 2.4 per cent in 2009 and 6.4 per cent in 1982.

“As those numbers remind us, this could be the worst downturn experienced in our province recent history,” she said.

B.C.’s restart plan is showing signs of hope for the economy as consumer confidence increases, she said. The unemployment rate is slowly rebounding and fewer wildfires and floods have helped the bottom line.

However, she warned that the province’s financial forecast could change depending on many risk factors, including the possibility of a second wave of infections, the possibility of a vaccine, as well as the success of relief measures and central bank policy.

Regardless of how B.C. copes with the pandemic, James said its economy is also subject to the economic health of other jurisdictions, particularly those that buy from the province.

James said it wouldn’t help the economic recovery to pull back on spending, but the government will review every cent spent as it heads into the next budget year.

The B.C. government has tabled legislation giving itself room for three years of deficits, which James said will be re-examined each year.

James said she believes people care about provincial deficits because they understand it’s taxpayer money, but they also understand the emergency the pandemic created.

She declined to predict how long the recovery would take, given the many moving pieces at play.

“There is no question that COVID-19 has had a profound impact on the economy of British Columbia and that’s not short term,” she said.

The job losses have been widespread but some have been disproportionately affected, depending on a worker’s age, gender or which sector they work in, James said.

Young workers are among the hardest hit, with the unemployment rate rising sharply from 9.1 per cent in February to 29.1 per cent in June for those aged 15 to 24.

Women, who dominate the service industries and many of whom have also left jobs to care for family members, are another group more affected. Their unemployment rate rose from 4.8 per cent in February to 13.4 per cent in June.

The hardest hit industries include wholesale and retail, accommodation and food services, construction, culture and recreation.

The overall unemployment rate of 13 per cent remains at its highest level since 1987. While the job losses in March and April were record breaking, the figures for May and June have seen modest recovery as the economy started to reopen.

“The projected numbers are staggering but they’re not without hope. Things are getting better each and every day when we follow the provincial health officer’s advice,” James said.

The NDP government’s fiscal update was met with calls for an economic recovery plan by its political opponents, with the Opposition B.C. Liberals asking what happens when federal benefits like the Canada Emergency Response Benefit run out.

Liberal Leader Andrew Wilkinson also suggested the government should reconsider its pre-pandemic spending priorities.

“People in every corner of B.C. have had to adjust to a new normal and adapt their household budgets, so why is this government pretending it’s business as usual?” he asked in a statement.

The Green party said the province should transition to a green economy by helping traditional industries become more sustainable, spending on training and building local businesses into the supply chain.

“We can seize the once in a generation opportunity to strategically drive stimulus spending toward a future British Columbians want: an innovative, low-carbon, sustainable, just and inclusive economy for all,” interim leader Adam Olsen said.

497,"WINNIPEG -- Premier Brian Pallister is calling on the federal government to make changes to the Canadian Emergency Response Benefit (CERB).

Pallister made the announcement Tuesday morning, saying the current program penalizes those who want to return to work.

The current program will give Canadians up to $2,000 as long as they earn less than $1,000.

""The program needs to be redesigned. It needs to be redesigned to make sure people aren't penalized for working and wanting to support their families without having to be dependent on the CERB,"" said Pallister.

The Manitoba government created the Job Restart Program as an alternative for Manitobans, which would provide payments of up to $2,000 in financial support for those who went off CERB and took a full-time job.

""We all succeed as Canada succeeds,"" said Pallister.

Pallister said he has written to other premiers in Canada, as he hopes they will also ask the federal government to make changes to the program.

Pallister added he wants to make it clear that he is not criticizing the federal government, saying he believes Ottawa has done a good job handling the pandemic.

NDP Leader Wab Kinew told CTV News he believes CERB should remain and be expanded, and says the premier does not understand the need for CERB.

“I don’t want to see a second lockdown happen, but as long as the experts are saying there is a possibility we might have to do more restrictions, we need to keep programs like the CERB and the wage subsidy in place to help people through this difficult economic time,” he said.

“In my own experience, I know really hard-working people who were put out of work due to the lockdown restrictions, and they had to turn to the CERB, and if Mr. Pallister doesn’t understand the importance that it played in allowing people to keep making their mortgage payments, to put food on the table, to pay their bills, it tells me he doesn’t understand the scope of the recession we’re in, and the importance of that program to help keep our economy moving.”

In a statement, Manitoba Liberal Leader Dougald Lamont said the province’s reopening strategy cannot be about going back to normal.

“Governments and businesses need to plan to handle that reckoning while building a much stronger and self-reliant economy, not more of the same,” Lamont wrote in a statement.

“Brian Pallister needs to look at the colossal failures of his own PC government before he points fingers at anyone else.”

MANITOBA RESTART

Pallister also touched on the importance of face-to-face meetings and he feels more can be done compared to electronic meetings.

With that, he said the plan is to head to Ottawa with a Restart Manitoba Taskforce, which would include several cabinet ministers to discuss a handful of topics.

""I think it is time for us to get back to some face-to-face on a number of fronts,"" said Pallister.

He added he can't talk on all the details right now, but the plan is to meet with those in the nation's capital in August.

PROMOTING TRAVEL IN MANITOBA

On Monday, Travel Manitoba released its newest campaign encouraging Manitobans to explore their own backyard, but the campaign also targeted those in Western Canada as well as northwestern Ontario.

Pallister was asked if this was the right approach considering there are still a higher number of cases in those provinces.

""Manitoba offers the safest site for you to visit in the country and one of the safest in the world,"" he said. ""The reality is that we are diligent here and we know we can't continue to live in fear. That being said we have to exercise responsible relaxing of the past rules.""

Pallister added while COVID-19 case numbers are increasing in parts of Western Canada, such as Alberta and Saskatchewan, the important number is the percentage of positive tests and not total positive cases.

498,"VICTORIA -- More drug users died in British Columbia last month than ever before in the province's history, eclipsing a record set just one month prior as health officials grapple with the twin crises of a global pandemic and an opioid epidemic.

There were 175 illicit drug toxicity deaths in B.C. in June, an average of 5.8 fatalities every day.

The latest numbers have pushed the province's total to 728 lives lost to illegal drugs in the first six months of 2020. Most of the 175 deaths in June – 124 in total – involved fentanyl, according to the BC Coroners Service.

The previous monthly record set in May saw 171 drug users die of suspected overdoses and poisonings, a rate of 5.5 drug fatalities per day.

Most of the deaths have occurred in Vancouver, Surrey and Victoria.

""For the second month in a row, this province has experienced the highest number of deaths ever as a result of illicit substances with 175 lives lost, leaving behind grief and frustration while this public health emergency carries on into its fifth year,"" said chief coroner Lisa Lapointe in a statement Thursday.

""We know the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted people who use drugs, as it has all British Columbians,"" Lapointe added. ""Access to key harm reduction services has been a challenge and our social networks are smaller.""

The chief coroner warned that the ""drug supply in our province is highly toxic"" as data from the coroners service published Thursday reveals an increasing number of drug users in April, May and June had ""extreme fentanyl concentrations"" in their blood during post-mortem tests.

The coroner's warning comes one week after B.C. Premier John Horgan gave his support to a group of Canadian police chiefs who are calling for the complete decriminalization of illicit drugs for personal use.

The Canadian Association of Police Chiefs announced on July 9 that it was endorsing the decriminalization of drug possession and calling for a national task force on drug policy reforms.

The premier noted that British Columbia is limited in what it can do with regard to drug enforcement policy – a federal Criminal Code matter – but said he has ""made it clear to the prime minister where British Columbia stands.""

Horgan responded to the report into B.C. drug deaths Thursday, saying the province plans to create more drug treatment spaces and put focus on addiction recovery rather than prosecution.

""The people who are addicted to opioids are not criminals, they're patients,"" the premier said.

He denied criticisms that his government is placing a greater emphasis on fighting the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed 189 British Columbians as of Thursday, than on the overdose crisis, which has killed nearly four times more since January.

""I want British Columbians to know that we are not abandoning them on this question,"" Horgan said.

Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry called Thursday's drug fatality numbers ""a tragedy,"" as province-wide measures to control the spread of COVID-19 have left many drug users less likely or unable to access harm-reduction services.

""Today's report clearly shows us that the tragedy of overdose deaths from the toxic street drug supply in B.C. continues to escalate,"" Henry said. ""While much effort has been made to reduce harm, remove stigma and provide the care that people living with addiction need, the impacts of the pandemic have made the situation dire for too many.""

Dr. Perry Kendall, an executive director with the BC Centre on Substance Use, says the recent spike in deaths among drug users is ""entirely preventable.""

The coroners service says that no deaths have been reported at any of B.C.'s supervised consumption sites in 2020.

""The number of lives lost over more than four years of a public health emergency is heartbreaking,"" Kendall said. ""It is quite clear what needs to be done: invest in a public health approach to substance use that promotes the health and equity of people who use drugs. This must include not only decriminalization, but also pharmaceutical alternatives to the toxic drug supply.""","B.C. records deadliest-ever month for drug overdoses, surpassing May record",8,0.5725782871654547
499,"VICTORIA -- One day after the Victoria Cannabis Buyers Club was raided by the provincial safety unit for a second time – and had its products confiscated – club members rallied on the steps of B.C.’s legislature.

Members say they are hoping to bring change to the province’s medical cannabis system.

“This is a complicated political chess game that we’re engaged in that’s never been done before,” said Ted Smith, founder of the Victoria Cannabis Buyers Club.

“Trying to get our club an exemption is a difficult and tricky path.”

Smith says the club needs an exemption from Health Canada in order to continue operating as a non-profit.

According to Smith, the Victoria Cannabis Buyers Club, which was founded in 1996, offers a wide range of medical cannabis products to its 8,000 members at a lower price than retailers.

One of those members, Suzan L’heureux, says the service the club provides is crucial for members like her.

“I used to go to a little store and it was $29 for these joints I use to get. Now they’re $63, so that’s a big jump when you don’t have money, you’re sick and you’re struggling,” said L’heureux.

The Victoria Cannabis Buyers Club was first raided by the B.C. government in November. After that first raid, Victoria city council sent a letter to the provincial government asking that the club be exempt from the current laws around the sale of pot.

Now, the club hopes the city will support them again.

“(We’re hoping) to get the city council to pass a motion to go to the federal government now to push for a meaningful dialogue to get an exemption for our club,” said Smith.

Smith says he’s tried to reach out to the federal government on his own but has heard nothing back.

“I’m already trying to get my head around how to crack Health Canada open here but they’re so far away and so caught up in other matters it’s going to be tough,” he said.

501,"WINNIPEG -- The Manitoba government announced on Wednesday it will expand the Back to Work wage subsidy program and provide more funding for businesses to create more employment opportunities in the province.

Premier Brian Pallister made the announcement at a news conference at the Manitoba Legislative Building on Wednesday.

“We are leading the country, but we are not out of the woods yet,” he said.

“And I wouldn’t want my statement today to be misconstrued as suggesting we should ease off in any way our efforts as we move forward. We have more Manitobans unemployed than in any time since the Great Depression, a high percentage of people are looking for work, higher than has ever been the case in the lifetime of most Manitobans.”

Statistics Canada said Manitoba’s unemployment rate was 10.1 per cent for June.

The new expanded program will reimburse up to $5,000 for up to 10 new workers for a maximum of $50,000per business, non-profit, or charity.

The province noted that any businesses that have already used the summer wage subsidies are still eligible to take part in this benefit and hire or bring back another 10 employees. It added that any employers that have received financial aid from other provincial or federal programs are still eligible as well.

The program will also reimburse half of all wages for those newly hired to Oct. 31.

“Our expansion and deepening of our programs will allow employers and employees to offer the services that Manitobans depend upon and rely upon and to help us to recover,” the premier said.

Businesses will be able to apply for the wage subsidy program starting on July 16 at noon. The application deadline is Oct. 1, and the deadline to submit proof of wages is Jan. 4, 2021.

“We’ve led in creating a safe environment for our people and that has enabled us to lead in terms of our economic recovery as well,” Pallister said.

“We understand that the safety of our people is paramount, but being safe and being unemployed is hardly a recipe for joy or success in life and so what we’re after here is being safe and employed instead.”

The province also announced it’s extending the deadline for applications for the Manitoba Gap Protection program to Aug. 31.",Manitoba expanding program to help residents get back to work,2,0.35681876360334597
502,"British Columbia Premier John Horgan took credit Thursday for pushing the rest of the country to endorse a new $1.1-billion federally funded paid sick leave program to help Canadians avoid spreading COVID-19 at their jobs.

A $19-billion “safe restart agreement” has been reached with the provinces and territories, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced earlier in the day, meant to fund efforts to combat the coronavirus pandemic for the next six to eight months.

As part of this package, the federal government is offering a “temporary income support program” that will provide workers 10 days of paid sick leave related to COVID-19, if they don’t already have access to this benefit.

Horgan, Yukon Premier Sandy Silver and Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister have been advocating for such a national program to help Canadians avoid having to choose between working while sick and losing income during a pandemic.

More than half of workers in B.C. between 25 and 65 years old do not have any paid sick days, according to a survey by the BC office of the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives. Workers with low incomes are also much less likely to have any, they found, including 89 per cent of those earning less than $30,000 a year.

“I’m particularly proud of our ability here in British Columbia to push the rest of the country to embrace the idea of a paid sick leave program, nationally funded and nationally co-ordinated,” Horgan said during a press conference Thursday.

The government said the program, which it estimated to cost $1.1 billion, will “encourage workers to remain at home and seek public health advice if they are showing symptoms.”

“To safely restart the economy, Canada must ensure that workers do not return to work if they have COVID-19 or are showing symptoms,” reads a backgrounder from Trudeau’s office.

Provinces and territories will need to pass legislation or regulations that will protect the jobs of workers who are taking advantage of the 10 days being offered, the government said.

B.C. plans to roll out its own $1.5-billion recovery package in the coming days. Horgan said those details are being finalized now and had originally included paid sick leave until Ottawa said it would pick up the bill.

The province recently forecasted a deficit of $12.5 billion for 2020-21 and has seen job losses of 235,000 since February. After distributing more than $5 billion in financial aid, B.C. is bracing for over a billion dollars in losses in income tax and sales tax.

In addition to paid sick leave, the prime minister said other funding in the $19-billion agreement would go toward: more testing, contact tracing and health information sharing; long-term care facilities, home care and palliative care; personal protective equipment; child-care spaces; and Canadians experiencing substance use, mental health, or homelessness challenges.

The government will also be providing two streams of joint funding with the provinces and territories, one for public transit and another for municipalities.

Public transit funding has been a major issue for B.C., Ontario and Quebec. TransLink in Metro Vancouver was expected to lose almost a half-billion dollars in revenue in 2020 as ridership plummeted, according to the Mayors’ Council on Regional Transportation.

One of the “sticking points” over the restart plan was that Ottawa had initially capped transit funding, said Horgan, such that he said it would have been entirely absorbed by Vancouver, Toronto and Montreal.

“We anticipate we’re going to be needing in the neighbourhood of $600 million to get back on track ... just for this year,” he said.

Toronto Mayor John Tory said Thursday he expects the TTC to benefit significantly from the federal funding.

Ontario Premier Doug Ford, speaking from a farm in the province’s southern region as he embarked on a provincial tour, described the overall federal funding as “desperately needed.”

Ontario’s share of the cash is roughly $7 billion, he said. Ford thanked Freeland and Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe for their leadership on the deal, along with mayors of Ontario cities who he said gave “unwavering support” during negotiations.

Energy Minister Greg Rickford on Tuesday announced Susanna Zagar, a long-time bureaucrat, as the new chief executive officer of the OEB. Lynne Anderson, who was appointed to the board by the previous Liberal government in 2017, will be the OEB’s new chief commissioner. “I look forward to working together with these experienced leaders as we renew and modernize the OEB,” Rickford said in a statement. “Strong leadership will help the OEB better serve individuals and families, allow the provincial regulator to operate more effectively and efficiently, and help ensure that Ontario’s energy system remains sustainable and reliable, as was envisioned in the OEB review panel,” he said. In the wake of the Tories’ cronyism scandal last summer — when Premier Doug Ford’s then chief of staff resigned suddenly amid a furor over patronage postings — the government has moved to make appointments less partisan. The province says reforms at the OEB are aimed at “enhancing transparency and accountability” and “pursuing greater efficiencies” by “reducing regulatory burden.” Zagar, a former senior civil servant at Queen’s Park, has most recently been chief strategy officer at the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board.

505,"WATERLOO REGION — The region’s YMCAs have long focused on improving an individual’s health and well-being. Now, in the midst of the pandemic that’s ramped up stress levels and obliterated the line between work and home for many, the YMCAs of Cambridge & Kitchener-Waterloo are extending that mission to the workplace. A new program for workplaces will be developed by three people with extensive experience in workplace culture and employee well-being — Jim Moss, Dave Whiteside and Nate Robertson, all formerly of Plasticity Labs. Financial problems forced the Kitchener tech company out of business in April. Founded in 2013 by Moss and his wife, Jennifer, the firm developed a platform to improve workplace happiness and employee engagement and performance. As a Plasticity customer, the YMCA saw the benefits the platform brought to the charity’s own employees, said chief executive officer Peter Sweeney (the two YMCAs share a common organizational structure). “They helped us understand, through the insights of our employees, how best to make this a great place to work.” While the YMCA program won’t be focused on technology, the trio of ex-Plasticity staffers bring the experience needed as the Y embarks on this experiment. “They know how to work within the workplace context to uncover the emotional needs of employees,” said Sweeney, who reached out to Moss to propose the idea. COVID-19 has exposed some of the cracks in society, and some of those are rooted in the workplace, Sweeney said. Remote work has left many employees craving connection. Child care is a major strain on families right now. Front-line workers in sectors ranging from health care to retail are under unprecedented stress. “Would other organizations benefit from a non-profit like the Y coming in to help them understand what their employees need?” Sweeney asked. “This is an opportunity to test a theory.” For Moss, the new program presents an exciting challenge that turns the page on the difficult decision to close Plasticity Labs, one that left him feeling he’d failed employees that found themselves out of work. “I spent some time to distill what I learned about myself from the Plasticity experience,” he said. High on that list was the understanding that he cared deeply about improving the workplace experience for others. Specifics about how the program will work and what services may be offered are being considered, but they know a one-size-fits-all approach won’t work. “If you don’t come into it with an open mind, you’re in trouble,” Moss said. “We don’t pretend to have all the answers that workplaces need,” Sweeney added. “We’re willing to take a risk to try it.” Moss will lead the project, as vice-president, workplace well-being. Whiteside is a “powerhouse” in data collection and interpretation, Moss said, while Robertson, a skilled problem-solver with a background in design, will join the team part-time. The program will serve the local YMCAs’ coverage area, which includes Waterloo Region, Guelph and Stratford. As a social enterprise, proceeds from program fees will be reinvested in the charity. While it will be fee-based, the YMCA wants to ensure that all organizations, including non-profits, can participate. As the Y itself adapts to a changing COVID-19 landscape, “we have to be thinking about different ways to diversify our offerings,” Sweeney said. “We think it’s an innovative way for us to support our community.”",Ex-Plasticity Labs execs lead YMCA’s new workplace well-being program,8,0.4495521437392589

Carol McCallum runs the Sportsman’s Inn in Glenavon, with her son Chris. She recently received a letter from her insurance broker saying fire and liability coverage on the business will end August 1.

“In the letter it says that being the beverage liability thing and COVID-19, they are just cancelling my insurance,” said McCallum.

The hotel has been insured by Western Financial, through a group plan arranged by the Saskatchewan Hotel and Hospitality Association.

“You can only imagine, you know you’d think that all the things we’re being overwhelmed with regards to you know the pandemic, now we have another priority,” said Jim Bence, with the Saskatchewan Hotel and Hospitality Association.

McCallum has turned to another broker to find coverage but she says no company is willing to ensure the hotel, not even government owned SGI. She cannot operate without insurance.

“You know it just seems to me that the insurance companies are big money, banks are big money. What do you want, the banks to own everything? You know, okay, go ahead take my business,” said MacCallum.

507,"INGERSOLL, ONT. -- It was eight-and-a-half years ago that Ingersoll Mayor Ted Comiskey first learned of the plan to bring in 17 million tonnes of waste and dump it in a new landfill just 800 metres from the town boundary.

“Our jaws dropped, we looked at each other and said ‘Can they do that? Do they not have to ask us?,'"" Comiskey said Thursday at a gathering of dozens of supporters who have fought since then to keep the ‘mega dump’ from opening.

Minister of the Environment, Conservation and Parks Jeff Yurek told the assembled crowd. “I’m proud to say today, that in Bill 197, the COVID[-19] Economic Recovery Act, if passed, will allow municipalities to have a say, whether or not a landfill is sited in their municipality.”

The bill, which still has to pass a third reading at Queen’s Park and be signed into law, has no real threat in the Conservative majority-led government.

“This is a sign or a signal from the province that they are serious about moving towards a more circular economy. A more responsible and respectable economy and environment in the future,” said the mayor of neighbouring Southwest Oxford, David Mayberry.

Part of the multi-municipality coalition to give municipalities the right to choose what is built within their borders. Zorra Township was the planned destination for the ‘mega dump,’ but Mayor Marcus Ryan says this will be a wake-up call for businesses wanting to skirt local process.

“If you want to in the Township of Zorra, you better make sure you ask the people of Zorra first. Otherwise, they are going to get you in the end.”

The bill goes further, according to Yurek, as neighbouring municipalities that could be affected will also have a say.

“Adjacent municipalities within a 3.5-kilometre radius of the sited dump, if there is residential housing in there, will also have a say and a veto. And this will ensure that development companies take the precautions and the necessary due diligence to have the consultations with municipalities before citing their landfill.”

An emotional Comiskey mused that this could be the catalyst for environmental change in the province.

“Hopefully, this will trigger the old mother of invention, if I can’t bury it, what am I going to do with it? And maybe now, all of industry, all levels of government, will take a look at what we are producing in waste, and not stick it in the ground. But find uses for it, that are safe for all of us.”

510,"Indigenous bands along the west coast of British Columbia say their borders will remain closed to tourists and non-residents, despite the economic impact, as they work to raise awareness about the threat COVID-19 poses to their communities. The Nuu-chah-nulth, the Heiltsuk Nation and the Haida Nation have all closed or restricted access to their territories and reserves. “Of course it’s negatively impacting. But our directors have said, our chiefs have said, people before economics,” said Judith Sayers, the president of the Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council, in an interview. “I think everyone is slowly realizing the impact economically, but right now we just really feel that we want to protect the members first.” Members of the Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council, made up of 14 First Nations along the west coast of Vancouver Island, have deployed a variety of tactics to help ensure their borders are kept sealed from non-residents. Members of the Ahousaht First Nation, who live in the remote area of Flores Island, have deputized citizens to act as peacekeeping officers, Sayers said. The Ahousaht issued a notice on July 2 that their territory, which covers a large area of land and water north of Tofino, B.C., including provincial parks, will remain closed to tourists and non-residents as there “is still no vaccine, no antiserum and no cure for COVID-19.” Others, like the Tla-o-qui-aht in Tofino, stopped cars in an effort to convince them to turn around. The concern, Sayers says, lies in the ability to test and contain any potential COVID-19 outbreak. “A lot of our communities are remote and testing is not easily available,” she said. “If you’re in Port Alberni, or Nanaimo, or Victoria, or somewhere (else), you can get testing and get results in 24 hours. It’s not the same with our communities.” The closures have resulted in disputes between Indigenous groups and local businesses. The Haida Nation in Haida Gwaii have turned away non-residents at the ferry terminal, discouraged leisure travel and called on two local fishing lodges to rethink their reopening plans. “We’re such a close-knit community, I think that once we get a case of COVID, I think that it’ll spread like wildfire,” said Duffy Edgars, the Chief Councillor of the Old Massett Village Council in Haida Gwaii. Edgars said many local fishing lodges are respecting the Haida Nation’s state of emergency, but is frustrated by others who want to open up. “It’s disrespectful,” he said. “These bigger (lodges) are coming in and just doing whatever they want.” Leaders and representatives from the Nuu-chah-nulth, Heiltsuk and Haida all say they would like to see more co-operation from the provincial government in working with Indigenous communities. “It’s really frustrating,” said Marilyn Slett, the chief councillor of the Heiltsuk. “We have a limited amount of time here, we think, before that anticipated second or third wave so right now is the time for us to be sitting down and having those discussions so going forward we’re all working collaboratively together.” Part of the issue, she says, lies in B.C. politicians encouraging residents to take part in interprovincial tourism. “We’re seeing a lot more vessel traffic on the coast, we’re seeing a lot more recreational boaters, and that’s a really high concern for our community,” said Slett. The closures — many of which began in March — have been felt at a variety of levels. The pandemic forced the cancellation of the Heiltsuk’s Spawn-on-Kelp fishery this year, an event Slett says employs 700 people and is a hugely important economic driver for the community. “Certainly our community put forward the health and safety before the economic driver,” she said. “So our community has been hit hard.” Sayers says when the pandemic first broke out and restrictions were placed on communities, First Nations were bringing in food for members so they didn’t have to leave their reserves and face possible exposure at grocery stores. The Heiltsuk, Nuu-chah-Nulth and the Tsilhqot’in issued a statement in late June, criticizing the provincial government’s reopening plan and what they saw as a lack of dialogue with First Nations groups. All three want the province to commit to four conditions which would allow border restrictions being lifted: COVID-19 information sharing, screening, rapid testing and culturally-safe contract tracing teams. Until those are met, Slett says, she can’t see Indigenous communities fully opening their borders. But the provincial government says it is committed to working with Indigenous communities. “Many tourist-depending communities are now safely welcoming the gradual return of out-of-town visitors,” said Sarah Plank, a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation. “At the same time, we acknowledge some smaller and more remote communities and First Nations continue to be concerned about visitors to their communities.” The government is also working on scheduling a meeting with the Nuu-chah-nulth, Tsilquot’in, Heiltsuk and Haida Nations and other communities, she added.",‘It’s really frustrating’: B.C.

512,"A group of daycare centre owners has started a campaign to pressure the provincial government to let them reopen child-care centres fully this fall. Given current COVID-19 trends, the private child-care operators say they can do so safely — and save their centres at the same time. “We need your help to urge the government to allow child-care centres to open safely at full capacity so we can provide child care for parents going back to work and who have nowhere else to turn,” says their website and petition at saveourspaces.ca. “Operating at partial capacity simply isn’t sustainable for the long term, especially with arbitrary direction and little to no financial support from the government. Reopening the economy requires safe and available child care for all.” The group of six female operators, calling themselves Concerned Childcare Providers, say the government’s announcement Monday to boost the “cohort” or grouping numbers to 15 later this month as the province moves into Stage 3 still means fewer spaces for families. “We would like the government to understand that for many the economics of operating child-care facilities at a reduced capacity after months of closures — with little to no financial support from the government — simply does not work, risking the closure and loss of thousands of spaces,” they said. Deborah Renwick opened Ellington Montessori School in Scarborough in 1990, but “when COVID-19 hit, it was unlike anything I had ever experienced in my 30 years of operating this centre.” She had to cover $22,000 in monthly rent, with no parent fees coming in with the shutdown. “Now, I have to close my doors for good,” she said. “I can only hope that others don’t have to resort to this as well.” Leigh Anne Jacques, an owner of Beaches Montessori School, opened the centre three years ago. Shut down because of the pandemic, it just opened up for summer camp, with about 18 students — although capacity is 62. “Since the government has allowed for child-care spaces to open at partial capacity, we decided we had to open our doors — even if it meant at a smaller capacity and at financial loss.… We knew how important it was for parents to have a safe, reliable place to take their kids every day,” she said. In the legislature Tuesday, NDP Leader Andrea Horwath grilled the government about the move to reopen to Stage 3. “Unfortunately, the Conservatives’ refusal to include a province-wide plan for child-care and education is going to make life even harder for workers and business owners in every corner of our province because it’s going to make it next to impossible for working parents to get back to work. Does the premier accept the reality that Ontario won’t be able to get back to work if working moms and dads can’t rely on schools and available child-care spaces?” Education Minister Stephen Lecce said the province will “ensure child care remains sustainable and accessible in every community in this province” and is working closely with the medical officer of health to do so. The NDP also released an emergency plan for back-to-school, which includes “funding to help keep the child-care sector afloat” and using “public infrastructure to support the reopening of schools and daycares” with additional space to allow for physical distancing. Carolyn Ferns, of the Ontario Coalition for Better Child Care, said there are still some questions about the new 15-cohort rule, but said overall the situation “has definitely been a challenge for child-care centres — non-profit and for-profit.” But she said reopening must be guided only by what is best for young children’s health and safety. Many critics have noted that without enough child-care spaces — and even pre-pandemic, there was a shortfall — parents, mostly women, can’t re-enter the workforce. “Women are disproportionately affected by this. It’s not right that a mom should have to pick between having a child and having a job,” said Jacques. Parents, she added, “are looking for more certainty … parents are anxious and our staff are anxious. Part of that is living in a pandemic, and part of it is that we are unable to provide them with a plan.” Every day at Beaches Montessori, kids and staff are screened, including temperature checks, before they are allowed in. “We have worked hard to ensure that our centre is safe. Parents have to wear masks at pickup and drop-off. We have a screener at the entrance wearing PPE and helping us with sanitizing,” said Jacques. “We are working diligently to help support our community. But the time has come that we need some help, too. We can’t sustain operating at a loss forever.”","Allow daycares to fully open this fall with safety precautions, private operators say",5,0.377558211851013
513,"OTTAWA—Federal opposition parties are demanding to know why the Liberal government created a $900-million program to help students find volunteer positions rather than putting the much-needed funds into an existing summer jobs program. The call for answers comes as the government tries to chart a way forward for the new Canada Student Services Grant, which has been in limbo after WE Charity withdrew from administering the program amid controversy over its links to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his family. The Liberals have billed the grant program as a way to reward tens of thousands of students who want to help with the COVID-19 pandemic and can’t find paid work. Participants were told they could earn up to $5,000 toward their education costs by volunteering the maximum 500 hours. Opposition parties say the Liberals could have accomplished the same task without controversy by putting the money into the Canada Summer Jobs program, through which thousands of positions for students are subsidized by the federal government every year. “The government chose specifically to ignore the opportunity of the Canada Summer Jobs and instead went for this,” Conservative economic development critic Dan Albas said of the Canada Student Services Grant. “It makes no sense ... They put a ton of money — $912 million — towards an untested concept when they have a ready-to-go program.” The Liberals have expanded the summer-jobs program by increasing the wage subsidy available to companies and not-for-profit groups to 100 per cent of the local minimum wage, expanding what types of positions qualified and extending the eligible work period to early next year. Employment Minister Carla Qualtrough’s office also noted the Liberals injected an extra $60 million to create 10,000 more positions than last year for students. The move brought the total budget for the program to $323 million and the expected number of summer jobs to 80,000. “This additional investment is helping more youth stay connected to the labour market, save money for their return to school, and find quality jobs in safe, inclusive, and healthy work environments,” Qualtrough spokesperson Ashley Michnowski said in an email. “By adapting the program this year, our government is making sure that we have the resources needed to support Canadian workers, businesses, and communities dealing with the social and economic impacts of COVID-19.” But the opposition says the available funding is not enough to cover demand in a normal year. The federal Employment and Social Development Department itself says on its website that in 2019, “requests for funding totalled more than three times the program budget.” Neither the government nor WE have said how many volunteer positions they were expecting to fill through the $912-million grant program. There has been criticism that participants receive only $10 per hour — less than the minimum wage in any province. There have also been questions about many positions advertised as available through the volunteer scheme, including thousands for students to shoot videos, make websites and create other content in placements apparently created by WE to meet the requirements of the volunteer program. NDP ethics critic Charlie Angus said that stands in contrast to the summer jobs program after the government asked members of Parliament across the country to identify potential positions in their ridings in the spring — many of which did not get funding. “We had really legitimate organizations ready to hire students to do legitimate work, and all of that was sidelined,” Angus said. “These were a lot more credible positions than making a video showing how to do exercises.” The Liberals have indicated they plan to move ahead with the volunteer program despite WE’s withdrawal, saying the federal Employment Department has taken over and is looking at ways to make it happen. But the Conservatives, NDP and Greens all say the government should learn its lesson and put the money into the Canada Summer Jobs program, which is already managed by the government and has a history of success. That starts with revisiting what the Tories and New Democrats suggested was the large number of summer jobs requested by businesses and not-for-profits and not funded because of a shortage of money. “The government should be focused on a program that is transparent, that is fair, that is broadly supported by all parties, and that already has a number of applications that have been ranked and have not been filled just because there’s not enough money,” Albas said. Green MP Elizabeth May said organizations that applied for positions through the student-volunteer program should also be allowed to transfer their requests to the summer-jobs program. And if that is not possible, Angus said, the government should be looking at taking the money and putting it into direct financial support for students, including by adding the funds to the Canada Emergency Student Benefit for those unable to find work due to COVID-19. “They have two options: One is to put that money into Canada Summer Jobs and one is to put it straight into the support for university students so they have the funds necessary to go to school and cut out all these schemes they worked out with WE,” he said. “I think they need to move on this immediately. The summer is getting close to half over. It may be at this point too difficult to get the Canada Summer Jobs up, but there are a lot of organizations that we submitted names for.” Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-François Blanchet, meanwhile, repeated a call on Tuesday for Trudeau to step aside in favour of his deputy Chrystia Freeland while the WE affair is fully investigated. But Blanchet said that based on what’s known now, he doesn’t believe the Liberal government should fall over it.","Feds should have put $912M into Canada Summer Jobs program, Opposition says",2,0.20391405043667976
514,"HALIFAX -- The COVID-19 pandemic has affected every aspect of our lives, from how we work, to how we celebrate, and even how we support our favourite charities.

The IWK Telethon for Children, which airs on CTV Atlantic every year, is one of the many charity events impacted by the virus.

“The IWK Telethon is a tradition that has brought Maritimers together for the past 35 years and symbolizes the true spirit of our community. We have always been there for each other united in our connection to the IWK,” says Jennifer Gillivan, the president and CEO of the IWK Foundation.

The telethon, which was scheduled to air on June 6 and June 7, will not go ahead as planned this year.

“We are sad that we can’t go ahead with the broadcast, but we are committed to bring content, as much as we can, using innovative ways to reach our community. We’re forever grateful to our community because they’ve always stayed with us. We’ve been in this relationship for over 35 years with our Maritime community, who in fact have built the IWK,” says Gillivan.

“We know some people are suffering and we would never expect them to do anything other than take care of their selves, and they are in our thoughts, but for those who can continue to support us, we hope they will.”

Much of the fundraising for the telethon has already taken place. Those donations will go towards priority equipment.

“The pandemic is happening and that just heightens and intensifies what’s already happening at the IWK,” says Gillivan.

“Kids can’t wait. They are already there. The sickest of the sick are there and then there is the heightened piece now, with the potential for infection during the pandemic. So the hospital still needs the equipment, they still need the beds, they still need the priority pieces that we fundraise for year-round. Probably now more than ever, they need that support.”

Gillivan says the IWK Foundation is committed to finding ways to celebrate donors and share the stories of patients and care teams at the IWK.

“Thank you to our broadcast partner CTV. Thank you to our many loyal donors who fundraise year-round for the IWK and thank you to our incredible telethon volunteer committees across the Maritimes,” says Gillivan.

“We applaud your unwavering commitment to the IWK. Stay healthy, safe and support each other.”

515,"Recently, RBC Economics published new estimates of this year’s deficits and debt accumulation for all 10 Canadian provinces. The news was predictably grim.

According to forecasts, all provinces will run large deficits this year. And Ontario’s deficit this year (relative to the size of the provincial economy) will be larger than at any point in the last 25 years.

When the COVID public health and economic crisis ends, the Ford government will face an even worse fiscal situation than when they took office. How bad is Ontario’s fiscal outlook?

The Ford government published its budget in mid-March, forecasting a $20.5-billion deficit, the largest nominal deficit in provincial history. Unfortunately, that was overly optimistic. Now, according to new forecasts, the government will collect about $5 billion less.

The government’s fiscal plan, however, included substantial contingencies (an accounting buffer), which would partially offset lower-than-forecasted revenues. Subsequently, RBC Economics now estimates Ontario’s deficit could exceed $21 billion this year.

With its buffer gone, any further bad news on the revenue side — or additional unplanned spending — will cause Ontario’s deficit to grow even larger. But the bad news just keeps coming.

In addition to a larger deficit, Ontario potentially faces a steep recession. According to recent forecasts, Ontario’s economy will shrink 4.2% this year. These two factors combined — a large deficit and a recession — mean Ontario’s long-standing fiscal mess will quickly get much worse.

Consider this: Ontario’s debt-to-GDP ratio (the best measure of debt sustainability) is forecasted to grow from 40% to 46%, the highest level in provincial history.

These problems can’t be solved overnight, especially during a pandemic and recession. The Ford government’s top priority should be helping the province weather the COVID public health and economic crises. However, once these have passed, Ontario’s government must exercise fiscal discipline — for a long time — to repair the damage.

Which raises the key question: Will the Ford government actually do the hard work to reduce Ontario’s debt burden when the recession ends? Only time will tell. But if it does, Ontarians will see a marked change from the policies of this government’s predecessors.

In the years following the 2008-09 recession, when Ontario’s deficit ballooned, the McGuinty and Wynne governments allowed large deficits to persist, which caused government debt to accumulate quickly. In the wake of today’s recession, to not repeat recent history, the Ford government must take active steps to reform and reduce government spending.

If, however, the Ford government — like its predecessors — continues to steadily increase nominal spending while hoping for larger revenue gains to shrink the deficit, it will likely produce similar results, namely more red ink.

The Ford government is not responsible for the current recession nor its effects on provincial finances. Still, once the recession is over, it will be the Ford government’s responsibility to clean up the mess. Doing this — quickly — will help the province prosper in the long-run and will reduce the size of the debt burden to be passed along to future generations of Ontarians.

518,"WATERLOO REGION — Agencies that help women and children experiencing abuse are seeing more people reaching out for help compared to when the pandemic started, but the worry remains that some are still at risk. They urge everyone in Waterloo Region to watch out for each other to prevent a rise in family violence during this unprecedented and stressful time. “There is so much that can be done just by reaching out to people,” said Karen Spencer, executive director of Family & Children’s Services of the Waterloo Region. Several agencies have joined together to launch the Keep Families Safe campaign to raise awareness about the danger of violence against women and children due to the isolation and stress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.  “This is still a dangerous time for women and for families,” said Jennifer Hutton, chief executive officer of Women’s Crisis Services of Waterloo Region. Reaching out for help may not be safe for many in abusive homes, and pandemic restrictions mean people are out less in the community where others can spot warning signs. Usually the shelters are full or close to full, but at the pandemic’s start that dropped to about half and calls were also down. Since the region moved into Stage 2 of the reopening plan and added opportunities to leave the home make reaching out easier, more women are seeking safe refuge.  “There is some relief that we’re seeing more,” Hutton said. “We’re still not at what would be typical for us.” That worries her because the current situation points to an escalation of family violence, not a decrease.  The agency added an online chat feature to its website as a discrete way for women to reach out for help. Hutton said it’s seeing good use, with one family reporting they could come into shelter because that option was available.  Normally, Hutton said it is difficult for women to leave an abusive situation but the pandemic has added other barriers to overcome, including uncertainty for the future.  “So then it’s hard to make such a major decision about taking your kids and going into a shelter,” she said. At Family & Children’s Services, calls were down at the start of the pandemic while police were responding to more. But now referrals are back to normal levels and that’s lessened the fear about unreported family violence. “There isn’t that same worry that people aren’t calling us to report concerns about a child’s safety or to request help,” Spencer said.  The agency relies on the community for early intervention because they’re called when something happens to a child or there’s a serious concern about well-being. Spencer is thankful people are looking out for their neighbours, and families are being connected to available support from food hampers to counselling. “I would say the community has really pulled together to make sure families don’t fall through the cracks and get the help they need,” Spencer said. “That’s been a collective community effort.” She hopes that continues, emphasizing that a listening ear or helping hand go a long way to ensure families have what they need to survive this stressful time. There’s a link between a lack of support networks and child welfare concerns, Spencer said. “A lot can be done to prevent child abuse and neglect by simply reaching out.”","Agencies helping women, children at risk of violence seeing return to more normal levels",8,0.8294212499885301

The provincial government announced today it will order an end to the system that sees children’s aid societies send notifications to hospitals if they believe a newborn is at risk. The government says research suggests the alerts have disproportionately targeted racialized families, and it’s committed to creating a more culturally appropriate child welfare system. It says that while birth alerts have never been required under provincial law, they have been inconsistently applied across children’s aid societies. The government says the practice must end by October 15, and societies must instead work with hospitals and community-based service providers to come up with pre and postnatal plans that better support families.

523,"WINNIPEG -- Manitoba’s healthcare workers will now have enhanced access to personal protective equipment (PPE).

On Tuesday, Shared Health said the province has a stabilizing PPE stockpile, which means more N95 respirators will be available for staff.

Lanette Siragusa, Shared Health’s chief nursing officer, said that making sure healthcare and front-line workers are safe has been a top priority for the province.

“Throughout this pandemic, personal protective equipment protocols have continually been adapted based on the evidence, leading practice and local expertise to ensure that our staff remain protected,” she said.

“And as we continue to plan and prepare, our current supply of PPE has improved steadily in all categories since the height of the pandemic.”

During the pandemic, healthcare workers have been using infection prevention and control measures, as well as known science, national and international guidance, to stop the spread of the virus between patients and staff. This includes point-of-care risk assessment, hand hygiene, and disinfecting all environments and equipment.

“These processes have been and will continue to be required in the care of all patients at all times in every healthcare setting,” Siragusa said.

Shared Health noted these measures, along with necessary precautions and PPE, have proven effective: 26 healthcare workers in the province have tested positive for COVID-19 since the pandemic started, though there has not been a confirmed case involving a healthcare worker since May 10.

There has also not been any confirmed cases among healthcare workers where the appropriate precautions were followed.

SHARED HEALTH, MNU REACH AGREEMENT

Shared Health and the Manitoba Nurses' Union (MNU) have also reached an agreement regarding increased access to PPE for nurses.

Siragusa said the policy change is the result of talks that began with the nurses' union, “but we are extending it to all healthcare workers to ensure that providers have consistency in application and protocols.”

In a statement, MNU president Darlene Jackson said nurses have been voicing their concerns about the PPE supply for months.

""Every nurse has a right to a safe workplace, and this agreement is a big step in the right direction following months of advocacy by nurses on this critical health and safety issue,"" she said.

Siragusa said Tuesday’s announcement should not be misinterpreted.

“COVID-19 is still a threat in Manitoba,” she said.

“We anticipate that PPE procurement will be an ongoing challenge that will require close scrutiny in the foreseeable months and while we continue to adapt the PPE guidelines based on evidence and based on circumstances, we still do encourage clinical providers to embrace these changes but also remain vigilant in their efforts to conserve PPE as much as possible.”

524,"SUDBURY -- Thanks to a generous donation, the Sudbury District Nurse Practitioner Clinics office on Larch Street is one step closer to opening a free dental clinic.

Executive director Jennifer Clement said the clinic will be for those who don't have health insurance or transportation. With the office now located right downtown it will be more accessible for people who need the service.

""When we got the funding for opening our Larch Street office here, we were lucky enough to receive a donation of dental equipment from Centre de Santé, who had a dental room at the corner clinic,"" said Clement.

""The intention was also that when we moved over here, we would have a dental room, as well, and the room is being used by dental students who will offer assessments and screenings to those who don't have access to dental services.""

On top of providing free oral health care to those in need, it will also help dental hygiene and dental assistant students from Cambrian College. The idea is that students will work in the clinic as part of their curriculum.

""One of the things we try to do with all of our programs -- but especially those helping professions like dental hygiene and dental assisting -- is we don't just want them to be good professionals, we want them to be good citizens,"" said Dan Lessard, manager of communications at Cambrian College.

Good citizens

""A big part of that is actually working in those settings, helping out while also getting an education. You know that you're doing good in the community, so the students benefit both ways. And I think they're really excited to be part of something new.""

This week, the clinic received more than $18,000 from Cambrian College's annual Walk for a Smile fundraiser. Lessard said despite the COVID-19 pandemic, that's about the average amount the fundraiser brings in each year.

""It's always a great feeling when you can help the community, especially when it's something new,"" said Lessard.

Officials say it is going to be a team effort to get the clinic open, with help from the health unit and the dental community in the area. However, the clinic is ready to take on the next challenge, Clement said.

""We're the first nurse practitioners clinic … to be able to do this in the province, which is great,"" she said. ""We're working with the health unit to develop a dental strategy so we can look at what is this going to look like over the long term.""

Lessard said it's an amazing feeling to be part of the opening the clinic, and it's a fantastic opportunity for students.

""They're the first ones who are going to experience this kind of setting,"" he said. ""They're normally used to going to a dental office or a dental clinic. A nurse practitioner's office is something completely different. So for them, it's just going to give them that broad range of experience that's only going to make them more skillful and marketable when they go out in the field.""

Important part of overall health

The clinic will offer dental cleaning with the students from Cambrian, and hopefully X-rays and other procedures later on.

""Dental care is a very important part of overall health care and there's some people in the community who, through circumstances, it's a little harder for them to maintain good dental care,"" said Lessard.

"" So what we've done as a program, dental assisting and dental hygienists, is raise money for community initiatives so that people don't have costs as a barrier for getting good dental care.""

An opening date for the dental room is still to be determined, but Clement said it is a priority at the clinic.

""If people don't have health benefits, they can be reluctant to get dental care, and oral health is really important to your overall health and well-being in total,"" said Clement. ""So by doing this, by bringing in students and looking at if we're going to use money to offer per diems for dentists to come in - we're not quite sure yet, but it's something we think is really important to the community.""",Northern Ontario city one step closer to free dental clinic,8,0.7446306177387316
526,"MONTREAL -- The Cirque du Soleil's shareholders terminated their takeover bid after the insolvent entertainment business reached an agreement with its creditors for an offer without any contribution from Quebec taxpayers.

The agreement will be presented Friday to the Superior Court of Quebec for approval to become the new so-called stalking horse bid for any rival offers that may be presented next month.

A lawyer representing Quebecor suggested last week that the media conglomerate intended to make a bid.

The shareholders -- the Texan fund TPG Capital, the Chinese firm Fosun and the Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec -- presented a US$420-million bid June 29 when Cirque filed for creditor protection. They were counting on a US$200-million loan from the Quebec government.

The shareholders and Cirque agreed to terminate the agreement, said a Cirque statement Thursday.

""The shareholder's proposed agreement, which had set the bar for other bids, assured a path to survival following the forced closure of all of the shows resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic by providing the company funding, support, and a clear road map to relaunch,"" said the statement.

The lenders, who hold about $1 billion of the Cirque's secured debt, would inject up to $375 million, create a fund to retain employees and pay ex-workers and artisans, and maintain the company's head office in Montreal, according to a source familiar with the matter, but who is not allowed to speak publicly.

""The co-operation of the group of creditors has been extraordinary in order to achieve our objective of recapitalizing the Cirque,"" Gabriel de Alba, the managing director and partner of Catalyst Capital Group, the main creditor, said in a statement.

527,"OTTAWA -- Royal Canadian Legion halls across the country have been shuttered for months due to COVID-19, and now a number of them are facing the prospect of never being able to reopen.

With most ineligible for the host of federal aid programs being offered to help keep other businesses and charitable organizations afloat, hundreds of these facilities could be forced to shut their doors forever without federal intervention.

Legions are often seen as the heart of many communities -- where Remembrance Day celebrations are held and meals are made and delivered to those in need -- but because the pandemic has put a pause on events, it’s cut off crucial income streams like facility rentals that allow legions to keep their doors open to veterans and others.

It’s estimated that about 124 of the 1,381 Royal Canadian Legion branches across Canada are likely to close permanently, and another 357 are facing financial hardship.

“We're a 95-year-old organization. And in that 95 years, we have prided ourselves on being self-sufficient, we have not reached out for funding. But these are unprecedented times,” National Executive Director Steven Clark said.

The Royal Canadian Legion has written to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s office twice, informing him of the gaps in the current federal aid offerings, and says they have yet to receive a response. The Prime Minister’s Office disputes that claim, confirming at least one response has been sent.

A government source told CTV News a reason the legions can’t get funding is because their programs are not directly related to the fight against COVID-19, though thousands of businesses have been able to access billions of federal aid dollars to make ends meet amid the pandemic.

In an email to CTV News, spokesperson for the Office of the Minister of Families, Children and Social Development Jessica Eritou pointed to the Emergency Community Support Fund as something legions that support veterans “may” qualify for to adapt their programs, and committed to “work with organizations to ensure they have the support they need to support Canadians.”

However, that program is offered to help adapt programming in the era of COVD-19 and the Royal Canadian Legion says that it’s their understanding based on conversations with federal officials that it can’t be used to cover operational costs, which is their biggest need right now.

They are calling on the federal government to expand the program’s parameters or allow them to access some other funding option to help pay for costs like rent and utilities.

While some branches may have employees on their payroll and could be eligible for some assistance, most are volunteer-run.

“We've had, of our 1,381 branches 167 have applied for federal assistance programs, but unfortunately only 55 have received that funding so it's still a very small percentage,” Clark said.

Local branches have been given some emergency reserve funding from the national headquarters, and have turned to crowdfunding initiatives but still the money is running out. While millions of dollars are donated every year through the National Poppy Campaign, this money can’t be used to cover the operational costs associated with keeping these facilities open.

While legions have been struggling for years to attract new members, having to close due to the pandemic could prove to be the final straw for many.

The branch in Kenora says it can only last a few more months before its closure becomes permanent.

“It’s extremely dire. We were good for the short haul, but as this keeps going, and we don’t know really where the light at the tunnel is going to be, we’re just not going to be able to survive,” said President of the Kenora Legion Jerry Lava.

“We’re depleting our savings now to make sure we can maintain our expenses. We’ve mothballed pretty well everything in the branch we could,” Lava said.

In a statement to CTV News, spokesperson for Veterans Affairs Canada John Embury said that the department’s response to the pandemic “is ongoing, and we will continue to explore ways to ensure that we’re providing Canadians and our community partners with the support they need.

Branches like this are the first point of contact for veterans and offer them crucial services and support, and that’s why so many are worried about what the future holds.

“I come to the legion and I meet old friends, and the comradery. It’s a place where you come and tell your story,” said Joel VanSnick, who is the Royal Canadian Legion’s district commander for the Ottawa-area which includes 62 branches.

529,"TORONTO -- Months after a highly destructive hurricane swept through the Bahamas, many families remain in dire need of basic resources, including food.

Canadian volunteers with GlobalMedic are now working to assemble and send emergency food kits to those in need.

About 1,400 families in areas that were affected by Category 5 Hurricane Dorian will be receiving these kits.

The hurricane swept through the island, causing catastrophic damage, on Sept. 1, 2019.

In the months that followed, many people in the Bahamas were left strongly affected by not only the hurricane, but also the sharp decline in the tourism industry due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Some residents were just starting to get their lives back in order six months after the hurricane hit when all of a sudden no one was able to travel to the island anymore, leading to many people losing their jobs.

The global shutdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has slowed, and in some cases stopped, any progress made in rebuilding on the island, according to GlobalMedic.

Rahul Singh, the executive director of GlobalMedic, said these volunteers are now trying to help feed those in need, which he calls a step in the right direction.

The emergency food kits being assembled by the volunteers include grains, beans, rice, peas, and grits. The kits will be loaded onto a shipping container on Wednesday before being railed onto a boat in Halifax and then shipped out to the harbour in Freeport, Bahamas.","Canadian volunteers send emergency food kits to 1,400 families in Bahamas",9,0.5309561803740346
530,"TORONTO -- Ontario Premier Doug Ford's recent announcement to build nearly 8,000 new long-term care beds is a re-commitment of promises made by the former Liberal government, CTV News Toronto has learned, despite the premier presenting it as new information.

Ford, on Wednesday, touted an ""historic investment"" of $1.75 billion to ""kick start the development of long-term care beds"" over the next five years.

""Today's announcement will result in an estimated nearly 8000 new Long Term Care beds and 12,000 redeveloped Long Term Care beds,"" Ford claimed.

However, sources in the Ministry of Long-Term Care confirmed the government re-announced commitments that had been made by the former Liberal government and beds that were allocated over the course of the past two years.

Of the 7,889 new beds Ford promised to build, roughly 6,000 were allocated by the Wynne government in 2017 and 2018, and the remainder was allocated by the Ford government in 2018 and 2019.

Merrilee Fullerton, Minister of Long-Term Care, was first to reveal the government's plan for 8,000 beds in November 2019 during Question Period.

""Our government... is investing $1.75 billion to create 15,000 new beds and redevelop another 15,000 in five years,"" Fullerton told the Ontario Legislature. ""We’ve already got almost 8,000 beds allocated this year so far, 50% of the requirement.""

""This year alone, we have allocated 1,814 new beds and reaffirmed our commitment towards building 6,085 previously allocated beds,"" Fullerton said.

Government sources told CTV News Toronto on Wednesday that the ministry will be able to build and re-develop just 4,000 beds in 2022, as the province offers developers new incentives to recoup their investment earlier in exchange for fast-tracked construction.

In a statement to CTV News Toronto, a spokesperson for Minister Fullerton didn't address Wednesday's re-announcement, but emphasized the changes to the construction funding model would ""kick-start construction.""

531,"SASKATOON -- Saskatoon Police Service (SPS) has seen a 44 per cent rise in possession and trafficking offences related to crystal meth so far in 2020 compared to last year.

Staff Sgt. Darren Pringle says meth addiction is also keeping many of his officers in his platoon busy creating more difficulties when arrests are made.

“The normal things you would do in terms of applying force aren’t very effective. (Suspects who are on meth) have lots of energy, they may or may not be in a bit of a psychologically altered state and it takes a little more work to get these people into custody,” he said.

He also says meth is cheap, easy to come by and the effects of the drug last longer. When a person comes down from the drug, the person is hurting in multiple ways until they can get more of the drug, which ultimately leads to more property crimes like multiple vehicle break-ins.

“The crash from meth is particularly spectacular because when you come off the drug, there’s all these physiological factors that go along with it so on there is an incredible drive to replicate that high and make the hurt go away because the low is so very low and your body hurts.

“For $40 to $50 you can get a gram of meth, compared to $80 to $100 for a gram of (cocaine). You smash a couple car windows, you find some change and you can facilitate that high again for yourself very quickly. That’s what’s driving up the property crime,” Pringle said.

According to an SPS report, as of July 6 there were 57 meth possession and four meth trafficking occurrences, up from 35 possession and four trafficking arrests at the same time last year.

Overall for 2020 police said there have been a total of 290 possession and trafficking incidents compared to 201 over the same period in 2019. This follows the record number of 80 meth offences in May 2020.

The number of occurrences related to crystal meth have steadily increased month-to-month over the course of 2020.

In February, police reported 32 possession and trafficking offences. That number increased to 37 in March, 45 in April, up to 80 in May and 61 in June.

Since 2012 the number of meth possession and trafficking occurrences has increased more than 25 times from 19 occurrences in 2012 to 477 occurrences in 2019, according to SPS statistics.

Kayla Demong, the associate director with AIDS Saskatoon, says it has been dealing with a meth epidemic for the last five years, leading to a strain on its services.

“We’re seeing definitely an increase in people in drug-induced psychosis. Across all of our programs, we’re seeing people with far more complex mental health needs and a lack of resources for them to access. We need all sectors to come together and look at this from a community perspective. It’s not just enforcement, it’s not just treatment, and it’s not just harm reduction. We need initiatives that look at all aspects of what people are going through and are able to respond in a holistic way to support them,” said Demong.

AIDS Saskatoon says the hugest gap for people living with meth addiction in Saskatoon right now is access to mental health care and services that are equipped and can work with people who are in psychosis and experiencing a heightened state.

Colleen Christopherson-Cote with Safe Community Action Alliance recently helped release 27 core strategic actions to assist in the meth epidemic in Saskatoon. She agrees in having all levels of government to focus on creating a facility in Saskatoon - specifically for meth use.

“Many of the treatment facilities that are addressing substance use look at an-alcohol based treatment facility so looking at crystal meth and the things that are very specific to that drug addiction will be a critical piece moving forward,” said Christopherson-Cote.

Christopherson-Cote says in Saskatoon people who are more vulnerable and marginalized are more likely targeted in getting access to meth. She also points to Canada’s history in relation to the reasons why meth addiction is so high.

“In this province and Canada in general has a deep rooted history of colonization and trauma so those are the root factors that drive people towards substance use. Its mental health, addictions, trauma and colonial heritage. Indigenous people make up easily 80 to 90 per cent of the homelessness and meth addiction. We need to start talking about dismantling and disrupting colonial systems that are creating and perpetuating cycles of poverty, substance use and trauma,” said Christopherson-Cote.

Both Demong and Christopherson-Cote said COVID-19 and the provincial and federal government’s response to the virus has shown what people can do when they come together in a timely manner. They would like to see the same level of response and action with meth addiction.

“We need to treat this as a public health crisis. We need to treat poverty, substance use and trauma as a public health crisis. People are dying by many of those social determinants of health,” said Christopherson-Cote.

“We have an HIV epidemic, a crystal meth epidemic and now we’re seeing an overdose epidemic in our province and the response to those things is not getting the full support from the government as it should be. What we learned from COVID-19 is, if we can work efficiently and effectively and quickly, people can get help really fast and things can get put into place really fast and all the red tape isn’t really necessary,” said Demong.","44% rise in crystal meth possession, trafficking compared to 2019: Saskatoon police",8,0.003519242097051234
532,"CALGARY -- The Alberta government has ended an agreement with the organization that runs Lethbridge's supervised consumption site after it said an audit revealed millions in misspent funds.

Officials say a financial audit of ARCHES (AIDS Reduction Community Harm Education & Support Society) was launched by Deloitte after possible irregularities were found in the organization.

The investigation concluded that a number of the allegations of mismanagement at the agency were substantiated, including:

Asset and funding misappropriation

Non-compliance with grant agreement

Inappropriate governance and organizational operations

Deloitte's report found a number of serious issues including $13,000 in interest from ARCHES bank accounts being used for parties, staff retreats, entertainment and gift cards, the annual salary of one senior executive exceeding $300,000 when it should have been capped at $80,000 and more than $1.6 million that is unaccounted for due to missing expense reports from 2017 to 2018.

""It is disturbing and extremely disappointing to me that taxpayer funds allocated to this organization in order to serve the most vulnerable in Lethbridge would be used for European conferences, expenses for retreats, entertainment and gift cards. Our government will not stand idly by while millions in taxpayer funds are missing or misappropriated,"" said Jason Luan, associate minister of mental health and addictions in a release.

The audit also found:

More than $4,000 was used to fund a trip for senior management to attend a conference in Portugal

More than $7,500 spent on management retreats including meals and mileage

Thousands in unverifiable travel expenses, including trips charged to company credit cards that were not recorded

Thousands of dollars' worth of gift cards to multiple businesses, including to a company owned by a senior executive's spouse

Other conflict of interest issues such as where a senior executive's family member was hired and earned a salary of $9,900

The number of staff members at ARCHES exceeded the 126 allowed as per the agreement; the actual number of employees could not be verified

""Proper personal conflict of interest declarations were not recorded when related individuals or vendors were hired or utilized,"" the province says. ""Vendors were repeatedly secured in secrecy with a lack of transparency and accountability. No petty cash reconciliations have been completed.""

Even with all the allegations that were proven against ARCHES, the government says the audit could not be fully completed due to the state of the agency's record-keeping.

It adds law enforcement has been notified about the situation.

""Due to missing funds and unverifiable transactions, as well as allegations, which could not be investigated in the scope of this audit, government will consult with law enforcement to determine whether further investigation is warranted.""

Even though ARCHES' site has been closed as a result, the government says a temporary overdose prevention site has been set up to help those with addictions.

Lethbridge officials say the closure of the supervised consumption site will leave a hole in the support for residents.

""(It's) disappointing to hear that money may have been spent inappropriately,"" said Lethbridge mayor Chris Spearman. ""There needs to be some form of support.""

ARCHES RESERVES COMMENT

In a press release issued Thursday, ARCHES says the audit was launched on March 4, 2020 and its staff and board of directors have cooperated fully with the government and independent auditor.

The board also began its own organizational review in May that has already resulted in changes at the facility.

When it comes to the forensic audit, the organization says it understands why there are concerns and adds it has concerns of its own.

However, it has decided not to comment further at this time.

""We woke up to this news just like the rest of our community and at this time the full report findings have not been given to the ARCHES’ Board of Directors. Please understand we are waiting to comment until we have all of the information.""

ARCHES expects to hold a press conference on the audit ""soon"" and will notify the media when it plans to do so.

534,"TORONTO -- Canada may be at the forefront of the race to develop an effective COVID-19 vaccine, with a clinical trial already approved, but experts warn we have fallen short in developing a fund to compensate those who may be injured by vaccinations.

With immense political and public pressure to develop a vaccine, a process that can take years, researchers are carrying out trials at an unprecedented pace in efforts to bring a successful vaccine to market in a matter of months.

And although vaccine-related reactions are rare, experts say a new vaccine -- especially one developed using new technology -- may come with unknown risks.

At least 19 countries already have programs in place that compensate individuals injured by vaccines, but Canada does not.

In fact, it is the only G7 country without such measures in place, and experts are now calling on the federal government to prepare in advance of the COVID-19 vaccination program.

“If you do suffer an adverse event, a serious adverse event, one of those very rare events, you should be compensated,” said Jennifer Keelan, a retired researcher who worked at the University of Toronto’s Department of Public Health, told CTV News.

“An ideal process is to think about these things before you implement the mass vaccine program, rather than reacting.”

Adverse reactions to vaccines are rare, but have had deadly repercussions in the past.

In 1976, the U.S. government rushed to develop a swine flu vaccination over fears of the next big pandemic. The immunization program was halted after 10 weeks due to reports that the vaccination increased the risk for Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), a rare form of paralysis that starts in the feet and creeps up the body.

Though the associated risk was approximately one in 100,000, more than 450 people developed GBS after receiving the vaccine. Of those, 25 died.

Similarly, in 2009, the H1N1 influenza vaccine, while largely deemed safe, was linked with cases of narcolepsy in Europe.

Experts warn that vaccine manufacturers may demand legal protection against lawsuits regarding adverse reactions to a new vaccine.

In 2009, the Canadian government put forth an emergency process to release the H1N1 vaccine without waiting for Health Canada to review the results of clinical trials concerning the vaccine’s efficacy.

According to the Canadian Medical Association Journal, Canada agreed to indemnify the vaccine’s manufacturer, Glaxo-SmithKline, from potential lawsuits.

At the time, the federal government was said to be considering a no-fault compensation scheme, or a vaccine injury compensation program. However, no such program was ever created.

Quebec is the only province that offers such a plan for adverse reactions stemming from immunizations.

In other provinces and territories, any healthcare costs associated with an adverse vaccine reaction would be covered through the public health system or, if disability occurred, through disability income.

According to the Canadian Vaccination Evidence Resource and Exchange Centre, the only other recourse would be through litigation. However, there is a limited understanding of the number of vaccine-injury related lawsuits in Canada.

CTV News contacted the federal government to see if there was any consideration for such a program in light of the circumstances surrounding COVID-19. A request for comment was not returned.

“Some of these individuals may actually be front-line workers, personal support workers, health-care workers, or those working in long-term care centres who will be asked to receive this vaccine not only for their benefit, but to protect the patients, the people they are caring for,” Dr. Kumanan Wilson, senior scientist at the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, told CTV News.

“Despite best practices being taken, if these individuals are harmed, we need a system in place to help compensate them in the event of injury.”

Wilson and Keelan have been calling for Canada to implement a vaccine injury compensation program for nearly 10 years.

In a 2011 report for the University of Toronto’s Munk School of Global Affairs, the researchers noted that, “the history and experience with vaccine-related injuries in many other western countries also suggests that it is highly probable that Canada will be faced with circumstances.”

At the time, Keelan noted that a no-fault compensation program for vaccine-related injuries would not only benefit people who suffer harm, it might also give those who are waffling about whether to get a vaccine the incentive they need to go ahead.

""We want people to be vaccinated. Vaccines are incredibly safe and they are one of the most effective public health measures that we have for preventing vaccine-preventable diseases,” she said in a 2011 interview with CTVNews.ca.

“We want them to have confidence in our publicly funded vaccine.""​

In a report to the World Health Organization in December 2018, the Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety wrote that no-fault vaccine injury compensation programs are considered a measure to maintain confidence in immunization programmes.","As the race for a vaccine ramps up, so do calls for vaccine injury compensation",8,0.405252071738319
544,"HAYWARD, CALIF. -- Robots that can cook - from flipping burgers to baking bread - are in growing demand as virus-wary kitchens try to put some distance between workers and customers.

Starting this fall, the White Castle burger chain will test a robot arm that can cook french fries and other foods. The robot, dubbed Flippy, is made by Pasadena, California-based Miso Robotics.

White Castle and Miso have been discussing a partnership for about a year. Those talks accelerated when COVID-19 struck, said White Castle Vice-President Jamie Richardson.

Richardson said the robot can free up employees for other tasks like disinfecting tables or handling the rising number of delivery orders. A touch-free environment that minimizes contact is also increasingly important to customers, he said.

""The world's just reshaped in terms of thoughts around food safety,"" Richardson said.

Flippy currently costs US$30,000, with a $1,500 monthly service fee. By the middle of next year, Miso hopes to offer the robot for free but charge a higher monthly fee.

Robot food service was a trend even before the coronavirus pandemic, as hospitals, campus cafeterias and others tried to meet demand for fresh, customized options 24 hours a day while keeping labour costs in check. Robot chefs appeared at places like Creator, a burger restaurant in San Francisco, and Dal.komm Coffee outlets in South Korea.

Now, some say, robots may shift from being a novelty to a necessity. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control says the risk of getting COVID-19 from handling or consuming food outside the home is low. Still, there have been numerous outbreaks among restaurant employees and patrons.

""I expect in the next two years you will see pretty significant robotic adoption in the food space because of COVID,"" said Vipin Jain, the co-founder and CEO of Blendid, a Silicon Valley startup.

Blendid sells a robot kiosk that makes a variety of fresh smoothies. Customers can order from a smartphone app and tweak the recipe if they want more kale or less ginger, for example. Once or twice a day, a Blendid employee refills the ingredients.

Only a handful are now operating around San Francisco, but since the pandemic began, Blendid has started contract discussions with hospitals, corporations, shopping malls and groceries.

""What used to be forward-thinking - last year, pre-COVID - has become current thinking,"" Jain said.

As salad bars shut down, Hayward, California-based Chowbotics started getting more inquiries about Sally, a robot about the size of a refrigerator that makes a variety of salads and bowls. Sally lets customers choose from 22 prepared ingredients stored inside the machine. It can make around 65 bowls a day before kitchen workers need to refill the ingredients.

Prior to this year, Chowbotics had sold around 125 of its $35,000 robots, primarily to hospitals and colleges. But since the coronavirus hit, sales have jumped more than 60%, CEO Rick Wilmer said, with growing interest from grocery stores, senior living communities and even the U.S. Department of Defence.

Wilkinson Baking Co., whose BreadBot mixes, forms and bakes loaves of bread, has also been getting more inquiries. Randall Wilkinson, the CEO of the Walla Walla, Washington-based company, said the BreadBot serves shifting needs. Grocery shoppers no longer want self-serve options like olive bars, but they still want fresh and local food. Seeing how that food is made also gives them more confidence, he said.

Robot cooks haven't always been successful. Spyce, a Boston restaurant with a robot-run kitchen, closed in November to retool its menu. Zume, a Silicon Valley startup that made pizzas with robots, shut down its pizza business in January. It's now making face masks and biodegradable takeout containers.

Max Elder, research director of the Food Futures Lab at the Palo Alto, California-based Institute for the Future, is skeptical about the future of food prep robots once the pandemic has eased.

""Food is so personal, and it needs to involve humans,"" he said.

Elder is also concerned that focusing on automating food preparation during the pandemic will shift attention from other problems in the food system, like outbreaks among meat industry workers or produce pickers.

""We can't automate our way out of the pandemic because the pandemic affects much more than what can be automated,"" Elder said.

Automated food companies insist they're not trying to replace human workers. At White Castle, Richardson says Flippy will allow managers to redeploy workers to drive-thru lanes or help them cover a shift if an employee calls in sick. Wilmer, of Chowbotics, says Sally may actually create jobs, since it keeps selling food at times of day when it wouldn't have been available before.

But robots can lower the demand for labour. At the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences in Little Rock, workers used to spend six hours per day prepping grab-and-go salads in the 24-hour cafe, said Tonya Johnson, the school's director of nutrition services. But two years ago, the campus installed a Sally, which now makes an average of 40 salads per day. Sally allowed the school to eliminate a vacancy in its cooking staff, Johnson said.

Johnson said the campus is buying another Sally for students to use when they return this August, which will save four hours per day of grab-and-go salad prep in the college deli.

""I think the pandemic has made us realize how much we need more equipment like Sally,"" Johnson said.

Miso Robotics co-founder and CEO Buck Jordan said fast food restaurants are already having trouble finding workers, due in part to a shrinking population of young workers.

""It's our contention that automation is not a choice,"" Jordan said. ""You must automate in order to survive the future.""

A BMW-Toyota partnership creates two vehicles so dramatically different that they’re impossible to compare

Three years isn’t an overly long time to wait for a new or renewed model to arrive. It must have felt like an eternity, however, for die-hard BMW fans awaiting a new Z4 sports car. They went cold turkey from model years 2017 to 2019 after the previous Z4 retired.

Worse still, fans of the Toyota Supra sport coupe have spent more than two decades wondering if and when their favourite nameplate would reemerge.

Well, the wait for both models has ended, thanks to a new platform jointly engineered by both automakers.

For Toyota, a modern interpretation of the Supra coupe was the goal, while BMW’s stylists crafted a two-seat-convertible shape that’s particularly stunning. The up-sweep of the Z4’s body creases flair out just above the taillight lenses, while the rocker panels are cut upward in the same fashion. Add an aggressive-looking nose with dominating air intakes, and the new Z4 makes a bold statement with a more substantial stance.

It’s about 10 centimetres longer than the previous convertible (most of that increase is ahead of the engine bay) although the distance between the front and rear wheels is reduced by about 2.5 centimetres.

The distance between the left and right tires — the track width — has been upped by nearly 10 centimetres in the front and 6.5 centimetres at the rear.

BMW states the design achieves a 50:50 front-rear weight balance, which is considered ideal for handling control and ride comfort.

The Z4’s power soft-top deviates from the previous version’s rather complex folding setup. The new top weighs less, which helps lower the car’s centre of gravity, and takes up less room when folded, which means increased (by 50 per cent) trunk space. The top can also be opened and closed at vehicle speeds of up to 50 km/h.

The aluminum-trimmed dashboard is elegant and the controls are straightforward. There’s a 12.3-inch gauge display plus a 10.25-inch information/navigation screen controlled by BMW’s iDrive rotary dial on the centre console, just to the right of the shifter.

The sDrive30i runs with a 2.0-litre turbocharged four-cylinder that’s rated at 255 horsepower and 295 pound-feet of torque. The more performance-oriented M40i is equipped with a turbocharged 3.0-litre inline six-cylinder that puts out 382 horsepower and 369 pound-feet.

Comfort, Sport and Sport+ modes — optional with the sDrive30i and standard with the M40i — adjust engine, transmission and steering responses according to driver preferences. A locking differential maintains equal torque split between the rear wheels, which BMW says makes for greater cornering precision.

Those who prefer to shift for themselves will be saddened that a manual gearbox is not offered. Your only transmission choice is an eight-speed automatic with manual controls.

The four-cylinder model will accelerate to 60 mph (96 km/h) from rest in a BMW-recorded 5.2 seconds, while the six-cylinder cuts that time to 3.9 seconds.

The four-cylinder sDrive30i will be the thriftiest of the pair, although final numbers for it haven’t been released. Consumption for the M40i is known, however: 10.3 l/100 km in the city and 8.0 on the highway.

For $65,450 (including destination charges and fees), the base Z4 gets a 10-speaker audio system plus some active-safety technologies such as forward-collision warning (with low-speed braking), pedestrian detection and lane-departure warning. A Driver Assistance Package with dynamic cruise control, blind-spot detection and rear cross-traffic alert is optional, as are M sport seats (more side bolstering), premium Harmon Kardon-brand audio and 19-inch wheels (18 inchers are standard).

Also available is a back-up assistant that will automatically steer the Z4 into a parking spot while the driver controls only the accelerator and brake pedal.

The BMW/Toyota collaboration has clearly benefited both brands, but if fun in an attractive wrapper is what you seek, the Z4 makes a great choice.

What you should know: 2020 BMW Z4

554,"Perhaps the only thing that’s not exotic is the price

The hardtop model has a removable roof panel and the rear glass shows off the engine, right. The convertible, left, keeps the engine hidden at all times. Photo: Chevrolet

Perhaps not since the First Sting Ray broke cover for the 1963 model year has there been a more highly anticipated Corvette.

Why? Two reasons. First, the engine is in the back and not the front, immediately making the 2020 Stingray a more exotic machine than any previous Corvette. Second, the base price is $70,000, which isn’t really exotic money.

Certainly some Corvette fans are not happy that their favourite sports car now looks like it was created in Europe and not in America, but their grumbling is drowned out by the praise.

From any angle, the new Corvette is stunning. And yes, it does look European in nature; especially the pointy nose, low hood and massive windshield. Chevrolet says their shapes were inspired by fighter jets, which is easy to see.

Other aspects of the design, however, such as the in-your-face air intakes positioned ahead of the extra-wide rear fenders, add some North American flavoring.

The rear window gives gawkers a peek at the engine bay, while the extended-length rear deck opens to reveal trunk space aft of the engine that Chevrolet says can hold two sets of golf clubs. It’s also where the removable body-coloured roof panel is stowed. Translucent and carbon-fibre panels are optional.

A smaller cargo hold in front — the frunk, as it’s called — is good for an airline-approved carry-on suitcase or a few grocery bags.

For the convertible — which costs about $9,000 more than the base coupe — the power-operated rear deck opens, clamshell-style, then the roof section retracts to rest above the engine before the deck returns to its original position. The process takes 16 seconds and can be done at vehicle speeds up to 50 km/h.

READ MORE: 2020 AMG C43 Wagon and Sedan are true benchmarks

The Corvette’s interior is almost as radical as the body. The unusual steering wheel is flat on the top and the bottom and might take some getting used to. The 30-centimetre configurable instrument display and the 20-centimetre touch-screen (angled toward the driver) appear to have been influenced by hardcore video gamers. Most obvious, though, the driver is separated from the passenger by a wall topped with a lengthy row of buttons and switches almost entirely needed for the climate-control system.

As is the trend these days, switches and pushbuttons have replaced the traditional shift lever, clearly indicating that this Corvette is not available with a manual transmission. Instead, an eight-speed automatic — of the rapid-shift, dual-clutch variety — with paddle shifters handles the gear swapping and hooks to a 6.2-litre V-8 that punches out 490 horsepower and 470 pound-feet of torque. The drive system has six modes, with engine and transmission settings ranging from cruising (soft) to sporting (firm), according to driver preference.

Chevrolet says the Corvette can reach 60 mph (96 km/h) from rest in less than three seconds, which is about as quick (or quicker) than the most powerful seventh-generation front-engine Corvette (the 755-horse ZR1).

KEEP READING: 2020 Nissan Pathfinder keeps moving forward

Part of the credit goes to rear weight bias of the new car (which means more traction), but to pull off that time you’ll need the optional launch control. Just keep the throttle floored and the system releases the brakes, immediately dispatching the Stingray with barely a hint of wheelspin.

The extra cost should be no problem considering the Stingray’s shockingly low $70,000 starting price (coupe), which includes destination charges. That gets you plenty of content, but along with launch control, most enthusiasts will likely shell out a bit more for the Z51 Performance Package. It includes bigger brakes with cooling outlets, performance suspension and rear-axle ratio, and a performance exhaust system that adds five horsepower.

Other options include an electronic limited-slip differential, rearview mirror/camera, upgraded interior appointments (including a choice of two front-seat designs) and magnetic ride-control shock absorbers that instantly and constantly adjust to road conditions and driver inputs.

Given its wild styling, hot performance and even hotter price, the 2020 Corvette Stingray is understandably in high demand. Deliveries begin soon, but that’s likely just the beginning as higher performing models will come on stream with more exotic power and looks. And likely at a price that’s still not exotic.

What you should know: 2020 Chevrolet Corvette Stingray

Type: Two-door, rear-wheel-drive midengine sport coupe/convertible

Engine (h.p.): 6.2-litre OHV V-8 (490/495)

Transmission: Eight-speed automated manual

Market position: For the first time in its six-decade-plus history, the Corvette has the engine behind the seats instead of in front, pointing the way to a whole new future for the car as it severs ties to the past.

Points: Stunning design also comes with a dash of practicality. • Ground-breaking interior has an almost singular focus on the driver. • Non-turbo overhead valve V-8 has been a Chevrolet staple for years. • Some enthusiasts will be saddened by the lack of a manual transmission. • Look for future more versions that stretch the performance envelope.

Active safety: Blind-spot warning with cross-traffic backup alert (std.); active cruise control (n.a.); emergency braking (n.a.); pedestrian detection (n.a.)

Through decades of ups and a few downs, Volvo has maintained a strong relationship with buyers who appreciate understated elegance along with the automaker’s abiding concern for safety. The 2020 XC60 epitomizes both of these values along with leading-edge technological advancements.

The utility vehicle is one of a quartet of Volvos with a 60 suffix in the name, including the S60 sedan, V60 wagon and V60 Cross Country wagon.

The XC60 (XC stands for cross country) seems somewhat duplicitous since the V60 Cross Country also comes with a hike-up stance, but the five-passenger XC falls into the tall-wagon bracket. It’s sort of a junior version of the seven-passenger XC90 and with the current utility-vehicle craze will ultimately be more popular than the V60.

In terms of design, however, the V60 and V60 Cross Country arguably get the nod over the square-ish XC60, but the XC dominates in terms of cargo and passenger capacity even though it’s noticeably shorter.

You know a Volvo is a Volvo by the way the interior is designed, especially the XC60’s standard leather-covered seats with power lumbar support. The suggestion here is that aching backs after long drives just might become a thing of the past.

A vertically positioned 23-centimetre touch-screen is the centrepiece of a clean and tidy dashboard that’s notably absent of knobs and dials. The XC60 retains an actual shift lever instead of buttons.

The standard eight-speed automatic transmission is part of the three available powertrains.

A turbocharged 2.0-litre four-cylinder — called the T5 — is found in the base all-wheel-drive Momentum. It makes 250 horsepower and 258 pound-feet of torque.

The T6 R-Design’s turbocharged and supercharged version of the 2.0 puts out 316 horsepower and 295 pound-feet. At lower engine speeds, the supercharger alone provides the boost, but above 3,000 rpm the turbocharger joins in.

The top performer is the T8 Inscription eAWD plug-in hybrid that puts out 400 horsepower and 472 pound-feet of torque. The system’s front and rear electric motors — supported by a lithium-ion battery pack — contributes 87 horsepower to the hybrid’s output and can operate independently of the internal-combustion engine for up to a claimed 27 kilometres.

Opt for the Polestar Engineered and the T8’s output climbs to 415 horses and 494 pound-feet. Polestar is a Volvo offshoot that specializes in electric vehicles. The T8 eAWD has the greatest output of all available powertrains and also has the lowest fuel consumption. Volvo estimates 4.2 l/100 km in combined city and highway driving. By comparison, the T5 is rated at 9.9 l/100 km, combined.

Pricing for the Momentum starts at $48,400 and, along with the leather seats, includes a panoramic sunroof and power-operated tailgate.

The R-Design has a sport-tuned suspension, blacked-out grille and trim, premium leather seats and 19-inch wheels.

The Inscription is topped up with chrome exterior trim, unique “Driftwood” interior finishings, Harmon Kardon-brand sound system and there’s more electronic active-safety features to help avoid collisions, or at least mitigate them.

At the pinnacle of the XC60 lineup, the $91,200 Polestar Engineered comes with beefier brakes, 21-inch wheels (22s are optional), high-end Bowers and Wilkins audio package, and shock absorbers that are manually adjustable to one of 22 firmness settings. The fact that they can’t be electronically controlled from inside the XC60 likely means that few buyers will bother fiddling with them once the novelty wears off.

On the options list is Volvo’s semi-autonomous Pro Pilot assist that handles steering and braking on well-marked highways at speeds up to 130 km/h.

If your taste in luxury automobiles tends to eschew the usual mainstream contenders from Germany and Japan, Volvo is certainly worth considering and the XC60 makes a solid starting point.

What you should know: 2020 Volvo XC60

Type: Four-door, all-wheel-drive utility vehicle

Engines (h.p.): 2.0-litre DOHC I-4, turbocharged (250); 2.0-litre DOHC I-4, supercharged and turbocharged (316); 2.0-litre DOHC I-4, supercharged and turbocharged with electric assist (400/415)

Transmission: Eight-speed automatic

Market position: For much of its existence, Volvo has taken an uncommon approach in automobile design and engineering. Vehicles such as the XC60 dare to be different in terms of powertrains, styling and safety content.

Points: Attractive redesign is as good or better than the competition. • Top-notch interior comfort reinforces luxury image. • Unorthodox forced-induction systems for the 2.0 engine creates more instant throttle-pedal response. • Standard content begins at the luxury level and just goes up. • An odd mix of standard and optional active- safety systems. • Plug-in hybrid is tops in power and fuel economy.

Active safety: Blind-spot detection with backup assist (std.); active cruise control (std.); pedestrian detection (std.); lane-keeping mitigation (opt.)

From compact cars to SUVs, an increasing number of drivers and manufacturers are turning to electric vehicles. Below are some options to consider for your next vehicle purchase.

Tesla Model 3

For luxury electric vehicles, Tesla leads the way starting with a price of $54,600. For those looking to start with its most affordable option, the Tesla Model 3 is the way to go. It has a top speed of 251km/h and accelerates from 0 to 100km/h in just 3.5 seconds. A single charge can drive up to 518 kilometers as well.

Nissan Leaf Plus

The Nissan Leaf has had over 400,000 sales worldwide and the 2020 model starts from $44,298. The leaf has a far less range than the Tesla but is more than the Hyundai IONIQ at 363 kilometers from full charge. It’s 62 kWh battery pack and 160 kW electric motor, offer horsepower of 214 and 250 lbs.-ft of torque. It also has the E-Pedal where drivers use one pedal to accelerate and slow down.

561,"The Venue is 13 centimetres shorter than the next-up Kona, although passenger room is similar. Where the Venue makes its sacrifice is total cargo room, lack of powertrain choice and it doesn’t offer all-wheel-drive. The Kona does. Photo: Hyundai

You might think that Hyundai had plugged every possible niche in its utility-vehicle lineup. The new 2020 Venue clearly shows that wasn’t the case.

After introducing the range-topping eight-passenger Palisade for the 2019 model year, Hyundai is addressing the small end of the lineup with the sub-compact Venue. It slots below the Kona — another relative newbie — and joins what becomes an eight-model lineup of wagons and hatchbacks that also includes the Tucson, Santa Fe, Veloster, Elantra GT and Nexo Fuel Cell.

The made-in-Korea Venue is currently sold in other countries, which likely explains why it has a distinctively international appearance. Many other Hyundai models are styled in the United States. Still, the tall roofline and generously sized windshield and side and rear glass play to the Venue’s practical nature.

The body lines are crisp and the front and rear overhangs are minimal, which suggests that the Venue is ready to play beyond where the pavement ends. That territory remains outside the little Hyundai’s comfort zone since all-wheel-drive is not available. Not that it should be of great concern for buyers of more basic transportation since other competing models, most notably the similarly sized and shaped Nissan Kicks, are also strictly front-wheel-drive.

The Venue provides a decent amount of space despite being 13 centimetres shorter than the Kona. The Venue is only about 2.5 centimetres narrower, but it’s slightly taller and has nearly the same amount of stowage room behind the rear seat (with the height-adjustable cargo floor in the lowered position).

Where the Venue ultimately falls short is in maximum roominess with the back seat folded forward. The Kona has an advantage of nearly 45 per cent. The Venue is, however, spacious enough to comfortably seat four adults, and five in a pinch.

The dashboard is a paragon of simplicity with easy-to-use knobs and switches for the audio and climate controls. The standard 20-centimetre touch-screen is propped up between twin air vents. The speedometer and tachometer, separated by a small info screen, are clearly marked and easy to read. Instead of an electronic parking brake, note the old-school manual handle.

The Venue has just one engine choice: The 1.6-litre four-cylinder is rated at 121 horsepower and 113 pound-feet of torque. Although not particularly potent, the output is typical of other category members. It also only has about 1,180-kilograms of curb weight to move around.

A six-speed manual transmission comes with the base trim, while a continuously variable transmission (CVT) is optional.

Fuel consumption with the CVT is rated at 8.0 l/100 km in the city, 7.0 on the highway and 7.5 combined.

Along with saving money at the pumps, the Venue has an economical base price of $19,200, (including destination fees) for the base Essential trim with a manual transmission. The CVT adds $1,300. Content includes air conditioning, heated front seats and a four-speaker audio system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity.

The Preferred trim level adds a number of active safety-technologies (including forward collision warning and lane-keeping assist), plus climate control, roof rails and 15-inch alloy wheels instead of steel. The Trend gets you a power sunroof, heated steering wheel and 17-inch wheels.

The Ultimate comes with rear disc brakes (instead of drums), climate control, navigation system and front and rear LED lighting.

In addition, Preferred, Trend and Ultimate models have a Snow Mode Select setting that provides added front-wheel traction that’s specifically modulated for winter driving conditions.

Although the Venue doesn’t qualify for family duty, as a short-haul commuter/grocery getter, it checks off most boxes and might be your kind of niche.

What you should know: 2020 Hyundai Venue

Type: Front-wheel-drive subcompact utility vehicle

Engine (h.p.): 1.6-litre DOHC four-cylinder (121)

Transmission: Six-speed manual; continuously variable (opt.)

Market position: Like many of its competitors, the Venue has the appeal of an off-roader, but it doesn’t have the all-terrain capability to back up the image. For most buyers, style comes first, along with price and economy of operation.

Points: The Venue will appeal to the hearts and wallets of buyers. • Modest interior appointments are far from luxurious, but the controls are simple. • The four-cylinder engine is more about operating economy than performance; a small-displacement turbo-engine option would likely do well. • The base Venue is decently equipped and attractively priced.

Active safety: Blind-spot warning with cross-traffic backup alert (opt.); active cruise control (opt.); forward-collision alert; pedestrian detection (opt.);

562,"The Acadia seats up to seven people with its standard third-row seat. Base models come with four-cylinder engines and front-wheel-drive. For 2020, a turbocharged four-cylinder has been added as an option. Photo: GMC

The GMC Acadia hits the sweet spot with buyers wanting comfort and good looks in a roomy midsize utility vehicle. And unless you need to transport a pro basketball team or tow a humongous boat or travel trailer, you can save yourself a bundle over the bulkier GMC Yukon and Yukon XL.

The 2020 Acadia is an update of the downsized current-generation model that arrived for 2017. It was nearly 18 centimetres shorter than its predecessor, nine centimetres narrower, and the distance between the front and rear wheels was cut by more than 15 centimetres.

As a result, passenger and cargo space were reduced, the folding third-row seat became more of a squeeze and maximum towing capacity was reduced to 1,820 kilograms from 2,365. In the process, the Acadia shed some 320 kilograms, which aided overall performance and fuel economy. The revamped Acadia suddenly found itself in the same bracket as the Ford Explorer, Honda Pilot and Toyota Highlander.

Exterior changes for 2020 include a bolder rectangular grille that’s similar to what’s found on other GMC pickups and utility vehicles, but the rest remains basically unchanged.

Inside, the control panel is clearly influenced by other General Motors vehicles. Replacing the traditional gear-shift lever with a row of switches (below the climate controls) frees up space for the optional phone charger.

The Acadia seats seven passengers in a two-three-two arrangement across three rows. Opt for second-row individual seats that recline slightly and slide forward for easier third-row access, but overall capacity is reduced to six.

Buyers now have three engine choices instead of two with the addition of a turbocharged 2.0-litre four-cylinder that produces 230 horsepower and 258 pound-feet of torque. It joins the base 2.5-litre four-cylinder with 193 horsepower and 188 pound-feet, and the 3.6-litre V-6 that makes 310 horsepower and 271 pound-feet. The V-6 is particularly smooth and quiet operator with plenty of instant-on power when you need it. A nine-speed automatic transmission is standard for all.

The turbo engine is the Acadia’s fuel champ with ratings of 11.0 l/100 km in the city, 8.3 on the highway and 9.8 combined, but the towing capacity is a paltry 680 kilograms, which is far less than V-6 that can pull up to 1,820 kilograms. The base engine can tow only 455 kilograms.

All-wheel-drive is optional with the turbo four-cylinder and the V-6, and unavailable with the base four-cylinder. When traction is not an issue, the system drives the front wheels only. It can manually be switched to 4×4, Sport, Off Road or Trailer/Tow modes via a console-mounted selector.

Acadia pricing starts at $39,600 in Canada, including destination charges, for the well-equipped SL trim. It comes with tri-zone climate control, 20-centimetre touch-screen, LED headlights and a high-definition rearview camera. Active-safety technology such as emergency braking and lane-keeping assist are not included.

The SLE and SLT trims add a variety of luxury content, while the AT4 is heavy on the black paint, blacked-out trim and wheels and is a specially equipped for off-road travel.

The pinnacle of Acadia extravagance is the Denali AWD ($56,400), with chromed-up exterior trim, hands-free power liftgate, wood- and leather-coated interior pieces, 20-inch wheels (18s are standard) and a variety of active safety technology such as emergency braking, lane-keeping assist and pedestrian detection.

Compared with the bigger and pricier Yukons, the Acadia will address the needs of most utility-vehicle buyers while leading the way in style and operating economy.

What you should know: 2020 GMC Acadia

Type: Four-door, front- /all-wheel-drive midsize utility vehicle

Engines (h.p.): 2.5-litre DOHC I-4 (193); 3.6-litre DOHC V-6 (310)

2.0-litre DOHC I-4, turbocharged (230)

Transmission: Nine-speed automatic

Market position: General Motors’ GMC division did the smart thing and downsized the

full-size Acadia, thus bringing it in line with other hot sellers with three rows of seats. The 2020 model updates the styling and adds another engine option.

Points: Updated look is bolder, as is the trend. • Dashboard could be from a number of other GM models. • Base four-cylinder and new turbo I-4 are thrifty, but for serious towing and hauling, stick with the V-6. • New AT4 trim level looks cool, adds off-road competency. • Cargo and stowage capacities are generous, compared with most competitors.

Driver Assist: Blind-spot warning with cross-traffic alert (opt.); active cruise control (opt.); emergency braking (opt.); pedestrian alert (opt.); lane-keep assist (opt.).

There’s nothing ‘eco’ about 6,000 pounds of metal and glass, but it hauls more than its gasoline counterparts and has decent fuel economy

The last two model years have seen the adoption of turbo-diesel engines by all domestic-based light-duty pickup brands. That includes the Ram 1500 turbo-diesel that returns to the group for 2020 following a one-year time-out.

In the automotive world, the pickup category is the most hotly contested. Millions are sold in North America every year. Of those, about 95 per cent are made by Ford, General Motors (Chevrolet and GMC) and the Ram division of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA). The stakes are huge.

The Ram 1500 has made quite a name for itself lately, winning numerous awards and accolades. That and some aggressive marketing has translated into steady sales growth along with a corresponding increase in respect among truck shoppers.

The only piece missing was the turbo-diesel that disappeared for the 2019 model year, primarily due to emission-related issues. But now the so-called EcoDiesel has returned, with added trailer-tugging and cargo-load capacities.

So how do the numbers stack up? The Ram’s made-in-Italy 3.0-litre V-6 puts out 260 horsepower and 480 pound-feet of torque, which is a gain of eight per cent and 14 per cent, respectively. A new turbocharger, redesigned fuel injectors and pistons and increased compression ratio are credited with the improved performance.

The Ford F150 turbo-diesel (also a 3.0-litre V-6) delivers 250 horsepower and 440 pound-feet, and GM’s 3.0-litre inline six-cylinder turbo-diesel in the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra has 277 horsepower and 460 pound-feet. Yes, the numbers are close, but the Ram holds a definite edge in the crucial torque department.

It’s also a horse race for official fuel economy. GM leads the pack at 8.9 l/100 km in combined city/highway driving, followed by Ram at 9.7 and Ford at 9.8.

The EcoDiesel’s maximum payload and towing capacities have increased to 1,045 and 5,710 kilograms, respectively, from 855 and 4,027 kilograms.

The EcoDiesel can be specified with all Ram body styles and box sizes, including the extended-length Quad Cab and four-door Crew Cab models. A two-door regular-cab version is also available, but only for fleet customers. Most trim levels can be outfitted with the diesel, too, including the Sport and off-road-oriented Rebel.

Aside from the diesel, the Ram is available with a 3.5-litre V-6 that produces 305 horsepower and 269 pound-feet of torque. That can be temporarily increased by up to 90 pound-feet with a belt-drive 48-volt “eTorque” motor/generator. This mild-hybrid system replaces the traditional alternator and uses a lithium-ion battery to add power under hard acceleration.

Optional is a 5.7-litre V-8 that delivers 395 horsepower and 410 pound-feet, and when equipped with eTorque it has slightly more towing capacity than the EcoDiesel at 5,795 kilograms.

All Ram engines are linked to eight-speed automatic transmissions.

Aside from what’s under the hood, the 2020 Ram 1500 has no shortage of tricks up its sleeves to be competitive. The optional air suspension can raise or lower the ride height and keep the truck level when it’s loaded.

Then there’s the trick multi-function tailgate. The split design allows you to open either or both sides, or you can drop the tailgate as a single unit for loading/unloading larger and/or longer objects.

The interior can also be loaded with luxury amenities and a dominating 30-centimetre touch-screen that’s so large it can be split into two screens. It looks intimidating, but the layout is intuitive and the system is easy to use.

Ram EcoDiesel pricing starts at $51,300, including destination charges. That’s about $5,200 more than the base gasoline V-6 and $3,250 more than V8-equipped Rams.

If your work and/or play requirements call for plenty of torque-rich pulling and hauling performance while keeping fuel consumption in check, the updated EcoDiesel option will be most welcome.

Type: Two- /four-door, rear- /four-wheel-drive light-duty pickup

Engine (h.p.): 3.0-litre DOHC V-6, turbo-diesel (260)

Transmission; Eight-speed automatic

Market position: The benefits of diesel power are fuel efficiency and low-speed pulling power. There’s 480 pound-feet of peak torque available at 1,600 rpm. By contrast, the 5.7-litre gasoline V-8 is rated at 410 pound-feet and at a much higher 3,950 revs. The diesel costs more to buy, though.

Points: Redesigned turbo-diesel engine provides greater efficiency and pulling power. • The cost for the optional powerplant seems high, but it more or less in line with competitive turbo-diesel models. • For now, the competition plays second-fiddle for peak torque. • Interior leans on the premium side, especially the oversize U-Connect touch-screen.

564,"In terms of length, the CX-30 splits the difference between the CX-3 and CX-5, although in terms of cargo room and price, it’s closer to the CX-3. Photo: Mazda

The CX-30 is a smart play on Mazda’s part and could be a smart buy for anyone seeking flair and finesse in a useful package

Achieving mastery in the utility-vehicle segment is not necessarily defined by the automaker that sells the most, but by which one, or ones, best combine styling, spaciousness and driving competency.

By that measure, the current trio of Mazda models — the CX-3, CX-5 and CX-9 — are highly regarded.

Despite what the name implies, the new CX-30 plugs a noticeable gap between the 3 and the 5. As for the tale of the tape for a vehicle that should be called the CX-4: About 13 centimetres longer than the three and 15 centimetres shorter than the CX-5.

Why is it called the CX-30? Apparently because Mazda already makes a CX-4, although not for this market.

In terms of cargo capacity, aft of the front seats, the CX-30 offers only slightly greater room than the CX-3. That’s due in part to a sloped liftgate, which gives the newcomer a sportier silhouette but cuts into stowage room (with the split-folding rear seat up or lowered). This is big deal because one of the CX-3’s shortcomings — and therefore one of the reasons to move up to the CX-30 — is cargo room.

Fortunately, the rear door is relatively wide and the cargo floor is quite low (unlike in the CX-3) to accommodate bulkier objects.

When viewed head-on, the CX-30’s visually appealing grille and elongated hood — part of the Kodo design language — appear to be lifted straight from the CX-5.

As you would expect, the CX-30’s passenger volume falls between that of the 3 and 5. The control panel and standard 23-centimetre touch-screen — appearing partially sunken into the dashboard — is also similar to the CX-5’s unit.

Elsewhere, Mazda focused on a quiet cabin. Along with added insulation, the sound system’s low-frequency speakers, which are normally placed in the lower front-door panels, are moved upward and closer to the pull handles. The automaker claims this means more bass plus a reduction in outside noise leaking in through the speaker grilles.

The base CX-30 engine is a 2.0-litre four-cylinder with 155 horsepower and 150 pound-feet of torque. Optional is a 2.5-litre four-cylinder that produces 186 horsepower and 186 pound-feet. Both engines are connected to six-speed automatic transmissions.

Front-wheel-drive is standard for both engines, and all-wheel-drive is optional for both.

Fuel consumption for the FWD 2.0 is rated at 8.9 l/100 km in the city, 7.1 on the highway and 8.1 combined.

A new AWD feature is the Off-Road mode that assists traction on rough/uneven/loose surfaces.

Pricing in Canada starts at $26,000, including destination charges, for the base CX-30 GX. That’s $3,000 higher than the CX-3’s base, but the CX-30 includes extra-cost content such as an 22.3-centimetre screen, heated front seats, LED headlights, 16-inch alloy wheels and eight-speaker audio. Also standard is blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert.

The midgrade GS comes with the 2.5-liter engine plus dual-zone climate control, 18-inch wheels and a heated steering wheel. There’s also a much larger grouping of key active-safety tech, including adaptive cruise control, pedestrian detection, lane-departure warning, inattentive-driver alert and emergency braking.

The top-line GT trim level comes with all-wheel-drive plus a 12-speaker Bose-brand audio package, heated front seats with power adjustment (including lumbar support and memory settings) for the driver.

You also get leather seat inserts, power moonroof, power liftgate, adaptive (left-right pivoting) headlights and head-up display that projects speed and other information onto the windshield.

Note than the GT’s 2.5-litre engine includes cylinder deactivation that shuts down two cylinders during light cruising to save fuel.

For the 2020 model year, every CX-30 (as does every new Mazda in Canada) comes with an unlimited-kilometre warranty with three years of comprehensive coverage (including roadside assistance), five-years of powertrain and seven years of anti-perforation (rust-through) coverage.

As buyers continue to gravitate to utility vehicles, the CX-30 is a smart play on Mazda’s part and could be a smart buy for anyone seeking flair and finesse in a useful package.

Transmission: Six-speed automatic

Market position: The CX-30 gives Mazda four utility vehicles to cover a wide range of size and price. It fills a critical spot in the lineup between the CX-3 and the CX-5.

Points: Slightly less practical (but better looking) than the CX-5, but a nice option to the CX-3. • Interior remains spacious for people and cargo, despite the smallish dimensions. • Stout optional engine is the same one installed in the heavier CX-5, so it should perform well with less heft to haul around.

Virtually all automakers have figured out that the key to current and future business success is in utility vehicles of varying sizes and descriptions.

That lesson hasn’t been lost on Jaguar, which launched the E-Pace for the 2018 model year. It serves as a junior partner to the mid-size F-Pace wagon that arrived for 2017.

If you’re interested in new or used Jaguars, be sure to visit TodaysDrive.com to find your dream car today!

The E-Pace name sounds like it might refer to an electric vehicle, but it uses good-old-fashioned gasoline propulsion. Jaguar’s I-Pace tall hatchback wagon is Jaguar’s sole electric, at least until the 2021 XJ sedan arrives. The E-Pace rests on a front-wheel-drive platform derived from the Land Rover Evoque (Jaguar and Land Rover are owned by the same company). Like the F-Pace, however, the E-Pace has standard all-wheel-drive.

The F-Pace and E-Pace are unmistakable as kin, right down to their similar-looking front-end shapes that are clearly influenced by other Jaguar fleet members. The common thread also extends to the opposite end, where the fashionably sloping liftgate looks attractive enough, but results in reduced cargo space when compared to other more squared-off designs.

The cabin appears equally inviting, especially the cockpit-style driver’s pod that could have been lifted straight out of the F-Type sports car. The touch screen is nice and big and the large, round ventilation controls will no doubt assist the fumble-fingered.

The E-Pace is more than 30 centimetres shorter and nearly nine centimetres narrower than the F-Pace, and is more than 20 centimetres shorter between the front and rear wheels. But the real surprise is that the E-pace actually outweighs the bigger Jag by 34 kilograms, which goes to show that compactness doesn’t necessarily result in a corresponding reduction in heft.

Fortunately, the E-Pace is up to the task of quickly and efficiently hauling passengers and cargo, using a turbocharged 2.0-litre four-cylinder engine that’s rated at a respectable 246 horsepower and 269 pound-feet of torque. It’s standard in the P250 models.

For significantly more oomph, the E-Pace P300 R-Dynamic trims come with a turbo 2.0 that puts 296 horsepower and 295 pound-feet of torque.

A nine-speed automatic is the sole transmission choice.

The all-wheel-drive hardware depends on the engine, starting with a permanently engaged setup for the P250 models. The P300 R-Dynamic’s “Active Driveline” powers only the front wheels in normal driving conditions. When traction loss is detected, the system can direct nearly all of the available torque to the rear wheels and to a specific rear wheel, if necessary.

Active Driveline’s standard torque-vectoring system “uses the brakes to (balance) the distribution of engine torque between all four wheels during cornering.” According to the company, this reduces the vehicle’s natural tendency to travel in a straight line even when the steering wheel is turned (called understeer).

Common to all E-Pace models is a low-speed cruise-control system that regulates the vehicle’s speed between two km/h and 30 km/h. Interestingly, active-safety technology such as blind-spot warning and adaptive cruise control are not standard, although lane-keeping assist is.

E-Pace pricing starts at $51,700, including destination charges. For that pile of cash, you get a reasonable level of standard content, but to move closer to the luxury zone you’ll need to select the R-Dynamic or Checkered Flag versions for leather seat coverings, panoramic roof, navigation, head-up info display and 19-inch wheels (18s are standard).

The performance-laden P300 R-Dynamic adds about $5,700 to the base price, but you also get larger brakes, 20-inch wheels plus a bit more comfort content.

Whatever the choice, the E-pace is an enticing little cat, with the looks, luxury and power that fits with the Jaguar name and reputation. And it’s a utility vehicle.

What you should know: 2020 Jaguar E-Pace

Type: Four-door, all-wheel-drive compact utility vehicle

Engine (h.p.): 2.0-litre DOHC I-4, turbocharged (246/296)

Transmission: Nine-speed automatic

Market position: The E-Pace is one of a growing legion of smaller premium utility vehicles. many of which resemble their larger stable mates. In some cases, these models have replaced traditional sedans in their respective lineups.

Points: Nicely balanced design presses all the right “want-it-now” buttons.

• Both base and higher-output versions of the turbo-2.0 engine should prove more than acceptable in the power department. • Jaguar’s aversion to offering manual transmissions is typical of most luxury brands these days. • Surprisingly heavy when compared with similarly sized wagons.

Many people might dream of owning a top-drawer Mercedes-Benz S-class, BMW-7 series or Lexus LS sedan, but they can cost upward of $100,000 (or possibly much more). Is there an alternative?

Although far from inexpensive, the Genesis G90 can at least keep the dream alive for some with a surfeit of luxury appointments and plenty of gas-pedal snap.

For the unaware, the G90 began as the premium Hyundai Equus, but for 2017 was spun off as part of a separate division along with the Genesis G80 (née Hyundai Genesis) and new-for-2019 G70 sedans.

The flagship 2020 G90 is also the first to receive a major makeover since its initial rebranding, which includes the replacement of nearly every body panel except for the roof and doors. In particular, the V-shaped grille dominates the front end and the headlights and taillights are each split by a thin band of LEDs that extend into the fenders. Like it or not, the new design clearly sets the G90 apart from the previous car, not to mention every other competing sedan.

Elsewhere, the massive rear doors simplify the entering and exiting process for the harried executive, and more than 450 litres of trunk space is enough to tote a foursome’s worth of golf clubs or enough Louis Vuitton luggage for a week’s worth of wardrobe changes.

Despite the external sculpting, the G90 retains the previous generation’s platform. That means all key measurements — length, width, height and distance between the front and rear wheels — are virtually identical to the measurements of the 2019 model.

For 2020, the sumptuously appointed leather-and-wood-trimmed interior includes a 31-centimetre high-definition touch-screen integrated into the control panel (no pop-up-style tablets here). The cabin is also a quieter spot with the addition of active noise control. It functions through the G90’s audio system to cancel out intrusive sounds entering the passenger compartment. Also available are 19-inch wheels that have been specially designed to absorb sounds emitted by the tires as they roll.

Additional comfort is derived from the adaptive suspension that instantly adjusts the shocks to tame the road surface. It also provides added control when cornering by firming up the outside dampers.

The only engine for Canada is a 5.0-litre V-8 that produces 420 horsepower and 383 pound-feet of torque. By special order only is a twin-turbocharged 3.3-litre V-6 with 365 horsepower and 376 pound-feet of torque. That reduces the G90 V-8’s $89,900 price (including destination charges) by $3,000.

Both engines are connected to eight-speed automatic transmissions and all-wheel-drive is standard. In Eco mode, the system disconnects itself from the front wheels for reduced fuel consumption, which for the V-8 is 15.4 l/100 km in the city, 10.2 on the highway and 13.1 combined.

The G90 arrives in a fully loaded state and content highlights encompass multi-position power front and rear Nappa-leather-covered seats, 900-watt surround-sound system and wireless phone charging.

You also get a complete assemblage of dynamic-safety technologies. Some of the more unique features include Auto Speed Slowdown that adjusts vehicle speed according to the posted signs, and Safe Exit Assist that warns of approaching traffic when you’re opening the doors to get out of the car.

As a relatively new player in the premium-sedan category, the G90 won’t have an easy time dislodging buyers from their favourite brands, whether Audi, Mercedes-Benz and Lexus. But given the G90’s content and performance, perhaps traveling in grand style while saving a few dollars will be enough motivation to make the switch.

What you should know: 2020 Genesis G90

Type: All-wheel-drive full-size sedan

Engines (h.p.): 3.3-litre DOHC V-6, twin-turbocharged (365); 5.0-litre DOHC V-8 (420)

Transmission: Eight-speed automatic

Market position: Hyundai’s premium Genesis brand as among well-established luxury automakers and remains a fringe player with far fewer models and no utility vehicles.

Points: Expressive design sets this flagship apart. • First-rate interior appointments convey a strong upscale presence. • Both base turbo V-6 and non-turbo V-8 engines deliver plenty of thrust. • Full assortment of standard active-safety technology. • Selling on quality and appealing price creates a tempting incentive to purchase.

Buick Encore, Envision, Enclave.

Maybe GM has run out of e-names, because here’s the Buick Encore GX.

Just a gussied-up Encore?

Nope.

They’re both built in South Korea, but don’t share a single nut.

Just the name.

Marketing people get paid way more to make these decisions than I do to question them...

GM calls the non-GX Encore a “subcompact” crossover, so the Encore GX, my tester, I guess becomes a “subcompact-plus” crossover.

It’s a millimetre-by-millimetre wheelbase difference business out there...

Encore GX starts at $26,098 for a front-drive “Preferred” trim level. My tester, a range-topping “Essence” which only comes with part-time selectable four-wheel drive, checked just about every option box and listed at $38,373.

It is built on a new platform, shared with Chevy’s recently launched Blazer.

It’s a handsome little thing, with a bit more character than the two-box concept of most in this class.

My tester sported a lovely “Dark Moon Blue Metallic” paint job with sparklies in it.

It’s equally handsome inside, with perforated leather seating surfaces, matte-black dash top to reduce reflections into the windshield, and also matte-finished metallic door handles and HVAC vents.

The photos here show what the dash looks like — well-designed, with clear gauges and a ton of choices for information displays.

As usual with modern cars, you’ll be months into ownership and still be discovering stuff.

My tester had all the nanny systems, but they’re easy to shut off if you don’t want them. I don’t.

Same for the head-up display.

Android Auto, Apple CarPlay and a Wi-Fi hot spot for up to seven devices highlight the high-techery.

Amazon’s Alexa is available if you’ve got a weekend to spend learning how to use it.

It isn’t quite “natural speech,” but it’s getting there.

Most minor controls are by the dreaded push buttons. At least radio volume and the HVAC system have proper round knobs so you can work them without taking your eyes off the road.

You’ll have lots of places to store stuff, with cup holders and cubby bins galore.

Allergy sufferers will rejoice over the air ionizer system which helps remove pollen and dust from the car.

The front seats are really short in cushion length, so if you like lots of thigh support, this might not be your car. I found it acceptable (I’m five-foot-10), but I didn’t take any long trips.

The main dimensional difference between Encore and Encore GX is wheelbase. This translates into decent rear seat legroom for two (three is a bit of a squeeze).

The rear seat-back split-folds one-third/two-thirds, and the front passenger seat can fold flat for added luggage-carrying flexibility.

The two-level trunk also has decent capacity.

A button on the driver’s door lets you open the power liftgate all the way, halfway (for those low apartment garage ceilings) or to shut it off altogether. Not sure why you’d want that.

The 1.3-litre turbocharged three-cylinder engine produces a modest 155 horsepower at 5,600 r.p.m., but a healthy 174 lb.-ft. of torque, which peaks at a low 1,600 r.p.m. and stays pretty much at that level until 4,000.

It scores 9.0 l/100 km city, 8.0 l/100 km highway.

The lowest number I recorded was 8.1; interesting that this was a bit worse than the bigger Jeep Cherokee I tested immediately beforehand.

As they say, “your mileage may differ.”

Sometimes you get into a car, and it just feels right. Both Lady Leadfoot and myself felt this way about the Encore GX.

The engine feels surprisingly peppy with no marked turbo lag. That low peak torque peak r.p.m. number helps here.

It is also surprisingly quiet, not as raspy as most three-bangers.

It cruises at common (if not technically legal) highway speeds with ease.

The nine-speed autobox has a ratio for every purpose; drive gently and you might never see three grand...

You can switch to manual shift mode, but in a car like this, I’m not sure why you’d want to.

The ride is on the firm side by historical Buick standards, but I’ll take that every time.

The steering is light and precise, and the car’s small size makes it feel nimble.

The “AWD” button on the console locks the car into four-wheel drive mode; otherwise, it’s an on-demand deal.

Good weather during my test didn’t give me much chance to test this, but quick acceleration runs on a gravel road with and without the system engaged showed it can make a difference.

So, how does one choose from what must be a dozen smallish crossovers currently available?

They’ve all been market-researched to death, so all offer roughly the same features at similar prices.

Let me make that decision a bit tougher by recalling an old Buick ad slogan: “Wouldn’t you really rather have a Buick?”

573,"Ford is bringing back the Mach 1 model designation on a Mustang after a 17-year hiatus.

First, this is a genuine “Mach” version of a genuine Mustang.

I still can’t believe Ford is using both of those fabled nameplates on a four-door electric truck.

Shame, shame, shame.

Don Frey, chief engineer on the original Mustang, would turn in his grave if he knew what to turn in it for.

The newest Mustang will be a real Mustang. It will be a 2021 model year car and goes on sale that spring.

Prices? Way too soon, but the car will be positioned between the Mustang GT (2020 price, $34,790) and the Shelby GT350 ($76,425).

Obviously a huge gap.

The Mustang Bullitt with which the Mach 1 shares some bits currently lists at $52,500, so my guess for the Mach 1 is somewhere north of that, probably high-50s.

By the way, no confirmation that the Bullitt edition will survive into 2021.

If you want one, it may already be too late.

During an online press conference, Tom Barnes, vehicle engineering manager for Mustang, and Jim Owens, Mustang and Shelby marketing manager, gave a group of Canadian journos some technical details of the new Mach 1.

A revised front end provides extra cooling for both engine and transmission. Some styling tricks like “go-faster” stripes bridge the gap to earlier generations.

As Owens noted, “Anything that bears this badge has to look right, it has to look to its heritage.”

Barnes added, “People who know Mach 1 will say, ‘That’s a Mach 1.’

“People who don’t know Mach 1 will say, ‘That’s a really cool car.’”

Revised trim inside includes a numbered serial plate.

Ford won’t say how many Mach 1s it’ll build, only that it is a “limited edition.”

I couldn’t even get them to say how many digits that serial number would contain...

Those planning to track the car will probably want to opt for the Recaro seats.

Barnes and Owens suggested “balance” is the key to the new Mach 1.

Their mantra is that Mach 1 will be “the pinnacle of Mustang 5.0-litre performance,” the “5.0-litre” caveat necessary because the 5.2-litre flat-plane-crankshaft Shelby GT350 and the supercharged 5.2-litre GT500 will outrun it.

That’s because Mach 1 gets essentially the same 5.0-litre V-8 engine as the Bullitt, providing 480 horsepower at 7,000 r.p.m. and and 420 lb.-ft. of torque at 4,600 r.p.m. Should be good for 0-100 km/h in the low- to mid-five-second range.

It will be mated to a six-speed Tremec manual gearbox, with rev-matching for smooth downshifting.

It also features the cool cue-ball shift knob.

Shiftless types can opt for a 10-speed automatic, which has been massaged for sportier on-road and on-track performance.

Suspension includes MagneRide dampers, still the best in the game in my view, and stiffer steering shaft, sway bars and front springs.

Bigger and better brakes are part of the deal.

19x9.5-inch front and 19x10-inch rear wheels are shod with Michelin PS4 tires.

A Handling Package, available only with the stick shift, brings even fatter wheels and tires, and a host of aerodynamic features which generate 150 per cent more downforce than Mustang GT when equipped with its comparable performance pack.

A rear subframe with stiffer bushings and a rear toe link lifted from the Shelby GT350 will further improve grip.

Underneath, a longer belly pan again aids aerodynamics.

The objective was to make the car fast on the track, but still ultimately “street-able.”

I’d love to tell you if they succeeded, but obviously, a virtual car launch can only tell us so much.

The Ford folks think this car is amazing. But then, they would, wouldn’t they?

I really liked the Bullitt, the GT350 and the GT500, so I imagine the Mach 1 won’t disappoint.

Can hardly wait to confirm that for you.",Revived Ford Mustang Mach 1 pays homage to heritage,0,0.40192372825721256
574,"DETROIT—In its 2019 Sustainability Report released Thursday, General Motors is providing new details of its upcoming flood of electric vehicles.

The report also outlined advances across the company GM made last year as well as where it can improve, such as in diversity hiring.

“In some cases we feel good about the progress we’ve made, but we know we can do better,” Dane Parker, GM’s Sustainability Officer, told reporters. “Where we are is necessary, but we need to improve as we move forward.”

Hints at future Cadillacs

In the report, GM said Cadillac, its luxury brand, will see new all-electric SUVs that mirror many of its internal combustion engine models already in the lineup.

For example, the report said Cadillac will reveal an electric “globally sized luxury three-row SUV.” That matches the description of its current XT6 SUV, a detail not previously disclosed.

Also new, Cadillac will offer an all-electric SUV with “attainable luxury — similar to today’s Cadillac XT4.”

Another hint at Cadillac’s upcoming EV lineup is a statement in the report that there will be a full-size, three-row luxury SUV that reflects the iconic Escalade.

Finally, GM has previously said it will hand-build a halo, vehicle called the Cadillac Celestiq, but in the report GM discloses that only 1.2 Celestiqs will be made per day.

GM has promised to bring at least 20 new electric vehicles to market by 2023. GM has said it plans for additional models beyond that, with a vision of an all-electric future to support its mantra of “zero crashes, zero emissions, zero congestion.”

“Transitioning to all-electric vehicles is central to a zero-emissions future,” said GM CEO Mary Barra in the opening statement of the report. “Our new, flexible platform and Ultium battery system will help us build EVs across all our brands. By mid-decade, we expect to sell a million EVs a year across our global markets.”

More than 80 per cent of EV charging is done at home, Parker said, but GM is vocal on its desire for a federal policy that will support more charging stations and other infrastructure to make EV ownership more desirable. Also, GM seeks consistent consumer government tax incentives for EV purchases, Parker said.

Here are the EVs coming that are listed in its Sustainability Report:

Cadillac

The Lyriq SUV to start production in 2022

A globally sized luxury three-row SUV that emphasizes interior space and cargo capability

An SUV EV with attainable luxury — similar to today’s Cadillac XT4 — and aimed at a key global growth segment

A full-size, three-row luxury SUV that reflects elements of the Escalade

Cadillac Celestiq handmade ultraluxury EV with projected build rate of 1.2 vehicles per day

GMC

GMC Hummer EV pickup truck that will offer 1,000 horsepower, 11,500 pound-feet of torque and 0 to 60 mph acceleration in three seconds

GMC Hummer EV SUV builds off the GMC Hummer EV truck but will be configured as an off-road-capable SUV

Chevrolet

A mid-size SUV targeted to U.S. customers who are looking for an electric option in this segment

Chevrolet battery-electric pickup. It will offer more than 400 miles of range on a single charge

Chevrolet Bolt that features a distinctive SUV design inspired by the Chevy Blazer and offers Super Cruise driver assistance — the first vehicle outside of Cadillac to do so

Two new all-electric vehicles will be the new face of the brand.

A Buick SUV will offer more conventional crossover proportions that maximize interior space and cargo

A Buick SUV will feature more expressive proportions with a greater emphasis on form and athletic fashion

Additionally, GM’s self-driving Cruise Origin will be the first production vehicle from GM’s partnership with Honda.

Manufacturing targets

GM is investing $2.2 billion (U.S.) to retool its Detroit-Hamtramck plant to assemble all-electric vehicles there. It will start building the electric GMC Hummer next year, then the Cruise Origin.

In fact, GM insiders dub the plant, “Factory Zero” because the cars it will build will all have zero emissions. GM has said once the plant is fully operational, it will create 2,200 jobs.

In its Sustainability Report, GM said it will allocate more than $20 billion of capital and engineering resources to its electric and autonomous vehicle programs between now and 2025.

GM continues to build a battery cell plant in a joint venture with LG Chem near Lordstown, Ohio, which will make Ultium cells. The Ultium battery enables a variety of electric vehicles to be built across brands and segments on the same platform.

Furthering its commitment to the environment, GM said by 2030 half of the content on each of its new vehicles to be sourced from “non-virgin” or recycled items. It is also studying using bio-based materials such as algae in future cars.

Other goals: By 2025, GM plans for 90 per cent of its global facilities to produce zero waste. By 2030, all of GM’s U.S. plants will run on renewable energy. By 2040, all of GM’s global plants will run on renewable energy.

‘More work to do’

GM also is committed to people, especially improving inclusion and diversity in its workplace, Parker said.

For 2019, 31. per cent of GM’s U.S. workforce self-reported as Black, Asian, Latino or American Indian.

GM’s report said women hold 32.2 per cent of GM’s top management positions within two levels of the CEO, and it is the only major U.S. company with both a female CEO and CFO.

For the year, GM hired 18,311 people globally, of that 6,768 were women.

In early June, Barra penned a letter to employees amid the race protests announcing she was commissioning and would chair an Inclusion Advisory Board made up of internal and external leaders, effective by the end of the quarter. Its goal is to inspire GM to be “the most inclusive company in the world.”

“We’ve been recognized on the work we’ve done on inclusion and diversity but we realize we have more work to do,” Parker said. “We’re optimistic that our voice along with the voice of others can make changes in this area.”",GM offers up revealing new details of future electric cars,4,0.6889082362934618
576,"“Not by bread alone.”

This biblical aphorism came to mind when my editors suggested that during these challenging times, I should concentrate on more affordable “cars for the masses.”

Ah, but who doesn’t enjoy a bit of candy now and then?

As Robert Browning said (aren’t we literary today?): “A man’s reach should exceed his grasp, or what’s a heaven for?”

Hence, the Lamborghini Huracán EVO. Starts at $305,691 for the coupé, $336,258 for the Spyder.

With a boatload of options — the “Grigio Artis” (i.e., grey) paint alone was $22,400 — my tester came to $384,991.

EVO is distinguished from other Huracáns by improved active aerodynamics and more carbon fibre, in the largely aluminum tub, and throughout the interior. This and other “lightweighting” techniques carve off 40 kilograms.

It’s very fast.

It’s very loud.

Both thanks to the mid-mounted naturally-aspirated 5.2-litre V-10, with 640 horsepower at 8,000 r.p.m., and 443 lb.-ft. of torque at 6,500 r.p.m.

Climbing in requires a bit of agility, and it may take a while to find a comfy seating position.

The seats are a nice balance of grip and comfort. My right thigh got a bit stiff after a few hours; might have something to do with being pressed to the firewall...

New for Huracán is a central touchscreen. Their website claims “traditional buttons become dematerialized,” as if that’s something to be proud of. When you are rocketing off into hyperspace, the last thing you want is to be fiddling with a touchscreen trying to turn off the radio.

Then again, the car is so loud it’s difficult to hear the radio or your phone anyway. Better to focus on your driving.

This screen also picks up fingerprints more readily than most, and you can’t set it to “daytime” brightness when the headlights are on.

Which of course they always should be.

So, let’s drive.

Hint — best spend a bit of time in this car before trying anything too dramatic. The technology makes the car so forgiving that you can get in way over your head right quickly.

Because the laws of physics always apply.

Flip the aircraft-style switch cover, press the button, and the beast roars to life.

Pull back the gear-selector release, tap a steering wheel paddle shifter for the seven-speed dual-clutch gearbox — there is no shift lever as such — and off we go.

The Lamborghini Dinamica Veicolo Integrata (for the linguistically-challenged, that’s Integrated Vehicle Dynamics) system somehow anticipates the driver’s intentions and adjusts the front-to-rear four-wheel drive torque split, four-wheel steering, torque vectoring, and traction control systems to get you around corners faster than you’d think possible.

That said, I did get a bit of front-end plowing on a local roundabout at a fairly modest speed, probably because during my late-spring test drive, the car was still sporting winter tires, having just been shipped in from Alberta.

You can select from three drive modes — Strada (street), Sport (duh...), Corsa (race) — by a switch in the six-o’clock steering wheel spoke. This is altogether too handy; you can inadvertently hit it if you’re busy at the wheel.

These settings change all those performance parameters to suit, and there’s a more noticeable delta in these settings than usual in such systems.

The dashboard display also changes to supply information relevant to that mode.

Corsa is a bit frenetic for anything but the track. (My helmet is packed and ready to go at a moment’s notice, Lamborghini...).

What’s missing is a “custom” setting; personally, I’d choose Sport for everything, but back off the transmission downshift sensitivity a notch.

The ALA (Aerodinamica Lamborghini Attiva, active Lamborghini aerodynamics) system opens and closes flaps at the front and rear to increase or decrease downforce as needed.

It can even open one side and close the other, to optimize the car’s handling in more-or-less real time.

One of the first controls you want/need to access in any Lamborghini is the front-end lift system. When exiting a garage or entering a gas station, pressing this switch lifts the front end by 40 mm to reduce the chances of scraping any of those expensive under-car bits.

Any Lamborghini guarantees a thrill-packed ride.

But the Huracán EVO might be my favourite from the stable of the fighting bull (Lamborghini’s traditional symbol).

While not as ultimately powerful as an Aventador, Huracán’s lighter weight makes it seem more agile, more accessible.

I’d probably opt for the Spyder. Hey — it’s a nice day as I type, and since I’m already dreaming...

577,"When Dr. Laura (my daughter the veterinarian...) starts looking for a car of her own, she’s got her eye on the Subaru Impreza.

Subaru was and still is a leader in four-wheel-drive technology. As a vet, you never know when you might have to venture into a muddy field to attend to a sick horse.

Impreza also offers one of the diminishing number of four-door hatchbacks (Subaru calls it a “five-door,” but if you don’t go in and out of it, it’s not a door).

Next to a station wagon, this is the most intelligent automotive configuration. Lots of room to carry medical gear, or an ailing puppy to the clinic.

Lower to the ground than an SUV, hence safer; lighter, hence better to drive and more fuel-efficient.

So, Dad approves.

We had a pair of Scooby Imprezas on test recently, at nearly opposite ends of that car’s wide product spectrum.

First, a hatch (starts at $20,995; mine was a “Sport-tech with Eyesight,” $31,695 as tested), then a WRX sedan ($29,995; “Sport-tech RS” $39,695).

Sadly, by far the best combination — a WRX hatchback — is not offered. This is your fault, Subaru buyers — if you wanted it, they’d offer it.

The two cars share general architecture, a flat four-cylinder engine which has been a Scooby trademark for almost ever, and a full-time four-wheel-drive system which remains one of the most sophisticated in the business, automatically delivering torque to whichever wheels can best use it.

This is a far more important safety feature than all the nanny systems — lane departure warning, pre-collision braking, etc., which abound here as well.

Like VW Beetles of old, the flat-four engine has a characteristic exhaust note. It is inherently balanced, but the exhaust pulses deliver that unique sound.

The clear, bright dashboard offers big, readable gauges.

A large central screen has the usual options of SatNav, dozens of configurations, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, plus Subaru’s own STARLINK, which I never did figure out how to work.

A second screen in the middle of the base of the windshield is also reconfigurable to provide information you need or want at a glance, without the irritating distraction of a head-up display.

There’s the usual host of controls on the steering wheel spokes — sound system, snooze-and-cruise, various other functions — which as always will take time to get used to.

There’s the should-be-mandatory steering-wheel heater. Not needed during my test, but this weather won’t last.

All in a matte black finish, to reduce reflections in the windshield.

Storage spaces everywhere, some with textured surfaces to keep things from sliding around too much.

Surprising amount of room inside for a “compact” car, and lots of luggage space too, augmentable by split-folding rear seats.

The hatch model is obviously roomier, more practical. Why would anyone not want this model?

Impreza barely passes the mirror adjustment test for the driver’s side — depending on how you adjust your seat, you should be just able crank it out far enough to eliminate the blind spot.

It does pass the lights-off test — shut off the car, the headlights go off, as they should. No need for another annoying buzzer.

The sunroof seems short by today’s standards, but few people use them anyway.

Now, on to the differences between models.

Clearly, performance.

The base car with 152 horsepower at 6,000 and 145 lb.-ft. of torque at 4,000 works well with the continuously variable transmission (CVT), because the engine stays closer to its fairly high peak torque r.p.m. figure.

Yet at common highway speeds it’s still turning less than two grand, so it’s reasonably quiet.

There is a bit of “motorboating” — the engine revs don’t always line up with road speed — but that’s how these things work.

Not too sure why a CVT would have steering-wheel paddle shifters, but they’re there if you want to play around.

Much of my test drive was on windy days, so the fair amount of wind noise may not be characteristic.

The car is firmly suspended, but I found it comfortable enough, and nicely “pointable” in the twisty bits. Subaru may not be rallying anymore, but the heritage shines through.

Speaking of rallying, on to the WRX.

You know this car is different before you even get inside — those bright red brake calipers from the Italian Brembo company are a dead giveaway.

Inside, “carbon-look” door trim (by “look,” I assume they mean “fake”), and Recaro front seats with red piping promise an interesting drive.

Speaking of interesting, Dr. Laura and Lady Leadfoot both complained about the comfort of the Recaros. They said their heads were pushed too far forward.

Turns out the headrest angle can be adjusted. Simply shove the headrest forward one, two or three clicks to get the angle you want. One more click and it goes back to the base setting, which we all preferred.

As usual, these seats offer excellent support and comfort, provided you aren’t too broad of beam, which none of us are.

Ahem.

With 268 horsepower at 5,600 r.p.m. and 258 lb.-ft. of torque from 2,000 to 5,200 r.p.m., the WRX doesn’t lack for pace.

Kind of odd on hard acceleration, though, that the power delivery isn’t perfectly linear. Nothing massive, just minor fluctuations in the acceleration curve.

The gearbox is light and precise, although on startup, the clutch requires some finesse to avoid stalling.

The rally-tuned suspension and those lovely big brakes mean you can lean on this car even harder, and it keeps asking for more.

The four-wheel-drive system really comes into its own when you do so. I detected a bit of understeer — front-end plowing — in tight corners, but backing off a touch brings the nose back in, and off you go.

Subarus seem well-suited to the Canadian driving experience. To paraphrase an old country song, “they were four-wheel drive when four-wheel drive wasn’t cool.”

Dr. Laura hopes to be singing that song soon.",Subaru continues to deliver sophisticated four-wheel drive,0,0.2077083307298535
579,"SHANGHAI, CHINA -- Tesla founder Elon Musk says that the world's recently crowned most valuable auto company could achieve a fully autonomous car by the end of 2020.

Musk, who has made premature predictions about the advent of completely autonomous cars before, offered the updated timetable in a pre-recorded message to a Shanghai tech fair.

""I'm extremely confident that 'Level 5', or essentially complete autonomy, will happen, and I think will happen very quickly,"" Musk said.

""I remain confident that we will have the basic functionality... complete this year.""

In years past, Musk had said Tesla may develop the technology for a completely autonomous vehicle by 2018, and then last year he said it may come by early 2020.

The California-based electric carmaker became the world's most valuable auto manufacturer earlier this month and its shares have soared this year thanks to strong output figures despite disruptions from the coronavirus epidemic.

The complexity and autonomy of self-driving car technology is classified up to ""Level 5"". Lower levels feature some combination of autonomous decision-making by the vehicle, along with as-needed human intervention.

But Level 5 denotes a car that requires no human intervention at any time, allowing the passenger to sleep or watch a movie while the car handles all navigation as well as adjustments to avoid collisions.

Tesla already enables partial autonomy for its cars, but analysts say the road to full autonomy faces considerable legal and regulatory hurdles, not to mention getting consumers to feel comfortable entrusting their cars with full control.

580,"It's been 25 years since the last Ford Bronco was made. Ford is bringing the brand back, with the unveiling of three new off-road-oriented SUVs under the Bronco name.

At an online event Monday night, Ford introduced the 2021 Bronco, which will come in a two- and a four-door version, and the smaller Bronco Sport. The new Broncos are engineered for hard off-road driving and include features designed to make it easier to get far from civilization and even stay there for a while.

The Bronco, which will come in a two- and a four-door version, and the smaller Bronco Sport will compete directly with Fiat Chrysler's Jeep line of off-road vehicles. The market for rugged SUVs, which Jeep currently dominates, is growing twice as fast as SUVs overall, Ford executives have said.

The larger Broncos will be available with 35-inch off-road tires and will be able to drive through water nearly 3 feet, 10 inches deep. It has independent front suspension, unlike its main competitor, the Jeep Wrangler. Independent suspension, used on almost all modern passenger vehicles, generally provides a smoother ride and better on-road handling than a single solid axle. It still has a solid axle in the back though, like most pickup trucks, a design suited to hard use.

Like the Wrangler, both the two- and four-door Bronco will have a removable roof s and doors. Buyers will be able to choose either a hard roof that can be removed in sections, a cloth top, or both. Unlike the Wrangler, though, the Bronco's doors will fit inside the vehicle after being removed.

The Bronco will be available with a choice of either a 10-speed automatic or seven-speed manual transmission. (The manual transmission will have six gears for ordinary driving, plus a seventh for low speed off-road driving.) It will be powered by either a 270-horsepower 2.3-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine or a 310-horsepower 2.7-liter turbocharged V6.

While all of the new Bronco SUVs are designed for hard off-road use, the Bronco Sport isn't quite as hard-core in its capabilities. It also has more convenience features than the more truck-like Bronco. While it's based on engineering that's similar to car-like crossover SUVs, Ford says that it's still intended for serious off-road use. Ford engineers boasted of the off-road testing the prototypes have been put through, including driving through deep sand, up steep inclines and crawling across boulder-strewn trails.

The Bronco Sport, available only as a four-door SUV, does not offer a removable roof. Instead of competing directly with the Jeep Wrangler, it's aimed more squarely at the Jeep Cherokee Trailhawk. It has a number of features intended to make it an ideal camping vehicle, like standard cargo-carrying roof rails designed to hold a rooftop tent. The rear liftgate has strong spotlights to illuminate the area around the back of the vehicle at night, and a cargo organizer tray in the back can slide out to be used as a table. The back portion of the roof is raised higher than the front, allowing enough room to store two bicycles upright with their front wheels removed.

Inside, there are zippered pockets on the backs of the front seats, as well cloth straps for hanging gear. There are also storage compartments under the back seats.

The Bronco Sport has independent suspension in both the front and back, like most vehicles intended for street driving, however it wil also be able to drive through almost two feet of water, according to Ford. It will have 28.5-inch off-road tires as standard equipment, but special First Edition models will have 29-inch tires with deeper off-road treads.

Buyers will be able to choose from either a 181-horsepower 1.5 liter turbocharged 3-cylinder engine or a 2.0-liter 245-horsepower 4-cylinder engine. Both engines will come with an eight-speed automatic transmission. In some versions, drivers will be able to select gears using steering wheel paddles.

All of the new Bronco models will have selectable driving modes for various terrain. They're called GOAT modes, for ""goes over any type of terrain."" (GOAT was Ford's code name for the original Bronco while it was under development in the early 1960s.) Modes include Normal, Slippery, Mud/Ruts and Rock Crawl.

There's also Trail Control, a sort of cruise control for off-road driving. With this feature, the SUV can move along at a set low speed while the driver can concentrate on just steering the vehicle rather than dealing with the gas and brakes. These sorts of features are available on a number of other off-road SUVs.

Both the Bronco and the Bronco Sport have blocky square-cornered designs that clearly draw from their 1960s predecessors. The shape also provides a real benefit in off-road driving, Ford designers explained. Drivers can easily see the peaks of the front fenders to know where their wheels are, something that's important to know when driving between boulders or around a steep drop-off, a design element that goes back to classic off-road vehicles ranging from the original Land Rover and Mercedes-Benz G-Class as well as classic Broncos. Additionally, an available camera system can provide a front bumper view of the terrain just ahead.

The Bronco Sport will be available later this year. The full-size Bronco won't be available until next spring, but Ford is taking US$100 deposits immediately for both the Bronco and the Bronco Sport. Prices for the Bronco Sport will start at $26,660. Prices for the two-door Bronco will start at about $28,500 and $33,200 for the four-door. Ford has not yet announced pricing for the four-door Bronco or the Bronco Sport.","After 25 years, the Ford Bronco is back",0,0.07488477751012912
582,"VANCOUVER -- New cars sales have rebounded across Canada following a dismal spring, but dealers and buyers are now faced with limited inventory.

“We went off a cliff in April to be quite blunt,” said Blair Qualey, president and CEO of the New Car Dealers Association of BC. “COVID-19 came marching in and everything shut down very quickly.”

But buyers who have their hearts set on certain models may have to wait a long time to get behind the wheel. Pickups, SUVs and crossovers in particular are in short supply.

CTV News spoke to several salespeople who told us many popular models may not be available for several months.

“It’s not going to be as easy as perhaps just walking in and saying, ‘I want that one,' because there may not be a ‘that one’ on the lot, and they may have to actually order one,” warned Qualey.

Factories all over the world were shut-down due to COVID-19, and many are just up and running now.

How long it will take for inventory to get back to normal depends on the model and brand. It may also depend on how efficiently car-manufacturing countries can contain the spread of COVID-19

“You’re sort of digging yourself out of a hole,” said Qualey. “Add that to pent-up demand and it’s going to be a little while.”

“There are so many moving part to the construction of a vehicle. The supply chains are in many cases global, so you may be fine in North America, but you’re getting airbags from one place, and other parts from another place.”

Qualey admits lower supply could lead to higher prices, but dealers will want to move merchandise and will be keen to offer good deals and buying plans.",Buyers may have to wait months for new car due to COVID-19,0,0.5231977675764631
583,"Upon its debut in 2019 for the 2020 model year, the Kia Telluride decisively captured the top spot in Edmunds' three-row midsize SUV rankings and pushed aside more established rivals. One of those was the Toyota Highlander.

But now Toyota is countering with its fully redesigned 2020 Highlander, which starts the model's fourth generation. The new Highlander has more cargo capacity, a nicer interior and new technology features. But is it enough to unseat the Kia Telluride?

COMFORT AND REFINEMENT

Both SUVs seat up to eight passengers or seven people if you opt for the available second-row captain's chairs. Go this route and you get second-row seats that are almost as comfortable as the front seats.

The big difference in this category comes down to third-row seating. The Telluride's third-row seat has more comfortable padding and a higher seat cushion height. In the Highlander, the rearmost passengers -- particularly if they are adults -- will feel cramped in comparison.

As for interior design, Edmunds experts find the Telluride's dashboard more cohesive-looking than the Highlander's. Both have easy-to-use controls; it's just that the Telluride is a little more stylish going about it. The materials quality feels slightly better in the Telluride, with a higher-grade leather and more consistent craftsmanship.

Winner: Telluride

CARGO SPACE

The Telluride can hold up to 21 cubic feet behind its third row, while the Highlander is limited to 16 cubic feet. That's enough of a difference to allow you to fit the equivalent of a couple extra carry-on suitcases in the Telluride. The advantage swaps if you fold those third-row seats down; the Toyota can hold 48.4 cubic feet to the Kia's 46 cubic feet. The maximum cargo capacity with the second and third rows stowed leans back in favour of the Telluride's 87 cubic feet to the Highlander's 84.3 cubic feet.

Winner: Telluride

THE DRIVING EXPERIENCE

The Kia Telluride and Toyota Highlander are essentially neck and neck in regard to performance specifications. Both have a standard V6 engine that provides about 290 horsepower, and both offer optional all-wheel drive. In Edmunds' testing, these SUVs accelerated from 0 to 60 mph in 7.5 seconds, which is an average time for this class of vehicle. Around town, however, the Highlander feels a little quicker to respond from when you put your foot on the accelerator to when the vehicle begins to move.

Braking power is also similar, though the Telluride needed about 10 fewer feet to perform a maximum-braking stop from 60 mph. Both SUVs are surprisingly capable on a winding road and give you confidence in their handling abilities. Overall, the majority of drivers will find both SUVs equally easy and pleasurable to drive.

Winner: Tie

VALUE PROPOSITION

The 2020 Kia Telluride and Toyota Highlander are similarly equipped in their base trim levels, though the Kia's US$33,060 starting price (including destination) is $2,660 less than the Toyota's $35,720. The Telluride's price advantage increases as you progress through higher-trimmed models.

Comparable trim levels for the Telluride also typically comes with an extra feature or two that might not become available until a next-step-up Highlander. For example, the Telluride's base LX trim starts you out with simulated leather upholstery. To get the same feature in the Highlander -- instead of cloth -- you have to move up to the midgrade XLE.

As for fuel economy, the EPA estimates the front-wheel-drive Telluride gets 23 mpg in combined city/highway driving; the front-drive Highlander gets 24 mpg. Toyota also produces a Highlander Hybrid estimated to get 36 mpg. Kia doesn't currently offer a hybrid version of the Telluride.

Toyota's reputation for reliability is often an enticement for car shoppers, though real-world longevity is affected by many external influences. Kia, for its part, offers a more generous warranty to potentially ease your mind. You get five years or 60,000 miles of bumper-to-bumper coverage compared to Toyota's more typical three years and 36,000 miles. Kia's powertrain warranty is longer too. You do save a bit of money for maintenance on the Highlander, however. Toyota also includes the first two years of scheduled maintenance for free.

Winner: Telluride

EDMUNDS SAYS: The 2020 redesign of the Toyota Highlander represents a marked improvement over its predecessor. Its greatest liability is its limited third-row seat space, but it's otherwise a strong choice in its class. Overall, however, the Telluride is a comprehensively better SUV at a more accessible price.

585,"FRANKFURT -- The coronavirus has cancelled business plans all over the world but Europe's push into electric cars isn't one of them. Sales of battery-powered and hybrid cars have held up better than the overall market amid a deeply painful recession, mainly thanks to the action of governments.

The 27-country European Union is moving ahead with a major shift in transportation as part of the bloc's efforts against climate change. Under regulatory pressure carmakers are rolling out a slew of new electric models so they can meet tougher limits on greenhouse gases that come into full force next year.

Battery-only models are becoming more affordable, especially as sales are supported by substantial government subsidies. As sales of internal combustion cars have fallen, demand for battery-only cars and hybrids that combine electric motors with conventional engines has been stable or even increased, recent statistics show. By contrast, electric car adoption is moving more slowly in the U.S. due to regulatory uncertainty.

The market share of battery and hybrid vehicles rose sharply across major European markets during the first half of the year, even as the outbreak closed showrooms in March and April. Germany saw an increase to 8.4% from 3.4% a year earlier as overall sales of all car types slumped 35%. France saw the plug-in share jump to 9% from 2.5%. Sweden saw a surge to 25%, from 10%.

One of the pandemic car buyers was Frank Schendel, a dentist from a small town outside the Bavarian city of Augsburg. In May he bought a battery-powered Hyundai Kona Elektro, a compact SUV-style hatchback. He had rented a Tesla on vacation for a couple of days.

""My son is getting his driver's license at the moment, and a Tesla is bit too expensive and too fast, so I was glad to discover the Hyundai Kona,"" he said.

He hasn't driven his 10-year-old Mercedes E-Class station wagon since. ""It's fun, fast and quiet, technologically up to date,"" said Schendel, 52. ""We drive the Kona everywhere: 500 kilometres to visit grandma, grocery shopping. We do every trip with the Kona.""

The 64 kilowatt-hour battery has a range of up to 484 kilometres, enough to reach grandma with just one stop at a highway charging station.

Electric car buyers are attracted by large government incentives. Under the German government's latest stimulus package, for example, an electric car with a price tag under 40,000 euros is eligible for a 9,000-euro incentive, 3,000 euros of that to be paid by the manufacturer.

Car buyers now have 70 different battery and hybrid models to choose from, with prices starting below 20,000 euros including those local subsidies in the case of the Seat Mii, the Renault Twingo ZE, and the Skoda CITIGOe IV. Volkswagen says it will start delivering its ID.3 battery hatchback by year end, starting under 30,000 euros.

""The demand is growing fast, very fast,"" said Juergen Sangl, an auto dealer in the town of Landsberg am Lech who sold Schendel his Kona. Sangl decided in 2016 to anticipate the trend and focus on electrics, which are 90% of his business. ""It has gone the way I suspected it would - first a trickle, now a flood,"" he said. Beyond the incentives, customers find electrics more attractive once range exceeds 300 kilometres (186 miles) on a charge.

The pandemic has nonetheless caused huge pain for carmakers. Daimler AG, maker of Mercedes-Benz luxury cars, says it will intensify cost-cutting efforts. ""Our previous efficiency goals covered the upcoming transformation, but not a global recession,"" said Daimler CEO Ola Kallenius.

Automakers in the EU need to reduce the average emissions of their fleets to 95 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometre driven starting next year. That's equivalent to 57.4 miles per gallon of gasoline.

To achieve that, manufacturers will have to lift electric sales from 7% to 12% of the market, according to advocacy group Transport & Environment. The new limit is part of the EU effort to comply with the 2015 Paris climate accord to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, blamed by scientists for global warming and accompanying climate change.

The U.S., with cheap gasoline and a federal government that wants to roll back fuel economy requirements, is lagging the rest of the world in electric vehicle sales and launches. But since automakers have to develop vehicles to sell globally, and some companies see electric cars as the future, the U.S. is starting to get more models. General Motors CEO Mary Barra has promised an ""all-electric future,"" with the company developing 20 electric models to sell globally by 2023.

President Donald Trump wants to roll back automotive fuel economy requirements enacted when Barack Obama was president. But the rollback has been challenged in court and it's uncertain which standards automakers will have to meet. If Trump loses the election in November, it's possible that Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic candidate, could reimpose the Obama-era standards.

Last year, automakers sold 236,000 fully electric vehicles in the U.S., only 1.3% of the 17.3 million new vehicles that were purchased.

In China, a reduction in subsidies led to a slowdown in electric sales late last year, but the government is moving ahead with its requirement for more low-emission vehicles over the long term. Electrics were 4.9% of the market.

Saul Lopez, e-mobility manager at Transport & Environment, said that European automakers appear on track to meet the C02 goals. He noted, however, that carmakers often seem eager to sell enough cars to meet the requirement, but not much more. Some electrics have sold out.

The reason: ""The carmakers make poor margins on electric vehicles, and good margins on SUVs,"" he said: ""At the end of the day, it's a compliance-driven market.""

586,"TOKYO -- Nissan unveiled an electric crossover vehicle Wednesday, the Japanese automaker's first major all-new model since getting embroiled in the scandal surrounding its former chairman, Carlos Ghosn.

At its global premiere in Yokohama, Japan, the new vehicle, ""Ariya"" was billed as ""a new chapter for Nissan."" The event was held online because of the coronavirus pandemic.

""I can tell you this is a no-compromise car,"" Nissan Chief Executive Makoto Uchida said, stressing the Ariya symbolizes the company turning a new leaf in its business, culture and products.

""You have to drive it to feel it,"" said Uchida.

The Ariya is set to go on sale in Japan by the middle of next year, and in Europe, North America and China by the end of 2021.

It will cost about 5 million yen (US$46,000) and will be competing against the Tesla Model Y, which now sells for between $43,690 and $53,690 in the U.S., including incentives and other cost-savings of $6,300. In the U.S., the Ariya will qualify for a $7,500 federal tax credit.

The Ariya comes with autonomous driving, so it will park itself and brake on imminent collisions, connect to the net and offer concierge-like services. It also boasts features associated with electric cars, such as quick acceleration and a roomy interior.

The crossover blends the muscle drive of a sport-utility vehicle with the comforts of a regular car and is one category that's selling well even as the pandemic slams auto demand around the world.

Crossover vehicles have accounted for more than 40 per cent of recent U.S. auto sales.

Koji Endo, an auto analyst at SBI Securities, said the big test still lies ahead, because buyers are looking for various features, such as driving performance, resale value and how easy the vehicle will be to recharge.

""But it's clear this is Nissan's chance to patch up its totally devastated brand image,"" Endo said in a telephone interview.

He believes Tesla fans tend to be so loyal the Ariya won't lure them away, but it might appeal to new buyers.

""Expectations can't be higher for Nissan. If it can't pull this one through, it's in pretty serious trouble,"" Endo said.

Nissan's profits have tumbled, sinking into a 671.2 billion yen, or $6.2 billion, loss for the fiscal year that ended in March, its first red ink in 11 years.

The Ariya is that one bright spot in recent Nissan news dominated by the dramatic saga of Ghosn's run-in with the law and his escape last year to Lebanon.

Chief Operating Officer Ashwani Gupta called it ""a catalyst for change"" at Nissan.

More people see charging a car as everyday, like charging a mobile phone, and so range is becoming less of a concern, he told reporters.

The Ariya's driving range on a single charge will be between 430 kilometres (267 miles) and 610 kms (379 miles), depending on the type of battery and whether the model has a two-wheel or four-wheel drive.

Going electric is becoming increasingly attractive as people become increasingly worried about global warming, the environment and sustainability. Electric cars can get subsidies from various governments, including China and the U.S., the two biggest markets, as well as European nations like Norway.

Uncertainty remains over how Nissan will fare without Ghosn, who spear-headed its move into electric cars while leading the automaker for nearly two decades.

Ghosn was arrested in Tokyo in late 2018 and charged with under-reporting future compensation and breach of trust. Ghosn says he is innocent, arguing the charges were concocted to drive him out of Nissan leadership. Japanese authorities are now trying to get the U.S. to extradite two Americans suspected of helping him escape while he was out on bail.","Nissan rolls out new electric crossover, aims to boost image",0,0.16855360788759777
588,"PARIS, FRANCE -- Airborne microplastics from traffic pollution may be entering the world's oceans at a similar rate to that from rivers, according to new research Tuesday warning that the particles may also speed up Arctic ice melt.

As global plastic production continues to surge, the study is the first attempt at quantifying how much plastic from road vehicle tyres and brake pads is dispersed and deposited by air currents.

Microplastics -- tiny particles produced when larger plastic chunks break down as well as microfibres from clothes and other materials -- have been found atop some of Earth's highest glaciers and at the bottom of its deepest trenches.

Researchers in Norway and Austria took data on how much microplastic is produced by road transport and combined them with simulations of where they might be transported on wind currents.

They found that around a third of all road microplastic -- roughly 50,000 tonnes -- end up in the world's oceans every year.

The estimated range of 40,000-100,000 tonnes of aerial microplastic compares with the 65,000 tonnes deposited into the ocean from rivers annually.

""Atmospheric transport -- a source that is underestimated or not even considered -- has the same impact on microplastic pollution in the ocean as riverine transport,"" Nikolaos Evangeliou, from the Norwegian Institute for Air Research and lead study author, told AFP.

He said that microplastics were already having an impact on human and animal health as they are able to absorb organic compounds and toxic heavy metals, which are then ingested and enter the food chain.

Most road traffic plastic emissions are produced in vehicle-heavy regions such as North America, Northern Europe and South East Asia.

LONG-TERM MENACE

Evangeliou and his team found that when they simulated where these emissions were transported by global weather patterns, a significant amount was likely ending up in the Arctic.

Given the plastic particles' dark colour, which absorbs more of the Sun's heat, they said the pollution could affect the rate of ice melt there.

""Such small particles may act as light-absorbing impurities when deposited on snow and ice surfaces decreasing surface (heat reflection) and accelerating melting,"" Evangeliou said.

With several countries promising to end production of gas and diesel vehicles in the coming decades, the paper published in Nature Communications suggested that road plastic emissions would continue to pose a growing environmental threat as tires and brakes would likely be the same even on electric models.

""Road microplastics environmental impact as they are derived by materials made from fossil fuels such as ethylene and propylene,"" said Evangeliou.

""Thus, the larger need for plastics result in larger emissions of greenhouse gases.""",Road traffic microplastics flooding world's oceans: study,4,0.713436998399841

If that’s the case, you’ve traditionally gravitated towards one of the many V8s — from the base GT to the top-dog Shelby GT500 — that power the FoMoCo pony car. Despite some dressing up, Ford’s V6 was always a weedy little thing, and if you even mentioned a turbocharged four-banger — be it from the early 1980s Mustang Cobra abomination, to the more recent 2.3L Mustang EcoBoost — you would’ve been laughed out of the (gearhead) club. Four were simply four too few, when it came to Mustang pistons.

Not anymore. Ford has essentially taken the rorty 2.3L it twisted into the Focus RS and plunked it where ordinary used to reside. Oh, it doesn’t have quite as much horsepower as the souped-up Focus — 330 horsepower in the Mustang, versus 350 in the Focus RS — but the torques are in fact identical, at 350 lb.-ft. of torque. The whole shootin’ match is mated to a quick-shifting 10-speed automatic transmission, making the little four-pot Mustang sprint to 100 km/h in the mid four-second range. That, for the record, is only about half a tick behind a standard V8-powered GT, pretty darned impressive for a motor that started its life as a sop to fuel economy and emissions.

It also plays the part. Throttle response is vivid, the ten-speed not-so-slushy slushbox’s close ratios always keeping the turbo on the boil. Forward thrust is surprising considering, again, there are four pistons on hand and the Mustang weighs a not-so-svelte 1,655 kilograms. It even sounds the part, the High Performance package making all sorts of deliciously, thoroughly illicit sounds when Johnny Law isn’t around. It’s no V8, but it’s loud, brash, and commanding.

Perhaps actually a little too loud, brash, and commanding. My only complaint regarding this Mustang’s powertrain is that at poodling speeds — when Johnny Law is around — the High Performance package makes it not nearly as sonorous. Yes, it’s aurally enticing when you’ve got your foot in it, but when you’re just trundling along in Sport+ mode, it sounds like one of those infernal slammed Civics with the requisite fart can exhaust. And if you quiet it down with Normal, it sounds like a wimpy Accord.

Engine aside, what makes this new High Performance version of the 2.3L Mustang even more intriguing is that Ford didn’t just tweak the engine, but also seriously upgraded its handling credentials as well. Primary among these changes — and standard equipment when you order the hi-po engine — are a stiffer front springs and a thicker rear anti-sway bar, married to stickier Pirelli rubber and all reinforced by heavy-duty strut towers. Throw in the fact that the little turbo-four weighs almost 75 kilos less than the V8 — all of it up front — and the Mustang High Performance package’s steering is actually better than the GT’s.

Things get seriously interesting when you order the EcoBoost Handling package, which beefs up the Mustang with an even stiffer rear sway bar, electronically-controlled Magne-Ride dampers, and even stickier Pirelli PZero 265/40ZR19 performance rubber, not to mention a 3.55 Torsen limited-slip differential. So endowed, the Mustang four is a sweet ride, its turn-in sharp, body roll minimal, and grip prodigious. Indeed, combined with the eager engine, this is the first four-cylinder domestic pony car that lives up to its sporty image. In fact, I will commit further sacrilege and state, for the record, that I prefer driving the 2.3L Mustang with the High Performance package to the V8-powered GT, booming exhaust not at all withstanding.

That said, there’s a fly in the ointment. The base cost of the 2.3L-powered Mustang EcoBoost “Premium” was $37,365. Float $6,500 for the High Performance package, $1,750 for the 10-speed automatic, a further $2,600 for the Handling package, and then various and sundry other options, and the darned thing cost — wait for it — $52,615 as-tested. That might be a tough sell when the V8 Bullitt costs but $6,000 more. Those thinking of opting for the base EcoBoosted ‘Stang to save some bucks, know that the upgraded engine, 10-speed automatic, and Handling package make this car. Together, they add up to $10,850, so there’s now cheap way to get this big-bang four.

You more of a Chevy guy, anyway. I’m not going to get into the whole loyal-fraternity-of-Ford versus the cultish-clique-of-Chevrolet thing. Nor am I going to bother with the relative merits of topline-V8-versus-topline-V8 versions. But I can tell you that in the competition of four-cylinder moxie, Ford has Chevy covered.

I will commit blasphemy by saying I do like the Camaro’s styling more than the Mustang’s, but in pretty much every other regard, the Blue Oval stomps the Bowtie. The 2.0L Camaro’s 275 horsepower and 295 lb.-ft. of torque simply isn’t in the same league, nor does it sound — at least, when you’re on gas — as fruity. The 1LE package on the four-cylinder Camaro at least gets Brembo brakes, better suspension bits, and stickier 20-inch rubber; it might stick with the Ford in the corners, but it’ll definitely be playing second-fiddle on the straights. The Chevy, though, is cheaper, the last one we tested more than $10,000 less expensive that the fully optioned 2.3L Mustang.

You love the looks of the Challenger. I can’t blame you for that. Of these three homages to pony cars past, the Dodge is by far the more fetching.

Unfortunately, that’s about it. Oh, if you opt for the Hellcat, the acceleration will for sure be unworldly, the ability to smoke tire and create sonic boom unparalleled. But that’s about it for attractions. By the time you get down to the base V6 versions, there’s none of the hellfire of the supercharged V8 and all that you’re left with is a sports car that wants to be a sedan. It’s heavier than its competition, more softly sprung, and not particularly precise about steering. Love the looks of the Challenger all you want, but know that either of the above four-bangers will smoke it on a twisty road, the High Performance ‘Stang also showing the V6 Challenger its taillights in a straight line.

You need eight (Ford) pistons. Well, then you need the GT, the most recent — and most fetching — being the Bullitt. Mustang V8s are very much a known entity, so if you’re reading this, you know that you get booming bass, decent thrust and surprisingly competent handling. It still feels very much American, but it can hang with many a continental coupe. Complain all you want that it only has 20 more horsepower than the regular GT, but come on, is that green paint job cool or what?

The Bullitt’s main problem is the same as the 2.3L HP’s — price. At $58,500, it’s a steep climb from the GT, there just not being enough of a technical upgrade versus the base V8 to warrant the whopping price tag. That said, the 2.3 High Performance’s MSRP, with all the goodies to make it at least semi-competitive, is also a stretch. I suspect that, of these two, the allure of anything Steve McQueen would tilt things in favour of the Bullitt.

Of course, the base Mustang GT, at $40,790, is much cheaper than both. I’m not sure it’s the better car than the HP’ed 2.3L, however.

592,"Like a lot of kids, Frank Stephenson started sketching when he was about five, growing up in his birthplace, Casablanca, Morocco.

“I remember my mother shoving me out of the house to get some fresh air, but all I wanted to do was draw,” he reminisced during an hour-long phone chat we shared, socially distanced by the several thousand kilometres between his office in London, England, and mine in Milton.

When he was 11 and living in Istanbul, he was walking through town with his dad. They came across a Ferrari Dino. “I stood there for 15 minutes, staring at that car. Dad finally had to lead me away, tears in my eyes.”

That’s when he decided he wanted to sketch only cars.

He’s been doing it ever since, in the process becoming one of the giants of the car design world.

Following high school and six years travelling around the world racing motorcycles (he still takes his bike out, but only on nice days), he decided to give car design a shot.

He applied and was accepted into the ArtCenter College of Design in Pasadena, Calif.

“Just getting in there is tough,” he says. “If you graduate, you’re pretty much set for life. The school prepares you very well for the rigours of product design.”

Thirty students started the four-year program with him. Only six graduated.

His fellow alumni included Grant Larson, who designed the first Porsche Boxster, and Ken Okuyama, who did the Ferrari Enzo.

Heady company.

“When I was halfway through the program, Ford offered to pay for my schooling, which I was happy to accept. When I graduated, I started with them in their European design studio in Cologne, Germany.”

One of his first projects was the Ford Escort RS Cosworth. The development of the three-level rear spoiler on the car, subsequently reduced to two, is the subject of one of his YouTube videos. Don’t miss it.

He subsequently worked for a number of companies, including BMW (where he did the X5 SUV, for which I guess I have to forgive him), Ferrari (FXX), Maserati (MC12) and McLaren (P1).

Unlike a lot of car-star designers, Frank also worked on “people’s cars.” The new MINI and the Fiat 500, the reimagining of two of the most iconic cars of the 20th century, both came about under his direction.

I first met Frank at the Paris Auto Show in 2000, where the featured unveiling was that new MINI.

He still bristles about how some commentators at the time viewed this car.

“I was really peed off ...” — about as close to swearing as he gets — “when people said it was a ‘retro’ design.

“Of the 15 designs that were proposed for the car,” he recalls, “some looked nothing at all like the original.

“I didn’t want to copy the old one, but didn’t want to throw away all aspects of it either. You need some sort of a family feeling, a link to the heritage, like the way we relate to our parents and grandparents.”

He talks about the “Golden Ratio,” the number 1.618, also known as “Phi.” This ratio is found in nature and in classic architecture such as the Parthenon in Athens.

He points out that great music also follows that ratio. Beethoven figured it out, and he was so deaf he thought he was a painter.

Not surprisingly then, this number is also found in the length-to-height ratio of the Minis, both old and new.

At last year’s “MINI Invasion,” a celebration of the original’s 60th anniversary, I had the rare opportunity to see both cars side by side. Not until then did I really notice how tiny the original was.

But I also could see certain features — wheels at the corners, short overhangs, “floating” roof and, most of all, those “golden ratio” proportions, which show the family resemblance Frank was seeking.

I can’t draw a straight line with a ruler, so I am always amazed how designers can toss a few lines on a piece of paper and BAM — there’s a car.

He has an idea for a book called “The Three Lines,” where he would take some of the iconic car designs of history and show how you can express them with just three strokes of a pencil.

“If you can draw a car in three lines, you pretty much have a good design,” he says. “The cars that don’t last have lines going all over the place. There’s too much going on.

“Some modern designs seem intended to shock, and they will age badly,” he believes.

One common concern about car design these days is that cars are all designed in a wind tunnel in search of better aerodynamics, hence, better fuel consumption. Won’t they all start looking even more alike than they already do?

Frank points out that what looks “aero” isn’t necessarily “aero.”

“We actually have more freedom now w/r/t aerodynamics than we did before,” he says. “Advances in computational fluid dynamics give us the opportunity to prove that a car that looks aerodynamic might not necessarily be so.

“New approaches to air flow give stylists more freedom than we thought we had.”

He also looks towards the animal kingdom for inspiration.

“Form doesn’t follow function,” he says, turning a design cliche on its head.

“Form IS function. I strive for natural shapes that don’t shock you, but are timeless.”

He likes the term “bio-mimicry.” Millions of years of evolution must have taught us something.

“The cheetah’s design has evolved to let it run fast. That’s how it survives. That’s the true test.”

He makes what sounds like quite a leap when he starts talking about warplanes.

“They are designed for one thing. They do it well.”

To him, that’s successful design.

Aviation is clearly another of this polymath’s interests. He has been working with a company which is developing a battery-powered aircraft that features VTOL — Vertical Takeoff and Landing.

Not much grass grows under Frank Stephenson’s feet.

He thinks a lot about how to stimulate creativity in children. Proportion seems to be innate in creative people, and everybody seems to have it when they are young. Does formal schooling turn that tap off?

“Kids are curious!” he marvels. “Somehow, we switch it off.”

Educators, take heed.

Frank Stephenson’s influence on car design is perhaps best reflected in a current web-based voting scheme, organized by whom, I have no idea. It purports to name the top car designer of all time.

From a list of 64 nominees which includes such as Harley Earl of General Motors who pretty much invented car design as a profession, Nuccio Bertone of the styling house that bears his name, and Peter Schreyer who brought European design ethic to Korea, Stephenson has reached “The Final Four.”

And, he is the only non-Italian in that quartet, the others being Giorgetto Giugiaro, Battista (Pinin) Farina and Leonardo Fioravanti.

Again, heady company.

I have no idea when or how the ultimate winner will be chosen.

If it were Frank Stephenson, I for one would not argue.",Artist takes inspiration from the ‘Golden Ratio’,1,0.23211387837349717
594,"AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND—Whatever good you have heard about New Zealand, it’s all true.

In fact, it’s understated.

Civilized.

Friendly people.

Gorgeous scenery.

And some fabulous roads on which to test a car, which Lady Leadfoot and I recently did.

Last week, we told you about the Kiwi Nissan Qashqai we drove.

Today, more about the roads and the driving culture here.

Each of the North and South Islands is worth more than the two weeks we had in total, so a brief summary will have to suffice.

We did the South Island by train.

But this is a car column, so North Island it is.

We started in Auckland, the country’s largest city. It must be beautiful beneath all the hoarding; it’s being torn to shreds in preparation for next year’s defence of the country’s America’s Cup yachting victory in 2017.

Lots of detours and road closures, so rather than drive, we walked everywhere.

New Zealand is basically a bunch of mostly dormant volcanoes, so it is very hilly. My “thunder thighs” soon turned to jelly.

Time to hit the road.

We spent much of our trip following the country’s main north-south highway, Highway 1.

Our Qashqai had SatNav — “Doris of the Dashboard” to use my Motoring TV cohort Graeme Fletcher’s classic phrase.

Back home, our SatNav would say, “Make a left turn, and follow 401.”

Here, they put the definite article in front of the road number, so it would say “Make a left turn left, and follow the 401.”

This SatNav added a twist. “Doris” would phrase an instruction in her charming accent, but with a slight hesitation: “Make a left ‘turn’ and follow ... The One ...”

Made it sound like a religious experience.

If you know anything about New Zealand at all, you might guess that its No. 1 industry is raising sheep.

No shortage of them, although recently, raising cattle has become increasingly important.

Based on our trip, my guess would be: manufacturing orange plastic traffic pylons, “30 km/h” speed limit signs for the construction zones, and the “TEMPORARY” signs that invariably accompany them.

To their credit, New Zealand drivers generally follow these strictures.

It is late summer here, so the old Canadian joke applies — there are two seasons, “winter” and “road construction” — so we saw lots of those signs.

New Zealand keeps its roads in pretty good condition, although given its latitude (Auckland’s is about the same “south” as San Francisco’s is “north”) they don’t have a lot of snow or frost heaves to worry about.

As noted last week, even their newly paved roads aren’t baby-bum smooth. As in England, they put some texture into the surface, presumably to provide more grip when the road is wet.

Given that you’re never much farther than 100 kilometres from the ocean, the weather can be changeable.

Instead of “If you don’t like the weather, wait 20 minutes,” they say, “If you don’t like the weather, look behind you.”

On most days, the forecast indicated a chance of rain. But weather people everywhere always say that, because if they’re wrong, everybody’s still happy.

Except farmers and forest firefighters.

Whatever, we had excellent weather for most of our stay.

Police presence on the roads wasn’t oppressive, although we did see a couple of cars pulled over, presumably for speeding.

There are occasional yahoos, usually in pickup trucks, driving with no concern for fellow road users.

But overall, their driving culture is like the rest of the country — again, civilized.

“Utes” are quite popular here. The car/pickup truck hybrids originated in Australia when a woman wrote to the head of Ford Australia in the early 1930s, saying their family needed something to take the pigs to market on Saturday and the family to church on Sunday, but could only afford one vehicle.

Some of you may remember such vehicles as the Chevrolet El Camino and Ford Ranchero? They’d be “utes.”

From Auckland, we headed north in the direction of “Ninety Mile Beach.”

Yes, New Zealand does use the metric system. So what’s with the “Mile” in that name?

The beach in fact is about 90 kilometres long. Sorry, I don’t have an answer for that ...

At first, we had planned to drive all the way to the top, to Mile 1. Then we figured, each mile of beach is pretty much the same as every other mile. Or kilometre.

It was still summer, but too chilly for a swim, so we turned back south, yes, following (dramatic pause ...) “ ... The One ...”

At Kaitaia, we veered west toward the Tasman Sea, then south on Highway 12 (Doris: “follow ... The Twelve ...”) so we could see the “Tane Mahuta,” which is a giant kauri tree, an endangered species in its native land.

It is some 45 metres tall, and is estimated to be between 1,500 and 2,500 years old. Breathtaking to be in the presence of a living thing that old.

The tree was “discovered” (meaning, “stumbled upon by people of European descent”) in 1928 while “ ... The Twelve ...” was being built.

This road had the most optimistic speed limit I can recall. Extremely twisty two-laner, narrow to non-existent shoulders, tough sight lines.

100 km/h? Yikes.

Maybe this is why New Zealand has produced on a per capita basis a surprisingly large number of remarkable race car drivers over the years, such as Bruce McLaren, Denny Hulme, Chris Amon and, more recently, Brendon Hartley.

We don’t have many three-lane roads in Canada anymore, but they’re popular here. Two lanes uphill, one lane downhill. Plenty of warning when they’re coming up, to discourage dicey passing.

But they make the same mistake most Canadian provinces do. They add a lane on the right for passing (they drive on the left, remember), which is as it should be.

However, when they shrink the road back to a single lane, they take away the driving lane forcing people to merge right.

That’s just stupid.

How can the “driving” lane ever disappear?

They should just swap their warning signs for ours and we’d both be correct.

Continuing southeast to Rotorua, the centre of both Maori culture and volcanic activity, with geysers spouting regularly.

We were tourists, so excuse us for taking in the tourist sights, such as a traditional Maori cultural performance and dinner, and the glow worm caves — millions of the little creatures, winking away at us.

They also have an exhibit for the kiwi, the universal symbol of New Zealand. These nocturnal flightless birds are extremely shy and hard to see even in captivity. Some patience on our part led to eventual success, but photography is not allowed, so you’ll have to take my word for it.

Down to Wellington, our detour to the South Island, then back north to Napier on the Atlantic (eastern) coast.

By this time, the effects of the “corona” virus, as it was still being called, were starting to take effect.

New Zealand’s rate of infection is still one of the lowest in the world, but hotel rooms and dinner reservations became easier to get as people were cancelling travel plans.

Our final touristy stop was Coromandel, which again was much quieter than usual.

The road to this town looks fine on the map. But the last 40 kilometres took about an hour and a half to cover.

Lady Leadfoot did her best not to gasp every time we came to a corner.

We were heading north and her seat was on the “ocean” side.

The road is narrow.

It was dark.

There were big trucks.

No guard rails for most of it.

The fact that I am writing this means we survived.

And we are still married.

The return trip the next day was even scarier. Not just because I was now on the “ocean” side, but because in broad daylight, I could see how narrow the road was.

And how big those trucks were.

By the time we got to Auckland, the airport was restricted to just passengers. Ours turned out to be the second-last Air Canada flight to leave the country.

Darn. Another month or two here could have worked.

So “Kia Ore,” a Maori expression which seems to cover everything from “HI!” to “Have a nice day.”

If you ever get the chance to go to New Zealand, take it.

597,"Grandiose pronouncements from Elon Musk are no longer exactly shocking. From his original mission statement — “we will not stop until every car on the road is electric” — to his curious decision to build flamethrowers, we are used to hearing Tesla’s CEO put his mouth where he hopes his company will follow.

Nonetheless, his recent proclamation that Tesla’s Autopilot system will be ready for full Level 5 autonomy by the end of this year came as a great surprise to all the experts — and, by all, I mean pretty much everyone else in the entire automotive industry — who think 2025, or even 2030, is the very earliest we might see full automotive autonomy.

Now, there’s no absolutely no doubt that Tesla is a leader — if not the leader — in self-driving software. Oh, Waymo’s autonomous system may be more effective than Autopilot, but it employs far more complex sensor arrays (various forms of LIDAR and more radar sensors) than Tesla’s comparatively crude camera-based system. Were there an award for simplest self-driving systems — doing the most with the least, if you will — Tesla would win hands down.

Nonetheless, the industry’s skepticism has less to do with Tesla’s hardware than exactly what Mr. Musk means by Level 5 autonomy. Theoretically, the answer to that is straightforward: the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which sets the standards for six levels of self-driving, defines Level 0 as complete human control while Level 5, the top echelon, means your robotic car can go anywhere at any time, in any weather or road condition.

And therein lies the rub. There are plenty of semi-autonomous Level 2 cars that can drive themselves under certain conditions (General Motors’ Super Cruise and Tesla’s Autopilot being the leaders). A few Level 4 vehicles — notably Waymo — can drive themselves without supervision, but only on specific roads. In other words, their complete autonomy is rigidly geo-fenced.

The problem is that Level 5 really does imply Mr. Musk’s Model 3s should soon be able to drive straight from the factory floor in Fremont all the way to Fairbanks, neither rain nor snow nor seemingly unmarked gravel roads keeping Autopilot from its appointed rounds.

Except that’s clearly not possible. Self-driving cars may have proven themselves (semi-) capable of navigating the straight and narrow of Arizona highways, and even a select few suburban California neighbourhoods, but no one has figured out how to completely conquer snow banks, black ice, and the perils of sensor-clogging salt. Hell, in my experience, there’s not a single automaker yet capable of getting one of their comparatively simple radar-based adaptive cruise control systems through a Canadian winter. Simply put, anyone that thinks their Model S is going to drive from downtown Montreal to their cottage north of Mont Tremblant in the middle of a January snowstorm is in for a rude awakening.

And thus we find ourselves once again dealing with Mr. Musk’s penchant for, let’s call them exaggerations, running headlong into what would seem to be some very specific standards. Indeed, his claims to the World Artificial Intelligence Conference (WAIC) in Shanghai that “complete autonomy … will happen very quickly,” then appear to be muddled by him implying that Level 5 autonomy will first be limited to California.

Well, besides the fact that other automakers are continuously expanding their self-driving capabilities to more California roads, there’s the simple fact that, if the next generation of Autopilot is geo-fenced to the Golden State, strictly speaking that’s Level 4 autonomy — not Level 5.

Semantics, you say?

Not quite. Legion are the Tesla owners doing what my dear old dad would call — when I arrived home with yet another dislocated shoulder from yet another motocross crash — “stupid s^%t.” One Tesla acolyte — Forbes’ John Koetsier — recently boasted that Tesla’s self-driving technology is advancing faster than other manufacturers, citing the example of a friend who “drove from Los Angeles to Las Vegas, using a fruit wedged in the steering wheel to simulate a human touch.” Nor is this silliness limited to North America, the BBC recently reporting that a British man had his licence suspended for 18 months because he turned Autopilot on and then climbed into the passenger seat. Musk’s pronouncements even have some ardent fanboys predicting that Tesla’s next over-the-air Autopilot upgrade — as in, later this year — will be the whole Level 5 enchilada.

Now it’s possible, in a fine example of Trumpian obfuscation — that finely honed process whereby the leader of the free world dog whistles exactly what he means to say and then provides himself an out-clause — that Mr. Musk’s contention that Tesla will have the “basic functionality” of Level 5 autonomy is his weasel-clause. After all, Tesla has always taken pains to note the risk-taking daredevilry that has already been attributed to Autopilot — Joshua Brown who centre-punched a transport truck, Walter Huang who rammed into a concrete barrier while reportedly playing a video game, etc. — occurred when the company was (officially) claiming that Autopilot was only semi-autonomous. Nonetheless, the most recent claims make me wonder what manner of mayhem will occur now that Mr. Musk says Level 5 autonomy is within sight.

The most recent claims make me wonder what manner of mayhem will occur now that Mr. Musk says Level 5 autonomy is within sight.

“But,” you might be thinking, “Tesla can’t be held responsible if its owners misuse the company’s cars.”

Actually, they can and already have, a Munich court having recently ruled Tesla had to pull advertising that claimed its cars had the “full potential for autonomous driving.” The tribunal went even farther in stating that just “by using the term ‘Autopilot’ and other wording, the defendant suggests that their vehicles are technically able to drive completely autonomously.” That, again, is when Tesla was officially claiming its cars were but semi-self-autonomous.

But let’s just say for you-know-what-and-giggles, that Tesla can by some miracle put a totally self-driving car in consumers’ hands next year. The question then becomes who will be responsible for any collisions involving a totally self-driving Tesla. Insurance companies will almost certainly balk at bearing responsibility when their client, the car’s owner, might have been asleep in the passenger seat. Will Tesla admit culpability? With Autopilot previously requiring human supervision, who was responsible was fairly easily delineated. With the car completely in charge, who is responsible for its operation becomes far more problematic.

And let’s understand that Teslas, Level 5 or not, will still be involved in collisions. As Motor Mouth recently reported, the U.S. Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) recently predicted that simply computerizing our cars will only reduce accidents by a third. Only by forcing computers into extremely cautious, borderline pedantic driving habits can self-driving get to the zero-fatality future we’ve all been told automotive autonomy promises. Mr. Musk has already posited that some level of danger will still be present, even with Level 5 Teslas. At the very least, crawling along at speeds that would likely make Autopilot safe enough for human use would seem at odds with one of the company’s other main marketing messages — ludicrous acceleration.

Like Mr. Trump’s antics, I think we’ve all become inured to Elon Musk’s bold assertions. It’s part of his management style, a major reason that Tesla is so successful and why he is worshipped by so many. But to claim his cars will be ready for completely driverless operation would seem to move his marketing game from merely audacious to downright reckless. Technology isn’t ready. Our legal and insurance systems aren’t ready.

And, judging by the hare-brained antics of some Tesla owners, consumers definitely aren’t ready for the “basic functionality” of Level 5 autonomy.",Motor Mouth: The truth about Tesla's Autopilot claims,4,0.32964356032052855

What’s best: Fabulous looks; fabulous performance; room for more than one friend.

What’s worst: That stupid shift lever, obviously; a couple of missteps in trim bits, inside and out; ride on the harsh side.

What’s interesting: Mercedes leaves no “model stone’’ unturned.

First thing you have to know about the Mercedes-AMG GT 63 S 4MATIC+ sedan is it bears little structural relationship to the Mercedes-AMG GT Coupé we tested a while back.

Gosh; you don’t think the similarity in the names is a deliberate attempt to fool the customer, do you?

Or the inattentive journalist?

Naw...

Second thing you have to know is this is a brilliant car, which in my view successfully bridges the gap between the all-out performance of its GT Coupé cousin and the E-Class family cars with which it shares some bones.

Third thing: I call this vehicle a sedan for one simple reason — it is a sedan.

What else would you call a car with four doors and four (optionally, five) seats?

Like other German manufacturers, Mercedes thinks that just because it has a sloping roofline and frameless side windows, although it does have a middle roof pillar, they can call this a coupé.

Not in my column. I write in English.

Labels be damned, this is a true AMG product, built at AMG’s facility in Affalterbach, and this body style is not available as a “normal” Mercedes.

My tester was actually a 2019 model, whose base list price was $177,500, and it topped out at $189,500. The 2020 model with a few extra bits of equipment starts at $182,600.

Chances are, your dealer won’t have many (any?) in stock. But you’d probably want to spec yours out anyway — the option list is endless.

The engine is the hottest locally available version of the corporate 4.0-litre twin-turbo V-8, producing 630 horsepower between 5,500 and 6,600 r.p.m., and 664 lb.-ft. of torque between 2,500 and 4,500 r.p.m. The signature of the sole engine assembler is on a plaque on the engine itself.

Interesting to note, this is actually more power than its allegedly more sporting cousin the AMG GT. Tobias Moers, head of AMG, told me at that car’s launch its dual-clutch transmission had a torque limitation the more powerful engine would exceed.

The GT S therefore uses Mercedes’ nine-speed automatic with the multi-plate clutch pack eliminating the sloppy starts that even the best torque-converter automatics can occasionally deliver, mounted up front behind the engine.

Suspension is the “AIRMATIC’’ system, with multi-chamber air springs and AMG’s adaptive dampers.

The “4MATIC+” part of the name means Mercedes’ full-time four-wheel-drive system, which automatically directs torque to whichever wheel can best use it.

The car is gorgeous, from the aggressive grille, slim LED headlights and subtle power bulges on the hood; through the smooth flanks with a subtle character line running the length of the car; to the slim tail lights and massive quad tailpipes and rear diffuser in the tail.

One harsh false note: the “vents” above the car’s nameplates on the sides just ahead of the front doors are fake. Shame.

At least the vents behind the rear wheels are real to allow air under the wheel arches to escape.

I was not initially a fan of matte paint finishes. The paint industry spent a century figuring out how to make cars shiny; now for an extra few grand you can make it look like someone painted it with a broom.

I’m starting to come around, because the “Designo Brilliant Blue Magno” looks terrific on this car. Another $2,500 from your piggy bank.

The interior is equally gorgeous, with real tree-wood (open-pore grey ash; $500), saddle-brown/black Nappa leather upholstery ($1,800) and top-quality materials everywhere, with the exception of the cover of the centre console in the rear seat, which is a cheap-looking bit of plastic. An odd oversight.

There are all sorts of features you will be discovering months after you take delivery.

Such as an interior colour lighting scheme that lets you choose the shade to suit your mood or taste.

And, the dash vents glow red or blue depending on whether warm or cool air is flowing through them.

The seats strike an excellent balance between the comfort required of a Grand Touring car and the lateral support needed for a car that handles this well.

The rear seat (two buckets or the optional three-seat bench) is actually habitable, provided occupants aren’t much taller than six feet. Your view of the outside world will be limited, however; the massive front-seat headrests take up most of the forward aspect, and the rear side windows are small triangles through which you must peek.

The dash and minor controls are a mix of the latest in Mercedes’ interior technology, with a couple of touches from the older-parts bin.

The twin screens on the dash provide a wide range of layouts depending on the selected driving mode. They are bright and readable, although it will take some time to know where every tidbit of information is located.

One of the “throwback” bits is the round knob on the centre console allowing selection of various functions. In some newer Mercedes models, this has been replaced with a touch pad hard enough to figure out when you’re standing still; when you are taking advantage of this car’s prodigious performance, it would be impossible, bordering on hazardous.

Some carmakers, with Mazda taking the lead, are starting to agree with me about this “just-touch-this” concept for the simple reason it is wrong.

Maybe when cars are driving themselves, you’ll have time to figure these things out. But then, why buy a car this much fun to drive yourself?

No Mercedes road test would be complete without my usual beef about the shift knob. Despite the German penchant for intelligence and logic, they continue to have Park selected by pushing a button instead of just shoving the shift lever full-forward.

Not only does this contravene 70-odd years of accepted practice for zero additional functionality, but it might be dangerous because it’s hard to get your finger on the button hidden under the shift knob itself.

Sorry; it’s just stupid.

That said, driving is what this car is all about, and it delivers.

Slam-you-back-into-the-seat levels of acceleration are a mere stab of the loud pedal away. Zero-100 km/h takes a tick over three seconds, at which point the car is barely clearing its throat.

A seamless upshift, and off you go to the red line again.

This auto-box is one of the most clever in the business, seemingly predicting what gear you’re going to need and selecting it for you. If you think you can do a better job (hint: you can’t), you can play with the steering column paddles, or that damnable shift knob.

Throttle response is about as quick as turbocharged engines get, a benefit of those turbos being nestled between the cylinder banks, close to the intake manifolds.

Even when you’re going about 70 or 80 km/h and hammer on the gas on a dry road, you can still get the traction control light to flash.

Fuel crisis? What fuel crisis? Gas is currently 80 cents a litre at my local self-serve...

Handling is outstanding, belying the car’s massive 2,000-kg-plus weight.

The steering is precise and perfectly weighted.

This car has Mercedes’ four-wheel steering — in-phase at higher speeds for more stability, counter-phase at low speeds for more agility. The fact that you absolutely cannot feel it working shows how well worked out it is.

As I mentioned in my review of the AMG GT coupé, Mercedes’ test drivers had the ability to shut this feature off (again, you can’t) and the car handled much better with it activated.

The optional Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tires — same as on my Targa Newfoundland Nissan Juke although these are much bigger — provide astonishing levels of grip. From my personal Targa experience with this tire, they don’t abandon you if it starts to rain.

Several drive mode settings are available via a rotary knob on the steering wheel at about the four-o’clock position. Throttle response, transmission shift speed, ride height, suspension firmness, even the exhaust note, are all altered in fairly predictable ways for the “Comfort,” “Sport” and “Sport+” modes.

“Drift” mode lets you play full-on hooligan if you have an unlimited tire budget.

“Race” mode converts it into a rear-drive car. AMG suggests you limit this setting to track use.

Killjoys; it was not so long ago AMG didn’t build any four-wheel-drive cars because they were deemed insufficiently sporty to bear this hallowed nameplate.

You can also program and store your own preferred settings.

Even with the suspension set to Comfort, ride quality is definitely on the firm side. It’s a small price to pay for the grip.

So, is the Mercedes AMG GT S 4MATIC+ a luxury car? Is it a very fast GT car? Is it a thinly disguised race car?

I’d say yes, yes and yes.

Its closest competitor would be the Porsche Panamera Turbo. One advantage the Porsche offers is the station wagon (Sport Turismo) body style, which is even more capacious than the AMG’s.

But the AMG GT S is more hard-edged, more of a pure driver’s car.

This customer is surely going to own more than one car.

602,"Cars seem pretty straightforward: they start, they stop, and they get us where we want to go.

But if you think about them any longer than that, you may run into a few things about them that can make you say, “Huh? Really?”

We’ve assembled some fun-but-confusing factoids about your favourite mode of transportation.

The more fuel you have, the more fuel you’ll use

The heavier a vehicle is, the more energy it takes to get it moving. A litre of gasoline weighs about 0.75 kg, so if you have a truck with a full 90-litre tank, you’re carrying some 67 kilograms of fuel. That’s like having another passenger along for the ride, and you’re burning some of that fuel just to move that fuel.

Of course, we don’t recommend you drive with just a splash of gas in your tank to save a bit at the pumps. Running out is inconvenient and potentially dangerous, as well as hard on your fuel pump. Even if you have enough to get where you’re going, bad weather or a traffic jam could hold you up and run you dry.

A bigger battery in an EV cuts into the extra range it provides

Once again, more weight takes more energy to move. To put more range into an electric vehicle, manufacturers will add a bigger battery — which adds more weight, which chews up some of that extra range it provides.

In addition to improving battery technologies to make them lighter, automakers use lightweight materials in the vehicle to help offset the battery’s weight. Still, there is a benefit to having some heft: a heavier vehicle builds up more momentum, and when it slows down, it can return more power to the battery through regenerative braking than a lighter car would.

The biggest truck doesn’t always have the highest capacity

You’d think the most massive truck could handle the biggest loads it could find, but that isn’t always the case. That’s because of GCWR — Gross Combined Weight Rating. That’s the maximum weight for the truck, the trailer, and everything in both, including passengers. If two trucks have the same GCWR, but one weighs more due to its configuration or the options it has, that difference has to come off the maximum trailer weight.

Automakers typically advertise the highest maximum capacity, but you’ll often find that’s for a relatively lightweight Regular Cab 4×2 — but the most popular configuration in Canada is the heavier Crew Cab 4×4, and its top pulling power could be up to few hundred pounds less.

A longer drive is better for your vehicle than a short one

You might think very short drives would be better for your car, because fewer kilometres should logically equal less wear-and-tear. But if your engine isn’t getting up to its recommended operating temperature – which it likely won’t on short drives in cold weather – your engine won’t burn off condensation, and fluids won’t do an optimal job of lubricating moving parts, including in the engine, transmission, or differential.

Engines and fluids have improved considerably over the years, so it’s not as much of an issue as it would have been in older cars. But if you only take your car around the block, then every week or two, treat it to a drive of at least half an hour.

The stiffer your vehicle is, the smoother it’ll ride

You might expect a body with a little “give” would soften up the driving experience, but it’s just the opposite. Whenever a vehicle gets a major makeover, automakers crow about how much stiffer the construction is over the last generation, and it’s all about the ride and handling.

If the body’s rigid, it doesn’t flex as much when going over potholes and road imperfections, or if you make a quick manoeuvre with the steering wheel, so you don’t get jolts and vibration. From there, engineers work on the suspension, which can be designed and tuned from a soothing ride for a luxury model; to the kidney-rattling intensity preferred by hard-core sports car fans

A harder seat can be more comfortable than a soft one

You’d think that just like with a sofa, a cushion-y auto seat would be the most comfortable one. It might be at first, but usually doesn’t stay that way for long. You’re sitting upright and constantly moving your head, arms, and legs, and you need support.

Most of the European manufacturers make seats that are almost too firm when you first get in, but they keep you comfortable long after a too-cushy seat has given up even trying to keep your spine straight.

The engine’s speed limiter isn’t for the engine

On the specifications for performance cars, you’ll often see they’re “electronically limited” to a certain speed. It’s not to protect the engine — instead, that’s the highest speed for its tires.

(For engine protection, automakers use a “rev limiter” that restricts the crankshaft’s spinning speed — its rpm, or ‘revolutions per minute.’ And Volvo recently announced it will limit its vehicles to 180 km/h, but it’s doing that in the name of public safety.)

Tires have speed ratings, which indicate the highest speed they can go for a sustained period while holding up the vehicle and everything in it. The ratings are denoted by letters, such as R for 170 km/h; V for 240 km/h; and Y for 300 km/h.

There are some oddities in the taxonomy, the result of tires getting better than anyone thought they could when the charts were first made; that’s why Z is somehow less than Y, and why there’s the weird bracketed ‘(Y)’ for 300 km/h-plus. With the electronic limiter, drivers can’t go over the point where the tire could fail — and that’s definitely something you don’t want to happen.",These 7 paradoxes of the automotive world might just blow your mind,0,0.030534474937409795
605,"What’s Good — Attainable luxury, surprising cargo space, bold exterior styling

What’s Bad — Busy interior styling, puzzling user interface, fun not included

For the most part, becoming an adult sucks. By accepting an ever-growing mountain of responsibility in order to meet both internal and external obligations; mystery, danger and spontaneity disappear.

However, there is an upside. Being a good adult and meeting said responsibilities means you get to wave goodbye to all the discomforts of your 20s. You can afford to treat yourself a little. That second-hand RAV 4 with the check engine light, funny noise, funny smell and not-so-funny late 1990s interior that you drove to your office job every day in your steady and determined grind of achieving a position which paid you a living wage? Time to pass it on to a college kid.

Now it’s time to get yourself a Lexus NX 300.

The NX 300, formally the NX 200t — which made more sense due to its 2.0-litre turbo engine configuration — was renamed in 2018, presumably because ‘300’ sounds like “more.”

While it shares its essential structure and wheelbase with the Toyota RAV 4, Lexus does the styling, suspension, engine and interior — firmly branding this crossover as a “real Lexus” and not just a simple re-badge job. While it isn’t very exciting, it presents its customers with the possibility of a mature, upgraded lifestyle.

Maturity with performance

The NX 300’s 2.0-litre, turbocharged 16-valve, DOHC, VVT-i, four cylinder engine produces 235 hp, which is perfectly sufficient for getting you up parking complex ramps and passing people doing the limit in the fast lane.

Coupled with a 6-Speed ‘Super Electronically Controlled’ (ECT) automatic transmission, cruising on the highway or navigating through city traffic is a buttery smooth experience. Effortless and without drama, acceleration in this car is a peaceful experience. And fuel economy isn’t unreasonable either. I averaged 9.1L/100 km after a healthy mix of city and highway driving through the week.

Bold exterior styling choices with some jarring interior choices

The NX 300’s sharp bodylines, LSD-inspired front end and angular, propeller-like rims are not for everybody. Let’s call these “bold” styling choices. But stop seeing this as a running shoe and start seeing it more as a designer handbag and the styling starts to make sense.

Is it my personal style? Not exactly. I think it looks too posh. Too bourgeois. Too trendy.

But I also think that might be the kind of thing that somebody else adores about it. Its sharp, aggressive, angular bodywork is for the kind of person who would wear a studded leather jacket to a business meeting. And I dig that — and t is pretty fun to look at it.

While it is the littlest crossover SUV in the Lexus line-up (the UX is technically the smallest, but falls more into the “compact SUV” segment), I still managed to get a few large boxes and even a small coffee table in the back that I needed to move out of my apartment. The rear tonneau cover is easy to remove to make way for anything too tall. A trunk net unfolds from a very stylish leather pouch in the rear, preventing your cargo from sliding around and upsetting the nice folks at Lexus who lent you the vehicle for a week.

No bungee cords or having to put something on the roof were required. 1545 litres of cargo capacity offer you a lot of usable cargo space. It’s a convenient vehicle to live with. And again, one of those things that just makes your life a little easier.

In terms of overall comfort, as well as fit and finish, it’s difficult to match a Lexus’ interior. Everything feels and looks of luxury and quality. Lexus’ “NuLuxe” synthetic leather wraps a good portion of the interior, including the shift lever and steering wheel.

Heated seats are standard. So are 8-way power adjustable seats from the driver and front passenger. A tilt and telescopic steering wheel is available on the “Blackline” edition trim or higher.

However, the mixture of materials is a little jarring, every surface is different—a combination of NuLuxe, brushed steel and soft plastic. There’s also a confusing mixture of shapes, from sharp angles to soft, round edges. The whole thing is little incongruent from a design standpoint and I just don’t think it’s as overall attractive or user friendly as anything made by BMW.

That big and chunky steering wheel is a case in point. It looks like a video game controller compared to what BMW or Mercedes are putting out.

Infotainment system avoids the mouse

The NX 300 mercifully does not use the same weird mouse-style cursor for navigating the infotainment system as the Lexus IS models. It’s a more user-friendly touch-pad with some decent haptic feedback built in. A big upgrade, to be sure. But still, you have to wonder, why bother with the touchpad at all?

Infotainment comes through an 8-inch screen and includes much of what you would expect in a modern car including: SiriusXM Satellite Radio, Android Auto compatibility, Bluetooth Capability, USB Audio Input and subscription free service called “Enform” — an app which alert you to Traffic Incidents, and keep you up to date on the weather, sports, stocks and fuel prices.

Solid safety and driving assistance for the road

Safety standards include a lane departure alert with steering assist, road edge detection and a sophisticated pre-collision system with pedestrian and bicycle detection. You’ll also get automatic high beams and full-speed range dynamic radar cruise control for your longer road trips. It’s a lot of handy features to keep you in a straight line, out of the ditch and off somebody else’s rear bumper.

Do all of these features add up to a driving experience that feels demonstrably different than any other modern car within the price range? No. Although I will say Lexus’ steering assist feels like a gentle suggestion compared to Acura, which manifests as an urgent need for the car to rip the steering wheel out of your hands. For that, I am thankful.

The biggest pill to swallow is the price tag on the “Executive Package”. It’s an additional $12,900 on the NX 300’s base price, which brought our as-tested model up to $59,306.

The “Executive Package” buys you a swath of unnecessary things to break later such as vented seats, a heated steering wheel, a rear-cross traffic alert (which is annoying), a heads-up display, a larger 10.3-inch screen and 10 speakers instead of the standard eight. It also comes with a one-year subscription to “Enform Destination Assist”. Apparently, Lexus thinks the GPS in your smartphone doesn’t work and what you really want to do is speak with a representative on the phone about where you’re going.

Starting at $44,150, I think the NX 300 is a really good buy for the person who is done playing everything cheap and cheerful and has finally worked their way into having some of the nicer things in life. But at $60,000, it starts to get outside the budget of the young up-coming professional adult and more into the realm of the “I want to speak to your manager” crowd.

My advice? Treat yourself to the simple, everyday luxury of owning a Lexus NX 300, but save the $13,000 on the ultra-lux bells and whistles.

606,"The first thing you have to do with respect to Kia’s Sportage is decide how to pronounce it.

Americans say “SPOR-tidge.”

Up here, it’s more likely to be “spor-TAHGE,” with the em-PHA-sis on the second syl-LAB-ble.

Also gives a distinctly French slant to it. Not surprising, given how well Kia does in Quebec.

The fourth-generation Sportage debuted three years ago. Fresh styling and added equipment highlight the changes for 2020.

Prices start at $25,795 for the front-wheel drive LX.

Even at that level, you get useful stuff like heated power side-view mirrors, heated front seats, Android Auto/Apple CarPlay, 12-volt outlets front and rear, two-level trunk with hidden storage and a backup camera with guidelines to ease those tricky reverses.

Another two grand gets you “Dynamax,” among the most clever four-wheel drive systems available.

A product of Canada’s own Magna International, Dynamax uses a series of sensors to automatically engage four-wheel drive when it can be helpful; otherwise, it stays in front-wheel drive to save fuel.

For that nasty cottage access road, you can lock the system into 4x4 mode.

The mid-range EX (4x4 only) at $31,695 brings a bunch of typically useless “driving aids” like “lane-keeping assist.”

(Um, how did you get your driver’s licence?)

And, of course, the “dumb key” fob system, which sadly is almost universal now.

More useful are the 10-way power seats and the heated leather-wrapped steering wheel. (Um again, when is our government going to make this mandatory?)

My EX tester listed at $37,995, which included the “Premium” package (the dreaded leather upholstery, pointless blind-spot warning system, the more useful dual-zone automatic air conditioning, and rear cross-traffic alert), and the “Tech” package (heated rear seats and cooled front ones, a lovely Harman/Kardon sound system with SiriusXM satellite radio, and Kia’s UVO telematics system).

Add $200 for the “Modern Bronze” paint job, plus taxes, freight and A/C charge, and this vehicle will run you $40,080. If you think that’s a lot for a compact SUV, you haven’t been following the market.

The range-topper is the SX Turbo 4x4, which starts at $39,995, but I’ll focus on the one I drove.

Sportage is a handsome thing, given that the two-boxes-on-wheels concept doesn’t give designers much leeway.

One knock: the rear turn signals are way too low in the bumper. Given how many people are driving taller vehicles now, these really must be positioned higher.

That bronze paint gives a luxurious look, which continues inside, with good design executed in high-quality materials. The exception would be the matte black plastic panel for radio and HVAC controls, which looks decidedly low-rent.

The main instrument cluster is a paragon of design and legibility. Big round speedo and tach, with smaller gauges for fuel and coolant temperature nestled within.

The “UVO” touchscreen system is integrated cleanly into the dash, rather than appearing to have been glued on as an afterthought.

Many functions are controlled by buttons on the steering column spokes, some of which can only be changed when the car is in “Park.” Occasionally inconvenient; undoubtedly safer.

It will take some time to find out where all the functions are, but that’s true of any modern car. Lots of adjustability in the seat and steering wheel (reach and rake) to find a good driving position.

Lots of room, too, and real adults can fit in the back seat.

The rear seat-back release levers are down on the floor, rather than on the seat backs themselves, as is more common. The seat split-folds in one-third/two-thirds ratio.

As I do in my VW Golf wagon, I removed the rear-seat headrests when no one was riding back there, to improve rearward visibility.

Lots of cubby bins and cupholders throughout, for real-world driving. An open bin ahead of the shift lever handles miscellaneous debris and includes a USB outlet.

A touch of a button gives you the choice of three drive modes. “ECO” dampens throttle response and isn’t as quick to downshift on light throttle application to maximize economy.

“Sport” gives you the most spirited drive, and the seat side bolsters tighten up a little to give you added lateral support, rare indeed at this price point.

“Normal” splits the difference.

I’d need a month with this vehicle to determine if there is any measurable difference in fuel consumption using these different modes.

My guess: probably not.

The 2.4-litre four-cylinder engine (181 horsepower at 6,000 r.p.m.; 175 lb.-ft. of torque at 4,000 r.p.m.) gives decent performance. But its most remarkable characteristic is how quiet it is — not something you’d usually say about a large-displacement four-banger.

Some credit must go to the sound-deadening “acoustic” glass in the windshield.

The six-speed automatic transmission is properly transparent in operation, shifting seamlessly as needed.

The manual shift feature is backwards, as it is in so many cars. It must be back to upshift, forward to downshift. If I have to tell you why again, you shouldn’t be using it anyway.

Hard to know how much of the Sportage’s nimble handling is down to the trick four-wheel drive system, but it’s a delight, simply going where you point it. Some credit must also go to the Michelin Primacy tires, same ones I have on our Golf.

The steering is accurate and confidence-inspiring.

In sum, the Kia Sportage is a very capable vehicle, and seems to have all the stuff this market wants.

The challenge for Kia is getting people to consider it. This is one of the biggest segments in the Canadian marketplace, with maybe a dozen worthy contenders.

If sprightly handling and high-end features are at the top of your shopping list, Kia’s Sportage is worth a look, no matter how you pronounce it.

Pros: Sharp looks, inside and out; nimble handling; sophisticated four-wheel drive system.

Cons: Rear-turn signal lamps must be repositioned; one measly trim bit on the dashboard takes away from the high-class ambience; manual shift pattern just plain wrong.

609,"If you had “presenting documentation to enter an Atlantic province” on your 2020 bingo card, then go ahead and break out your brightest dabber. The four Atlantic provinces recently agreed to permit each other’s residents to move freely across their boundaries without needing to self-isolate for two weeks. The only requirements? A couple of pieces of ID and, depending on the point of entry, enough paperwork to keep the region’s pulp and paper mills humming for weeks.

The latter is an exaggeration, of course, but only slightly. We hit the road bright and early from central Nova Scotia in a 2020 Toyota Sienna, headed for the land of Jean Coutu pharmacies and St-Hubert restaurants (a.k.a. New Brunswick). Unlike countless trips in the past, however, the visit actually started 24 hours prior with a visit to the New Brunswick government’s website, where we could download and complete the appropriate self-declaration form, which asked questions ranging from travel habits to phone numbers.

Firing up one of the last V-6 Sienna vans likely ever to be built (the model switches to an all-hybrid platform in 2021) while most of the province was still slumbering off Canada Day festivities proved to be a good idea, as the line of cars waiting to cross the checkpoint comprised just five vehicles, a marked difference from opening day, when the queue of idling cars turned the Trans-Canada Highway into a parking lot (or the Don Valley Parkway at 5 p.m., depending on your life’s experiences).

Cones and temporary barriers lined the road like frosting on a cake, funnelling commercial tractor-trailers to the right and passenger cars to the left. Three masked officers were on hand, standing outside the type of temporary tents one might see at a garden party or wedding. No one offered to toss the garter. What they did offer was to either take my pre-completed form or, as was happening with most cars, fill one out on the spot. Since the majority of travellers were opting for the latter, the massive lineups seen earlier in the week are easily explained.

A quick flash of two pieces of government ID and we were on our way to the Confederation Bridge. Like most good Nova Scotia tourists, we visited New Brunswick only to get to P.E.I. Nevertheless, it was a straight shot on Route 16 to the bridge, where we were greeted by digital signs straight out of a post-apocalyptic contagion movie, informing of the next checkpoint some 14 kilometres distant.

Message to the nation’s sign writers: surely there is some room for a bit of humanity in these warning signs. Yes, the pandemic needs to be taken very seriously, but the sight of overhead gantries bearing words and images that could very easily have been taken from the pages of a Stephen King novel does nothing to lower anyone’s blood pressure. Some will say I’m being overly dramatic and they’re likely correct. However, the country needs humanity and normalcy now more than ever.

In any event, the Confederation Bridge, for those who’ve never been, deposits its drivers in a broad patch of pavement on the red shores of The Gentle Island. Here, no fewer than five lanes of traffic-coned checkpoints awaited us and the Sienna. It’s worth noting that, as of this writing, P.E.I. asks those arriving in the province to complete a mandatory self-declaration for ahead of time, answering questions about your health the planned length of your stay.

Clicking “submit” on this form generated a Very Official confirmation number, one which was requested of us by a stern but maskless border agent who then asked for two pieces of identification. My medical card was rejected as it had expired a month prior and I had neglected to populate my wallet with the new one. This, despite it being accepted with no trouble at the New Brunswick boundary just 30 minutes prior. A digital pay stub bearing my home address was a sufficient substitute.

Touring the island was a pleasant as ever, with warm weather and whip-straight roads being the order of the day. Still, we were mindful of the ongoing pandemic, limiting our time outside the van and staying away from usual tourist spots like the Cavendish boardwalk. Still, we juiced the island economy with a purchase of P.E.I. handpies (bacon and cheddar, of course) and hot drinks at a local coffee shop. Masks and gloves abounded at both places, by the way.

When we headed back to the mainland, an attendant at the Confederation Bridge presented us with an Interac machine taped to the end of a hockey stick so we could pay the one-way bridge toll. If only we were wearing plaid and had the foresight to cue up Rush or the Tragically Hip.

Tucked in one of the Sienna’s many storage cubbies was another completed form for entering New Brunswick, prepared the night prior in an effort to save time. When we approached bridge’s end, it was easy to see the enormous line up of traffic snaking along the access road that cuts along the shore and under the bridge itself, a strip of tarmac generally used to access the tourist information centre. Today, it was being used to funnel cars into the new checkpoint.

Interestingly, as we began to follow the detour, an official began diverting traffic back onto the highway and into New Brunswick, bypassing the checkpoint altogether. We may have offered a muttered invocation to the traffic gods, or whatever deity to which you bow, for not having to wait an hour or more in the checkpoint lineup. However, it must be noted that we — and several other cars — passed into the province freely and without scrutiny.

It was a similar experience returning to Nova Scotia (yes, we passed through New Brunswick again without stopping — mon dieu!), where socially distant but mask-free agents only asked that I hold my Nova Scotia driver’s licence aloft for scrutiny before sending us on our way. Five hours made quite a difference in traffic volume compared to our 8 a.m. visit, however, with vehicles lined up for about 1.5 kilometres on each side of the Nova Scotia-New Brunswick boundary.

So what did we learn? Well, the Toyota Sienna ran the gamut without complaint, offering up plenty of space and comfort for our merry band of Bubblers. Whether one chooses to ante up for this 2020 model or wait for 2021 is largely a decision between pay now and pay later. With the new hybrid-only van on the horizon, Toyota stores may be willing to cut a deal on existing inventory. However, its more efficient replacement will likely blow our observed fuel economy of 10.0L/100km right out of the water.

As for the Atlantic bubble, a new spate of infections has since cropped up on P.E.I., proving that viruses don’t care very much about borders. These cases have been linked back to a visitor from outside the bubble who failed to self-isolate after arriving. If you’re choosing to travel this summer, be sure to take along masks and a bottle of hand sanitizer. A good dose of common sense, and common courtesy, will go a long way in providing a safe environment for everyone.

But an Interac machine taped to a hockey stick? Even I didn’t have that on my bingo card for 2020.

611,"The man who made N95 masks so effective had been retired for over two years when the pandemic struck. But the inventor didn't think twice about returning to work when health-care workers needed him most.

Peter Tsai, a Taiwanese American scientist who invented the synthetic fabric used to make N95 respirators, which is considered the most effective barriers to prevent the spread of coronavirus, resumed work on sterilizing the masks in March as the coronavirus took hold in the U.S.

He spoke with CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, about resuming his work during the most challenging health crisis of the century.

""I felt I need to -- I need to help the health workers,"" Tsai said in his Wednesday appearance on Gupta's ""Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction"" podcast. ""You know, they put their lives at risk. What I know can help them.""

Tsai patented the technology used to make the masks in 1995.

Here's how it works: To block up to 95% of the particles that come in contact with the mask, Tsai made the filters using the corona electrostatic charging method. Put simply, the mask's filter contains both positive and negative charges. It can attract neutral particles, like bacteria from viruses, and polarize those particles, trapping them before they can pass through the mask.

But when Tsai heard about physicians and nurses who were treating coronavirus patients reusing the masks to prevent supply shortages, he got back to work.

Tsai dug in at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville's Research Foundation, working up to 20 hours a day to test new ways to sterilize the masks.

He tried a variety of methods: He left the masks out in the sun, put them in the oven, washed them with soap and steamed them, he said.

The best method, he found, was keeping the masks in 160-degree dry heat for 30 minutes, which can be feasibly done by hanging them in an oven.

But that's not his preferred method, he told Gupta: He recommends buying seven N95 masks and rotating them, using a new one each day. After using one mask, he hangs it in an isolated spot and doesn't use it again for seven days, so any bacteria it catches become inactive.

N95 respirators are the most effective face covering, but the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns against the public purchasing and wearing them. They're fitted to fit physicians' faces and can often become uncomfortable when worn for long periods of time, and if the public buys them up, healthcare workers could face a severe shortage of them.

But people should absolutely wear masks in public, even if they're not N95 respirators, Tsai told Gupta.

""Some people said, 'I don't care. I do not need to wear a mask,'"" he said. ""That is very selfish because you expose your germs to other people. So any mask is good.""",He invented the N95 mask filter. When coronavirus hit he was called to help once again,8,0.16562952750215765
617,"TORONTO -- Toronto will be making it mandatory to wear face masks while inside enclosed public spaces starting on Tuesday.

The motion was presented to city council last week—with the support of Toronto Mayor John Tory and Medical Officer of Health Dr. Eileen de Villa—in an effort to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 as more businesses start to reopen in the city.

Here's what you need to know:

When do you need to wear a mask?

According to the mayor, the masks will be mandatory in all public and enclosed indoor spaces. This means they will be required on public transportation such as the TTC and ferries to the Toronto Islands, as well as inside shops, grocery stores and malls.

Toronto residents will not need to wear masks while at home, eating on a restaurant patio and at most workplaces where physical distancing is possible. It would also not apply to child-care centres.

“It is about public spaces where the general public has free and ready access, to try and limit the risk,” de Villa said.

While not mentioned in the bylaw, health officials have previously said that residents should wear a mask anytime where it is challenging to social distance from others.

What happens if I can’t wear a mask for health reasons?

All health officials and politicians agree that if someone is suffering from a medical condition that makes it difficult to breathe or function while wearing a mask, they should not wear one. They ask that those people try their best to remain physically distanced from others while in public spaces.

Children under the age of two also do not have to wear a mask.

When will the bylaw take effect?

The bylaw will take effect on July 7 and last until the first city council meeting of the fall, which is scheduled for the end of September or early October. At that time, council will either extend the bylaw, amend it or discontinue it.

What does this mean for schools reopening in early September?

Local health officials say the decision about whether or not children or teachers wear masks while in school is up to the provincial government. The Ontario government, in response to the mandatory mask policy, has said that it is actually up to each individual school board to decide on classroom policies.

“Each board right across the province has the flexibility,” Ontario Premier Doug Ford said on Tuesday. “Everyone is going to have different guidelines.”

Will there be a fine for not wearing a mask?

The mayor admitted there would not be “aggressive enforcement” when it comes to the mask policy, but rather his government will focus on education.

“To be candid about it we don’t really have the resources to go around and look at every store and look at every person that is in one of those places,” he said. “We are going to rely on people by and large to get educated and to do the right thing.”

At the same time, Tory said that it is up to every business to have a policy in place to ensure compliance, suggesting a “no shirt, no shoes, no mask, no service” model.

Who else is doing this?

The mayors of Brampton, Mississauga and Caledon also announced on Tuesday they intend to pass similar bylaws requiring masks to be worn inside public spaces.

Brampton Mayor Patrick Brown said the bylaw in his city could be in effect by July 7.

No timeline has been provided for the bylaw in Mississauga or Caledon.

Why is it not mandated provincially?

The Ford government has said they will not be requiring the wearing of masks, but rather will encourage their use. Speaking on Tuesday, the premier said that the needs of regions like Peel and Toronto will be different from those in northern Ontario, which is why he can’t make masks mandatory.

“But each region has the authority to make their own rules,” he said. “I will support them on any decision that they make.”

Why is this policy necessary?

Experts have said that wearing a mask will prevent the wearer from spraying droplets on others, helping curb the transmission of the disease if they are asymptomatic.

De Villa said that requiring masks in indoor settings is essential to preventing the spread of COVID-19, but that compliance will need to be as high as 80 per cent in order to work.

“The reality is that the virus continues to circulate and that we still need to be careful,” she said.

619,"KITCHENER -- Much of the province will move into Stage 3 in the province's recovery plan on Friday, meaning places like gyms, fitness studios, movie theatres and indoor dining areas can reopen.

Now that Waterloo Region has a mandatory face covering bylaw in effect, there may be questions regarding mask guidelines in these settings.

In some, you'll need to wear a mask in specific areas, while others will be exempt.

At a gym or fitness centre, for example, you should wear a mask when you enter the building, in the change room and when heading to workout areas.

When it comes to actually exercising, though, you don't have to wear a mask.

In indoor dining areas at restaurants, you need to wear a mask when you go in and while you're sitting at your table, but you can take it off while you're eating or drinking.

""The intent of the bylaw is to ensure that at any point in time when somebody may be in closer proximity to you that you will have your mask on,"" explains Kris Fletcher with the Region of Waterloo.

""So I would envisage you'd have a waiter who has a mask who would deliver a drink to your table, you could take off your mask while you're drinking that particular drink.""

The Region of Waterloo frequently asked questions page explains that those who are dining on a patio still need to wear their masks when they go inside to use the bathroom.

There are exceptions to who needs to wear a mask, including those who have a medical reason not to.

Someone who is exempt from a mask does not need to show proof, but businesses are able to refuse service to people who are not wearing them based on their own policies.

Face coverings are an extra tool to help slow the spread COVID-19 now that more people will be in places where physical distancing can be harder to maintain.

For the safest experience, masks should be worn and people should do their best to stay six feet away from each other.

Ideally, a mask will fit snugly without gaps over the nose, mouth and chin, and won't impair your vision.

Here are a couple of tips on how to properly wear a mask:

Don't wear a mask made out of plastic

A bandana or scarf can also serve as a face covering

Avoid readjusting the mask while it's on your face

Wash your hands with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds before and after putting on and taking off your mask

Wash your mask after every use

Ensure your mask is clean and dry before you put it back on

For more tips on proper mask wearing, you can visit the Region of Waterloo's face covering page.

If you still have questions, the region says you can call their Service First Call Centre at 519-575-4400.

There have been 1,349 positive cases of COVID-19 in Waterloo Region to date.

Of those, 48 that have been identified are still considered active. More than 80 per cent of cases have recovered, while 118 people have died.

620,"Society’s approach to condom usage since the 1980s can be applied to face masks today, one expert says

Jill McDevitt watched the conversation about face masks evolve over the last couple of months and realized it looked familiar.

This isn’t the first time public health officials have needed to convince people to wear something they didn’t want to wear in an effort to slow the spread of a serious virus, she says.

As a sexologist, McDevitt hopes the lessons from society’s approach to condom usage since the 1980s can be applied to face masks today.

“I was hearing about people getting very angry at others not wearing masks and it reminded me a lot of the conversation with not wanting to wear condoms,” said McDevitt, a San Diego-based sexuality educator, wellness coach and University of Waterloo graduate.

“Health organizations years ago were getting very angry and shame-based with the way they tried to make people use condoms. But we have gotten better at delivering the message in an effective manner over the last 40 years.

“So we’ve already done this work. We’ve already learned these lessons.”

ALSO READ: Should non-medical masks be mandatory in Canada?

McDevitt posted a widely shared list on her Facebook page last week highlighting ways to help convince people to wear face masks.

Among them was avoiding guilt-based methods, like shaming people online when they don’t wear masks in public; making sure face masks are accessible; and educating people on the risks of not wearing them.

But the biggest positive change, McDevitt says, needs to be making sure leaders and public health officials are on the same page with their messaging.

“We’ve all heard: wear the condom, wear the condom. But with masks, at first it was ‘don’t wear a mask,’ and now it’s ‘wear a mask,’ and every place has different policies,” she said.

“But as far as what happens on an individual level, I think normalizing it, learning how to have the tough conversations with people in our lives who don’t want to wear masks — not shaming people. I think those things are in our control.”

Hilary Bergsieker, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Waterloo, agrees that messaging needs to be consistent in order to get people to comply. She said some non-mask wearers in Canada may be dealing with a lack of trust in public officials who stressed early in the pandemic that masks weren’t effective but have since changed their tune.

Some of those people won’t have a choice anymore though. Cities like Toronto and Ottawa have bylaws taking effect Tuesday for face coverings in enclosed public spaces.

Other Canadian cities or provinces have also implemented face-covering rules in various settings. Quebec recently extended its face-mask rule province-wide on all public transit, coming into effect mid-July.

Canada’s public health officials say a non-medical mask or face covering can reduce the spread of a person’s own infectious respiratory droplets. This matches the advice of other health agencies including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization, which say face coverings help reduce the spread of COVID-19 in public settings, especially when physical distancing is not possible to maintain.

Despite the medical advice, Bergsieker says there are numerous reasons why people take issue with mask-wearing mandates.

Social media has shown us plenty of examples, like a video shared on Twitter of a woman screaming at a 7-11 employee in Texas after being asked to wear a mask in the store. Last week a Toronto woman posted a video of herself refusing to wear a mask in a hospital.

“Some of it is ideological. Whenever you tell people to do something you can engender a psychological state called reactance, which is basically this resistance to having freedom curtailed,” Bergsieker said. “As soon as somebody says ‘do this’ that makes you automatically at some level not want to do this.

“That’s particularly true if there are inconveniences and minor costs associated with the behaviour in question.”

Bergsieker says mask-wearing mandates will be effective — especially “if they have teeth” in the form of a fine or citation. People will comply with laws, she added, but that doesn’t mean they’ll be “psychologically convinced” the behaviour is necessary.

Harris Ali, a sociology professor at York University, says changing peoples’ behaviour takes time. But it can be done.

He likened mask-wearing to seatbelts, pointing to initial skepticism from citizens when provinces began enacting those laws too.

“At first everyone was like, ‘Oh, I don’t like this, this feels uncomfortable.’ And now we’re so used to it that we actually feel uncomfortable not wearing the seatbelt,” he said. “So slowly, gradually, there was a transformation in our thoughts.

“Right now it could be that people are feeling uncomfortable wearing masks, but you become more comfortable as it becomes more prevalent and it loses its novelty, and therefore it’s stigma.”

But how do we get to that point?

Ali says one way is in seeing the leaders, politicians and celebrities we respect and admire — “whoever the influential people in the society are” — wearing masks.

Bergsieker agrees role models can be effective in changing peoples’ attitudes. And like McDevitt, she doesn’t believe online shaming to be a strong influencer.

In fact, it can have the opposite effect.

“Online shaming can motivate people only if there’s a sense that the people whose opinion you value are going to see what you’ve done and disapprove,” Bergsieker said. “So if people who are refusing to wear masks think that their peers, the audience they care about, will actually think they’re being bold or brave or standing up for their principles, then public shaming like that will backfire.”

McDevitt says people need to be honest about the realities of COVID-19 when trying to convince others to wear face masks, but not rely on a fear-based approach.

She recalled a video she was shown in the 1980s that insinuated anyone who had sex would die by contracting HIV.

“We can talk about (COVID) like, ‘hey, this is a deadly virus,’ but when we’re honest about the whole thing, people are more apt to listen,” she said. ”A whole generation of people in the ’80s were told ’you’re gonna get AIDS and die if you have sex,’ and when that didn’t happen they stopped believing anything sex educators said for a while.”

McDevitt also says we need to allow for adaptations for those who can’t wear masks.

Things like face shields might be a suitable solution for an asthmatic, just as those with latex allergies have other options for condoms now.

“Whenever you’re just like: ‘you’re a jerk, wear a mask,’ we’re missing opportunities to have conversations,” she said.

“But of course there is also a flagrant disregard for others that has been common (among) some people who don’t want to wear masks, and that comes from a lack of empathy in a lot of spaces. … So I think the whole conversation is missing a lot of compassion.”

622,"LONDON - Britain and France moved Tuesday to make face coverings compulsory in more places as both countries try to get their economies going while at the same time seeking to prevent further coronavirus outbreaks. Following days of procrastination and mixed messages, British Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the wearing of face coverings will be mandatory in shops and supermarkets in England from July 24. On the other side of the English Channel, amid signs of a slight virus resurgence in France, President Emmanuel Macron said he also wants to require masks inside all indoor public spaces by Aug. 1. Britain and France previously took a more relaxed attitude to face coverings than many other European nations, recommending masks but not requiring them. Germany, Spain, Italy and Greece already require masks to be worn in enclosed spaces. But with their economies reeling after months-long lockdowns, French and U.K. government leaders were anxious to try to persuade people to spend again — hopefully without spreading the virus. Weeks of indecision made way for new rules that came into view virtually overnight. Britain’s Hancock told lawmakers in the House of Commons Tuesday that face covers can help workers and shoppers alike. “In recent weeks, we have reopened retail and footfall is rising,“ he said. “We want to give people more confidence to shop safely and enhance protection for those who work in shops.” People in England already have to wear face coverings on public transport and in hospital settings. Anyone not wearing a face covering in the additional environments outlined by the government could be fined 100 pounds ($125,) and shops can refuse entry to anyone failing to comply. Children under 11 and those with certain disabilities will be exempt. The new requirement only applies to England. The other nations of the U.K. — Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland — can determine their own public health policies, and Scotland already requires masks in shops. Hancock stressed that wearing a face covering complements other accepted strategies aimed at keeping a lid on the pandemic, such as washing hands and abiding by social distancing rules. “We cannot let our progress today lead to complacency tomorrow,” he said. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who in April spent a week in the hospital being treated for COVID-19, began wearing a bright blue mask in public last week. The change in policy followed. In an interview with French television networks marking Bastille Day, France’s Macron said “the best prevention” against the virus is masks, social distancing and hand washing. Recent rave parties in France and widespread backsliding on social distancing — even within Macron’s presidential palace and other government facilities — have raised concern lately, so the government has been weighing tougher mask guidance. “We have signs that (the virus) is picking up a bit,” Macron said, noting that France’s virus reproduction rate is inching past 1 again, meaning each infected person is infecting at least one other. British authorities are hoping the public will comply with the new requirement. London Mayor Sadiq Khan told the BBC he believed that “Londoners by and large will follow the rules,” without too much need for the police. “The problem is not the issue of enforcement, the problem is the mixed messages and the confused communications,’’ Khan said. British Environment Secretary George Eustice also did not rule out the possibility that mandatory face coverings would become compulsory in offices and other workplaces in the future. He told the BBC that the government was taking “one step at a time and we’ve taken the view in this next step that we should make it mandatory in retail environments.” A growing body of evidence suggests wearing face coverings brings some benefit in preventing the spread of the virus. “Lack of strong evidence of their effectiveness should not be considered a problem but the evidence is accumulating that they have a part to play in reducing transmission and also in protecting the wearer,“ said Keith Neal, an epidemiologist at the University of Nottingham. ___ Angela Charlton in Paris contributed to this report.","UK, France move to extend rules on face coverings in public",5,0.36108976833344886
624,"PARIS - Medics in white coats replaced uniformed soldiers as stars of France’s Bastille Day ceremonies Tuesday, as the usual grandiose military parade in Paris was recalibrated to honour medics who died fighting COVID-19, supermarket cashiers, postal workers and other heroes of the pandemic. Yet for thousands of participants in a protest across town, the national homage wasn’t nearly enough to make up for missteps by French President Emmanuel Macron and his government before and during the coronavirus pandemic. Riot police sprayed tear gas and unruly demonstrators hurled smoke bombs as the largely peaceful demonstrators marched to Bastille plaza, where the French Revolution was born on July 14, 1789. The contrasting scenes marked a Bastille Day like any other, overshadowed by fears of resurgent infections in a country where more than 30,000 people have already lost their lives to the coronavirus. With tears in their eyes or smiles on their faces, medical workers stood silently as lengthy applause in their honour rang out over the Place de la Concorde in central Paris from Macron, the head of the World Health Organization and 2,000 other guests. A military choir sang the Marseillaise national anthem, and troops unfurled an enormous French tricolour flag across the plaza. The battle against the virus was the main focus, as Macron sought to highlight France’s successes in combating its worst crisis since World War II. Mirage and Rafale fighter jets painted the sky with blue-white-and-red smoke, and were joined by helicopters that had transported COVID-19 patients in distress. The guests included nurses, doctors, supermarket and nursing home workers, mask makers, lab technicians, undertakers and others who kept France going during its strict nationwide lockdown. Families of medical workers who died with the virus also had a place in the stands. Medics in jeans or sandals strolled onto the plaza for the climax of the ceremony, and the lengthy military parade was truncated into a smaller affair closed to the public to prevent new virus infections. In eastern Paris, meanwhile, medical workers’ unions marched to decry years of cost cuts that left public hospitals ill-prepared when the virus raced across France. “We are enormously short of personnel,” said protester Sylvie Pecard, a nurse at the Saint-Louis Hospital in Paris who described colleagues falling ill with the virus as COVID-19 patients filled its wards. “It’s because we haven’t recruited nurses. I came here 20 years ago and there were no empty positions. Now all the services are short of personnel, and it’s worse and worse.” Other protesters chanted slogans against police violence, spoke out against racial injustice, or against Macron policies seen as favouring the wealthy, or against his decision to appoint a man accused of rape to oversee French police forces. Some protesters wore yellow vests, representing their movement against economic injustice — or face masks in the same neon yellow shade. Riot police closely surrounded the crowd, and smoke from tear gas and firecrackers swirled around Bastille Plaza after sporadic tensions. Demonstrators sang in support of medical workers, while the Bastille Opera house displayed a huge message of thanks surrounded by portraits of nurses and doctors by street artist JR. In an interview with French television networks, Macron addressed the anger his presidency has unleashed, acknowledging “mistakes” in managing the pandemic and in pushing through business-friendly reforms. “Our country is afraid. There is a crisis of trust,” he said. He noted a new 8-billion-euro investment and hiring plan signed this week for French hospitals, but warned of “massive” unemployment and other economic problems still to come after months of virus lockdown. He announced no significant policy changes for the remaining 22 months of his term. He said masks would be required in indoor public places by Aug. 1, but that schools should resume as usual in September. France has one of the world’s highest virus death tolls, and scientists are warning of a potential resurgence as people abandon social distancing practices, hold dance parties and head off on summer vacations. At the main Bastille Day event, troops sported masks as they got in formation, took them off for the ceremony, then put them on again when it was over. Macron made a point of donning his before speaking to WHO chief Tedros Ghebreyesus. One government member panicked when she realized she forgot hers, but was saved by a colleague with a spare. All around France, towns and cities scaled back holiday festivities to stem virus infections.

627,"HALIFAX -- Residents of long-term care facilities in Nova Scotia will soon be allowed to enjoy visits with more of their loved ones and the resumption of some activities.

The provincial government announced the further easing of COVID-19 restrictions at long-term care homes during a news conference on Friday.

“We know this has been long and difficult months. It has been emotional, stressful and sad because you couldn’t see your loved one. I hope these last few weeks, because you’ve been able to go visit outside, has offered some relief, but I know that wasn’t possible for everyone,” said Premier Stephen McNeil.

“Get yourself ready for that visit and that long-awaited hug.”

The province first eased visitor restrictions in June, allowing residents to have outdoor visits with a maximum of two people.

The changes announced Friday will allow residents to visit with more people outdoors and limited indoor visits.

“COVID-19 has been difficult for all of us, but I think it’s especially true for those who live and work in our long-term care facilities, as well as their loved ones and families,” said Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Robert Strang.

“The restrictions that we implemented four months ago were done to protect the physical health of residents and were necessary. But we know that this isolation has had a toll on the mental and social well-being of residents and their families.”

Long-term care facilities can implement the following changes on July 22:

Up to five people can visit a resident outdoors at a time.

Up to three people can be designated for indoor visits, per resident, but only one person can visit at a time.

Facilities will establish designated locations for visits.

Appointments must be scheduled with the facility.

Visitors must wear a mask at all times during indoor visits.

Visitors may not need to wear a mask during outdoor visits, if they maintain a distance of six feet. But they must wear a mask if they wish to have limited physical contact, such as a hug.

Visitors must wear a mask when they arrive at the facility, where they will first undergo a COVID-19 screening process.

Residents and staff can gather in groups of 10 or less for dining, recreation, or socializing without physical distancing. Groups should remain consistent and visitors cannot join.

Sightseeing bus trips for groups of up to 10 people, including residents, staff and the driver, are allowed. However, residents and staff cannot get off the bus, and the vehicle must be thoroughly cleaned before and after each trip.

Licensed hair salons within long-term care homes can reopen to serve residents only. Hair salons must follow the guidelines set by the Cosmetology Association of Nova Scotia and must submit a safety plan to the facility within which they are located. The plan must include keeping a list of residents who visit the salon.

The province says long-term care homes can decide which changes they will implement.

“With new cases remaining very low we’re comfortable that we can now open visitation more and bring some more normalcy back into the lives of the residents and their families,” said Strang.

“We ask for families to be patient, to work with their facilities that have loved ones living in, and give those facilities time to make the necessary arrangements.”

He also stressed that visitors should cancel their visit if they are feeling unwell.

Adult residential centres and regional rehabilitation centres licensed by the Department of Community Services can also implement indoor visits under the same guidelines.

MASKS ON PUBLIC TRANSIT

The Nova Scotia government also announced Friday that drivers and passengers will be required to wear non-medical masks on public transportation, starting on July 24.

“The evidence on non-medical masks have evolved throughout the pandemic and our public health direction is evolving along with that,” said Strang.

“We certainly are learning that the public wearing non-medical masks is an effective tool in helping prevent the spread of COVID-19 … before a resurgence of COVID-19 happens, we need to make mask-wearing much more of a habit for all Nova Scotians.”

The mandatory mask requirement applies to municipal transit buses and ferries, school buses, community transit vehicles, and private taxis and shuttles.

Masks are not mandatory on buses or other vehicles that transport employees in a work situation, nor are they mandatory on provincial ferries, or ferries that travel between the Atlantic provinces.

Children under the age of two, and people with a valid medical reason for not wearing a mask, are exempt.

“The vast majority of Nova Scotians are able to wear masks … there are very few valid medical reasons to not wear a non-medical mask,” said Strang. “They’re mainly related to anxiety.”

He also noted some people with cognitive or developmental disabilities may not be able to wear a mask.

The provincial government will help public transportation services with supplies of masks for people who can’t bring their own, but passengers are encouraged to use their own masks as much as possible.

Strang also said, while masks will be considered mandatory on public transportation, the province won’t actively enforce the requirement.

MASKS IN HOSPITALS, HEALTH-CARE FACILITIES

Meanwhile, Nova Scotia Health announced Friday that, starting Tuesday, patients and visitors will be required to wear a non-medical mask when entering hospitals and other health-care facilities in the province.

NO NEW CASES OF COVID-19

The province reported no new cases of COVID-19 on Friday, for the second day in a row, despite having tested almost 1,000 people on Wednesday and Thursday.

The QEII Health Sciences Centre's microbiology lab completed 499 Nova Scotia tests on Wednesday and 491 tests on Thursday.

“We’re still testing a significant number of people, because as we continue to reopen the province, it’s important that anyone who has symptoms that could be from COVID-19 get tested and get tested early,” said Strang. “The only way we have to contain the virus is to know it exists and be able to have rapid public health follow-up around those cases.”

The latest case of COVID-19 was identified Tuesday and reported on Wednesday, in the Nova Scotia Health Authority’s central zone.

Strang said the source of the person’s infection remains under investigation.

“So, this is an important reminder to everyone that COVID-19 is still with us and we must all remain vigilant and follow public health measures as part of our new normal,” said Strang.

“We’re living with COVID-19 and we’re in this for the long haul.”

To date, Nova Scotia has 59,124 negative test results.

TWO ACTIVE CASES OF COVID-19

The number of confirmed cases remains at 1,067, though 1,002 cases are considered resolved and 63 people have died, leaving two active cases in the province.

Among the 63 Nova Scotians who died from COVID-19 are 53 residents of the Northwood long-term care home in Halifax.

There are no active cases of COVID-19 in any long-term care facilities and the Northwood outbreak is considered resolved.

There are also no longer any patients in hospital as a result of COVID-19.

“That in itself is an important milestone as well,” said Strang.

The province's confirmed cases range in age from under 10 to over 90.

Sixty-one per cent of cases are female and 39 per cent are male.

There are cases confirmed across the province, but most have been identified in the central zone, which contains the Halifax Regional Municipality.

The provincial government says cumulative cases by zone may change as data is updated in Panorama, the province’s electronic information system.

The numbers reflect where a person lives, and not where their sample was collected.

western zone: 54 cases

central zone: 903 cases

northern zone: 57 cases

eastern zone: 53 cases

The provincial state of emergency has been extended to July 26.

SYMPTOMS AND SELF-ISOLATION

Anyone who tests positive for COVID-19 is required to self-isolate at home, away from the public, for 14 days.

Anyone who travels to Nova Scotia from outside the Atlantic region is also required to self-isolate for 14 days and must fill out a self-declaration form before coming to the province.

Residents of New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador are no longer required to self-isolate when travelling to Nova Scotia, but they must provide proof of their place of residency at provincial borders.

Anyone who experiences one of the following symptoms is encouraged to take an online test to determine if they should call 811 for further assessment:","N.S. to ease visitor restrictions at long-term care homes, make masks mandatory on public transit",5,0.3054958810525106
628,"WINNIPEG -- The City of Winnipeg announced on Friday it is bringing back the 120 transit operators and 41 operators-in-training who were laid off amid the pandemic.

This announcement comes after a steady increase in ridership over the past few weeks, according to the city.

Starting on Aug. 2, transit will be returning to its regular summer schedule. Full weekday service will then resume on Aug. 4.

“We saw passenger levels drop to their lowest point during the month of April, when we saw an average of 70 per cent reduction in ridership over the same time frame last year,” said Jay Shaw, the city’s assistant chief of emergency management.

Shaw said transit levels stayed around that mark throughout May and June, with an approximate 66 to 68 per cent reduction in ridership.

“However, we have seen a steady increase in ridership through early parts of July with an approximate 52 to 56 per cent (reduction in ridership) over the last two weeks,” he said.

“With those numbers continuing on an upward trend, the decision was made to restore summer transit service beginning in August.”

The city recommends that Winnipeg Transit passengers wear non-medical face masks while riding the bus. It notes that transit drivers and inspectors won’t be enforcing the use of masks and asks people not to judge those who aren’t wearing one.

“Dr. (Brent )Roussin and the province of Manitoba have been pretty clear right now that if you can’t maintain social and physical distancing, then a non-medical face mask is definitely an option,” Shaw said.

Shaw noted the masks are recommended, not mandatory.

“We want to be able to maintain that safe service. Transit has been a safe service the whole time and we want to maintain that as we move into this new normal as we go forward,” he said.

Winnipeggers are also asked to maintain a reasonable distance from other passengers on the bus, use the back door when getting off the bus if they’re able, and avoid using transit if they have any flu-like symptoms.

At a news conference on Friday, Mayor Brian Bowman thanked the city’s transit operators.

“They do incredibly important work to keep our city moving and especially in these unprecedented times, I want to thank them, I want to thank their loved ones and their families for all that they’re doing to keep this city moving,” he said.",The date full transit service will resume in Winnipeg,5,0.10638543387964139
629,"OTTAWA -- Ottawa Public Health is encouraging all employees in indoor public buildings to wear face masks at work, even in places where Ottawa's new face mask bylaw allows some employees to go maskless while on the job.

Council approved the City of Ottawa's new mandatory face mask bylaw on Wednesday requiring people to wear masks in enclosed public spaces during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the bylaw includes an exemption that allows employees working in non-public areas or behind a physical barrier to go maskless while working in public buildings.

""The intent of the bylaw is to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission in enclosed public spaces where close contact between persons is likely and increase the risk of spreading COVID-19,"" said Ottawa Public Health in a statement to CTV News Ottawa.

""There may be some areas of the premises that preclude public access, thereby reducing the risk of transmission between patrons and employees. However, COVID-19 can be transmitted between employees sharing these spaces and between patrons and employees when items are exchanged.""

Ottawa Public Health encourages all workers to wear masks within the establishment, ""including those who are behind physical barriers.""

The health unit tells CTV News Ottawa that masks decrease the risk of COVID-19 from respiratory droplets that may enter around the sides of a physical barrier and contamination of surfaces behind the physical barrier by infected employees.

The City of Ottawa's mandatory face mask bylaw covers the following places:

Restaurants, cafes, cafeterias, banquet halls

Retail establishments and shopping malls

Churches, mosques, synagogues, temples, or other places of worship

Libraries, museums, art galleries, recreational facilities, bingo halls, cinemas, theatres, concert venues, convention centres

Sports facilities, sports clubs, gyms, yoga studios, dance studios, and stadiums

Hotels, motels, or short-term rental premises

Municipal facilities, including City Hall, and any community centre, cultural, arts or leisure centre, recreational or sports facility, parks building, client service centres or indoor parking facility

OC Transpo buses, the O-Train, stations and Para Transpo vehicles.

The bylaw includes an exemption for ""a person who is employed by or is an agent of the Operator of an Enclosed Public Space is not obligated to wear a mask"" while:

In an area of the premises that is not designated for public access

When located either within or behind a physical barrier, including but not limited to a plexiglass

""If masks are not worn by employees in area exempted from the temporary bylaw, physical distancing practices of at least two metres between all person must be ensured (e.g., between patrons and the employees working behind the physical barriers, and between employees),"" said Ottawa Public Health in a statement to CTV News Ottawa.

""As should emphasis on increasing cleaning procedures of the shared workspaces, and training on hand hygiene and masking technique to avoid self-contamination.""

630,"WINNIPEG -- A new proposed bylaw that has been introduced in Kenora is raising some eyebrows, with one activist saying it is unfairly targeting homeless and Indigenous people.

The proposed loitering bylaw will be voted on by city council on July 21. The proposal would give police and bylaw officers the authority to ticket people who stay around on public property.

Marlene Elder, who is a community activist, said this bylaw is designed to target homeless and Indigenous people.

""We know that, they (council) know that. But they are not prepared to admit to that. So that is why we are stepping out,"" said Elder.

The other concern that Elder has is she feels like the bylaw would impact the ability for people in that city to protest.

""So it will affect our ability to raise issues on public property. So that is a serious concern.""

Elder said that council tried to sneak this proposed bylaw under the ""COVID radar"" and that the public wasn't aware of it until Monday.

When she learned of the bylaw she said it was very scary and she thinks it has been proposed now that tourists are coming back to the area.

""There is a whole bunch of areas that they are saying it's for but really it is to just clean up the town in the summer for those tourists that are now being welcomed back.""

Elder said she and others are now reaching out to the councillors who are in favour of this bylaw to tell them about the human rights issues, the bad public relations, and the legal costs this bylaw will cause.

""This is not going to stand up to a Charter challenge at all. I don't know if they just thought nobody would notice,"" she said.

If this bylaw is passed, people would face a $100 ticket if they’re found to have broken the bylaw.

CTV News reached out to Kenora Mayor Dan Reynard for comment.

He declined an interview but he said in an email that council needs time to review additional information and to have a ""wholesome discussion in order to make the best decision.""

Medical Officer of Health Dr. Vera Etches announced that Ottawa Public Health is mandating the use of masks in indoor public spaces to help limit the spread of COVID-19.

Ottawa Public Health has tips for washing, re-using, storing and discarding a cloth mask or face covering after using it on its website.

The health unit says masks or face coverings become contaminated, especially when touched by your hands.

Removing the mask:

Ottawa Public Health says, ""after washing your hands with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, remove your mask by pulling the ties or ear loops away from your ears.""

Washing the mask:

If your mask has a removable, non-reusable filter, make sure to remove and throw out the filter before machine washing or hand-washing your mask.

When using a washing machine, Ottawa Public Health says put the cloth mask directly into the washing machine or in a bag that can be emptied into the washing machine. Throw out the bag after you have used it to store your mask.

Wash your hands again with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer after handling your mask.

Wash the masks with other laundry using a hot water cycle.

For hand-washing the cloth face mask, Ottawa Public Health says use laundry detergent and water as hot as you can stand, then dry thoroughly.

If you are discarding damaged or worn out masks, drop them in a lined garbage bin.

Ottawa Public Health says do not leave any discarded masks in places where others can come in contact with them such as shopping carts, public seats, but stops or on the ground.

Reusing your face mask

Ottawa Public Health says cloth masks may be re-used throughout the day, ""if not soiled and undamaged.""

When removing your face mask, public health says ""with clean hands, remove the mask from your face and fold it in half so that the outer space is inwards (so that the contaminated outer surface is not contacting anything during storage) and place it in a clean, sealable bag until ready to use it again the same day.""

Can I wear my cloth mask all day?

Ottawa Public Health says a mask can be worn all day as long as it does not become damaged, damp or dirty.

""Do not share your mask with others,"" the health unit says.

""Remove your mask with clean hands when you are safely able to do so and wash your hands using soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.""

Storing your face mask during the day

Ottawa Public Health reminds people ""do not place your used mask into your pocket.""

With a mandatory face mask policy in place for Windsor-Essex, before leaving the house to go to the store having a face covering on hand is a new normal.

According to the Windsor-Essex County Health Unit, in order to safely wear a face mask a person should:

Wash their hands before putting it on and after taking it off

Make sure it fits to cover both the nose and mouth

Regularly wash the cloth mask in the laundry

Clean surfaces that a dirty mask has touched

The health unit states wearing a face mask can help protect others from your germs and when worn properly, can be effective in reducing the spread of COVID-19 from person to person.

It also helps to prevent people from touching their nose and mouth and can offer protection to others if two metres of physical distance cannot be maintained.

Face masks should be washed regularly and should not be used on children under two years old and should not be shared.

“A face mask, if worn properly, should cover the entire mouth and nose capturing and containing respiratory droplets that come out of an individual’s mouth when speaking or coughing,” Windsor-Essex medical officer of health Dr. Wajid Ahmed said during Wednesday’s daily COVID-19 briefing.

Ahmed said face shields should not be used as a substitute for a mask and is instead a piece of personal protection equipment.

“A shield does not hold and contain the respiratory droplets of the person wearing it, nor does it completely protect the wearer,” he said.

In addition to wearing a face mask, the health unit also recommends regular hand washing, practice physical distancing, avoid touching eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands and avoiding close contact with people who are ill, among other precautions.",How to properly wear a face mask,5,0.055343052815480465
635,"ASHGABAT, TURKMENISTAN -- The World Health Organization said Wednesday it was ""concerned"" about reports of pneumonia in Turkmenistan, a closed Central Asian country that has yet to declare any coronavirus cases.

At a press conference after a delayed, 10-day mission in Turkmenistan, WHO's Senior Emergency Officer for Europe Catherine Smallwood recommended the government adopt measures including contact tracing ""as if COVID-19 were already circulating.""

""We are aware of and concerned of reports of acute respiratory disease or pneumonia,"" Smallwood said.

She credited the government's ""recent activation of stronger measures"" as part of efforts to prevent the potential spread of the virus in the country.

Smallwood added that authorities in the reclusive country of around six million people had conducted 60,000 coronavirus tests, citing official figures.

""The actions taken in Turkmenistan will have impact for the people in the country, but also throughout Central Asia, Europe and the world,"" Smallwood warned.

State television on Wednesday evening showed strongman President Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov wearing a mask for the first time as he was pictured fishing while on holiday.

Berdymukhamedov then gave four large fish that he caught to a children's summer camp, where they were turned into fish soup, the report showed.

Law enforcement on Monday began apprehending citizens for not wearing masks after the health ministry warned of ""high concentrations of dust"" and ""pathogens"" in the air.

'FAKE NEWS'

Police had previously been seen discouraging citizens from wearing masks and face coverings were absent at mass government events overseen by Berdymukhamedov in recent months -- some of which attracted thousands of people.

Speculation has been building that the authoritarian government in ex-Soviet Turkmenistan is preparing to acknowledge that the coronavirus has entered the country, even though health offices have not reported any infections.

At a government press conference earlier on Wednesday, Foreign Minister Rashid Mederov appeared to suggest viruses could reach the country via dust storms.

""We do not exclude the influence of natural factors on the distribution of hazardous substances, including viruses. Especially dust and salt storms from the bottom of the Aral Sea,"" Meredov said, referring to a mostly dry inland lake in neighbouring Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan.

That lake's devastation is the cause of regular ecological problems in the region.

Turkmenistan ordered this week the suspension of passenger trains from Thursday.

Meredov said Wednesday that buses between regions had been stopped and citizens from outside the capital would take university entrance exams remotely.

Ashgabat's largest bazaar and a key supermarket chain were also shuttered earlier this week.

636,"WATERLOO REGION — Masks are mandatory in indoor public spaces and on public transit in Waterloo Region starting Monday.  Kitchener Mayor Berry Vrbanovic, who introduced the motion at regional council calling for mandatory face coverings, said wearing a mask is the “ultimate sign of caring for your neighbour.” “We have a long history of both being a resilient community, but more importantly being a very caring and compassionate community,” Vrbanovic said. “I hope people will put that hat on, along with their mask.” He said the bylaws will make sure the region can continue to move forward, and people can get back as much a sense of normalcy as possible in their lives. Some view the bylaws as infringing on their rights, but Vrbanovic pointed out the flip side of that argument.  “With rights also comes our collective responsibility toward each other and our community,” he said. “Your decision to wear a mask will actually help to save lives … Together let’s look out for our community.” Coun. Tom Galloway, who supported mandatory masks from the start, thinks most people will follow the new requirement.  “There are going to be people who might cheat, feign an exemption, but that will be a small number of people,” Galloway said. He said the bylaws are imperfect, but they will help keep the curve flat to avoid closing things again and move to the next stage of reopening as soon as possible. The Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Health Unit made face coverings mandatory inside any commercial or retail establishment in mid-June, when both that area and Waterloo Region moved into Stage 2. Galloway said Guelph has about a 90 per cent compliance rate — and that’s a good goal for here. “That’s going to go a long way,” Galloway said. People are asking why now when local numbers are low, and not months ago. “We are doing well and we want to keep it that way,” Galloway said.  He is concerned that people who are exempt will stay home to avoid confrontations with others who may be bothered they’re not wearing one, but he stressed that some have legitimate reasons.  “There’s no need for individuals to self-enforce this,” he said. “People generally are law abiding.” People who are unable to wear a mask due to a medical condition or disability and children under five are exempt from wearing a face covering, defined as a medical or non-medical mask or other face covering, including a bandana, scarf or other fabric that covers the nose, mouth and chin. Regional Chair Karen Redman stressed that the bylaw does not require someone to show proof of exemption, and many health issues and disabilities are invisible.  “If you see someone not wearing a mask, assume they have a medical reason,” she said. Regional council voted unanimously last Monday night to pass two bylaws requiring face coverings on transit and in indoor public settings. Delegations took 3.5 hours at the start of the special council meeting, arguing both for and against a mask rule. “There’s strong views on all sides,” said chief administrative officer Mike Murray at Friday’s briefing. He said bylaws passed by council was a more democratic route that allowed public input, compared to “just issuing and edict.” “That’s a pretty robust process and it provides an opportunity for the community to weigh in, and it provides an opportunity for our elected officials to make an appropriate policy decision,” Murray said. “I’m hopeful that because of that public process that the community will be supportive of the direction that the regional council has taken.” The bylaws are in effect until Sept. 30, unless extended by council. They will be enforced by complaints.  Signs must be posted at entrances to all public spaces where masks are required. In the Guelph area, businesses were required to enforce the rule or face a hefty fine.  Acting medical officer of health Dr. Hsiu-Li Wang appreciates the bylaws here make it clear everyone is responsible for reducing the spread of COVID-19. “I was really pleased to see the bylaws that are passed does put the responsibility on all of us who can wear masks to wear masks, reinforcing what we’ve been trying to say all along which is that it’s a collective responsibility for us to protect each other,” Wang said. Redman said the region needs to find “the new normal,” and council believes wearing a mask is part of that.  “This is an important step in helping our region safely reopen and move from Stage 2 to Stage 3 in the near future,” Redman said. “When we keep our germs from others by wearing a mask, we help reduce the virus from spreading. It’s a simple and inexpensive action that we can take to take care of each other.” Find out more about the bylaws at regionofwaterloo.ca/en/face-covering-by-law.aspx.",Masks mandatory in enclosed public spaces in Waterloo Region starting Monday,5,0.2165577909596218
637,"MIDDLESEX CENTRE, ONT. --

Middlesex-London Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Chris Mackie, issued instructions on Friday to all local businesses and organizations to ensure masks are worn in enclosed public spaces at all times while on their premises.

The mandatory wearing of face coverings takes effect at 12:01 a.m. Saturday.

It comes as the City of London plans to introduce a bylaw on Monday that would require masks in all indoor publicly-accessible spaces. Mackie is recommending London and all municipal councils in Middlesex issue a bylaw.

Mackie's instruction will be enforceable by public health staff, municipal by-law officers and law enforcement officials.

The instruction comes under Ontario’s Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act.

“We know that physical distancing is very effective in preventing the spread of COVID-19, but as the pandemic has evolved, new evidence supporting the use of face coverings in enclosed public spaces has continued to emerge,” says Mackie.

“Our community has done an amazing job to slow the pandemic to a crawl. We need to do all we can to prevent a spike in cases that could occur as most of our businesses and establishments move to Stage 3 of reopening.”

While the instruction applies to most people, the following individuals are exempt from having to wear face coverings:

• Children under the age of 12;

• People who have a medical condition or disability which inhibits their ability to wear a face covering;

• Those unable to apply or remove a face covering without help;

• People with accommodations under the Ontario Human Rights Code or the Accessibility for Ontarians with a Disabilities Act;

• Staff or agents of an enclosed public space who are in an area of the premises that is designated for them and not accessible to the public, or in an area separated by a physical barrier, such as plexiglass.

Mackie says if a customer isn't wearing a mask the business can ask the person to wear a mask, but not to create conflict.

""The primary enforcement mechanism will be education here for this instruction. Education is the most important part. If businesses make a reasonable attempt to ask a customer to wear a mask they will not be charged.""

Meanwhile, there are no details on when the city's temporary bylaw would take effect, or how long it would apply.

It would also require all businesses to post signage about mandatory masks.

According to city officials, the bylaw has been developed on the recommendation of Mackie.

The primacy goal is ""to reduce the risk of further COVID-19 infections within the City of London.""

The proposed minimum fine for failing to wear a mask is $500.

Council will discuss the bylaw at a special Strategic Priorities and Planning Committee meeting on Monday afternoon, with the bylaw expected to be introduced on Tuesday.

644,"The man behind a viral video of a ‘Karen’ at a recent Toronto anti-mask rally says he filmed the protesters to help those who may be on the fence about mask wearing to make an informed decision.

In a series of three videos recorded on July 7 using a chest harness camera, Brian Tao challenges a group of a few dozen protesters on a number of their points — including how virus particles are able to penetrate through the fabric of a mask, but yet oxygen molecules cannot, despite being smaller than virus particles.

“I know a lot of people ask — why do I engage?” Tao mused Friday in an interview with the Sun.

“The point isn’t to convince those particular people, because you’ll probably never convince them. They’re set in their beliefs. But the (videos) can be used as an example for those sitting on the sidelines.

“For every one person who comments on a video like this, there could be 10 or more who are taking this in silently and forming their views. So I really want to prevent more people into falling into this trap of disinformation. You should keep an open mind, but not so open that your brain falls out.”

One woman, who identifies herself as Kelly Anne Wolfe, is prominent in Tao’s video, “$#!+ Covidiots Say (Part 2), which was shot at the corner of Yonge and Bloor Sts.

That 10-minute video opens with protesters handing Tao a leaflet and telling him that showing it to businesses will exempt him from wearing a mask. Tao, who says he has a degree in cell and molecular biology, rips up the paper.

“That’s OK. Those are the people that walked the Jews into the gas tanks,” said Wolfe.

“I’m all over the place. I’m a musician and a very popular one,” she continues. “Anyone who is going to commit to this kind of civil obedience is the same kind of people that believed their government when they walked the Jews into the gas tanks. By the way, I’ve got 13 degrees in psychology, I’m a member of MENSA and have a masters in political science.”

When Tao challenges Wolfe about the claims on the card that wearing a mask decreases oxygen intake, she tells him to come to Queen’s Park where the group will be doing a live demonstration “of how your oxygen is decreased and your carbon monoxide intake is increased,” she said.

“Carbon dioxide, not carbon monoxide,” Tao corrects.

Throughout the videos, Tao pauses to post screenshots of sources debunking what protesters are claiming.

“If you look up the size of an oxygen molecule and the size of a carbon dioxide molecule, you’ll probably see it’s about 1,000 times smaller than a virus particle. So if this does not protect me from viruses, let’s assume that, how does that also stop oxygen from getting into my airways?

646,"The man caught on video shouting “Go back to China” to Mississauga T&T Supermarket employees last week after they asked him to wear a face mask has surrendered to police.

Investigators had homed in on his identity as of July 10 and had been asking John McCash, 48, of Mississauga, to speak with a lawyer and contact police.

McCash surrendered himself at 11 Division in Mississauga Thursday morning and was served a summons for causing a disturbance. He is to appear in Brampton court on Sept. 25 to answer to the charge.

The incident took place July 5 around 4 p.m. at the grocery store, located at 715 Central Pkwy. W., near Mavis Rd. A male customer was filmed making racist comments after workers asked him to leave because he refused to wear a mask.

In the three-minute and 50-second video filmed by a bystander, a man is seen emptying the contents of his cloth shopping bag on the floor.

“I’m never coming back here again,” he says. “I’m going to have the media here. You guys can all wear your masks and you can all die and you can all get sick. Because when you wear the mask, you get sick. It’s science.”

Several employees speak to the man and one asks him not to scream.

“This is a communist, socialist lie,” the man continues. “Where did we get our Wuhan communist virus? From China. From you guys.”

The man then asks the employees, “Where are you from?”

“I’m a Canadian,” responds a male employee.

The customer then repeats that he has an asthmatic condition and gets into the employee’s face while his wife hugs him and appears to try to create some space between him and the workers.

“We are Canadian, sir,” the male employee says.

As the man, still ranting, is escorted towards the exit by several employees, the male employee — who is wearing a mask — raises his arms in the air to show he is not touching the customer.

“I am Canadian,” he repeats while the customer shouts, “Get out of my face.”

Before leaving the man shouts, “Go back to China where you came from. And take your coronavirus back to Wuhan.”

T&T began performing mandatory temperature checks for all staff and voluntary checks for customers at its locations across Canada on April 20, but suspended them as of June 8 as they found the checks became inaccurate because of the warmer weather. Masks, however, have remained a mandatory requirement for shoppers to enter its stores since May 11.

Loblaw Companies Inc., the parent company for T&T Supermarket, banned McCash from all their stores, including T&T Supermarket, Loblaws and Shoppers Drug Mart.

“We will not tolerate this type of hateful behaviour in our workplace,” said T&T Supermarket CEO Tina Lee said in a statement Thursday afternoon.

“T&T will not be taking any further action, as this case is in the trusted hands of the Peel police and courts.”

Lee said between Jan. 27 and July 10, T&T has recorded three positive COVID-19 cases across 5,500 colleagues.

“When compared to the regions in which we operate, T&T has maintained the lowest infection rate of 0.05%, despite being deemed an essential service to Canadians, remaining open and serving thousands of customers every day, while most of the country was in lockdown,” said Lee.

“We believe this has been achieved by the early adoption of masks, a key pillar in our safety strategy, along with frequent sanitization efforts, and social distancing in stores.”

This incident has had a profound impact on not only the victim, but also the community. @PeelPolice investigators have worked hard to identify John McCash & I urge him to speak with legal counsel & make arrangements to speak with our investigators

DETAILS:https://t.co/a84Y3aMoJI pic.twitter.com/DwLroEFiSq — Chief Nishan Duraiappah (@ChiefNish) July 16, 2020

Lee added she sympathizes with those with a medical condition that makes it difficult to wear a face covering. To accommodate them, they can shop or approach their customer service counter with a shopping list and staff will do the shop for them.

Peel police Chief Nishan Duraiappah said the incident “has had a profound impact on not only the victim, but also the community.”

“Hate-crime incidents have a negative impact on our community and create a ripple effect. It can increase feelings of vulnerability, anxiety and fear, not only on the individual who has directly been victimized, but also to the community at large,” Duraiappah said in a statement Wednesday urging McCash to surrender.

“Reporting incident of hate-crime is essential to stopping these incidents; we are dedicated to ensuring the safety and well-being of all we serve.”

Tavisha Kochhar, a Grade 9 student at Sullivan Heights Secondary, has made hundreds of cloth masks in recent months, selling them to raise funds for Lower Mainland hospitals and vaccine research.

Tavisha, according to the Surrey school district, started sewing the masks about two months. She sells them through her website, tavishahelpinghands.com, and then ships the masks throughout Canada and the U.S.

So far, she has made roughly 600 masks, raising $2,700 for Surrey Memorial Hospital, BC Children’s Hospital, St. Paul’s Hospital and Vancouver General Hospital.

“I’ve always been fundraising,” said Tavisha, 14. “I kept on donating, making things, selling what I made and I would use the funds collected to donate to different charities and organizations.

With the pandemic, Tavisha said she decided to make affordable masks because she saw online “that many people were selling masks for unreasonable prices and it was just so unfair to the people who don’t have jobs anymore and lost family members.”

Tavisha took a textiles course in Grade 8, learning how to sew.

In 2017, she started Tavisha’s Helping Hands to help people suffering from the B.C. wildfires. According to her website, she raised $850 by selling artwork, making pencil holders, key chains, paper weights and magnets using recycled materials.

“The environment is a really big issue,” she said. “If we’re able to make reusable masks that you could wash and keep clean for longer, it’s just so much better for the environment.”

Through her website, people can buy masks off all different designs, ranging in price from $5 to $7, plus shipping.

Over the years, she has donated $5,000 to several charities.

649,"It finally happened. As society sticks its toe back into the proverbial wading pool — and literally in the real ones — four months into the COVID lockdown, Waterloo Region’s new masking bylaws mandate that, like Hannibal Lecter and The Green Hornet, everyone must cover their face in indoor public settings. When it kicks in Monday there will, of course, be exemptions for age, health, disabilities. But it’s an unexpected pivot that — while crucial in controlling the virus’s spread — has all sorts of cultural implications. On this week’s panel, four of the region’s deep thinkers contemplate a world undercover, where bank robbers, citizens and Jason from “Friday the 13th” blend indiscriminately, with the alluring prospect of a Victorian-styled resurgence in personal modesty: “I can’t show my face — I might cough.” On hand to sort through this psychological morass: radio personalities Angie Hill and Mike Farwell, pop culture priestess Isabel Kuxdorf and University of Waterloo history prof Andrew Hunt.  As someone who believes everything I read on Twitter, I want to cut to the chase: is this a government conspiracy to erode our freedoms and destroy democracy?  Farwell: If it is, governments really need to aim higher than “put this piece of cloth on your face!” Hunt: I saw a video a few days ago about a U.S. woman yelling that face masks were a “Deep State” plot to take away our freedoms. I thought “If this is what totalitarianism 2020-style looks like, we’re gonna have a pretty easy ride compared to people who lived under dictatorships in the last century.” Kuxdorf: Folks, the mask will not erode your freedom. Leave that to the Tech giants and Lobbyists. I sense skepticism, but in Toronto last week, subway protesters chanted “hugs over mask, we don’t have to ask!” Freedom fighting aside, how much do you want an unsolicited hug from a stranger with COVID? Farwell: If I’m going down from COVID, I’m going down hugging. Hunt: I think I’ll take a Pasadena on the Free Hugs Movement. I wasn’t into it pre-COVID. If that makes me Mr. Square, so be it. Hill: Never … Ever … get off me! Jump back six months. You walk into a bank and see someone wearing a mask. What’s your reaction? Hill: Call the cops ... potential robbery Hunt: “I demand fifteen thousand dollars and a 707 to Havana! No, make that twenty thousand!” Is it permissible to yell at someone if you see their nose peeking over the top of their mask? Hunt: No way! It gives them a sort of nonconformist street cred.  Given the exemptions for medical conditions, kids under five, no proof required, why would anyone wear a mask? Farwell: Because they want to feel a part of our pandemic recovery and because, believe it or not, they actually care about other people. Hill: Better safe than sorry — kind of like that kid who doesn’t believe in Santa Claus and gets nothing … you wanna take THAT chance???? You radio people are so rule-abiding. Hunt: This might be like the big controversy over mandatory seatbelt laws back in the ’80s. It calmed down after people realized that if you don’t wear one, you go flying through the windshield face-first into a utility pole. Isabel, you see other benefits?  Kuxdorf: Free facial. Your constant breathing creates a steam bath for your face. Gross but truly pore-opening! Tell me more. Kuxdorf: Think of the money we’ll save on lip plumpers, glosses and facial waxing. We can use masks to hide imperfections, as in the Victorian fan, which among other uses, was used to hide bad teeth. For wheezing gasbags like myself, breathing difficulties kick in after 10 minutes. What impact will this have on shopping? Farwell: Ten minutes? That’s Ironman territory. If there’s any impact on shopping, my guess is it’s on those who won’t enter a store if they don’t see people inside wearing masks. Shoppers gonna shop. Hunt: I overheat. As a result, I get disoriented when I’m shopping. I end up buying things I wouldn’t ordinarily buy, like tiny cocktail parasols and exotic dragon fruits and People magazine. Hill: It’ll make people less likely to browse and more pick it up and run.  Should Halloween masks be considered appropriate protection under the new bylaw? If so, who would you be? Hill: The old man from The Muppets ... and I’d demand the senior discount.  Hunt: I’d dig one of those big dome helmets from “Alien,” complete with a built-in face hugger. Kuxdorf: I find it ironic that Halloween masks were banned in schools but now they’re going to be REQUIRED. You can now officially run around like an upside down Zorro — any day of the year. What about incorporating space helmets? I’m thinking Matt Damon in “The Martian.”  Farwell: Oddly enough, I’m thinking of The Great Gazoo. Is that a “Flintstones” reference? You gotta move into the 21st century, man. I say that as someone who patterned his life after Potsie in “Happy Days.” Kuxdorf: Our governments could generate much needed revenue by selling masks with provincial or state mottos. Wouldn’t you like to run around with Ontario’s new “Open for Business” on your face?  Bylaw enforcement will be complaint driven. I have a neighbour who calls the snitch line if our tree branch hangs an inch too low. Would this be a good opportunity to exact revenge?  Farwell: We’ll bitch about it on Facebook, but actually taking the time to call someone official? You have to remember people are generally really, really good. It’s just that those who are less good make a lot of noise. Hunt: Any means of exacting petty revenge, I’m all for. Is there a danger of getting so comfortable wearing a mask you may not want to take it off? Farwell: Is it September 30th yet? Because as much as I’m willing to do my part, I don’t love wearing a mask. I’m looking forward to our bylaw’s sunset clause and release from the shackles of facial fabric. Hunt: My son made me a mask when the pandemic first hit in March. Not only is it comfy, I have a strong sentimental attachment. Ah, those poignant pandemic moments! At what point do you say “To hell with nose hair/blemishes/washing my face?” Farwell: I’m pretty sure for me that point was 1989. When you look at People magazine and see photos of celebrities strolling along exotic beaches wearing masks, does this justify its $5.99 cover price? Kuxdorf: If this spells the end to the “Instagram pucker” popularized by Kim Kardashian, now seen in school yearbook photos everywhere, then I’m all for it. Can we make mask wearing a requirement on social media? Hunt: The celebrity in question has to be pretty damn cool to sway me. Hardcore cool — the level of Abdul ‘Duke’ Fakir, the last surviving member of The Four Tops. Or Fox Mulder and Dana Scully cool. Or legendary Mad magazine artist Al Jaffee, who recently retired at age 99. You history profs and your pop culture Easter eggs. Wikipedia!

650,"SAN FRANCISCO - California Gov. Gavin Newsom laid out strict criteria Friday for school reopenings that makes it unlikely the vast majority of districts will have classroom instruction in the fall as the coronavirus pandemic surges.

The rules include a mandate that students above 2nd grade and all staff wear masks in school.

Newsom’s new guidance mandates that public schools in California counties that are on a monitoring list for rising coronavirus infections cannot hold in-person classes and will have to meet strict criteria for reopening.

The guidance says all school staff and all students in grades 3 to 12 will be required to wear face coverings. Younger students will be encouraged but not required to wear masks. Younger students will be encouraged but not required to wear masks.

The governor’s strict new regulations marked a dramatic shift from his earlier position that it was up to local school districts and boards to decide when and how to reopen. His announcement comes just weeks before many of the state’s 1,000 school districts return to classes in mid-August, with many still finalizing their reopening plans.

With school districts struggling over the decision, teachers unions, parents and school officials have urged state leaders for more direction on whether it is safe to go back to school. The state this week reported its second-highest one day totals in infection rates and deaths since the start of the pandemic. Nearly 7,400 have died in California — more than 1,100 of them in the last two weeks.

Several school districts have already said their schools will begin the new term virtually, including Los Angeles and San Diego, the state’s two largest with a combined population of 720,000 K-12 students. San Francisco, Oakland, Sacramento, Long Beach, Santa Ana and San Bernardino are among the other districts opting not to immediately return to classrooms.

Los Angeles is the second-largest school district in the country after New York City, where mayor Bill de Blasio has said schools are expected to reopen with a hybrid model of in-person instruction and at-home learning, subject to state approval.

California officials have placed at least 31 of the state’s 58 counties on a watch list because of concerning coronavirus transmission and hospitalization rates. Being on the list puts restrictions on the ability to reopen various segments of the economy.

If those counties are still on the watch list when the new term begins, the guidance means that most California schools would not be reopening classrooms but holding school via distance learning.

The guidance lays out in detail when classrooms and schools would have to close if there is an outbreak. If a student or educator test positive for the virus, a classroom would have to close and the students and teacher would quarantine for 14 days. An entire school should revert to distance learning if it reports multiple cases, or 5 per cent of students and staff test positive within a 14-day period.

Newsom’s administration and the state Department of Education had released guidelines in early June for districts to follow when reopening, which include implementing temperature checks for students, remaking activities such as lunch and recess, and recommending cloth face coverings for students and teachers. But at that time, California had managed to keep its coronavirus case count under control.

“Since we’ve issued our guidance, conditions have changed dramatically,” State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond said during a media briefing Wednesday, adding that he expects more districts will decide to begin the term virtually. “In any place where there is uncertainty, we should",California governor outlines strict guidelines for schools,5,0.16859757880447968
651,"TORONTO -- Face masks will be mandatory for passengers onboard GO Transit vehicles, including the UP Express, beginning Tuesday.

The decision was announced by Metrolinx in a news release issued on Friday.

The announcement comes as more regions across the Greater Toronto Area implement the mandatory use of a facial covering for those attending indoor public spaces.

“As the GTA starts to prepare itself for Stage 3 of the recovery, we are seeing many more customers return to our GO and UP services,” Metrolinx CEO Phil Verster said. “With that in mind and your safety in mind, we are making face coverings mandatory on all our services.”

Verster said drivers of their transit vehicles have been wearing face masks for the last several months.

“In terms of our enforcement, of our requirement of people to wear face coverings, we will focus on education rather than enforcement,” he added. “Our employees will help customers on buses and trains if they haven’t got face coverings and we will ensure that no one will be left behind.”

Earlier this month, the transit agency announced that it had started installing clear plastic dividers between seats on some of its buses and trains.

So far, the dividers have been installed on 30 GO buses and six GO trains.

The use of face masks and the plastic dividers are two of the 40 measures Metrolinx says they are implementing to help limit the spread of COVID-19.

Beginning July 21, riders will be required to wear a face covering when traveling on GO Transit and UP Express. GO and UP staff are already required to wear face coverings.

653,"The new issue of Vanity Fair featuring a powerful image of Oscar-winning actor Viola Davis marks the first time the publication has featured the work of a Black photographer on its cover.

The historic image of Davis, shot by photographer Dario Calmese, shows the 54-year-old in profile, her back facing the camera. Davis is wearing a blue gown with a deep plunge in the back, hand on hip.

The publication has “had a problem in the past with putting Black women on the covers,” Davis says in an interview for the magazine.

Radhika Jones, the magazine’s editor-in-chief, writes in the issue that 17 Black people have been on the cover in the 35 years between 1983 and 2017, and that she was determined to fix the lack of representation when she took over the job.

She said in publishing Calmese’s photo of Davis on the cover, “we celebrate him and honour his vision at this heightened moment in American history.”

“Calmese describes his cover concept as a re-creation of the Louis Agassiz slave portraits taken in the 1800s — the back, the welts,” she writes. “This image (of Davis) reclaims that narrative, transmuting the white gaze on Black suffering into the Black gaze of grace, elegance and beauty.”

In her Vanity Fair interview, Davis discusses the recent racial justice protests, her upcoming role as Michelle Obama, her impoverished upbringing in Rhode Island, and the challenges of being a Black woman in Hollywood, among other topics.

655,"REGINA -- The Government of Saskatchewan is not currently considering implementing a mandatory mask policy for the province, after seeing the biggest single-day rise in COVID-19 cases on Thursday.

“Mask usage is just one of the tools that right now are available in the tool box,” said Warren Kaeding, the Minister of Rural and Remote Health.

“Our Chief Medical Health Officer has been fairly explicit as to where he sees a mask would be the best benefit.”

The province will continue to adhere to the advice of Dr. Saqib Shahab, the province’s Chief Medial Health Officer, when it comes to mask use.

“As we continue to see the evolving nature of this virus, and the understanding of the virus, if it comes to that point where the Chief Medical Health Officer believes that it needs to be taken to another level, then I would expect we would move to that,” said Kaeding.

Scott Livingstone, the CEO of the Saskatchewan Health Authority, said for now, the government will continue to educate the province about the benefits of using non-medical masks in certain situations.

“Having a little more of a voluntary policy but keeping people aware of what’s out there and how to protect themselves, I think is more important,” said Livingstone.

The SHA will continue to rely on Saskatchewan people to willingly follow public health restrictions and guidelines. A mandatory mask policy would likely only be considered if transmission of the virus was linked to a lack of mask use.

“I think we would consider what would happen with a mandatory masking policy if we started to see things that we could definitely identify were strictly related to that type of transmission,” Livingstone said.

But many restaurants have yet to turn on the open sign.

Market Buffet BBQ and Smokehouse in Barrie hasn't served a meal to anyone since March. Owner Jamie Martin closed the restaurant two days before the pandemic was declared.

""It's been rough,"" admitted Martin. ""I think everyone in the industry has taken a real hit.""

Over the past four months, Martin said they had lost more than $500,000 in sales alone.

Since buffets aren't part of Stage 3, the owners had to reinvent how it operates, including changing its name to Market BBQ and Smokehouse.

""We had to remove the buffet. We're going to transition into a menu that is more of a sit down a la carte restaurant,"" said Martin, who added there are plans in the works to open its patio with a smaller menu.

Before the pandemic, the self-serve restaurant offered more than 150 items, which has now been reduced to about 80, which, according to Martin, are mainly guest favourites.

The buffet has been family-owned since 2005 and underwent a $60,000 upgrade in 2015.

Martin said COVID has been an eye-opener but never thought their business model would ever change with the future of buffets unknown.

""I think there will be a shift in buffets,"" said Martin. ""Either they're going to get out of the buffet altogether like we did, or they'll change the way they serve.""

Demand to book tickets online caused the Park Board website to crash for nearly an hour Sunday morning as people tried to reserve time at Kitsilano, Second Beach and New Brighton pools for a designated session on Monday, the first day they reopen to the public.

Registration opened at 9:30 a.m.

Shortly after 10 a.m., the Park Board issued an apology, citing a technical problem and thanking people for their patience.

By 10:30 a.m., the booking system was open for business.

The Park Board closed pools and recreation centres at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic when B.C. declared a public health emergency.

The three outdoor swimming pools are poised to open Monday, July 13 for the first time this year with new safety guidelines and health protocols. Maple Grove Pool will open July 20.

Swimmers must arrive ready to swim, meaning there will be no access to change rooms or lockers, and people must book their visit one day ahead, opting for 45 minutes for lane swimming or 90 minutes for leisure swimming.

Pods are limited to two people over the age of five and a maximum of three people.

""We encourage patrons to access the centre of the pod as much as possible, to allow for adequate distance between pods,"" the Park Board advises on its website.

667,"NEW YORK -- If you decide to have an alcoholic drink, limiting yourself to one a day is best - whether you're a man or woman.

That's the new advice experts are recommending for the U.S. Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which are scheduled to be updated later this year for the first time in five years. The guidelines now say men should limit themselves to two drinks a day, and that women should limit themselves to one. That advice has been in place since 1990.

In a report released Wednesday, a committee of experts noted there isn't adequate evidence to support different alcohol recommendations for men and women, and that research supports tightening the limit for men. U.S. health agencies that issue dietary guidelines aren't required to adopt the committee's recommendations.

“As a nation, our collective health would be better if people generally drank less,” said Dr. Timothy Naimi, an alcohol researcher at Boston University and one of the experts on the committee convened by federal officials.

The proposed advice shouldn't be interpreted to mean that not having a drink on Thursday means you can have two on Friday, Naimi said. One drink is the equivalent of about one 12-ounce can of beer, a 5-ounce glass of wine or a shot of liquor.

The advice is based on links that researchers observed between drinking habits and all causes of death, including heart disease, cancer and car accidents, rather than a specific physical harm that alcohol might have. Such observational studies, common in food and nutrition science, do not establish a cause-and-effect relationship but they are often the best evidence available, so experts use them to give guidance.

With alcohol, Naimi said two drinks a day was associated with an increased risk of death compared with one drink a day. He said the increase was modest, but notable enough for the committee to recommend updating the advice.

Whether the proposed new advice would influence behaviour isn't clear. Many Americans already exceed the current advice on alcohol limits, Naimi noted. Still, he said most people could generally benefit from any reduction in alcohol, even if they're not within the advised limits.

The report noted that the guidelines may be aspirational, but are important for “stimulating thought around behaviour change.”

The guidelines are based on the overall health of a population, and an individual's risk from drinking could vary depending on a variety of factors and health habits, said Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, a professor of nutrition at Tufts University.

Mozaffarian also noted that many people misinterpret the current advice to mean they should have one or two drinks a day. The limits are meant for people who already drink. The guidelines do not recommend that people who do not drink alcohol to start doing so.

Even if most Americans aren't familiar with the details of the U.S. Dietary Guidelines, they're subject of intense lobbying because of their power to shape the advice dispensed by doctors and what's served in federal food programs, including school lunches.

Other changes recommended by the committee include tightening the limit on added sugars to less than 6% of calories, down from the previous limit of 10%. Federal officials are expected to issue the updated guidelines by the end of the year, after considering public comments and input from other agencies.

671,"WINNIPEG -- A Winnipeg restaurant is facing a total of $5,084 in fines for breaching COVID-19 health guidelines.

Chaise Corydon, known for its usually busy patio, got its first ticket for $2,542 in mid-June for not spacing its table and chairs enough. At the time, the owner thought a warning should have sufficed.

READ MORE: Winnipeg restaurant owner fined more than $2,500 for breaking health orders

On Friday, the restaurant received a second ticket for $2,542 because some patrons were dancing and not physical distancing.

""This is getting ridiculous these [inspectors] are out of control,"" said Shea Ritchie, the owner of Chaise Corydon. ""This is every authoritarians' dream situation.""

Ritchie believes both reasons for Friday's fine aren't worthy of the hefty price tag.

""Apparently everything we did was wrong, and we have to pay $5,100 in total now for two fines for not knowing these ever-changing, ambiguous rules,"" he said.

In an effort to bring people further into the restaurant and create more space on the patio, Ritchie hired a DJ. He said the inspector told him four people were dancing, hence the fine.

""We have a bathroom at the back of that room people were dancing,"" said Ritchie. ""If someone is waiting in line and moving to the beat, are we supposed to walk up and tell them to cut that out? Where does it end, and where does it start?""

As for the accusation of not properly social distancing, Ritchie claims there was a reservation of 40 people in a room with a capacity of 86.

When asked about the fine at the news conference, Dr. Brent Roussin stayed firm on the rules.

""We are not back to normal, and when we are enforcing the Public Health Act, there's often plenty of opportunities to fix things and warnings, but we will protect Manitobans,"" said Roussin.

Ritchie, however, said he never received warnings.

According to Ritchie, he asked the inspector which specific rules in the Public Health Act he broke. The inspector could then not specify the rules and then changed whether he thought the establishment was a restaurant or a licensed facility.

""I'm not trying to give the government any pushback,"" he said. ""There are too many situations. You can't control them all. In that case, go around giving people a lot of warnings.""

Ritchie said he's not mad he got fined, he's mad that the inspectors ""won't follow their own rules.""

Ritchie has since contacted the inspector and tried to get the fine reduced to a warning. With no luck, Ritchie said he'll fight it in court.

CTV News reached out to the Liquor, Gaming and Cannabis Authority of Manitoba for more information on the fine, but it has not yet responded.

As Ottawa and eastern Ontario moves into Stage 3 of the COVID-19 reopening plan, the city says all playgrounds and exercise equipment at city parks are now open.

Playground equipment and outdoor exercise equipment have been off-limits since the end of March due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Ontario Government's Emergency Management and Civil Protection Order closed playground equipment to limit the spread of COVID-19.

The City of Ottawa says all users are reminded to practice physical distancing from people outside your household, avoid touching your face, and wash your hands after using park equipment.

Sports teams can now resume competitive play at all City of Ottawa indoor and outdoor facilities.

In a statement, the city says, ""team sports can now resume competitive play provided participants adhere to physical distancing guidelines, avoid prolonged and deliberate physical contact, and follow the guidelines of their governing organizations.""

The city has cancelled all existing July indoor rental agreements for events, meetings and community activities. Staff will reach out to August rental contract holders to advise them that all indoor events for more than 50 people will be cancelled.

674,"Premier Doug Ford is hitting the campaign trail, but he’s ruling out an early election call to cash in on a bump in the polls over his government’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. In an interview with the Star on Tuesday, Ford was asked if his province-wide summer tour is to set the stage for a snap vote this fall. “No, not at all,” the premier said from Waterloo. “We’re going to year four.” That means the June 2022 election will go ahead as planned. While the province has a law on the books that fixes election dates at once every four years, the Progressive Conservatives could easily amend the legislation because they have a majority in the house. Opposition party strategists have privately worried Ford might opt to face voters earlier in order to get out ahead of the post-pandemic economic hardships that loom. “You might not want to be an incumbent premier or prime minister going to the polls in two years’ time if we’re in a deep recession,” said one senior Liberal insider, speaking on background in order to freely discuss strategy. “So we’ve told our team to get ready for any eventuality,” said the Grit, noting Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s minority Liberal government is gearing up for a possible federal election. But Ford, who will spend the next eight weeks visiting 38 of Ontario’s 124 ridings in seven regions of the province, insisted his blitz is not a pre-election victory lap. “There’s no victory at all,” he said, emphasizing the COVID-19 pandemic that has killed more than 2,700 Ontarians and left the province in a state of emergency since March 17 is far from over. The premier launched his tour Tuesday at Cambridge’s Eclipse Automation, a company that retooled its machines to manufacture N95 and surgical masks and other medical supplies. He said he just wants to thank businesses “for stepping up” during the outbreak. “We’ve all been cooped at home in the bubble for too long. It’s a big province,” said Ford, who was also at Challenger Motor Freight before heading to Kitchener’s Shaver Industries, which is making 25,000 face shields a week for front-line workers. On Thursday, Ford will visit Essex County, where he’ll get his shaggy golden mullet trimmed by a local barber. “You wouldn’t believe how many barbers there are down there,” he enthused. Freshly coiffed, he plans to be back in Waterloo Region the following day. Liberal Leader Steven Del Duca expressed concern about the premier hitting the hustings. “Parents working from home are struggling with child care and Doug Ford is nowhere to be found,” said Del Duca. “His priorities are way out of order — he has a detailed plan to reopen pubs and movie theatres, but none to get our kids back in school this fall,” he said. “Doug Ford should spend his summer figuring out the crisis in our schools, not campaigning for re-election.” NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said Ford is displaying “poor judgment.” “Shame on him for worrying about his election chances as opposed to worrying about the things that everybody else are still worrying about,” said Horwath. “Things like businesses being able to weather the storm with a government that didn’t really help out at all, in terms of direct support. Everybody’s worried about [going] back to school and Ford decides he’s going to go campaigning? Really, really, really troubling,” she said. “It’s extremely disappointing that that’s what Mr. Ford thinks his job is — to seal his next election, as opposed to to continue to be here to deal with the crisis that’s unfolding still with COVID-19.” Green Leader Mike Schreiner charged that Ford is campaigning at the same time as his government is “failing to deliver for parents, students and teachers, a plan to safely reopen schools this fall.”  Ford’s barnstorming, which is designed to boost the Conservatives’ political fortunes, come as he has seen a rebound in public-opinion polls for the Star. The premier had a -49 per cent approval rating this time last year, when he was loudly booed at the Toronto Raptors’ victory celebrations at Nathan Phillips Square while Trudeau and Mayor John Tory were cheered. Last July, a poll found that just 20 per cent of respondents approved of the job he was doing while 69 per cent disapproved and 11 per cent had no opinion. But the latest Campaign Research poll for the Star found Ford now has an overall 39 per cent approval, a swing of 88 percentage points. The firm found 66 per cent approved of his performance with 27 disapproving and six per cent having no opinion.  Campaign Research polled 1,395 people across Ontario last Wednesday and Thursday using Maru Blue’s online panel. It is an opt-in poll, but for comparison purposes, a random sample of this size would have a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points, 19 times out of 20. On Friday, much of the province will enter the third stage of reopening, meaning restaurants and bars can serve indoors and outdoor playgrounds will reopen. However, the GTA and Hamilton area will remain in the second stage for at least another week. Ford said has no regrets about moving slowly, noting American officials have “been reckless down there” by reopening the economy too quickly.",Doug Ford hits the campaign trail but rules out a snap election call,2,0.1451782500468748
676,"Sport Abbotsford has called on the City of Abbotsford to open Centennial Outdoor Pool for the summer. (Sport Abbotsford photo)

Sport Abbotsford wants the City of Abbotsford to reconsider its decision to close the Centennial Outdoor Pool for the summer.

The association, which represents dozens of local sports organizations in Abbotsford, stated that the pool is an important venue for many local families and will only push the capacity of other nearby venues which will be opened.

The City of Abbotsford announced the decision on June 17, stating high operation costs and residents’ desire for an indoor pool to be opened led to the move.

The pool is also the home of the Abbotsford Whalers aquatic club, which has a history of over 50 years of summer swimming. The Whalers stated on their website that the city has offered the club some pool time at the Matsqui Recreation Centre in August. They recently launched a survey to gauge the interest in this offering.

RELATED: Abbotsford’s Centennial Outdoor Pool will not re-open this summer

Scott Johnson, a former president of the Whalers, said that zero consultation was made between the city and local community groups like the Whalers. Families involved with the Whalers now do not have a local venue to train and compete in.

“We understand the challenges the city faces during this time, solutions have been created at the provincial level to allow safe swimming activities,” he stated in a press release. “It is happening in towns across the Fraser Valley and B.C. but these opportunities can’t even happen in Abbotsford because local groups have been denied the opportunity to even try. Once again, decisions about our facilities are made without consultation with community groups. Again, as a parent, to meet the interests of our children we need to follow the roads that leave Abbotsford.”

The decision has also been criticized because many other municipalities have decided to open their outdoor pools. Facilities in Langley, Delta, Surrey, Agassiz and Vancouver will all be opened up this summer. Sport Abbotsford stated that the closure is further evidence that the City of Abbotsford lags behind other municipalities in sports and recreation offerings for residents.

“This pool closure is another example of the City of Abbotsford prioritizing finances over families, and focusing on revenue instead of recreation,” stated Josh Reynolds, Vice Chair of Sport Abbotsford. “This pool serves thousands of residents over the summer months, and is a safe summer activity as the province continues to re-open. We hope the city reverses course here and opens the pool.”

Sport Abbotsford wants the pool to be open as soon as possible, and a petition supporting the pool opening has been started, and will be sent to Mayor and Council next week.

The petition can be found by clicking anywhere in this sentence.

The petition, which began on July 1, currently has 195 signatures.

678,"NEW YORK -- It's been the story for many a starry-eyed creative type looking for a big break in the Big Apple -- wait tables to pay the bills while auditioning, performing, singing, painting, dancing, writing, whatever it takes to make the dreams of success come true.

But there's been a plot twist, thanks to the coronavirus putting food servers out of work in recent months as restaurants were forced to shut down their dine-in services. And much uncertainty remains over what restaurant dining will look like even as New York City reopens.

Questions of whether there will be enough business for establishments to stay open and even have waiter jobs to fill are causing concern about what that's going to mean for the city's creative class if the jobs that helped them be able to live here and add to the city's artistic culture are no longer readily available.

""It really is a part of the artist's life in New York, so I don't know what that's going to look like if it's just suddenly not an option anymore,"" said Travis McClung, 28, who has spent close to nine years waiting tables while doing theatre, singing and more recently, trying to build his career in video editing and post-production.

The virus has been devastating for the city's restaurant workers. According to the state Department of Labor, restaurants and other eateries employed just over 273,000 people in February, before the city shut down in mid-March due to the pandemic. In April, during the peak of virus cases, that number had fallen to under 78,000. As the city reopened in May, it rose slightly to close to 100,000, still vastly below where it had been.

And while outdoor dining has been allowed in recent weeks, with around 6,600 restaurants in the five boroughs applying for permits to feed people on sidewalks and streets, the return of indoor dining has been put off indefinitely over fears that confined quarters would make virus cases spike.

For McClung, who came to New York City in 2009 from a Dallas, Texas, suburb to study theatre in college and started waiting tables here, a restaurant job has been a safety net, of sorts. Pre-pandemic, New York City's vibrant restaurant scene was busy enough that he always felt he had a fallback.

""It was a sense of security, it let me stay in New York City, pay the rent here,"" he said.

That's what led to his last pre-virus waiter job, a position at a casual dining place on Manhattan's Upper West Side.

""I had a big gig editing and it cancelled and I panicked and then my friend posted he was leaving that job,"" McClung said. ""I messaged him for a referral and then I got hired the next day.""

Rachel Berry, who moved to New York City in 2004, tried her hand at a bunch of different jobs like dog walking and nannying before moving to bartending and some waiting tables in 2016.

The Laurel, Maryland, native even spent some time at a 9-to-5 gig in her early 20s, but found the structure too rigid to give her enough time to work on her creative pursuits, which have included photography, painting, performing and most recently, interior design work.

""There's just something about the food service industry,"" the 36-year-old said. ""It affords me a life that I can get by in New York.""

She worries now about what will still be available in restaurants, as social distancing restrictions will require lower capacities in food and drink establishments for the foreseeable future, and whether she would have to work even more in other fields like retail to make what she has been able to in food service.

""Am I going to have the same opportunities afforded to me financially, or, you know, am I going to be stuck in this, I need two to three jobs to get by,"" Berry asked.

And that's of course assuming people don't leave, or hesitate to come to New York City now in the first place, said Jen Lyon, owner of MeanRed Productions, a company that puts on arts and music events.

That's a concern to her, as someone who looks to work with up-and-comers, in a city where it was already expensive and difficult for artists to sustain themselves.

As someone who spent years bartending, she has an appreciation for food service jobs and what they offer creative types.

They're ""the best jobs to have when you needed to focus on your art, especially in New York,"" she said.

But now, if those jobs largely disappear, ""What happens in my world is suddenly I don't have young artists to work with because they can't afford New York,"" she said. ""You don't have people creating art in New York anymore.""

The pandemic ""has scattered a lot of the potential artists,"" she said. ""We're going to lose a decade of possible talent until people figure out how to stay.""

Losing its creatives is also a ""huge threat"" to the city's fabric overall, said Eli Dvorkin, editorial and policy director at the Center for an Urban Organization, which advocates for policies that make New York City more equitable.

""That's a huge problem for New York which has been so dependent on its role as a cultural capital of the world,"" he said.

""As a city we can't afford to lose our creative edge. It's been one of the key drivers of the city's economic growth over the past decades,"" Dvorkin added. ""It's one of the reasons why I think New York maintains its status as a beacon for creative, innovative people from all over the world.""","Without waiter jobs, what happens to creative New York?",1,0.12997885852693347
679,"LONDON, ONT. -- Casinos and slots across southwestern Ontario will remain closed, despite permission to open during Stage 3.

“It has been a challenge with the 50-person capacity. It really comes down to economic viability,” explains Paul Burns, CEO of the Canadian Gaming Association.

Burns says the province’s decision to limit occupancy in enclosed spaces to 50 people is too few to cover operating costs for most gaming sites.

In London, each day the 755 slots and e-table games at Western Fair sit idle costs city hall its share of gaming revenue.

“That’s dramatic. That’s has a dramatic impact on our budget,” says Mayor Ed Holder. “We generate about $4.5 million in terms of revenues as a result of the Gateway Casino (games).”

By the end of August, London city hall projects it will face a $13.5 million budget deficit caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Lost revenue from slots accounts for about $2.5 million of the shortfall. And the economic impacts extend beyond city hall.

When the province ordered gaming facilities to close on March 16, Gateway Casinos employed about 350 people at its Western Fair site.

Construction of a new casino complex on Wonderland Road has been paused until Gateway can reopen its other locations in Ontario.

On Monday, casino operators will make a pitch to public health officials in Ontario to permit more than 50 patrons if they follow new procedures established by the industry. But even if the industry is successful, gaming won’t return immediately.

“Casinos will probably need a couple weeks if capacities are increased to get prepared to be open"", Burns says. Holder adds, “The message is safety first.”",Municipalities betting on casino revenue to address deficits out of luck,0,0.4628892738532562
682,"For 111 days from March 26 until July 15 B.C. bars and restaurants were legally permitted to fill growlers of draft beer for customers to take away.

But few people knew, or were able to take advantage of it.

That’s because the temporary rule change by the Liquor and Cannabis Regulation Branch was designed to help restaurants, which were take-out only at the time, to be able to sell beer from kegs that were opened prior to the COVID-19 shutdown. The temporary permit was reversed in a July 13 policy update that extended the sale of packaged beer and wine from stores until Oct. 31.

“A lot of restaurants and brewery tasting rooms had surplus draft beer around, so they were allowed to use that to fill growlers,” said Ian Tostenson, president and CEO of the B.C. Restaurant and Foodservices Association. “It wasn’t [advertised], because you don’t want to [advertise] something you will run out of.”

READ ALSO: So you think you’re not a beer drinker

In the meantime, it stoked a small discussion in the industry as some customers liked it, said one rep from a local craft brewery. Some restaurants also abused the rule, which was supposed to be limited to a 1.9-litre growler or a 650ml bomber.

“There was examples of mason jars and other containers being used that were not laid out by the liquor regulation,” said Ken Beattie, executive director of the British Columbia Craft Brewers Guild.

Growler fills have now reverted back to only those establishments with a brewery manufacturing licence, which is the way breweries have always liked it, Beattie said.

“It’s been the lifeblood of new breweries to have growler sales, and tasting rooms,” Beattie said. “The guild of brewers advocated for it to protect the product, which is best fresh off the tap, the best beer you can have, and it drives traffic to ensure sales.”

In fact, for as popular as they are at many breweries, growlers are likely to be phased out at some breweries around B.C.

That’s because the reliance on growlers has decreased thanks to the advancement of mobile packaging companies which show up to can and bottle beer at small breweries, Beattie added. Having their own in-house packaging is a cost many brewers can’t afford. Other advancements – such as the “crowler,” a one-litre can – are also changing things by holding large amounts of beer, like a growler, but keeping it fresher for longer.

The reality is there aren’t a lot of requests for the right to serve growlers that the B.C. Restaurant and Foodservices Association is hearing about, Tostenson said.

“It’s getting into their turf, it’s really the domain of the brewers and it’s not a fight that we’re [taking on],” Tostenson said.

686,"Video posted online of a downtown Toronto restaurant seemingly skirting COVID-19 restrictions has ignited a social media firestorm, and triggered an investigation by both municipal and provincial officials.

The video shows a July 10 birthday party inside Marbl at 455 King St. W. — the location formerly belonging to troubled eatery Fring’s that was co-owned by Toronto rapper Drake.

MARBL on King St. has once again shown they don’t give a damn about physical distancing.

Keeping bar and restaurant patrons safe when Toronto transitions into Stage 3 of the province’s COVID-19 re-opening plan — which would allow the use of indoor dining areas — is of primary concern to the city.

Speaking at a press conference on Monday, Toronto Mayor John Tory said the incident was under investigation by “a number of bodies,” including the province’s Alcohol and Gaming Commission.

A restaurant spokesperson told The Canadian Press the video isn’t an accurate representation of the entire evening, and that the evening’s thunderstorms prompted staff to “bring the group under the covered portion of our patio to finish the evening.”

Tory said on Monday that such an explanation isn’t an excuse for what appears in the video.

“It was made fairly clear at the beginning that when indoor dining wasn’t permitted … that people who are on the outdoor patios would have to seek shelter elsewhere other than piling into these establishments,” Tory said.

“So even if that turns out to be the explanation, which I believe was the one that was offered, it isn’t consistent with the policy that was outlined right from the beginning.”

Late last month, fellow King St. W. bar Goldie saw their liquor licence revoked after a Toronto police investigation discovered a large secret party inside the nightclub on June 26.

Charges for failing to comply with emergency orders were also filed against the management.

687,"Toronto’s gyms and fitness centres maybe closed — but many have moved their programs outdoors, offering open air workouts to help their clients stay fit and keep the social connections they’ve created alive. “We developed a pretty tight-knit family,” before the shutdown, said Jamie De Cicco, manager of fitness centre F45’s downtown franchise. “So once we were able to organize our first several outdoor classes, it was more about getting people back into working out with their friends.” De Cicco and Matt Webster, manager of the F45 Liberty Village location, said so far their outdoor programs have had a good turnout. They offer classes to members on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays at 7:30 a.m. in Liberty Village and Regent Park. They have spots for nine people in each session. All F45 locations are looking forward to reopening safely when the province gives the nod, Webster said, adding that they may continue outdoor classes if the demand is there. “We are going to prioritize the in-studio experience and the safety protocols there, but if there’s a way for us to continue doing the F45 Track, or the outdoor boot camps, then we may,” Webster said. F45 isn’t the only gym in the city that has adapted for COVID-19 protocols to retain and engage their clientele. At Sweat and Tonic on Yonge and Shuter streets, the first outdoor classes in mid-June were such a hit, the gym added more to its weekly schedule. Classes have nine participants, all social distancing, and range from HIIT, to yoga, to running. They take place either at 50 Gould St. on Ryerson’s Campus or at the Underpass Park at 29 Lower River St. Bolo, at 364 Richmond St. W., holds a strength and agility class Friday mornings at Stanley Park, outdoor boxing on Mondays at 6 p.m. at Canoe Landing and a run on Tuesday evenings. RedLeaf Fitness launched its outdoor programs June 25 outside the gym at 662 Caledonia Rd., and posted the socially distancing workout groups to its Instagram account. Some of these classes are open to non-members who can pay per class or for a number of classes. It’s different for every gym. Prices range from $20 and $45 per session depending on the activity. Sweat and Tonic charges $20 per outdoor fitness class. ",Gyms working out new ways to stay active in the age of COVID-19,5,0.11743671769283648

Battered deep-fried pork balls with gloopy dayglo red sauce? According to Uber Eats, butter chicken topped national doorstep drop-offs during our housebound heyday. While poutine came in second, more naan than fries zipped down our streets and more shawarma than onion rings. The rest of the list — miso soup, pad Thai, bubble tea and edamame — tells a story of how we’re eating now: More than half of us born after the mid-1960s were already used to scrolling and clicking to fill our bellies before March. Also, surveys reveal the younger we are, the more likely we’ll fill our plates with foods our parents and grandparents won’t eat. It seems as our understandings and experiences broaden, so do our palates. A friend and I have a decade-long on-again-off-again conversation about Indian restaurants. I grew up eating the best South Indian food in Waterloo Region — note: my mum’s cooking is the best. That’s not up for debate — while my friend is giddily incandescent about a place that’s … lacking. A few months ago, she shoved a takeout menu for Sahar’s Kitchen into my hand and implored, “This place is so much better. You have to try it. You have to.” It was like she switched from Android to iPhone, Coke to Pepsi, the Leafs to, well, anyone.  Sahar’s Kitchen’s familiar collection of foods hopscotches across the Indian subcontinent. Along with those rooted in Bengali, Chettiar, Goan, Mughlai and Pakistani traditions, others are from the Anglo-Indian canon. With a family story that stretches from Pakistan to Bangladesh to Hong Kong, Majid Maqbool joined his wife, Jhorna, in Kitchener in 2015. Before this, he was cooking at a family restaurant in Hong Kong.  The plan was always to return to the restaurateur life here. Two years ago they opened, naming their restaurant after their now four-year-old daughter — Sahar means dawn’s light. Here, the couple, along with Mian Maqbool Sabry (Majid’s father), turn out some fine dishes from the cosy restaurant’s kitchen.  Unlidding containers reveals complex aromas and flavours buoyed by texture and colour. Rivulets of brick red oils swirl atop luscious crimson and russet gravies. Spices speckle pallid sweet sauces. Textures wander from firm to sticky to voluptuously soft. The Butter Chicken’s ($15.99) chunks of breast meat are tender and swathed in a rounded, rich, tomato gravy. Unlike the tinned tomato soupiness that’s sometimes found elsewhere, its light sweetness doesn’t overpower. The King Prawn Chettinad ($17.99) is punchy with a pleasantly creeping heat that doesn’t overpower. The gravy’s depth is boosted from the firm tail-on shrimp — here, the gravy is to be sopped up.  For okra fans, the Bhindi Bhaji ($14.99) combines firm and slippery chunks with slithers of silky onion, fried in mild spices. There’s a mild tang to the Bharta’s ($14.99) soft mash of grilled eggplant from the tomato masala.  Mixing the wet and dry dishes into the nutty, aromatic Basmati ($3.99), jeera rice flecked with grains of saffron rice, brings everything together. The soft, bubbly Garlic Naan ($3.99) — blistered from the tandoor and scattered with chopped garlic and coriander — is perfect for sopping up puddles of gravy. Soaked in sweetened rosewater-scented cream, the Rasmalai’s ($2.99) cheesecake-like paneer is moreish. And whether you call it kheer, payasam or Rice Pudding ($2.99), the loose, butter yellow pudding is flavoured with cardamom and studded with cashews. Both are needed desserts for hot nights.

689,"MONTREAL -- In one Montreal restaurant, patrons are getting a fashion-food two-for-one: Mannequins placed at tables not only ensure social distancing but also sport chic outfits that can be purchased to benefit charity.

With Quebec province at the forefront of Canada's coronavirus pandemic, businesses have been reopening cautiously.

Le Monarque, a fashionable restaurant in Old Montreal, reopened its doors just a few days ago -- but not without putting some creative safety measures in place first.

""We wanted to give customers more space,"" chef and owner Jeremie Bastien told AFP. ""But we didn't want to remove tables or put up Plexiglas panels.""

BRINGING WORLDS TOGETHER

So when Le Monarque fired up its ovens a few days ago, it took several steps to ensure social distancing.

The idea of filling some seats with mannequins, thus providing separation between human clients, came from the team behind the Sarah Pacini clothing line, including prominent Quebec menswear designer Philippe Dubuc.

""We wanted to make a stylish, high-end installation because we are bringing two worlds together, those of fashion and gastronomy,"" said Dubuc, adding, ""I think these two worlds have always been close.""

The restaurant's 29 mannequins all sport Sarah Pacini and Philippe Dubuc designs. They are meant to be ""visually beautiful,"" both inspired by and fitting in with their elegant surroundings.

""We are there, of course, to create and market our clothing,"" Dubuc said. ""But we are also there because our job is to make people dream.""

SILENT AUCTION

Nassim Habashi, who was enjoying lunch at Le Monarque, approved, saying, ""I think it's a wonderful idea both to mark the separation between tables and to make the atmosphere much more pleasant, given the current situation.""

At the end of each meal clients are given a gift certificate redeemable in Sarah Pacini and Philippe Dubuc outlets.

Chef Bastien says the partnership has been ""very advantageous"" for both sides. But he stresses that it is about more than just ""creating distance or dressing up the space.""

The idea, he said, was to ""go a bit deeper (and) figure out what we can do to help the people around us who have suffered during the pandemic.""

699,"WINDSOR, ONT. -- Ontario Premier Doug Ford came through with a promise by getting his hair cut in Leamington, the last area of the province to advance to Stage 2 of reopening.

Ford stopped in the southwestern Ontario town Thursday for his long-awaited cut and meetings with local farmers and business owners.

The premier chose Mastronardi Barbering for his first haircut since the COVID-19 emergency orders were put in place in March, closing hair salons.

“Very exciting, it really fulfills my heart,” said shop owner Henry Matronardi, who added he felt no pressure.

When the region was excluded from advancing with the rest of the province last month, Ford promised he would visit the area to get clipped.

“I’m just so happy to be here with the people of Leamington and Kingsville they’re just down to earth people. I absolutely love them,” Ford said in a video he posted on Twitter.

It’s so great to be here in #Leamington with my new friend and champion barber Henry! While he was giving me my great cut I learned about his family and how his business are recovering from #COVID19. pic.twitter.com/72jmBkUW4G — Doug Ford (@fordnation) July 16, 2020

Leamington and Kingsville were the last municipalities in the province to move to Stage 2 of reopening last week. The other five municipalities in Windsor-Essex advanced to Stage 2 on June 25.

Ford said it was due to the high number of COVID-19 cases in the local agri-farm sector. On Thursday the Windsor-Essex County Health Unit said there are still about 150 active cases in farm workers in the region.

The region has been excluded from Stage 3 plans so far.

Ford will also be making another COVID-19-related announcement at 3:30 p.m. on Thursday, as he continues an eight-week province-wide summer tour.

His news briefing will be at Craven Farms in Chatham with the Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs Ernie Hardeman. CTVNewsWindsor.ca will stream the announcement live.

Essex MPP Taras Natyshak said Ford should be taking more action to curb the spread of COVID-19 in the region.

He said Ford has held the region back from re-opening because the virus continues to sweep through, but has not tested the majority of farm workers, or managed the quarantine of workers arriving from other countries.

“Doug Ford is campaigning on a vanity tour of the province while our region is still crying out for help,” said Natyshak. “For months, we have been calling on Ford to take action, and make the necessary investment to get outbreaks under control. He still refuses to do that and it’s families and local businesses that are left to suffer the consequences of his failures.”

Ford said both farmers and workers are now cooperating with getting tested. On June 24, Ontario announced a three-point plan to stop COVID-19 outbreaks in Windsor-Essex.","Ontario Premier Doug Ford gets haircut in Leamington, meets with farmers",2,0.24309173409213014
700,"TORONTO -- Canada's largest cinema chain says it's in no rush to re-open its theatres in Ontario, as provincial reopening guidelines appear to limit occupancy to only 50 patrons at a time.

While Stage 3 of Ontario’s reopening guidelines will permit movie theatres in a wide swath of the province to open this Friday, Cineplex says it will not do so.

“We are still reviewing what's being proposed by the province, so as a result we aren’t in a position to open our theatres in Ontario on Friday,” company spokesperson Sarah Van Lange told BNN.“While we are certainly excited for the day our operations can resume, our top priority has always been the health and safety of our employees and guests and ensuring that their time with us is safe, comfortable and welcoming.”

Ontario’s Stage 3 reopening guidelines state that movie theatres are subject to an occupancy limit of 50 people, excluding staff.

Most large movie theatres in the province could comfortably contain many times that.

Cineplex has 62 multiplexes in Ontario.

Landmark, a chain with ten cinema locations in Ontario, told CP24 the rules as they stand will prevent theatres from opening in the province at all.

“(Ontario’s rules) will prevent the re-opening of movie theatres across the province,” a spokesperson said Wednesday.

“The provision to limit movie theatres to 50 Guests does not recognize the configuration of our properties and the personal space that is afforded to each Guest. Theatres control showtimes, seating layouts, and auditorium capacity to ensure physical distancing can be maintained at all times.”

Speaking on Monday, Finance Minister Rod Phillips said the province was working with theatre operators to find a solution where theatres could possibly welcome more than 50 guests at a time.

“This is an area where Minister (Lisa) McLeod has already been working with the associations that represent theatres, to work on that safe reopening plan that I talked about so you know the kinds of considerations that the Chief Medical Officer is concerned about of course is you know how many washrooms are there, the concession stands, making sure that there aren't too many people so it isn't just about the theatre rooms themselves, it's about the broader facility,” he said.

Provincial industry-specific guidelines don’t appear to be ready for theatres either.

While the province has put out guidance for entertainment, museum and gallery workers, no specific guidance document or advice has been provided for cinemas.

The industry was forced to shut down entirely on March 17 as part of the Ford government’s emergency declaration, which also shut schools, restaurants, daycares and most other indoor spaces.

Ontario’s guidance for cinemas takes a much different approach than other jurisdictions. In Alberta, distancing measures mean cinemas can fill up to about 45 per cent occupancy.

Calaway Park is back up and running with a different look for its 2020 campaign that will see smaller crowds compared to years past and staggered entry for guests throughout the day.

The park, situated west of Calgary city limits, will reopen to season pass holders Friday and the general public the following day. All guests will be required to reserve an entry ahead of time and purchase all tickets online.

""We’ve been given ordinance to go ahead at this time, but with significant restrictions and we really want our guests to know that,"" said Calaway Park’s general manager, Bob Williams.

Williams adds that the park will be open to about one-third of its normal capacity of guests. Not every major attraction at the park will be open either as several rides are temporarily closed until at least Stage 3 of Alberta’s economic relaunch.

The Vortex, Chaos, Ocean Motion, Adrenaline Test Zone, Free Fallin’, and Wave Rider attractions will remain closed to guests.

""These rides are rides where somebody might be screaming or yelling out of joy and the droplets gets spread,"" Williams explained.

All rides will be wiped down by staff between each use. Staff members will also be screened with temperatures checks before entering the park and required to wear masks.

Guests are not required to wear a mask on the park grounds, but they will be mandated on some rides and encouraged in higher traffic areas including lineups.

The majority of food kiosks and retails stores will reopen with social distancing measures including limits on the number of customers allowed at a time. The park’s lone sit-down restaurant will remain closed.

Calaway Park is open daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. with plans to extend its hours to 7 p.m. once the province enters Stage 3.

The gallery on Sussex Drive begins the first phase of reopening on Saturday, with reduced hours and physical distancing protocols in place to help limit the spread of COVID-19. Admission will be free this weekend for visitors.

The gallery will be open Thursday to Sunday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. It will remain open until 8 p.m. on Thursdays.

The National Gallery of Canada's Chief of Marketing, Communications and New Media Gay Decker told CTV Morning Live ""we are so excited to be welcoming visitors back to the National Gallery of Canada.""

All national museums in Ottawa and Gatineau closed in mid-March due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Decker said the National Gallery of Canada established committees to develop the protocols to reopen the museum safely for the public. Special signage will remain visitors of physical distancing measures and indicate the route to follow during the visit.

""The key thing to know is that we've changed the visitor journey so now we only have one entrance and one exit,"" said Decker on Friday morning.

""The reason we've done that is we want to closely monitor the number of people coming into the gallery at any one time.""

Decker says masks will be available for any visitor that doesn't have a mask, and hand sanitizer will be available throughout the gallery.

Capacity has been reduced to 30 per cent of normal to encourage physical distancing.

707,"TORONTO -- Canadian gamblers are trading in cards and chips for temperature checks, hand sanitizer, face masks and disinfecting wipes.

As casinos across the country open, the gaming floor looks decidedly different. For the most part, table games are closed and there are fewer slot machines to choose. Reminders about physical distancing are scattered about on floors, walls, doors and around elevators.

Many amenities are closed. Forget valet service, buffets, live shows, spas and nightclubs. Casinos are built for escapism, but there is no escaping COVID-19.

Casinos are applying the same kind of cleaning discipline once reserved for washrooms to their entire site, using long-lasting antimicrobial sprays to disinfect surfaces, wiping down slot machines between each use, and providing disinfectant wipes and sanitizer throughout the gaming floor.

Many casinos are no longer open 24 hours, instead closing down for a few hours each morning to clean.

Plastic barriers are common at slots, gaming tables and food and beverage counters, and a number of casinos are employing technology to minimize the need for lines, including live count capacity monitors and apps that tell casino visitors when it’s their time to enter.

Those who enjoy casinos want to get back to the machines and tables after three or four months of dark gaming floors, says Paul Burns, CEO of the Canadian Gaming Association. But they understand the experience is going to be different, just like every other facet of public life.

“Where we’ve had reopenings, demand has been good. Customers do want to come back but they also want to know it’s safe. We have to get this right for customers.”

WHERE CASINOS ARE REOPENING

Alberta was the first province to reopen its casinos. It isn’t requiring masks, though strongly recommends them, and also hasn’t set capacity restrictions beyond requiring a two-metre distance.

Casinos in all the Atlantic provinces are allowed to reopen (except Newfoundland and Labrador, where they have been illegal for many years.) But some operators in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick have yet to reopen.

Saskatchewan reopened its casinos last week and beginning Friday, casinos are permitted to reopen in the parts of Ontario that are entering Stage 3.

Quebec’s casinos will reopen over the next few weeks.

Manitoba and British Columbia have not reopened casinos. Health authorities in B.C. have included casinos in its Phase 4 plan, along with conventions, live professional sports, concerts and international tourism. That phase requires a vaccine, broad community immunity or successful treatments.

But casino operators are lobbying the provincial government to allow them to open their doors with approved health and safety plans.

It’s a safe bet casinos are big business.

There were 114 casinos in Canada when pandemic measures closed every one of them in a 72-hour period in March. According to the Canadian Gaming Association, the gaming industry accounts for more than 182,000 jobs in this country, along with revenues to governments and charities of $9.2 billion and spending on goods and services of about $14.6 billion.

‘GNAWING IN MY STOMACH’

But how many gamblers are willing to wager on a casino outing?

Marcia Coward-Wilson used to visit a Vancouver Island casino at least once a week, sometimes more. Vacations with her partner were planned around trips to casinos and it wasn’t uncommon for the couple to make a day’s road trip to visit all six casinos on the island in one day.

But due to the pandemic, Coward-Wilson, 66, says she won’t see the inside of a casino for a very long time.

“I certainly will not be going back when they open,” she said from her home in Merville, B.C.

Coward-Wilson has an auto-immune disease and worries about crowds, recirculated air and all the touched surfaces inside a casino.

“And COVID is still an unknown. Every day, you hear something new about it.”

Coward-Wilson says she won’t risk being able to see her three-year-old granddaughter to visit a casino. And she doesn’t think it would be that much fun anyway, what will all the worrying about getting too close to people and what she’s touched.

“I get a gnawing in my stomach that tells me I don’t want to go near a casino anytime soon.”

But many have shown their eagerness to get back to the casino floor.

News reports documented a long line of people outside Casino Regina when the doors were opened for the first time in three months on July 9.

In just three hours, the casino reached its maximum capacity of 250.

Jason Agecoutay in Yorkton, Sask. says he and his spouse were among those at the casino a few days later. He said there were “some great protocols in place” and he will return soon, though he hopes to see more staff wiping down slots next time.

The casino’s visitors have to undergo a health screening at the door, but masks are optional. The casino has spaced out its slot machines and reduced its hours of operation to allow for more cleaning.

“Maybe the biggest thing that impressed me was that they had machines turned off so you are forced to social distance while playing,” he told CTVNews.ca by email. “Unlike other casinos where they just ask you to social distance and leave all the machines running, you can clearly see the focus is on patron protection and not on making money.”

SAFETY MEASURES

Many casinos have detailed their reopening plans or operating protocols on their websites.

The yet-to-be-reopened South Beach Casino in Scanterbury, Man. says it will have slot attendants offering disinfecting wipes to players, disinfecting machines at least once every two hours, and completing a log of each machine’s sanitization schedule.

Elevator capacity is capped at four people and buttons will be sanitized at least once an hour.

Casino de Montreal, which is reopening Aug. 3, will open six sections at a maximum of 250 people each. Guests are asked to book their visit through a new RSVP system to get “priority access.”

Masks are mandatory, and visitors must sanitize their hands at the entrance and exit and when arriving and leaving tables. Casino-goers will be supplied with a stylus pen so they can avoid touching devices.

Slots are either spaced out or divided with plastic barriers, machines are only activated by an attendant if they’ve been disinfected and physical distancing is in place.

The casino will not operate valet service or coat check and even urinals are closed due to physical distancing.

Some table games have been modified so that only dealers handle chips and those that require players to touch cards, such as poker, will be closed. Players will be separated from each other and from the dealer by a plastic screen.

Quebec casinos will be the first to offer table games in Canada under COVID-19 restrictions. In some cases, health authorities have prohibited them, but in others, casino operators have determined they can’t make a go of running them under physical distancing measures when only two or three players can sit at a table, says Burns at the Canadian Gaming Association.

Other operators are installing barriers on the tables and will open them down the road.

NOT ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE IN ONTARIO

Many of Ontario’s casinos can reopen Friday, when much of the province enters Stage 3 of reopening. That excludes the Golden Horseshoe and Windsor-Essex, which will remain in Stage 2.

Under provincial guidelines, Ontario’s casinos cannot operate table games or buffets, must require face masks for customers, and must submit a reopening plan to the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario, which regulates casinos.

In the new phase, Ontario is increasing its indoor capacity limit to 50 people, and while Burns says he understands where health authorities are coming from, it’s not an economically feasible number for casinos.

“At 50 people, there is not a casino that will reopen.”

Gateway Casinos, which operates 12 sites across Ontario, has announced it won’t open any of its casinos Friday and has no timeline for doing so. Great Canadian Gaming Corporation’s website does not include any reopening information for any of its 13 sites in Ontario.

Burns says the industry is continuing to work with the province and the regulator to demonstrate “our operators are prepared to bring in limits that are responsible and safe.”

He says the province’s casinos have developed “very detailed and robust plans” to reopen that are being reviewed by public health experts before submission to the province. Burns points out that casinos already have surveillance systems that will make it easy to monitor the movement of people and to deal with people who are congregating.

Many of Ontario’s casino operators have sites in other jurisdictions where they have been allowed to open in compliance with public health guidelines. That direct experience, along with studying what is being done around the world, will only help the reopening process in Canada’s most populous province, says Burns.

But there are many moving parts, including new training of staff, getting buildings ready with signs and a newly spaced out gaming floor, figuring out how to deliver various games, and preparing adjacent amenities to reopen, including restaurants, hotels and salons.

“There is a great deal of experience and dedication going into this process,” he told CTV News from Toronto. “No one is going to rush to reopen.”

And certainly no one wants to reopen, only to close again for an outbreak.

THE ALBERTA EXPERIENCE

The five Alberta casinos owned by Century Casinos reopened June 13 and are operating at roughly 40 per cent of pre-COVID-19 capacity, said Geoff Smith, senior vice-president of operations.

With some “well-designed Plexiglass barriers” in place, about 50 per cent of the slot machines are open. In some cases, slots have been spread out to allow two-metre separation, in other cases, some have simply been turned off.

Employees are wearing masks at all Century casinos and they are required for visitors at three sites, Smith told CTVNews.ca from Edmonton. He says masks are “highly encouraged” at the other two sites and required when two metres of distance isn’t possible.

“I’d say, all together at all our casinos a high percentage are wearing them – north of 80 per cent.”

Casino visitors go through a wellness check and have their temperatures taken if there is any reason for concern, says Smith. Employees’ temperatures are taken every day before they enter the premises. Century implemented an ambassador job for management-level employees whose sole responsibility is to ensure COVID-19 measures are followed.

Smith says the “optics of the experience” are crucial, so that customers feel safe. A large portion of the casino’s normal clientele are 55-plus and some of that crowd hasn’t returned, he says. But at times, especially just after reopening, there were some lines on the weekends.

Live entertainment isn’t happening and Century Casinos are shifting their large promotional draws online beginning in August, says Smith. But restaurants are open and so is a comedy club at Century Casino Edmonton, with an occupancy limit of 100, and horse-racing tracks with up to 200 spectators.

“I think we can still provide the fun and entertainment people want but in a secure, responsible way. The close proximity and mingling of crowds has stopped, and who knows for how long.”

There is no indication from the province when table games will be permitted, but when poker and blackjack and the like is allowed again, River Cree Resort and Casino in Enoch, Alta. will be ready, says marketing director Jayme Behm.

The casino has already sourced specially-designed dividers to separate players from each other and from the dealer and has bought a chip sanitizer that looks like a big washing machine, says Behm. Each time trays of chips come to the cash cage, they will get a spin through the sanitizer.

River Cree, which is owned and operated by the Cree Nation just outside Edmonton, used its time during shutdown to install plastic barriers between each of its 1,350 slot machines, allowing each one to stay in operation.

Masks are not mandated at River Cree, except for employees who work in close quarters and for servers and bartenders. And guests are not undergoing health screenings to enter.

But the casino is providing complimentary masks, hand sanitizers and wipes (the latter in bright yellow canisters), and has a designated “extreme clean team” circulating the floor to wipe down surfaces. There is a hotline number patrons can call if anything needs attention or to report physical distancing violations or someone possibly displaying COVID-19 symptoms.

The casino also has real-time capacity scanners at every entrance, which indicate how many guests are in each of two casinos (a smaller one allows smoking). That allows managers to make “proactive and informed decisions” about capping capacity when it seems physical distancing can’t be maintained, says Behm.

The casino is exploring cashless and other no-touch technology and has already replaced the tradition of “hand pays” for slots jackpots, where winners had bills counted into their hands at the machine, with a credit slip paid out at the cash cage.

Head counts and traffic are definitely down over last year, says Behm, but that’s not surprising given live entertainment and big giveaways of jackpots and cars that bring crowds are all on ice for now.

The fear of the virus is certainly a factor, too.

“Some people are comfortable with going out and some people are not, whether that’s the grocery store, the casino or their uncle’s house. Some are not willing to come back yet.”

THIS VIRUS LOVES THE INDOORS

Raywat Deonandan, an epidemiologist and associate professor at the University of Ottawa, says he’s not generally a casino goer, but if he was, he wouldn’t be going right now.

“This virus loves indoor clustering of people and casinos are set up to gather people around slots and gaming tables,” he said.

Standing around with strangers, whether that’s in lines, around slots and tables or in bars or restaurants, poses a danger. The risk is amplified the closer people are and the longer they stay close.

“The second wave will be triggered by a super-spreading event and that’s going to be some sort of indoor mass gathering, whether that’s a church, a bar, a casino or a concert.”

He says Canada continues to ride a delicate balance between opening its economy and letting people live their lives, while controlling virus numbers.

“So that means looking at what’s really necessary and what’s a luxury,” he said. Schools, stores and factories could be seen as necessities, while things like bars, casinos and movie theatres are luxuries.

He acknowledges casinos in particular are big employers and even bigger generators of revenue for governments, but the risk is evident, he said.

It’s possible to minimize the threat, but it does take effort, time and resources, said Deonandan. The key is to keep the number of people inside a casino small and spread out. And he says masks should be mandatory for everyone at all times.

“That’s just not something you can get around.”

Employees should be doubly protected – with masks to handle outward transmission and visors to protect against inward transmission.

As for temperature checks, the professor thinks they may catch a few carriers of the virus, but fevers can easily be suppressed with over-the-counter medications and those who are infected but are asymptomatic or haven’t developed symptoms yet won’t be flagged by a thermometer.

It’s more important, he says, that casinos offer plenty of hand washing and sanitizing stations, along with strong messaging about hygiene, physical distancing, and not touching the face. And while the risk of surface transmission is believed to be low, it’s still important to properly and frequently disinfect the things that people touch.

Casinos also must invest in maintaining and upgrading air filtration systems and to ensure air is always moving, says Deonandan.

Surveillance and enforcement, something casinos are already adept at, are going to be critical to maintain physical distancing, says the professor. It will change the casino experience for many and maybe improve it for some.

“It’s really about what motivates someone to be in a casino. Are you there to socialize or to sit by yourself and gamble at a slot machine?” he said. In some cases, pandemic measures may boost the comfort level. Instead of jockeying for a spot at a craps table or sitting elbow-to-elbow playing poker, Deonandan says barriers to keep people apart could be made to feel like individual, spacious booths.

“Casinos have the resources and the motivation to get it right. They are motivated to get people in and keep them in, so people have to feel safe.”

SOUTH OF THE BORDER

The reality of the coronavirus has even hit home in Sin City.

Las Vegas, which opened its famed casino strip on June 4 to headlines about larger-than-expected crowds ignoring physical distancing and hardly a mask in sight, has now seen the majority of its operators institute mandatory temperature checks and masks for guests and employees.

Dice are splashed with sanitizer after every throw and dealers stand behind plastic shields. There are also plastic barriers between every two seats at bars.

But New Jersey took it a step further, deciding to ban alcohol (or drinks of any kind), eating and smoking in its nine casinos in Atlantic City, while limiting capacity to 25 per cent.

Many casinos in New York state are going the same route. Gamblers can only get water and non-alcoholic drinks at Oneida Nations Enterprises’ three casinos and must drink them from a straw with their masks in place. It is also among a number of the state’s casinos limiting entry to those who live within 160 kilometres. And if you live in 19 U.S. states that have elevated levels of COVID-19, you’ll be turned away.

The entry procedure, included in the casinos’ 25-page reopening plan, includes swiping ID to prove you’re not from a restricted state, lowering a face covering for three seconds to be visually checked, putting the mask back, and grabbing hand sanitizer.

Kewadin Casino in Michigan is recommending that those with “compromised immunity or vulnerabilities not visit,” and is prohibiting any congregating around slots. Mystic Lake casino in Prior Lake, Minn. is taking temperatures, limiting on-site smoking and providing an on-site health clinic for staff.

An anti-smoking group in the United States says about 170 casinos have gone smoke-free in the wake of COVID-19.

A TOUCHLESS CASINO

Some of the changes COVID-19 has wrought could be here to stay, says Burns at the CGA, but that likely depends on how long the virus poses a threat. What is for sure is that the pandemic is forcing innovation in a way few things could.

Long a bastion of cash, this pandemic, and the resulting reluctance or downright fear of handing bills, could push the casino industry to embrace digital payment options. Few casinos allow for contactless or mobile payments and many regulators don’t allow it. But the feeling is that the coronavirus will accelerate the conversation.

The CGA has been working on plans for going cashless for more than a year, says Burns. It recently released a technical proposal for the adoption of debit or cards or digital apps, such as Apply Pay, Google Pay, and PayPal and is now collecting industry feedback.

“We started looking into it last year but the pandemic has had a way of escalating timelines,” he said. “It’s not going to happen immediately, but these tools will find their way to the gaming floors in the coming months.”

The American Gaming Association in June found that 57 per cent of people who visited a casino in the past year said the option to use digital payments on the casino floor is important to them and 59 per cent said they are less likely to use cash because of COVID-19.

The trade group said alternatives should be available to anyone uneasy about using cash. And it said that limit setting within digital platforms – both in terms of dollars and time spent playing – could encourage people to gamble responsibly.

And innovation could ultimately lead to a fully touchless slot experience. Las Vegas-based Scientific Games has developed a mobile wallet and app that connects by Bluetooth to a slot machine. The player operates the machine from their phone and if they win, the money can go right back to their bank account or be turned into casino credits.

The company has also created a platform that notifies floor staff when a player leaves a machine so that it can be sanitized and tells a player through an app how recently a device was cleaned. When a player connects, the machines on either side become inoperable to maintain physical distancing.","New Normal: Casinos betting on temperature checks, chip cleaners",5,0.06080464202945668

710,"Like they say, when it rains, it pours.

And boy is it ever going to pour in Toronto this weekend.

A major rain storm on “steroids” will start overnight Friday and could leave up to 50 mm of the wet stuff by the time it’s all over Sunday night.

“A real whopper of a system,” Environment Canada’s senior climatologist David Phillips said Friday, describing the storm as “a significant event.”

“Every single conceivable weather warning and condition is part of this massive system. It’s a powerful storehouse of weather even for January,” he said. ” It’s got subtropical moisture from the gulf of Mexico just loaded with moisture and it is coming northward.”

“The question (for Toronto) is when will it turn to freezing rain? And most of the indications right now are that it will be the evening on Saturday,” Phillips added.

Environment Canada has issued a special weather statement for Toronto calling it “a soaker” with “very strong southwest winds Sunday.”

The temperature, meanwhile, is expected to get up to a balmy 11C on Saturday (the record high for Jan. 11 of 11. 7C was set in 1975) before plunging to a high of 2C (still above normal) on Sunday.

The rain is expected to be continuous and heavy at times all day Saturday and into Sunday morning.

“The average we get of rain in Toronto in January would be around 25 mm,” said Phillips. “So what we’re going to get in one day, in one 24-hour period, is going to exceed what we normally get in 31 days.”

Strong southwest winds are also expected Sunday morning, especially along the Lake Ontario shoreline, with gusts up to 90 km/h.

The Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) also issued a statement Thursday saying “a flood outlook” was in effect until Sunday and “all shorelines, rivers and streams within the GTA should be considered hazardous,” and “any children or pets should be kept away from any slippery or unstable banks.”

Meanwhile, the City of Toronto sent out a press release Friday saying “Toronto Water’s storm readiness plan is in place,” and crews are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week to answer flooding calls at 311.

Otherwise, residents are being asked to clear catch basins on their streets to avoid potential street and basement flooding and “move valuables from basement to shelves or upper floors, and take cleaners, paint or chemicals off the floor as not to further contaminate potential floodwater.”

They’re also being told to keep eavestroughs and downspouts clear and shovel any snow or ice away from their foundation and onto their lawn not the road.

718,"Cowichan Valley has the honour of being the first sub-GI outside of the Okanagan

Blue Grouse’s winemaker led the initiative, but it would not have been possible without the enthusiastic co-operation of every winery and grape grower in the valley (Citizen file)

Buyers across the province will soon be able to pick up a bottle of wine marked as from the Cowichan Valley thanks to a new sub-geographical designation now officially being recognized under B.C. law.

“Officially recognizing the Cowichan Valley as a distinct and unique wine grape-growing region in B.C. is a testament to the hard work, passion and dedication of the many local entrepreneurs and staff in the wine industry,” said Sonia Furstenau, MLA for Cowichan Valley. “This is a well-deserved accomplishment for all those involved in producing exceptional wines and memorable winery experiences.”

According to a press release issued Friday morning, “defining geographic zones on wine labels connects consumers with the unique geographic area the grapes are grown and the wine is made in and increases exposure to the region for both wine and tourism businesses.”

The Cowichan Valley sub-GI is roughly defined as the area between the Cowichan watershed, the eastern coastline from Mill Bay to Maple Bay and the western area of Cowichan Lake.

“The Cowichan is home to family-owned and operated wineries and grape growers who have been part of the valley for generations,” said Lana Popham, Minister of Agriculture. “They take pride in the wines they produce and recognizing their hard work, skills and growing reputation on the B.C. and international stage is overdue. They make great wine in the Cowichan from the grapes grown in the valley, and the designation both respects and promotes that.”

The Cowichan Valley has the honour of being the first sub-GI outside of the Okanagan and joins the Golden Mile Bench, Naramata Bench, Okanagan Falls and Skaha Bench in the Okanagan Valley.

“The newly announced Cowichan Valley sub-GI recognizes our unique terroir and solidifies Vancouver Island’s position as an up-and-coming wine destination,” said Blue Grouse Estate Winery owner Paul Brunner. “Bailey Williamson, Blue Grouse’s winemaker, led the initiative, but it would not have been possible without the enthusiastic co-operation of every winery and grape grower in the valley. We are proud to be part of such a cohesive group of wine lovers and look forward to being part of an exciting future.”

Tourism Cowichan’s Jill Nessell said now Cowichan can rightfully recognized as a top-quality wine-producing region.

“Wine enthusiasts can now add Cowichan as an area to explore wines produced with this unique terroir. While the award-winning wines and beautiful vineyards draw thousands of visitors to Cowichan every year, it is the extraordinary people behind the wines that create memorable wine-tasting and tour experiences for locals and visitors from across the globe,” she said.

It’s about time Cowichan is recognized for its efforts, said Miles Prodan, president of the BC Wine Institute.

“Having Cowichan Valley officially recognized as a distinct and unique wine grape growing region in B.C. is testament to the maturity of the wine growers and producers in the region,” he said. “To put it simply, when you now see Vancouver Island, Cowichan Valley, BC VQA (Vintners Quality Alliance) on a bottle, it is your guarantee that you’re sipping a wine that is 100% grown and made in this particular terroir of British Columbia.”

720,"TORONTO -- A popular Toronto restaurant is under investigation after a video released on social media over the weekend appeared to show patrons and staff failing to follow COVID-19 public health rules.

Mayor John Tory has confirmed that the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario has launched an investigation into MARBL, located in the city's downtown.

A video originally published to Instagram shows dozens of patrons crammed into a partially outdoor seating section while surrounded by unmasked employees carrying drinks.

A version posted to Twitter had been viewed more than 18,000 times by Tuesday and triggered outcry online.

Many social media users called on local and provincial authorities to strip the bar of its liquor licence.

MARBL confirmed in a statement to The Canadian Press that the video was authentic, but insisted it did not show the restaurant was breaking public health rules.

""When thunderstorms began in the middle of service on Friday, we were forced to bring the group under the covered portion of our patio to finish their evening. The two minutes of footage that has been shared is an anomaly and not reflective of the rest of the evening, which was all socially distanced,"" the club's statement said.

Tory, however, said public health guidelines apply to all restaurants and bars under current Stage 2 restrictions, regardless of the weather conditions.

""I think it was made fairly clear at the beginning that ... people who are on the outdoor patios, which were permitted, would have to seek shelter elsewhere other than piling into these establishments,"" Tory told a news conference on Monday.

MARBL on King St. has once again shown they don’t give a damn about physical distancing.

It's not the first time a downtown Toronto establishment has been called out for failing to comply with public health guidelines.

A popular bar -- Goldie -- lost its liquor licence earlier this month after authorities learned it had hosted an illegal gathering of 125 people.

South of the border, public health experts say bars and indoor restaurants have been some of the biggest vector points for mass transmission of the novel coronavirus since the country began rapidly reopening last month.

London was one of the first regions to enter Stage 2 when it was announced.

Over the past week the region served by the Middlesex London Health Unit (MLHU) has seen a decline in numbers, including a three-day stretch where no new cases were reported.

What kind of businesses can reopen in Stage 3?

According to government’s framework set out in April almost all businesses will be able to open in some capacity during Stage 3.

Movie theatres, gyms, casinos, indoor dining and bars can all open with some special measures in place:

Table games at casinos are banned.

Restaurants, bars, concession stands, etc. are allowed to reopen for indoor dining, but nightclubs are still banned except for serving food or drinks.

No dancing is allowed for patrons, but musical performances can resume.

Gyms and fitness studios can reopen with safety protocols in place.

Organized sports can resume, except for contact sports.

Playgrounds, community centres and libraries will also reopen, along with interactive museum and gallery exhibits.

CTV News has learned that work is already being done at London-area movie theatres to prepare for reopening.

Some high-risk businesses, including amusement parks, buffet restaurants and overnight camps, will not yet reopen. Concerts and sporting events are also still prohibited.

The full list of businesses that can reopen is here.

Other changes in Stage 3

Also in Stage 3, the maximum number of people allowed at an indoor gathering climbs to 50 from 10, while outdoor gatherings rise to 100 people.

Physical distancing must still be maintained with those outside someone's social circle, and those limitations have not changed, with only 10 people allowed to interact without physical distancing.

Whilt the total number of people allowed goes up, religious, wedding or funeral services must continue to fill only 30 percent of a venue's capacity.

In addition to organized gatherings, these caps also apply at casinos, bingo halls, performances, convention centres, theatres and sports facilities like gyms.

The government will monitor COVID-19 cases and has warned that restrictions could be tightened again if necessary.

727,"SUDBURY -- The Ontario government is investing $50,000 in the Lake Superior Watershed Conservancy's Canoes for Conservation project to help promote ecotourism and create several seasonal jobs.

Funding for the project is through the Northern Ontario Heritage Fund Corporation and will be used to develop guided tours in a 14-person, 11-metre canoe, connecting visitors to cultural and historical sites along the banks of the St. Marys River in Sault Ste. Marie.

""Sault Ste. Marie's downtown core and many of the city's tourist attractions are situated along the St. Marys River,"" said Ross Romano, MPP for Sault Ste. Marie, in a news release Thursday.

""In addition to boosting tourism development along this historic waterway, the Lake Superior Watershed Conservancy's Canoes for Conservation project will also promote environmental stewardship of Lake Superior and create greater opportunities for cross-cultural learning with Indigenous people.""

Environmental stewardship

The Lake Superior Watershed Conservancy is a land trust organization that works to sustain a healthy Lake Superior watershed for future generations. It is the lead stewardship organization of the Lake Superior Water Trail and works closely with educational institutions to advance environmental stewardship.

""NOHFC funding assists local enterprises like the Lake Superior Watershed Conservancy, ensuring our northern communities can grow and thrive,"" Greg Rickford, Minister of Energy, Northern Development and Mines, said in the release. ""As the province reopens and the economy recovers, our government is proud to support tourism and attractions across the north.""

The NOHFC promotes economic development across Northern Ontario by providing financial assistance to projects - big and small, rural and urban - that stimulate growth, job creation and develop a skilled workforce. Since June 2018, the NOHFC has invested more than $193 million in 1,386 projects in Northern Ontario, leveraging more than $748 million in investment and creating or retaining 3,912 jobs.

730,"Photographer/artist Ric Wallace told council the artists walk along the promenade should be able to reopen safely, with physical distancing measures in place, since the White Rock Farmers Market was able to do so. (photo courtesy Ric Wallace – WhiteRockBeach.ca)

White Rock’s promenade and pier may be open, but one popular waterfront element – the artists walk – is still missing.

And it’s not likely to reappear until plans can be worked out to allow it to operate safely under COVID-19 restrictions, according to city cultural development manager Elizabeth Keurvorst.

In a brief verbal presentation and written memo to council on June 15, Keurvorst was responding to a question to council from local artist/photographer Ric Wallace.

Wallace had asked whether the artists walk was to re-open, with physical distancing measures.

He noted that the White Rock Farmers Market is currently accepting non-food vendors; that council is taking measures – including providing picnic tables – to help support waterfront restaurants; and that even some buskers have returned to designated outdoor areas in the city.

But Keurvorst pointed out that resuming the artists walk – which in pre-pandemic times provided space on the grassy area just west of the museum to some 14 exhibiting artists – would create challenges under current provincial restrictions.

Ordinarily, individuals pay a $150 annual fee to participate in the artists walk, which enables each to set up, display and sell their artwork in a six square-metre space, and keep 100 per cent of the proceeds of sales.

“In looking at how we can restart, we look to the provincial health office, and there are two considerations that we would want to look at before re-opening the artists walk,” Keurvorst said.

“One would be physical distancing…as people walk the promenade they tend to veer onto the grass to allow for that six-foot distancing, that two-metre distancing,” she added.

READ ALSO: White Rock Farmers Market back with a difference May 3

“As well, the public health order has put out guidelines for farmers markets, when it comes to including artisans, but there is a market manager present to monitor that – we wouldn’t have that at the artists walk. We would need to look to the provincial health authorities’ cross-departmental team in order to look at reopening the artists walk, so there is a lot of work to do before we can open it again.”

Coun. Christopher Trevelyan asked whether there had been any consideration given to alternative locations for the artists walk.

“The short answer is no, but the same principles would apply; looking to the provincial health officer to help us with any guidance on both buskers and artists,” Keurvorst said.

Trevelyan sought, and received, assurances from Keurvorst and chief administrative officer Guillermo Ferrero, that staff is actively studying ways to bring back the artists walk.

“In concert with all the other services we’re doing, we’re looking at the Pop-Uptown Gallery, we’re looking at the artists walk, buskers and all the services we offer,” Keurvorst said.

In her memorandum, she noted that artists who exhibited in 2019, but could not this year, have been encouraged to participate in online marketing in association with the city’s Virtual Canada Day event on July 1, and also online art shows offered in partnership with Semiahmoo Arts.

“Re-thinking how the tents are set back and how walkers are able to walk between or behind to maintain physical distancing, where artwork is stored, and how far down the beach, we want to stretch, will be important for us to comply with the provincial health distancing requirements,” she wrote.

733,"Surrey’s two chain-operated multiplexes are set to reopen Friday (July 3) following months of COVID-caused closure.

To start, the Landmark Theatre in Guildford will screen a mix of new and old movies, including Deadpool, Back to the Future, Jaws, Batman Begins, Sonic the Hedgehog, Bloodshot and Harry Potter & the Sorcerer’s Stone, among others.

A “Welcome Back” deal offers seats at $5 per movie, in all formats, via landmarkcinemas.com.

The website details new health and safety protocols at the theatre, including reduced seating capacity, a reduced number of showtimes and increased time between screenings to reduce congestion in the lobby and auditorium.

New at Landmark is a Laser Ultra “experience” that offers enhanced sight, sound and comfort for screenings of Deadpool and Star Wars: The Force Awakens.

(Story continues below)

Cineplex Cinemas Strawberry Hill will also reopen Friday with screenings of Bloodshot, Sonic The Hedgehog, The Invisible Man, The Hunt, My Spy and the Punjabi-language titles Sufna, Ik Sandhu Hunda Si and Jora: The Second Chapter. Showtimes and others details are posted to cineplex.com. The chain is also offering a $5-a-seat deal.

The Strawberry Hill theatre in Surrey is among eight to be reopened Friday by Cineplex, along with others in Burnaby, Kelowna, Langley, Nanaimo, Richmond, Vancouver and Victoria.

In early June, the independent Hollywood 3 Cinemas chain reopened theatres in Surrey and two other B.C. cities, including the Hollywood 3 in Newton, the Caprice in South Surrey, the Caprice Duncan and the Hollywood 3 Pitt Meadows.

734,"Ontarians will soon be able to dine out and work out indoors, catch a movie and let their kids loose on playgrounds in much of the province as additional COVID-19 restrictions are lifted. Premier Doug Ford said most of Ontario would enter stage three of the framework for reopening on Friday as new coronavirus cases remain low, but the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area and parts of the southwest have to wait a week. “We need just a little more time,” Ford said Monday. Indoor restaurants, bars, gyms, cinemas and outdoor playgrounds can open in Ottawa, Brant County, Peterborough, Grey Bruce, Kingston, Kitchener-Waterloo, Guelph, Muskoka, Sudbury, North Bay and a slew of other regions. Toronto, Peel, Durham, Halton, York, Hamilton, Niagara, Haldimand-Norfolk, Windsor-Essex and Lambton will remain in the current second stage of reopening. Ford suggested those regions could open up as early as July 24, so long as new cases of coronavirus stay steadily low and Dr. David Williams, the province’s chief medical officer of health, gives him the green light. That’s the same day Ontario’s state of emergency, in place since March 17, is due expire after yet another extension was granted Monday by MPPs. Education Minister Stephen Lecce said as of July 27, all child-care centres across Ontario can open with up to 15 kids per room. Lecce said that should enable them to be at 90 per cent capacity, meaning more parents can get back to work. He added schools could also reopen for students in September, although that situation remains fluid. “We will be cautious, methodical and focused on safety to get this right, because keeping your child safe is what matters most,” he said. “I’ll be sharing more details soon about the return to school plan, which I know is top of mind for many parents around the province. We are confident in this plan to enable parents to return to work while having the peace of mind that their children are cared for.” Green Leader Mike Schreiner questioned the Progressive Conservative government’s strategy. “Securing a safe place for kids to be Monday to Friday should be a higher priority than allowing people to crowd into bars and restaurants,” said Schreiner. “We are still without a sound plan for education or new funding for child-care providers to implement COVID-19 safety protocols.” NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said the Tories need to offer more help for small businesses struggling in the pandemic, like subsidies for Plexiglas barriers and personal protective equipment for workers. “As we prepare to move into a new stage of our economic reopening, we must remember that small businesses across the province are struggling because Doug Ford didn’t provide the kind of direct support needed to keep Main Street healthy and vibrant,” said Horwath. The premier insisted Ontario has learned lessons from the U.S., where reopening businesses and attractions too quickly has led to a surge in cases. “I see these numbers from Florida and they’re staggering — 15,000 people that contracted COVID in a day, that is scary. But we’re being pretty vigilant. We aren’t rushing into anything,” said Ford.  After Friday, the places in stage three can have indoor gatherings of up to 50 people, while in stage two the limit remains at 10. Outdoor gatherings will be increased to a maximum of 100 people in the third stage. However, some restrictions will remain. Amusement parks and water parks will not be allowed to open. Nor will buffet restaurants, night clubs, overnight camps for children, private karaoke rooms, saunas, bath houses, oxygen bars or table games at casinos. In bars, there will be no dancing and all patrons will need to remain seated inside. For athletes, “prolonged or deliberate contact while playing sports is not permitted” in order to curb the spread of COVID-19. Spectators at such events must abide by the gathering limits and physical distancing restrictions. While gyms, fitness studios and community centres can reopen indoor facilities, similar measures will be in effect to keep people two metres apart. Concerts, artistic events, theatrical productions, performances and movie theatres can resume with limits. “Performers must maintain physical distancing of two metres from every other person, except from other performers where necessary for purposes of the performance,” the government said. Similarly, “audiences are subject to the number of people that can maintain physical distancing of at least two metres and cannot exceed gathering limits of 50 indoors and 100 outdoors,” it said. “This applies to the entire facility, regardless of the number of theatres or performance stages within the facility.” Ford said amusements parks and multiplex cinemas could make a pitch for exemptions to the rules. “If they come up with a plan, a proper plan that keeps people’s social distanced and in other areas and puts it forward to the chief medical officer and they approve it, then they can open,” he said.","Restaurants, playgrounds and movie theatres can reopen in most of Ontario on Friday — but not in the GTA",5,0.3951882627859874

739,"As gyms and fitness studios outside of Toronto prepare to open Friday, and those in the city look ahead for their turn, the owners of small studios say it will be impossible for many to reopen with the current limitations and lack of support.

Stage 3 of Ontario’s reopening allows indoor gatherings of up to 50 people with two-metre physical distancing still in effect.

But gym and studio owners say operating at a significantly reduced capacity with little federal financial support might not be feasible and many may choose to stay closed or shut their doors for good.

Jennifer Lau, owner of Toronto studio FitSquad, said the nature of the business means many independent gyms and studios don’t qualify for the federal wage subsidy, since their trainers are often contractors. With limitations still unclear, she said the smallest of these businesses may not be able to fit more than a handful of clients in their space. Some are tearing down walls to make more space to make it worthwhile, she said.

“We’re just waiting for the actual guidelines because right now it’s a little vague and there’s so much room for misinterpretation,” Lau said. “We’re doing our best.”

Lau is also the founder of the Save Health and Wellness Coalition, which has been advocating on behalf of studios like hers for a rent relief extension, among other things.

The next six months to a year will be a struggle, she said, as it may be a while before gyms can allow more clients in.

The coalition had pushed for studios to be included in Stage 2, since they are appointment-based — she likened them to tattoo studios, which were allowed to open. But to no avail.

“Our industry is going to be hit so hard,” she said.

When her 6,000-sq.-ft. studio does reopen, it will be at 30 to 40 per cent capacity, or a maximum of 20 people including staff, more than many studios that have smaller square footage. She said trainers and clients will work in pods, and classes will be limited to between eight and 10 people.

But many studios are trying to decide whether reopening will save their business or prolong its inevitable closure.

That’s the situation in which Portia Albrecht finds herself. Albrecht owns the Generate fitness studio in Bloor West Village, a larger independent gym at around 6,000 sq. ft. that offers barre, yoga and spinning classes and has a weight training and equipment area as well.

Albrecht, who is currently working as a nurse in Boston, doesn’t know whether or not she’ll be able to reopen her studio, even with the federal rent relief program.

“It doesn’t look good,” she said.

It’s not just the reduced capacity or the increased costs — she’s also not sure people are ready to return to the gym.

Albrecht surveyed her clients and found that fewer than 30 per cent were willing to return to the gym right away. And for those who are willing, she’s concerned nervousness about the pandemic could overtake the feeling of community and cause friction between clients.

She believes the rent relief program should be extended, though even that might not be enough for Generate, she said — her rent alone is $25,000 a month, but there are many other costs as well, and it’s not a hugely profitable industry to begin with.

“It’s going to take a long time to build the numbers back up to where they need to be.”

Alex Kucharski, a director of the Ontario Independent Fitness Studio Association and an F45 studio owner in Toronto, said many gyms and studios have pivoted to online and outdoor classes to stay afloat, but that these offerings are not sustainable. He believes small studios have an advantage over the big gyms because they are generally a more controlled environment, with planned classes instead of walk-ins.

Kucharski said independent fitness studios are often beloved members of the business community — and many have already closed their doors for good, including Toronto Newsgirls Boxing Club, a boxing gym that focused on women and trans people as clients.

Some gyms have taken to their community to stay afloat. For example, Bloor Street Fitness & Boxing has a GoFundMe campaign with a goal of $80,000 — donor comments call the gym inclusive and socially focused.

Kevin Charles, who owns an F45 studio in Toronto, said the rent relief program and federal $40,000 loan could help his studio stay open, since the wage subsidy doesn’t apply to his subcontracted employees. Both he and his landlord are in the process of applying to these programs.

He has been offering online classes “out of necessity” to help cover his bills, and hopes the rent relief and loan programs will kick in soon, as he will be operating at a third of his usual capacity when he can reopen the studio.

Charles is doing everything he can to help his clients feel safe returning. He recently purchased an electrostatic sprayer to more efficiently and effectively disinfect the space and equipment.

Environment and Climate Change Canada issued a severe thunderstorm warning for the city and surrounding regions on Thursday until about 6:30 p.m.

The storm dropped hail, from pea to dime sized, in many parts of the city and sent frequent lightning and thunder throughout the region.

CTV Edmonton weather stations around the city reported 15 to 30 millimetres of rain, although Meteorologist Josh Classen said it was likely other parts of the city received significantly more.

In downtown Edmonton, Rogers Place reported ""some water damage"" to Ford Hall and other ""leaks"" throughout the building.

Road crews were also on Whitemud Drive, which was closed to traffic in both directions at Calgary Trail. There appeared to be a shattered manhole.

The storms moved into the area around 4:30 p.m. and were gone shortly after 7 p.m.

TORNADO WATCH ISSUED FOR SOUTH OF EDMONTON

A tornado watch was issued for the Leduc-Camrose-Wetaskiwin regions. Storms moving into that area had the potential to produce a tornado early Thursday evening as storms move through the area.

Edmonton was not under that watch and the worst of the storms had moved through eastern parts of the Edmonton metro region at 5:45 p.m.

Classen said the risk of severe storms will continue for southern and eastern parts of the area until about 7 p.m. Showers behind the storms may continue until about 9 p.m.

Classen said western parts of the region would clear out earlier than eastern areas.

A tornado watch remained in effect for the Red Deer and Drumheller regions until about 9 p.m., where storms also had the potential to develop a tornado.

The storms were expected to bring heavy downpours, strong wind and hail.","Severe thunderstorm warning ended for Edmonton, tornado watch ends south of the city",4,0.08578527943670455
742,"As large swaths of Ontario move to Stage 3 of reopening this Friday (Toronto not included), bars and restaurants will be allowed to offer dine-in service in addition to takeout and outdoor dining. But just because they’ll be open, it doesn’t mean the pandemic is over. So is it safe to go to the corner pub for a burger and a pint, or is it better to continue with takeout? Dasantila Golemi-Kotra, a microbiologist and associate professor at York University, said that for the time being, she’ll continue getting takeout and cook at home. “It seems that the conditions this virus thrives on is in confined areas with proximity to others,” she said. “Bars and restaurants meet all those requirements. We spend time leisurely there, and you find yourself talking louder to compete with the music and other people. Studies have shown that respiratory droplets are released as you talk and the virus persists even in the smallest drops.” The rule laid out by the province so far is that indoor gatherings, such as in restaurants and bars, need at least two metres of space between patrons from different households and social bubbles, unless there’s a barrier like a Plexiglas shield. There’s a maximum indoor gathering limit of 50, guests have to remain seated and buffets are still a no-go. Golemi-Kotra added that respiratory particles can travel beyond six feet within a confined space with poor air circulation, which is why she said patio dining has worked relatively well so far. Alcohol can also make a person more relaxed about social distancing guidelines. Patrons also can’t wear a mask when eating or drinking. Another risk is restrooms. And while the risk of contamination is small, there are surfaces touched by many people and the ventilation isn’t the best.  For those that absolutely must head to a bar or restaurant, Golemi-Kotra still recommends the patio or takeout.  For dining-in, she said to restrict the tables to people from the same household. “If you must dine with your social bubble be strict about it, dine with the people that you share the same health and safety concerns and lifestyle as. Be mindful that asymptomatic people are responsible for as much as 40 per cent of the SARS-CoV-2 spread.”  Keep the dining and drinking sessions short, exercise good hygiene and don’t share food or utensils, she added. Still, even then, she said there’s still a risk of infection as cases have spiked in cities that already reopened bars and restaurants. B.C. health officials issued a warning after eight people who tested positive for COVID-19 had visited downtown Kelowna and the city’s waterfront between June 25 and July 9. Montreal health authorities also told people to get tested after 13 patrons tested positive and visited at least nine bars since July 1. Last month in Michigan, more than 100 COVID-19 cases were traced back to a single bar. On Monday, just after Ontario Premier Doug Ford announced the province’s Stage 3 plans, California’s governor closed all bars and indoor restaurants for a second time as COVID-19 cases continued to rise.  Councillor Joe Cressy, chair of the Toronto Board of Health, told the Star on Monday that the city needs to be “extremely cautious” when it comes to reopening bars in indoor settings and monitor other jurisdictions around the world to see how they’re handling indoor drinking. “I’m happy that the numbers in Ontario are (low) but people tend to forget that we’re doing well because we’re staying home,” Golemi-Kotra said. That’s why we have to be careful or else the numbers will go up again.”",Should I go to the bar or nah? A microbiologist on the risks of indoor drinking,4,0.034193321017138345

Among major brands, five per cent said they have already withheld money from such platforms, and a further 26 per cent said they are likely to do so, according to a poll from the World Federation of Advertisers. The industry lobby group says it represents 90 per cent of global marketing spending, or about $900 billion U.S. a year. About 40 per cent of companies are undecided.

Facebook has come under particular fire from organizations like the Anti-Defamation League, who say it isn’t doing enough to curb hate speech. A growing list of top tier brands, from Starbucks Corp. to PepsiCo Inc. said they will stop spending on the platform, which sent Facebook’s shares down eight per cent on Friday. Still, Facebook is well-insulated from a blue-chip revolt because most of its ad sales come from small- and-medium sized businesses.

We are shifting resources and creating capacity to reinvest in our highest potential areas, and we anticipate our realignment will likely result in a net loss of jobs.”

E-commerce sales were a bright spot for Nike last quarter, growing 75 per cent at a time when overall revenue plunged. Shipments to Nike’s wholesale customers were down almost 50 per cent in the period, leaving the company with excess inventory.

Nike’s gross margin fell 8.2 percentage points to 37.3 per cent, falling well short of projections. That was its worst performance since 1998, according to data analyzed by Bloomberg.

751,"CALGARY - Despite negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on production and costs, rising prices for gold are expected to buoy results as Canada’s precious metals miners begin rolling out second-quarter financial results next week.

In the three months ended June 30, the average gold price was US$1,713 per ounce, up eight per cent over the first quarter, said RBC Capital Markets in a report this week.

“Q2 may not be that bad after all,” said the report. “Quarter over quarter, we forecast that North American gold and silver producers will report a seven per cent improvement in total earnings and a doubling of free cash flow.”

The bank’s analysts say they expect mine suspensions and lower productivity due to measures to control the pandemic will result in 11 per cent lower gold and silver production and a four per cent rise in overall costs, but higher gold prices will largely offset those impacts.

In a preliminary report earlier this week, Barrick Gold Corp. said second quarter gold production fell eight per cent mainly due to COVID-19 related disruptions at its Veladero mine in Argentina.

Temporary mine closures, production losses, care and maintenance expenses and costs for new health and safety protocols will weigh heavily on second-quarter results for miners, said Moody’s Investor Service in a recent report.

“However, the vast majority of the operations previously placed on care and maintenance are ramping up and production levels are expected to normalize in the second half,” it said.

“As restrictions are lifted and operations normalize, we expect gold miners to benefit from a sharp fall in prices of oil, energy and materials, foreign currency depreciation, as well as high gold prices.”

Moody’s said low energy prices could cut three to five per cent from operating costs, pointing out energy makes up 15 to 20 per cent of such costs at a typical gold mine.

Both gold and silver beat price expectations for the second quarter and both are poised to continue to rise, said analysts with Haywood Securities in a second quarter preview report.

“We maintain our view that gold is now in the early days of a new bull market and would not be surprised to see gold push through the old 2011 high of US$1,923 per ounce this year,” it said.

“Gold could go much higher, but valuations continue to be modest, with many stocks trading at mulitiples which are discounting gold prices well below spot prices.”

Haywood is forecasting gold will average US$1,800 per ounce in the second half of 2020, while silver will rise to US$18 per ounce from its second quarter average of $16.38.

Gold’s rise in the second quarter wasn’t matched by other metals, as silver fell three per cent, copper slipped five per cent, lead was down eight per cent and zinc off seven per cent, RBC reported.

The analysts said they will be watching company results closely for indications of future planning as official guidance was suspended for about half of the North American mining companies RBC covers because of the pandemic.

752,"Variable rate mortgage holders are the big winners from the Big Six banks’ moves to match the Bank of Canada’s 50 point reduction to its trendsetting interest rate.

According to rate comparison website RateSpy.com, variable rate customers will see rates drop by half a per cent for interest cost savings of roughly $500 per year for every $100,000 of mortgage.

Those with adjustable-rate mortgages will see monthly payments fall by about $24 per $100,000, while variable-rate customers will continue to make the same monthly payment but their portion directed to principal will rise while the amount paid in interest will fall. Home backed and regular lines of credit will drop as well.

All of this follows the Bank of Canada’s decision Wednesday to lower its overnight target rate by 50 basis points to 1.25 per cent — the lowest since the 2008 recession — due to fears of a deepening economic downturn caused by the coronavirus and after the U.S. Fed imposed an emergency 50-basis-point cut.

There had been expectations that the banks would not pass on the full BoC cut, but Canada’s largest bank, RBC, led the way Wednesday evening, announcing a 50-basis point reduction to 3.45 per cent for its prime rate effective Thursday, which is used to set the rate at which banks lend to customers with good credit.

The other big banks — Bank of Nova Scotia, TD-Canada Trust, CIBC and BMO followed suit with National Bank of Canada confirming Thursday that it will also lower its prime rate by 50 points to 3.45 per cent as of Friday.

Rob McLister, RateSpy.com’s founder, said the the lowest widely available variable rate will drop immediately to roughly 2.34 per cent from 2.84 per cent, while the 2.59 per cent rate for the lowest conventional five year fixed-rate mortgages will fall in the short term due the lower prime and downward movement in bond yields which normally signal falling mortgage rates. He said fixed rates will trend lower as economic data continues to soften, “but we’ll have to wait and see by how much.”

Many observers expect the Bank of Canada to announce another 25 point rate cut next month — possibly another quarter-point cut before the end of the year, which would bring Canada’s overnight rate to 0.75 per cent.

“The growing risk of COVID-19 to the outlook suggests that the Bank of Canada will follow today’s 50-bp cut in interest rates with an additional 25-bps cut in April,” said Stephen Brown of Capital Economics in a note. “Given lingering concerns that looser policy will boost an already red-hot housing market, however, we think the Bank is unlikely to go further than that.”",Borrowing to buy a house?

754,"Tenants who are sheltering in place during the coronavirus outbreak will likely face a softer rental market when the lockdown lifts, says the head of development-tracking market research firm Urbanation.

Shaun Hildebrand said that while construction has slowed, many residential building sites are still operating and will inject new supply into the rental market.

There are already signs of a shift in the Toronto area’s notoriously tight rental market, he said.

There were 7,200 units leased in the first quarter of 2020, a 16 per cent year over year increase. But there was a significant shift after March 16, Urbanation reports.

The year started with a 25 per cent year over year uptick in the number of Toronto-area lease transactions. But in the second half of March, rentals were 25 per cent below the same level the year before — down 39 per cent compared to the first half of the month.

The supply of rentals dropped only 7 per cent during the same period.

“That we saw some weakness in rents already, just two weeks into the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic downturn, it just speaks to how quickly the market is starting to react,” said Hildebrand.

The changes represent a pretty dramatic shift and likely the beginning of what will be a pretty soft period for the rental market, he said.

Some 10,000 condos and 1,000 purpose-built rentals were expected to come on the market in the second quarter of this year, and while they will likely be delayed, most will be ready for occupancy later, said Hildebrand.

Residential construction sites are operating, albeit at a slower pace to allow for worker safety measures.

“On the demand side we have job losses, lower income, lower immigration. On the supply side we haven’t seen a lot of rental availability as yet but I think that will happen,” he said.

Job losses mean some tenants will move into roommate situations or back home. Hildebrand predicts fewer people will upgrade their apartment. But the introduction of new buildings means a large supply coming online at once and that can put downward pressure on rents.

Because most Toronto investment condos are owned by individuals rather than REITs or pension funds, those landlords will be motivated to rent their units and, because they bought at lower prices than condos sell for now, they will have some flexibility to lower their prices, he said.

Meanwhile, rental website PadMapper reported a 10 per cent drop in apartment searches between February and March.

Toronto remains the most expensive rental market in the country, according to PadMapper. The $2,250 average one-bedroom rent, was .9 per cent higher year over year in April. Two-bedroom rents rose 2.8 per cent to $2,950 in the same period.

Barrie had the fastest growing rents in the country, up 5 per cent year over year to an average $1,460.",Rental relief could come for tenants once city is on the other side of COVID-19,0,0.33010716678974783

759,"Land lease is an affordable home ownership model that allows people to own a home without buying the land. While land lease is a well-established home ownership model in many countries, it is less well-known in Canada.

Parkbridge’s land lease communities are particularly attractive for young families looking to buy their first home and for retirees looking to free up money for life’s other priorities while still continuing to maintain and build equity. Parkbridge is a leading Canadian developer and owner-operator of land lease communities, with 55+ communities in Canada.

As Parkbridge continues to grow, it’s helping Canadians better understand how land lease works and why the option can be beneficial. Here are some frequently asked questions about land lease. To learn more, visit parkbridge.com.

Q: Is buying a home in a land lease community like buying a traditional home?

Yes! Buyers work with a real estate agent and lawyer and obtain financing as required before closing the purchase and sale agreement. Those wishing to buy a home in a Parkbridge community must make an application with the community management team and then sign a site lease. Parkbridge recommends you complete this application and have it approved before finalizing any home purchase.

Q: How do I get a mortgage on a home in a land lease community?

Homeowners in Parkbridge communities work with mortgage brokers and financial institutions to obtain financing with Canada’s major banks and credit unions. Thanks to industry awareness efforts in recent years, financing on land lease homes is now broadly available at many financial institutions and credit unions across Canada.

Q: Do homes in land lease communities increase in value?

As with other forms of home ownership, appreciation value depends on a number of factors, like location and the state of the economy. At one Parkbridge community, homes purchased between 2007 to 2017 rose in price an average of seven per cent per year. Some homes more than doubled in just six years.

Q: What legislation supports homeowners in land lease communities?

Land lease communities across Canada are governed by provincial legislation and regulations that differ slightly across jurisdictions but in all cases enforce the rights and responsibilities of both residents and land lease owners.

Q: What happens when a resident’s lease expires? Are they able to renew?

Yes, residents are able to renew their lease. The homeowner works with the land lease operator on renewing the lease agreement.

Q: Is the lease transferable upon sale of a home?

Yes. This is called an Assignment of Lease and is covered under provincial legislation.

Q: How does the new owner enter into a lease agreement with the land lease owner?

The seller informs the community management team of their intention to sell. Before finalizing the home purchase, the buyer completes a lease application.

Q: How much is rent?

Rent varies from community to community and is regulated by the respective provincial governments. Rent depends on the local market as well as the services and amenities that are provided in that community.

Q: Are land lease communities different than Manufactured Home Communities?

Manufactured Home Communities (MHCs) are the earliest example of land lease. Today, Parkbridge has modular, manufactured and traditional-build homes.

Q: Why do homeowners choose to live in a Parkbridge land lease community?

On average, the purchase price of a home in a land lease community is up to 30-per-cent less than a traditional freehold home in the same area. Parkbridge’s land lease communities are also professionally managed, often with quality amenities, which helps create a sense of community where residents feel supported and connected. Amenities can include community centres, pools, playgrounds and fitness centres. Services can include snow removal and maintenance of common areas. Amenities and services vary by community, depending on the needs and wants of the owners.

And a final advantage is that unlike other developers, Parkbridge maintains a presence in the community, investing alongside homeowners to ensure there is ongoing, thoughtful attention to community infrastructure, standards and amenities.

766,"TORONTO -- A painting by Alex Colville shattered a price record for work by the Canadian master at an auction held in Toronto on Wednesday.

Colville's 1976 canvas ""Dog and Bridge"" sold for more than US$2.4 million -- doubling its estimated value. The work had been owned privately for decades and had never appeared at auction before.

""Presenting a masterpiece as special as Colville's 'Dog and Bridge' was a highlight for Heffel, and we're thrilled that our excitement was matched by our bidders,"" said David Heffel, president of Heffel Fine Art Auction House, which held the sale.

Other works saw strong bidding.

Pablo Picasso's 1939 ""Tete de femme"" sold for more than $1.3 million -- about in the middle of its estimated range.

Abstract Expressionist painter Joan Mitchell's oil on canvas triptych, ""Untitled,"" sold for nearly $1.2 million, well above its estimated price of about $500,000.

Quebec artist Jean Paul Riopelle's commanding, large-scale ""Le reveil"" sold for about $1.2 million.

Yvonne McKague Housser's ""Town of Cobalt"" sold for more than $200,000, four times its estimate.

Five works by Lawren Harris were also sold, two for well above their estimates. His ""North East Corner of Lake Superior (Lake Superior Sketch XXXVIII)"" fetched $481,250 and the abstraction ""LSH 89A"" went for $277,250.

One of the five works had been stowed away in the late Canadian painter's possessions for decades, but was uncovered by relatives earlier this year.

769,"I fell in love with a home, largely due its award-worthy garden and landscaping. The garden has thousands of dollars’ worth of mature perennials. How can I be sure the sellers won’t take them when they move?

Landscaping can be a powerful motivator when it comes to buying a home. A property’s curb appeal can make or break your impression of the home’s appeal.

In your case, it is clear that the gardens and the perennials are a very important factor in your decision to buy the home. The question is, are the perennials considered part of the home that you have bought?

Generally speaking, in-ground plantings are considered part of the property and included as part of the sale because they have effectively become a permanent part of the property and can’t be moved without damaging the home’s landscaping. These would generally be deemed to be included — similar to an indoor fixture — in the purchase agreement, unless they are specifically excluded.

It is worth noting that many grey areas exist when it comes to what’s included in, or what’s excluded from, a home sale. Many a dispute has arisen between buyers and sellers about the state of the home upon the closing date of a sale.

The best approach is to treat the gardens with importance and to be very clear about your expectations of what is considered a part of the home or property being purchased — and request that inclusions be documented as such. In this case, you want to make sure the seller understands that you want the garden and the perennials to remain intact as part of the sale.

First, your real estate professional can structure the purchase offer to document the state of the garden and its contents, as well as your expectation that the garden would be intact once the sale closed.

Second, you and your real estate representative could discuss ways for you to visit your new home just prior to the sale actually closing. This would allow you to inspect the garden and the perennials, and confirm they were in the same condition as when you made the offer. These types of arrangements are common in real estate transactions, and they are negotiable. Keeping in mind our four-season climate, this may not always be a plausible option.

Third, and in addition to the measures above, you can take pictures of the garden — and any other chattels and fixtures that are included with the property, for that matter — that may assist should the seller attempt to remove any items that are part of the Agreement of Purchase and Sale.

If you and your real estate rep take these steps, you should feel confident that you will be able to enjoy the beautiful blooms in the garden that you fell in love with when you found the home.

770,"SUDBURY -- Meeting on Tuesday, city council in Timmins will consider awarding a contract to demolish three buildings to Salvage Kings, a reality TV show.

By awarding what's known as a single-source contract to the show, a staff report says the city can save as much as 25 per cent of the roughly $250,000 it will cost to tear down the structures.

The move follows direction from councillors last fall to take a more aggressive approach to dealing with derelict and vacant properties in the community.

""That approach resulted in a number of properties being brought into compliance with the property standards bylaw, as well as a three properties being demolished across the community,"" the report said.

One of the buildings is a home that is beyond repair, the second is one the city received in a tax sale, and the third is a city property that ""has reached the end of its useful life.""

Positive exposure

Single source contracts are permitted only under specific circumstances. In this case, the report said, it would be allowed because it's ""under circumstances which are exceptionally advantageous to the city.""

In addition to the cost savings, the report said the buildings contain dangerous substances such as asbestos and silica, which the Salvage Kings can deal with properly.

""They will have the ability to recognize and identify any potential hazard containing materials and then have the ability to deal with them accordingly,"" the report said.

A third factor is the positive exposure the city would receive by appearing on the broadcast.

""The exposure on the program will help promote the city,"" the report said. ""It will also show that the city continues to mean business and take action with derelict properties and property owners.

""Also, it shows that not only is the city taking these drastic measures with private owners but, is also taking this seriously and applying it to city-owned properties.""

771,"A week into a pandemic that has forced a swath of Canada’s economy to shut down and wiped hundreds of billions of dollars off the nation’s stock market, a Vancouver mansion sold for $150,000 over the asking price.

As the coronavirus upends the real estate business, along with everything else, the country’s indefatigable buyers are taking some pause — but, so far, not much.

John Pasalis’ firm was getting ready to list a $1.1 million home in Toronto’s trendy Leslieville district next week but was pre-empted by two “bully” offers — those made ahead of the official selling date. A deal was struck before the property ever hit the market.

“Some of those buyers are seeing the slowdown as a way to compete without too many people,” said Pasalis, president of Realosophy Realty.

Before the virus landed in Canada, its three biggest markets — Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver — were gearing up for a sizzling house-hunting season this spring. That outlook has now dimmed.

Home resales are expected to fall in the coming weeks as the economy contracts. Agencies are cancelling open houses, and a traditionally face-to-face industry is using virtual tours to get some deals done.

In addition, new home construction and renovations will take a hit. Toronto said Wednesday it was suspending all but emergency issues of building permits as city facilities are closed.

An extended drop in Canada’s housing market would be a major blow to an economy already reeling from the meltdown in oil prices. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, the Bank of Canada and the country’s biggest commercial banks are pulling out all the stops to try and head off a serious recession.

The central bank has now cut interest rates a full percentage point to 0.75 per cent in the past two weeks, spurring mortgage rates lower, and it may cut again. The banking regulator is loosening bank capital requirements to free up $300 billion of lending capacity.

Meanwhile, Canada’s six biggest lenders, including Royal Bank of Canada, Bank of Montreal and Toronto-Dominion Bank, said they would consider six-month mortgage-payment deferrals for small businesses and individual borrowers impacted by the pandemic.

In the longer run, relentless demand means any pullback will likely be short-lived and prices should hold up, said Robert Hogue, senior economist at RBC.

“In all likelihood, this will be a temporary hit with a rebound taking place later this year once the COVID-19 situation settles down — though the timing and magnitude of the rebound are highly uncertain at this point,” Hogue said in a research note this week.

Immigration bump

Re/Max, one of the nation’s biggest brokerages, on Tuesday urged its 18,000 brokers across the country to cancel all open houses. In Vancouver, developers are closing sales centres and construction sites will be impacted as building activity is interrupted, according to Anne McMullin, president of the Urban Development Institute, an industry group.

But underpinning the market is the fastest pace population growth in 30 years, driven in large part by immigration, and the appeal of Canadian real estate to those with cash to deploy at uncertain times, including foreign buyers.

In Montreal, a New-York based buyer just made an offer on a property listed at more than two million after a virtual visit, said Debby Doktorczyk, owner of Engel & Volkers Montreal, which counts 175 brokers.

Momentum helps. The housing market entered the spring selling season on a high, with sales across the country up 25 per cent from February 2019. Toronto and Vancouver home resales surged about 44 per cent from the same month a year ago, while Montreal’s were up about 23 per cent.

The market was extremely strong — if not a bit “crazy” — before the pandemic, says Doktorczyck. Now, “instead of getting 15 offers for a property, we’re getting five,” she said, adding virtual visits are likely to become more common.

Market oxygen

Even in Vancouver, which was only just emerging from its worst year in decades before the coronavirus, Royal LePage broker Adil Dinani says his shop is still doing 90 per cent of the deals expected.

Dinani was up past midnight negotiating the sale of a $2.3 million, six-bedroom home in an affluent suburb just outside Vancouver. The open house on Sunday had drawn 40 groups — some 85 eager buyers undeterred by the virus — who waited to enter one group at a time. The property drew seven offers, including the winner — an all-cash bid, almost $150,000 above asking.

While open houses may be suspended, home buyers can still see homes by appointment, say agents. Meanwhile falling mortgage rates will act as a spur. Borrowers can now get a five-year variable mortgage at 2.1 per cent and a three-year fixed at 1.99 per cent, according to RateSpy.com.

“You know the saying — oxygen for any real estate market is low interest rates,” said Dinani at Royal LePage in Vancouver. “Well interest rates just got lower. There’s a lot more room to move in Canada. That prime rate can come down more, unlike the U.S. and other nations that are pretty much operating near zero.”",‘Bully offers’ eclipse coronavirus woes in Canada’s home market,0,0.3703518687876949
772,"House-hungry millennials could be forgiven for hoping that the silver lining in COVID-19’s economic rampage is an unexpected shot at the real estate market.

With home prices set to soar at the start of this year, many would-be buyers went into lockdown feeling priced out and discouraged by heated bidding wars and bully offers.

Then COVID-19 sent Greater Toronto Area home sales tumbling 69 per cent year over year in April. Some consumers still hanging on to their salaried jobs read it as a signal that the window of opportunity was opening.

On a year-over-year basis, home prices have stalled, with the average price rising only about $1,000 in April to $821,392. Still, that was down about $90,000 from February’s average price of $910,319.

While there are some opportunities in the COVID-19 housing market, experts warn those come with risk, and timing the low point is tricky for buyers. Even if this is a once-in-a-decade chance to step on the property ladder, it may be slipping away as the economy sputters back to life.

The Star asked six experts — two economists, three real estate brokers and a mortgage specialist — if post-pandemic conditions will be first-time-buyer friendly, and whether a recovery will quickly shut down those opportunities.

Here’s what they said:

“The bottom is not falling out of the market, but it’s a better time for a first-time buyer probably than we’ve seen since 2009,” said Andrew Harrild of Condos.ca.

The year opened with bidding wars galore and homes commonly selling for 10 per cent over list price. Then in mid-March, when open houses were cancelled and condo buildings banned real estate showings, there were probably deals to be had amid the uncertainty.

But the market has since stabilized.

“You’re even starting to see offer dates creeping back in, which is certainly an indication people are feeling a bit more confident,” Harrild said.

“You’re not seeing massive discounts off the list price but you are seeing 98 per cent of list or $10,000 or $20,000 under asking,” he said.

The flip side is there isn’t much to see. Listings were down 64 per cent in April compared to the same month last year, with short supply putting upward pressure on prices and signs of pent-up demand.

“There’s a bit of confidence coming into the market,” he said.

If you are looking for a bargain you’ve got to drill down to individual neighbourhood and housing category, said Zoocasa CEO Lauren Haw.

She warned that sales statistics are skewed by the low number of sales and the mix of available properties on the market.

“Neighbourhood by neighbourhood, things are quite different,” she said.

There could be more choices for those in the market for a downtown condo. That’s where some short-term rentals have migrated to the long-term-rental and resale markets. But there are few detached houses available in good school districts.

“April-May is your crown month for family homes in good school districts and they’re not for sale right now. I continue to think when those houses hit the market we’re going to see prices rise,” Haw said.

There is some real estate excitement in the 905 communities around Toronto and that is extending to cities such as Hamilton, Peterborough, Barrie, London and Kitchener-Waterloo, markets that were thriving before the pandemic.

Now that many people don’t see themselves going back to work at the office full-time, Haw predicted those secondary cities will likely remain buoyant.

“If I am only going to commute three days a week, of course I’m going to buy a detached house in a great neighbourhood in Kitchener,” she said. But home buyers will continue to want walkable downtown lifestyles with restaurants and entertainment nearby.

Royal LePage CEO Phil Soper said there are bargains to be had with homes selling for less than they were in March. But, he said, “There is a risk premium for trading in any financial crisis and frankly it’s justified because there are so many unknowns.”

That benefit of a sale price that is 2 to 5 per cent lower looks more substantial when you consider prices had been expected to rise as much as 15 per cent this spring, he said.

Soper also warned that the window for those savings will close as the market returns to normal, and there are signs that is already happening, with traffic up 20 per cent year over year at the company’s listings website royallepage.ca and an uptick in virtual and guided showings.

“The longer you wait the less an opportunity there will be for a cheaper purchase,” he said.

“In any market correction, buyers are the earliest to react to a potential downturn and adjust their expectations lower as far as price goes. Sellers are the last in and the first out,” Soper said.

Their usual reaction is to take their house off the market or test the market to see if they can get what they want, not let the house go at a significant discount.

“It appears that the 905 is doing better than the 416 during this recovery,” Soper said. “It may be a combination of lower average price and lower density — probably a citizenry that is somewhat less concerned about leaving their homes to transact, particularly in housing,” he said.

David Macdonald, senior economist with the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, said he doubts few young adults 25 to 35 years are thinking about buying homes, with about 30 per cent having lost their jobs or the majority of their work hours since February.

“If you were in that age category and a third of your friends lost their jobs, you might be pretty reticent to take on a big mortgage because you might be next,” he said.

Several factors need to line up for buyers to take advantage of the recession, Macdonald said.

“You’ve got to be lucky enough to keep your job and we need to see big declines in house prices, which itself would be devastating to the economy because people would feel a lot poorer as a result of their houses being worth much less,” he said.

Macdonald said people who might have been saving for a house pre-COVID-19 are now likely more preoccupied with paying the rent.

“There may be people who benefit from this but in terms of allowing millennials en masse to buy single-detached homes in the GTA any time soon, I think that’s extraordinarily unlikely,” he said.

One sign the housing market could be quickly revived is that mortgage pre-approvals are beginning to pile up, said James Laird, president of CanWise Financial.

“It feels like just before the spring market right now where there is a few purchases happening but not many, but it does feel like people are readying themselves to possibly buy in the next couple of months,” he said.

While part-time and hourly workers have suffered disproportionate job losses during the COVID-19 crisis, only about 10 per cent of full-time workers have lost their jobs, Laird said.

“Typically it wouldn’t be the part-time, hourly person who is looking at entering the real estate market,” he said. “It’s more typically those with longer-term, stable employment, and that group has not been nearly as badly affected,” he said.

Conference Board of Canada senior economist Robin Wiebe said there are competing factors that could hasten or slow recovery. But on balance, he said, Toronto housing fundamentals can likely sustain a comeback.

“One of the things that might go against a quick rebound in the housing market is that consumers in general are carrying high debts. Even though rates are low they may not be prepared to jump into the housing market — that’s not just young people, that’s people of all ages,” Wiebe said.

But population is a big driver of housing demand and there are reasons to think Toronto has pent-up demand based on Conference Board estimates that the city added 128,000 people last year, on top of 125,000 in 2018. That’s the equivalent of two Census Metropolitan Areas (CMA) according to the Statistics Canada definition of 100,000 people, he said.

Until the shutdown Toronto also enjoyed “red hot” employment growth, rising over 4 per cent last year, and interest rates are low and expected to stay that way for some time.

That has contributed to pent-up demand and a short supply of housing. Wiebe cited Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. (CMHC) statistics showing there were 209 completed and unoccupied (ownership, not rental) apartments in the Toronto CMA in April. The 20-year average is 630.

Experts who spoke to the Star stressed there are still a lot of unknowns about the road to recovery.

What happens if there is a second wave of COVID-19 infection in the fall?

“A brief second wave I believe the market could manage, and people will treat it like the aftershock of an earthquake. An extended or more damaging second wave would mean all bets are off for the economy and the housing market,” Soper said.",Home sales are down 69% — is this a once-in-a-decade chance to get into Toronto’s housing market?,0,0.5210776725725857
773,"The Toronto Regional Real Estate Board has revised its 2020 forecast of 10 per cent price growth as COVID-19 sent real estate sales plunging 69 per cent year over year in the first 17 days of April.

The average selling price for homes also dipped 1.5 per cent to $819,665, according to a special mid-April market update released on Wednesday.

The board now expects home prices to finish out the year at 2019 levels, instead of the originally forecast $900,000 average.

Listing prices showed a similar drop in the first part of this month.

The board’s revised expectation takes into account a roaring 15 per cent year-over-year price gain in the first quarter. More recently though, COVID-19 restrictions have severely curtailed real estate activity, said board president Michael Collins.

“Home buyers and sellers have concerns about the economy and, indeed, their own employment situations. On top of this, many buyers and sellers are avoiding any type of in-person interaction. In the condo market in particular, individual condo corporations have curtailed entry for non-residents,” he said in a news release.

The board forecasts a return to housing activity if public health restrictions loosen in the summer, leading to an acceleration of sales in the fall. Some price declines could appear into the second and third quarters of the year, however.

“But these declines will have less of an effect on the overall price for 2020 because the annual share of sales will also be much lower than normal,” said a news release.

New listings went the way of sales, plummeting 63.7 per cent to 3,843 in the Toronto region between April 1 and April 17, a period that is traditionally part of the housing market’s busiest season.

When buyers get back in the market, there will be a pent-up demand for homes, said TRREB chief market analyst Jason Mercer.

“Increasingly those buyers will be faced with the persistent lack of listings inventory that was a serious problem before the (onset) of COVID-19,” he said.

The market update shows that detached house prices have taken the biggest hit, declining 9.1 per cent to $1.26 million on average in the city of Toronto. There was a drop in the number of homes that sold in the city for more than $2 million, bringing down the overall average, says the real estate board.

Across the Toronto region, detached houses sold for 4.6 per cent less year over year, averaging $990,543.

Even condos, which have consistently increased in value, saw a drop in the average selling price of 1.8 per cent to $578,594 in the GTA and a 2.9 per cent decline to $617,246 inside Toronto’s borders.

774,"Three-quarters of Ontarians say universities should give students a tuition discount if they are learning online this fall because of COVID-19, says a new poll. The survey, conducted by Campaign Research for the Star, found that just 13 per cent of those polled thought tuition should remain the same. “I think everybody is looking for a bit of a discount,” said Campaign Research principal Nick Kouvalis. It’s partly a reflection of how people feel about online learning, he said, and “if people think they are not going to get the full experience” of being on campus, spending thousands on tuition doesn’t sit well. A number of student groups have also been pushing for a break on tuition for this fall. Campaign Research polled 1,434 people across Ontario last week, using the Maru Blue opt-in online panel. The equivalent margin of error for a random sample of the same size is plus or minus three percentage points, 19 times out of 20. The survey found the public is split on universities offering in-person classes this fall, with just over one-third supporting the move and 31 per cent opposing it. The remaining third were unsure. However, if classes were smaller, some 67 per cent of respondents feel it would be safe for students to be learning on campus. But when it comes to living on campus, just 27 per cent of those surveyed said it is safe to reopen residences, with 39 per cent saying it’s not. However, if universities only allow for one student per room, 55 per cent agree residences could safely operate this fall. About 50 per cent of respondents felt January 2021 to the best time to reopen residences. Some Ontario colleges and universities are planning for online-only learning this fall, with others promising a hybrid of remote and in-class sessions where possible. Some have closed residences or are planning for one to two students per room depending on the size of the space. Last month, the province announced a summer pilot project allowing post-secondary institutions to partially open their campuses to allow “academically stranded” students to complete lessons or labs they missed during the COVID-19 shutdown. Schools across the province — including all 24 public colleges — are taking part in the pilot, targeted at students studying health care, nursing or the trades, which call for practical, hands-on experience to graduate. Colleges and Universities Minister Ross Romano said the pilot will help guide schools as they plan to reopen safely this fall.","Give university students a tuition break, Ontarians overwhelmingly say",0,0.34537928645586036

776,"WATERLOO REGION — Store closures and an increasing shift toward remote work could have significant impacts on commercial real estate, local market representatives say. The retail and office sectors could see the biggest changes as Waterloo Region emerges from pandemic lockdowns. In the past few weeks, several area businesses, ranging from bars and restaurants to tech firm Plasticity Labs, have already announced they won’t ever reopen. This week, Shopify — with hundreds of locally based employees and a large footprint at two Waterloo offices — said it will prioritize a work-from-home model going forward that throws its long-term need for substantial square footage into question. Shopify will maintain “recruitment hubs” in cities including Waterloo, the company said, but it’s not clear how much of its more than 100,000 square feet in Waterloo that will require. “Office space demand is a widely contested debate and consensus sees the future of office as having a mix of both options for staff to either work from home (WFH), from a dedicated office space, or combination of both,” Mitchell Blaine, of commercial real estate services and investment firm CBRE, wrote in an email. “Both WFH and dedicated office spaces have their pros and cons and decisions by tenants over the next many months will be highly dependent upon the companies’ culture, financial health and future growth prospects.” Before March, the absorption rate of office space had been increasing, Ginger Whitney of Whitney & Company Realty said Thursday during an online discussion hosted by Communitech. Since then, the absorption rate has been in a holding pattern. “We don’t have the same velocity we once had,” Whitney said. “We are keen to see a correction happen, and to see what’s next with office space.” Blaine said he’s found that office leasing — and renewals in particular — has been continuing, while most sales have been extended or paused. “Large office expansions have been put on pause for the most part as many office tenants work to determine their optimum balance of WFH and dedicated office space needs,” he added. Spacing considerations might actually increase square footage needs if companies retain physical offices, Whitney and colleague Steph Snyder both noted in the online forum. New standards will probably eliminate bench-style seating, dividers and barriers may be required, HVAC systems might be outfitted with filters, and offices might be subject to random inspections, Whitney predicted. The retail market was already experiencing challenges pre-pandemic with the rise of online shopping, and those are now being heightened, Blaine said. Aside from grocery stores and pharmacies, retail properties “are the hardest hit and will likely be last to recover,” he said. Industrial/warehouse and apartment properties remain a bright spot, with strong momentum continuing, Blaine noted. Demand — and related investment — for logistics and e-commerce warehousing is on the rise. Commercial tenants may find opportunities as landlords work to avoid or fill vacancies, Snyder said. A sublease could provide short-term, flexible space at a good price, for example. Other firms may look to lower costs by sharing offices where staff from different companies come in on a rotation, and the space is intensively cleaned in between, said Whitney. “No landlord wants vacancies right now,” Snyder said. “There’s just so much uncertainty as to when those vacancies are going to fill.”",Pandemic poised to significantly impact commercial real estate,0,0.043574618551851296

780,"Beneath the panes of his greenhouse, Jan VanZanten surveys a sea of sun star flowers rising up from plastic pots, ready to ship but without a buyer.

In past years, the Niagara Region grower had no trouble selling to wholesalers by the thousands.

""Now we're just composting,"" VanZanten said. ""Since my kids are home every afternoon, they have to spend two hours throwing out the flowers that have bloomed out.""

Sales are down 30 per cent for the year and Easter came and went at the height of physical distancing measures. The uncertainty facing the industry as Mother's Day approaches -- ""you could liken it to Christmas for every other retailer"" -- and the critical spring planting season dawns are even more worrisome.

""If this goes till June we will most likely be at 70 per cent,"" he said of year-over-year revenue loss. ""My overdraft is maxed out at the bank. Obviously they're wondering when I'm going to start drawing that back, and I can't since I haven't sold anything.""

VanZanten is one of thousands of flower farmers across the country concerned about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Demand for non-perishable items pushed decorative plants out of the supply chain in last month's stockpiling frenzy, while the ongoing shutdown of garden centres in jurisdictions including Ontario and New York has cut off critical points of sale, threatening to leave growers high and dry.

""This is when we sell. We're on the cusp of a critical period,"" said James Farrar, director of the Canadian Ornamental Horticulture Alliance.

Trees, bushes and bedding plants are usually planted between May 1 and June 15, he said, with customers ranging from backyard gardeners to municipalities.

In Ontario, flower producers discarded about 40 per cent of their Easter crop, according to Flowers Canada Growers.

The province has designated garden centres as a non-essential service -- a painful exclusion for the industry, since nearly two-thirds of Canadian production stems from Ontario. Neighbouring New York and Ohio have also forced garden centres to lock their doors, while Michigan and Vermont have banned retailers from selling non-essential products, including home gardening items.

""If they don't open, the damage is going to be astronomical,"" said trade group head Andi Kuyvenhoven, noting garden centres' crucial role for bedding plants in particular.

British Columbia -- the second-biggest flower and plant producer -- Alberta and Manitoba and have allowed garden centres to keep running, while Quebec deemed them essential along with nurseries as of April 15, though not in time for Easter.

Kuyvenhoven, who with his wife co-owns a $2.5-million business selling potted Chrysanthemums and indoor calla lilies -- largely to U.S. distributors -- on a pair of farms west of Toronto, says clogged supply chains south of the border remain a problem.

""U.S. customers for a time closed their distribution systems to floral and so the main grocery chains were not purchasing plants,"" he said, which was hard on growers of cut flowers such as roses and tulips.

""If a truck can take 24 skids and four skids were flowers, the flowers came off the trucks and they put more food on the truck -- which we completely understand. The only challenge is, when you're growing flowers as we do, they also have a shelf life,"" said Kuyvenhoven, who bought his business from his parents in 1990.

""Now we're now facing liquidity issues...I haven't slept in five weeks.""

Flowers Canada Growers says exports to the U.S. make up about one-third of greenhouse flower and plant sales, which hit $1.6 billion in 2018, according to Statistics Canada. Nursery sales topped $500 million.

While garden centres can continue to operate across much of the continent, growers wonder whether bouquets and flower pots will remain on the shopping list of consumers struggling to make rent amid soaring unemployment numbers and a looming recession.

Kuyvenhoven is hoping that families confined to their homes for most of the day will choose to spend what they've saved from unpurchased vacations and lattes on plants for their vases and flower beds.

""That's part of what's carried us through downturns in the past,"" he said.

Growers associations are in talks with federal and provincial governments over potential financial relief, with Flowers Canada Growers asking for a ""cash injection"" as well as extended debt repayment plans secured in part by Ottawa, Kuyvenhoven said.

So far, the federal government has extended a stay of default for eligible farmers until Oct. 31, giving flower and potted plant producers an extra six months to pay off federal loans that would have been due at the end of April.

Ottawa has also granted exemptions on air travel restrictions to temporary foreign works and invested $50 million to help farmers fly in labourers on charter trips. ""New flights are being booked ever day,"" the agriculture department said in an email.

Back at the greenhouse, VanZanten mulls the overripe lilies and orchids.

""Flowers do make you happier, they do actually lift your spirits...but there are farms that can't bounce back from this,""

he said.

""This all happened at the wrong time.""

781,"CALGARY -- Nick Zannis is thankful his greenhouse established online sales five years ago, now that the retail world has been turned upside down by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The doors of Golden Acre Home and Garden in Calgary are allowed to be open as an essential service in Alberta, but there are ample warnings about social distancing.

A steady stream of customers, many of them wearing face masks, walk through the store even though spring bedding plants aren't ready and the selection of seeds and flowers is somewhat limited.

Zannis said having an online presence puts his greenhouse on less shaky ground than many others.

The business has sent products to as far away as Nunavut and Nova Scotia in recent years but will be focusing primarily on the Calgary market now.

Online orders are up by 2,000 per cent from a year ago, Zannis said. But it's not a gold mine.

""It's very expensive to operate. Now you have to pay somebody to go and do the shopping,"" he said.

""But the online store has kind of kept us afloat ... We're just trying to survive, honestly. I just want to survive this year.""

In addition to Alberta, Manitoba, British Columbia and Quebec have designated garden centres as an essential service. Other provinces, including Ontario, have forced them to keep their doors closed.

""We are allowed to offer pickup at the curb, so we are doing that,"" said Mary Reid, owner of Green Thumb Gardening Centre in Nepean, Ont.

""A customer would either phone or email us what their order is, then we'd get it ready and say you can come and get it.""

Reid said she has basically had to start online orders from scratch but isn't able to do e-commerce.

She hopes gardeners will still be keen to shop when restrictions are eased.

""It's not a pretty picture at all ... it depends on how far into lockdown we get.""

The executive director of the Canadian Garden Council, the national umbrella body for provincial and national garden organizations, said there's been a huge increase in the number of Canadians who want to start gardening.

Michel Gauthier said it's a struggle for centres that have to stay closed.

""A lot of growers and greenhouses are having issues. Right now, there's a big movement to say horticultural products are essential and should be essential for the well-being of people,"" he said.

""We're saying ... if we want people to have that gardening experience and spend some time in their garden, then they need to have access to the material and access the product.""

Don Vanderwerf said it's almost like business as usual at his Kel-Lake Greenhouses in Kelowna, B.C.

Demand for seeds, soil and vegetables has been strong, he said.

Peak gardening season begins in three weeks to a month. Vanderwerf said products will be spread out on benches and into the parking lot at his site.

Still, Vanderwerf is expecting a financial hit. He's already losing business in flower baskets for hotels and restaurants.

""We'll be down a bit. But I feel fortunate that I'm not owning a restaurant or a pub, because they're hurting.""

In all, the Toronto index closed up 269.04 points or 1.7 per cent to 15,908.45. That’s the largest daily gain since June 5. In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 556.79 points at 26,642.59. The S&P 500 index was up 42.30 points at 3,197.52, while the Nasdaq composite was up 97.73 points at 10,488.58. Second-quarter bank results were mixed but provisions for credit losses were much higher than expected at nearly US$27 billion for three banks. Shares of JPMorgan Chase increased after the drop in profits was less than expected on gains in capital markets while Citigroup shares dropped on a steep decline in profits. Wells Fargo sank 4.6 per cent after cutting its dividend and posting its first quarterly loss since the 2008 financial crisis. Bank executives said in conference calls that they underestimated how long the pandemic would last and its impacts on the overall economy. “I think you’re seeing weakness in the banks generally as some of the smaller regional banks are more heavily weighted towards lending and have less capital markets exposure so less of an offset as we proceed through earnings,” said Natalie Taylor, a portfolio manager with CIBC.  Meanwhile, she said there seems to be some flattening in the growth of COVID-19 infections outside of Florida despite larger outbreaks in some states. “The sense is that maybe the worst in the surge is either near or has already occurred,” she said in an interview. Taylor also said investor sentiment has improved on increased certainty that the U.S. Congress will pass another fiscal stimulus package by the end of the month to extend some income benefits and provide some support to state and local governments. “The market has continued to look through the spike in cases that we’re seeing in the states basically because we’re probably not going to see a broad shutdown of the economy again like we did in March and that there’s going to be stimulus on the other side,” she said. The Canadian dollar traded for 73.44 cents US compared with 73.71 cents US on Monday. Ten of the 11 major sectors on the TSX were higher with only real estate decreasing. Energy rose 4.1 per cent despite slight increases in crude oil and natural gas prices.

The August crude contract was up 19 cents at US$40.29 per barrel and the August natural gas contract was up 0.7 of a cent at nearly US$1.75 per mmBTU. Taylor said the crude oil market is being affected by OPEC discussions about reducing product cuts, which she said would be “manageable in the context of the market.” In addition, former U.S. vice-president Joe Biden’s clean energy initiative unveiled Tuesday may not be as punitive for the oil and gas industry as may have been expected.

783,"TORONTO -- As global warming transforms our planet and farmers search for sustainable ways to grow food, the answer may lie in the ocean.

Sea vegetables grow rapidly and require zero fresh water, and a team of researchers at Florida Atlantic University who studied the salt-loving plants are optimistic that they could be a game-changer in the way we shop for groceries.

“The wonderful thing about these is that you just need salt water,” Megan Davis, a professor of aquaculture at Florida Atlantic University, told CTV News Channel in an interview on Thursday.

Her team spent 10 weeks studying the optimal growing conditions for sea asparagus, sea purslane and saltwort. All three species are traditionally foraged in coastal countries in Europe and Asia but have yet to reach mainstream produce aisles in North America.

The researchers were able to grow more than 100 pounds of the plants in six tanks, a result they say proves the veggies are efficient growers. The plants, also known as halophytes, are also relatively low waste, with the average edible portion ranging from 55 per cent for the sea purslane to 72 per cent for the sea asparagus and 75 per cent for the saltwort.

Based on this, Davis says her team sees “quite a trend” for sea vegetables in the future.

“There are quite a number of people and restaurants who are very excited to include them as part of their menu,” she said.

Better yet, Davis says, the vegetables are tasty. She described sea asparagus as a saltier version of its terrestrial cousin. Plus, it’s loaded with nutrients.

“So what’s amazing about these sea vegetables is they have a lot of different minerals, because they’re taking the minerals from the sea, and sometimes terrestrial plants don’t have all of these same types of minerals. One thing that sea vegetables do have is a lot of iodine, which is very healthy for us.”

Mariculture — the cultivation of food from the sea — has long been touted as a major player in the search for sustainable food. Research suggests that the world will need to produce 50 to 70 per cent more food by 2050, and global warming has worsened drought conditions in many countries, making traditional farming approaches that rely on fresh water more challenging.

The World Bank Group has said seaweed production could represent “a transformational change in the global food security equation” and could also become a greater source of food for livestock.

Sea vegetables have been on foodies’ radars for years. In 2018, Dutch global insights platform Innova Market Insights predicted the “ocean garden” would become a major food trend.

Speciality grocery stores like Whole Foods and Thrive Market already stock a variety of sea vegetables, including seaweed, kelp and dulse, a chewy, red-leafed plant that can be added to salads and soups or eaten as a healthy snack.

In Japan, seaweed has long been a dietary staple and is traditionally used in sushi and salads.

The company on Thursday reported 10.1 million net new subscribers, a gain that surpassed the 7.5 million Netflix had projected for the second quarter earlier this year. The increase is less than the company’s gain for the first quarter, when it added about 16 million customers as economies and people began locking down amid the spread of the coronavirus.

Like most of Hollywood, Netflix isn’t making much content because COVID-19 has halted production of movies and television shows, but it has a large arsenal of programming and is still able to offer new content to viewers.

The Los Gatos, Calif.-based company said it ended the second quarter with a total of 192.9 million paying subscribers, up from 182.9 million as of the first quarter and 151.6 million a year earlier.

The company has benefited from heightened demand for television shows, movies and other forms of content that can be streamed at home as the pandemic forces changes in consumer behaviour. People in many markets have stayed at home as movie theatres have shut down, sports leagues have delayed competition and entertainment venues have cancelled concerts.

“We saw significant pull-forward of our underlying adoption leading to huge growth” during the first two quarters of the year, the company said.

However, Netflix said it expects less growth for the second half of 2020. It anticipates adding 2.5 million net new subscribers in the third quarter, down from a gain of 6.8 million in the year-ago period.

Shares fell more than 10 per cent in after-hours trading. The stock has been one of the strongest performers in the S&P 500 in 2020 and ended Thursday up 63 per cent so far this year.

For the second quarter, Netflix said it added 2.8 million subscribers in the region including Europe and the Middle East, 1.8 million in Latin America and 2.7 million in Asia.

The company reported more than 2.9 million new subscribers in the U.S. and Canada for the second quarter, up compared with a gain of 2.3 million in the first quarter.

Netflix is facing more competition for viewers in North America. Comcast Corp.’s NBCUniversal has launched its Peacock streaming service. In May, HBO, part of AT&T Inc., began offering commercial-free HBO Max. Walt Disney Co. and Apple Inc. also have their own streaming platforms.

Netflix reported second-quarter revenue of $6.15 billion (U.S.), up from $4.92 billion a year earlier. Analysts expected Netflix to generate $6.08 billion in revenue for the latest quarter.

Profit rose to $720 million, or $1.59 a share, from $271 million, or 60 cents a share, the year earlier. Analysts had expected $1.82 a share, according to FactSet.

786,"WATERLOO REGION — After a dismal April, the local real estate market showed signs of a slow recovery last month. The number of homes sold through the Kitchener-Waterloo Association of Realtors in May spiked 80 per cent over April, with 419 residential properties changing hands last month. April’s sales were the lowest the association had seen in a single month since December 2008, as pandemic fears caused many buyers and sellers to put their plans on hold. “Consumer confidence, I think, is coming back,” said association president Colleen Koehler. With the market virtually paused for the second half of March and April, “we honestly didn’t know” what May would bring, she said. “I think it’s a little more significant than we anticipated.” There’s still quite a hill to climb to return to pre-pandemic sales levels; May’s sales represented a 40.5 per cent drop compared to results in May 2019. Average prices continue to rise year-over year. The average for all properties rose 6.5 per cent to $568,275, while the average for a detached home rose 5.4 per cent to $657,274. Those averages were virtually unchanged compared to April. The May median price for all properties rose 10.1 per cent over May 2019 to $545,000, while the median price of a detached home increased 9.6 per cent to $630,000. Apartment-style condos saw the lowest price growth; the May average sale price of $330,336 was up just 0.6 per cent compared to May 2019 results. Townhomes saw the average price rise 13 per cent to $454,197, while semi-detached homes were up 11.4 per cent to $482,479. A recent Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) report forecasts a tough road ahead for Canadian real estate, with predictions that housing prices nationwide could fall 9 to 18 per cent from first-quarter levels this year before starting to recover next year. In Ontario, CMHC predicts that decline won’t reverse until the third quarter next year; it could be the latter part of 2022, or later, before prices return to pre-pandemic averages. “The precise timing and speed of the recovery is highly uncertain because the virus’s future path is not yet known,” CMHC’s chief economist, Bob Dugan, said in a release. Koehler doesn’t believe the worst-case pricing scenarios will play out in Waterloo Region. “Time will tell. Obviously, what happens in the next six months will be crucial,” she said. “We still have a fairly strong economy here.” Historically-low inventory levels are helping to maintain higher prices, with homes in lower price categories still attracting multiple offers, Koehler said. While the association saw more new listings come on to the market last month than in April, with 577 residential properties put up for sale, it’s still a far cry from the previous 10-year average of 1,035 new listings in May, and represents a nearly 50 per cent drop over new listings in May 2019. Although traditional open houses are still prohibited in Ontario, virtual open houses and tours are proving popular, and the Ontario Real Estate Association has issued extensive health and safety guidelines when in-person showings and meetings are necessary. “We’re seeing more sellers feeling more comfortable about listing their properties now,” Koehler said.",May home sales hint at slow market recovery,0,0.14875649897091658
788,"The finances of Langley Township and City are looking a lot better than the worst-case scenarios sketched out a few months ago during the early stages of the pandemic.

In May, Langley Township forecast a possible $48 million shortfall in revenues, based on an estimate that just 75 per cent of property owners would pay their taxes by the July deadline.

But as of this week, the Township has determined that 85.5 per cent of property owners have paid their taxes already, including 92 per cent of residential property owners.

It appears to be “a normal year” for property taxes in the Township, noted Mayor Jack Froese.

This means things will be financially much simpler for the Township.

“It reduces our reliance on dipping into reserves, or borrowing,” Froese said.

If taxes hadn’t been paid, the Township would have run out of ready cash to pay for ongoing expenses sometime later in the year.

Langley City is in a similar state.

According to City staff, they have collected 82 per cent of their total property taxes, including 90 per cent of residential property taxes and 72 per cent of commercial property taxes.

“It’s fantastic that we have that, because we can keep our services going,” said Mayor Val van den Broek.

She noted that one of the reasons the level of payment is so high is that many City residents were already paying their taxes monthly through their banks.

The lower amounts paid for commercial property taxes in both City and Township do not mean that those taxes won’t get paid this year, either.

The provincial government mandated a two-month grace period for all non-residential property tax payments. Commercial and industrial landowners don’t have to pay their taxes until September, but a majority have still already paid in both City and Township.

For those who have not yet paid residential taxes, the penalties will be less if they can pay over the summer.

There is a 10 per cent penalty for non-payment of property taxes in B.C., but both City and Township modified its terms to reduce the first level of penalty.

In the City, half of the penalty was originally due after July 2, but that’s been reduced to two per cent. The remaining eight per cent is only due if the landowner misses an Oct. 1 deadline.

The 10 per cent late payment in the Township has been reduced to 1.75 per cent for those who missed July 2, and 8.25 per cent deferred to mid-November.

Both City and Township reduced their planned tax increases this year.

MISSISSAUGA, Ont. - Second Cup Ltd.'s parent company has opened its first recreational cannabis dispensary.

Mississauga, Ont.-based Aegis Brands says it welcomed guests to a Hemisphere Cannabis Co. location on Avenue Road in mid-town Toronto today.

The location was previously home to a Second Cup and will be joined by six more dispensaries Aegis has planned to open in Toronto, Orleans, Ont. and Ottawa in the coming months.

Second Cup said in 2018 that it has more than 130 locations across Ontario that it plans to leverage to enter the cannabis space.

Second Cup has undergone a series of restructurings in recent years to try to increase its profits in the competitive Canadian coffee industry and hopes cannabis will help it regain market share.

The COVID-19 pandemic has delivered more troubles to Aegis, which had to temporarily suspend operations at 83 of its 244 Second Cup cafes and five of its 19 Bridgehead coffeehouses.

This report by The Canadian Press was first published July 10, 2020.

790,"NEW YORK -- Netflix added a flood of new subscribers amid the coronavirus pandemic and also offered clues to a possible successor for founding CEO Reed Hastings, who on Thursday named the company's chief content officer, Ted Sarandos, as co-CEO.

But it was investor disappointment in the outlook for new subscribers that helped drive down the stock 9% to $480.70 in after-hours trading.

Sarandos, who joined Netflix over 20 years ago, will also join the Netflix board of directors. ""Ted has been my partner for decades. This change makes formal what was already informal -- that Ted and I share the leadership of Netflix,"" said Hastings in a statement.

In a post-earnings video conference, Hastings nonetheless said he plans to stay with the company for the next decade and added the setup means the pair will serve as ""full-time"" executives, rather than two part-time CEOs splitting the role.

The company picked up 10.1 million worldwide subscribers during the April-June period, more than triple what it usually adds in that period.

The increase announced Thursday with Netflix's second-quarter earnings eclipsed the gain of 8.3 million subscribers projected among analysts polled by FactSet. Netflix ended June with 193 million worldwide subscribers, including 70 million in the U.S. and Canada, its largest geographic market.

Nearly 26 million of those subscribers have joined Netflix during the first six months of this year -- more than double the number compared with last year -- as the pandemic curtailed travel and even nights out on the town. The restrictions have turned out to be a boon for Netflix, which also faces a slew of new streaming competitors such as Disney Plus and HBO Max.

Netflix Inc., however, said its subscriber growth has begun to slow following the ""initial shock of Covid and social restrictions"" after it added just 2 million fewer customers in the past six months as it did for all of 2019. It forecasts just 2.5 million new additions for the current quarter.

The pandemic has shut down Hollywood, limiting the ability of TV and movie studios to produce more entertainment to feed Netflix and other video streaming services. That could limit their appeal if viewers run out of new things to watch. Netflix said Thursday that it is slowly resuming production, mostly in Asia and Europe, and its 2020 lineup remains intact. Shooting delays mean big shows and movies slated for next year will come out more in the second half of 2021.

People spending more time at home due to the pandemic has ""massively accelerated the shift"" from traditional TV to streaming video,"" said eMarketer analyst Eric Haggstrom in an email. That bodes well for Netflix, the streaming pioneer. ""Even as lockdowns are relaxed and new competitors begin to scale their services, Netflix will extend its lead as the first stop for entertainment."" He predicts that Netflix will get one-third of streaming subscribers globally in 2020.

The Los Gatos, California, company's extraordinary expansion helped Netflix earn $720 million on revenue of $6.15 billion during the second quarter.

Investors have been betting the pandemic will make Netflix more popular than ever. Since public health experts officially declared the pandemic on March 11, Netflix's stock has soared by 50%.

VANCOUVER -- Childhood asthma rates have fallen because fewer unnecessary antibiotics are being prescribed to babies within the first year of life, a study by British Columbia researchers says.

It says infants who were given antibiotics face nearly double the risk of asthma by age five. Earlier research shows the drugs affect so-called good bacteria in the gut.

Researchers from BC Children's Hospital, the BC Centre for Disease Control and the University of British Columbia found that every 10 per cent increase in prescribing of antibiotics was linked with a 24-per-cent jump in asthma rates.

The study on the most common chronic childhood disease was published recently in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine.

Dr. David Patrick, first author of the study and director of research and medical lead of the antimicrobial resistance program at the BC Centre for Disease Control, said antibiotics should be prescribed only for serious infections.

""Most of those antibiotics were prescribed for conditions like viruses, colds, where there was no benefit,"" said Patrick, who is also a professor with the school of population and public health at the University of British Columbia.

The findings involved analyzing the data of about 225,000 children up to age four in B.C., for every year between 2000 and 2015.

""This is the first time that we've demonstrated a population-level effect in any jurisdiction in the world where a reduction in antibiotic use in babies appears to be resulting in a drop in the asthma rate,"" Patrick said.

The study also included the data of 2,644 children in Vancouver, Edmonton, Winnipeg and Toronto who are participants in the ongoing Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development cohort, or CHILD, which began in 2008 to study the development of various conditions from birth, including asthma, allergies and obesity.

Children who were prescribed antibiotics as infants and went on to develop asthma could potentially have the healthy bacteria replenished through further research, Patrick said.

Jacqueline Jones was randomly recruited to participate in CHILD at a hospital in Vancouver when she was pregnant with her daughter Charis, who is now nine.

She said her daughter was prescribed antibiotics for bronchitis when she was about nine months old and was diagnosed with asthma in March 2017.

Jones said it's possible that the asthma is linked to the antibiotics, though she and her 15-year-old son Rhys also have asthma, which can run in families.

""Maybe it did increase her chances of having and developing asthma,"" she said. ""But at the time you have a not-even-one-year-old who's coughing, having a hard time breathing and has this infection. When it's a baby it's quite scary.""

Jones said she's hoping both her and her daughter's participation in the CHILD study will one day lead to further advancements in the treatment of asthma.

Dr. Stuart Turvey, senior author of the study and a pediatric immunologist at BC Children's Hospital, said that in 2000, about 70 per cent of children received at least one course of antibiotics before their first birthday but that had dropped by half by 2014.

""It was helpful to reduce antibiotic resistance in bacteria but now we see that it had unexpected benefits including being associated with a decreased rate of asthma in kids,"" he said.

The CHILD cohort study involved the recruitment of about 3,000 pregnant women across the country to follow the health of their children over time.

TORONTO - A new report that ranks North American cities on their ability to attract tech talent has put Toronto at No. 4, giving it the top spot in Canada.

Commercial real estate firm CBRE reached that conclusion by assessing 50 cities on 13 attributes, including tech-talent supply, cost of living, educational degrees and real estate prices.

Toronto's ranking was down one spot from last year, as Washington, D.C. - chosen in 2018 to be host of Amazon's second quarters - jumped two spots to No. 2 after the San Francisco Bay Area.

Seattle - home of Amazon's original head quarters - slipped one notch to No. 3 and New York City stayed at No. 5.

Vancouver retained its 12th position in the rankings, Ottawa jumped five spots to No. 14, Montreal dropped three levels to No. 16 and Calgary made its debut in the Top 50 in the 34th slot.

CBRE said Toronto gained 66,900 or 36.5 per cent more tech jobs over the past five years, the second-most after the Bay Area over that time frame.

The report says the average tech worker salary in Toronto rose by 11.2 per cent to reach $84,986, keeping it a much more affordable market for talent than many U.S. cities it studied.

801,"TORONTO -- The COVID-19 pandemic has pushed women's participation in the labour force down to its lowest level in three decades and rebounding won't be easy, says a new study from the Royal Bank of Canada.

The report Thursday shows 1.5 million Canadian women lost their jobs in the first two months of the pandemic and says women accounted for about 45 per cent of the decline in hours worked over the downturn, but will only make up 35 per cent of the recovery.

RBC deputy chief economist Dawn Desjardins said women are being hardest hit because they tend to work in industries -- hospitality and food services, retail trade, educational services, health care and social assistance -- most affected by closures, earnings losses and layoffs.

""In March in April, it was kind of evenly split between men and women with both having about 1.5 million (job losses), but it's in the reopening where we have started to see a divergence,"" Desjardins said.

""Men are already being rehired as certain industries get back on their feet, whereas women have been rehired, but that gap is bigger because there is still one million fewer women working.""

Women are also impacted because they shoulder more childcare responsibilities than their male counterparts and may have to refuse work or seek a reduction in hours if students don't go back to school in the fall or go back part-time, Desjardins said.

Employment among women with toddlers or school-aged children fell seven per cent between February and May, compared with a four per cent decrease for fathers of children the same age.

Single mothers with a toddler or school-aged child saw their employment drop 12 per cent between February and June, compared with a seven per cent decrease for single fathers.

It's a stark contrast to prior recessions, when men were significantly more likely than women to be laid off.

RBC said in prior recessions, from the early 80s to the 2008 financial crisis, men were significantly more likely than women to be laid off.

In the downturn due to the financial crisis, the unemployment rate for men was more than 2.5 per cent higher than that of women and when the recovery came women's participation in the labour force rebounded to its highest level as the participation of men was declining.

Desjardins said prior recessions hit the male-dominated goods market more than the female-dominated service market, which has faced the brunt of COVID-19.

During this recession, RBC said one-third of women who lost jobs between February and June did not seek work, putting them at higher risk of long term job-separation and future wage penalties.

Jennifer Hargreaves has heard about these struggles constantly since COVID-19 started spreading across Canada.

""The things I've been hearing in the community are things like 'I might have to quit my job. How am I supposed to look for work right now when we don't even know who's got flexible workplaces and we don't know what childcare is going to look like?"" said Hargreaves, who runs Tellent, an organization that helps professional women find flexible work opportunities.

Many women have reduced their hours because their partner earns more and they need a way to look after their kids -- a situation Hargreaves faces in her own home.

Others, she said, have been laid off and haven't begun the job hunt because of the uncertainty the pandemic has fostered.

She worries about these women because, she says, ""any time you take more of an extended break in your job search, you can lose your network, your connections and your confidence.""

For Hargreaves, one of the most scary parts of women's drop in participation in the labour force is that ""there's no end in sight.""

""Not a lot of employers are talking about what flexibility is gonna look like. We don't know what school is gonna look like,"" she said.

""It's just that uncertainty of not knowing and not having clarity or communication that makes it exhausting and really hard to plan.""

810,"WINNIPEG -- June marked a record number of home sales in a single month, according to the Manitoba Real Estate Association.

Though the COVID-19 pandemic put a halt to the real estate industry back in the spring, things have started to pick up.

Kaya Wheeler, a first-time homebuyer, said even with the pandemic going on, she still wants to find a home of her own.

“When we do go see homes, we have been asked not to touch surfaces, like turning off and on lights, like maybe not to do that,” she said.

“There’s usually hand sanitizer as soon as you walk in the door.”

Glen Tosh, president of the Manitoba Real Estate Association, said when the province first shut down, houses weren’t selling -- now it’s a selling frenzy

“There’s definitely some pent-up demand because the real estate market kind of, in a sense, lost out on the latter half of March and most of the month of April, where there was very limited number of sales,” he said.

According to the Manitoba Real Estate Association, 2,015 residential properties sold in June, which is $616.1 million in total dollar volume. So far this year, there have been over 7,100 residential sales, which represents 97 per cent of the total unit sales over the same time period last year.

“Brandon and Winnipeg are our two major centres that we have the most data on, and they're both up in the month of June,” Tosh said.

“We also recently attained some data that cottage sales are up significantly in the month of June, plus in the year, they are up almost 50 per cent.”

Real estate agent Monica Manaigre said there’s actually a shortage of houses for sale.

“Twenty-nine per cent of houses sold in June sold for over list price, so we are seeing a lot more buyers and not quite enough inventory,” she said.

That’s something Wheeler knows first-hand.

“We were looking at a house and an offer was accepted while we were still in the house,” Wheeler said.

Wheeler said there are a few houses in her price range, but they are going fast. She said she has put offers out, but she wasn’t the only one.

“I think there were six or seven offers on the same house,” she said.

Wheeler’s advice for other first time homebuyers is to go slow and take their time to find their perfect first home.",Manitoba sees record number of home sales in June,0,0.4025746085300167

A report submitted to Vancouver council from the city's fire chief recommends a bylaw prohibiting the sale of animal deterrent devices.

The report cites an increase in complaints about the explosive devices being set off in the city starting in April.

There were 167 complaints by early June, it says.

The report also mentions evidence some of the devices have been turned into improvised explosive devices.",Should bear bangers be banned? Vancouver council mulls sales bylaw,7,0.1677975358744883
815,"You may have seen the reports about how the ever-beneficent auto insurance industry will be offering credits of “up to $150” or “up to 15 per cent” on premiums, because people are not driving as much due to the COVID-19 pandemic, hence are not exposed to as much risk.

And yet, our provincial government is re-introducing photo radar to deal with the carnage on our roads.

More on that next week; one shameless scandal at a time...

At Kenzie World Headquarters, we got the insurance premium “credit” from our insurance company the other day.

$7 a month for three months.

Twenty-one whole dollars! Start planning the fully masked socially distanced parade.

I guess $7 is in the range of “up to” $150.

It’s just “not very close to” $150.

As former Ontario premier Kathleen Wynne might have put it, that’s a “stretch goal...”

Our household must look damn near ideal to an insurance company.

Safe, well-trained drivers.

Excellent driving records.

No more teenagers at home.

Neither of us drives to work. (OK, so I drive FOR work, but I am not a regular commuter.)

Lifelong abstainers.

In fact, we were originally with “Abstainers Insurance” — yes, there was such a thing before it was bought out, and we ended up in the hands of Aviva.

We live out in the country, away from the congestion and fender-benders of the city.

You’d think insurance companies would be pressing rubies into our ears, trying to sign us up.

So if we only qualify for a $7 discount, who the heck is getting $150?

Certainly nobody I know.

When I told a friend of mine, a former insurance broker, about my massive rebate, he chuckled and said, “Most people didn’t get anything!”

It is sounding more and more like a PR ploy to make it look like the insurance industry is “doing their bit” in this difficult time.

(Emphasis on the word “bit.”)

My “insider” told me there are big changes happening within this industry.

First, a couple of definitions.

A “broker” represents several different insurance companies, and will shop around to get you the best package for your particular needs. They get a commission from the sale, which runs about 12.5 per cent in automobile insurance, and up to 20 per cent for life insurance.

An “agent” represents only one company, so will sell you a product which his company supplies.

No commission.

Should also make insurance cheaper for you, yes?

Not so’s you’d notice.

My insider told me about a guy he knows. Lives north of Lindsay. Retired, so no longer drives to work. When his policy came up for renewal recently, his premium rose 22 per cent.

Same car. Same driver. Same location. Nearly a one-quarter increase in his premium.

So the insurance industry giveth with one hand — that $7 — and taketh away with the other.

From what my ex-broker sees, the insurance companies are trying to get rid of brokers altogether.

Makes some sense at least from the perspective of the companies — no need to pay that commission.

They are doing this by paying handsomely to buy up these formerly independent brokerages to gain access to their “book” — industry-speak for their client portfolio.

There is also a lot of interest in them from U.S.-based hedge funds.

So the industry is becoming ever more concentrated in ever fewer hands.

When the number of people who can supply you with insurance decreases, what happens to the price?

You betcha.

Maybe not a complete monopoly.

But increasingly an oligopoly, in which a few big players can have a significant impact on the scene, which needless to say leads to higher prices.

And greater profits for themselves.

No wonder the share prices of insurance companies keep going up.

Not that I am against profit.

But if it’s acquired using underhanded and possibly illegal means, off with their heads!

Insurance companies also have a stranglehold on the auto-body repair business.

You have a crash (they are almost never “accidents,” because somebody is always to blame, never mind “no-fault” insurance).

Your insurance company tells you to take the car to their “appraiser,” who arranges everything for you. You may never meet the people who fix your car.

Fortunately, when a tree almost crushed our Miata a few years ago, we took it to the company-appointed body shop. They asked if we wanted steel or aluminum for the hood and trunk lid.

Um, what the car came with, please, aluminum.

How many people unknowingly let their cars be diminished by this shady practice?

Many years ago, a friend of mine who ran a body shop here in Milton had a list of insurance companies posted on his office wall. If you were insured with one of them, he told you to take your business elsewhere.

He was good enough he could afford to do that.

Most shops cannot.

Other body shops I know of won’t take much, if any, collision work.

Insurance companies specify how much they will pay per hour for body repairs. With the complexity of today’s cars — aluminum and high-strength steels, composites, sensors that must be adjusted to a millimetre of precision in order to be effective — body shop technicians need to be highly trained and skilled, and they require expensive tools to do the job correctly.

This shop can’t make a profit on what the insurance companies will pay, so they focus on restoration work for high-end cars because their owners can and will pay for a proper job.

So, why aren’t car owners up in arms over these rate increases, when the service they need might well be compromised?

At least one regular reader is — he put me onto this scam. Thanks, Jeff.

But maybe it’s because we have become distracted by the current crisis.

Now, you wouldn’t think this industry, a paragon of virtue for generations, would try to take advantage of this pandemic, do you?

Perish the thought.

But I wouldn’t put it past them.

816,"TORONTO -- Struggling to breathe is one of the main symptoms of the novel coronavirus that has recently swept across the country. But for Nicole Stringer, who suffers from cystic fibrosis, it's been the reality for her entire life.

For Stringer, every breath is a battle. Now, she's fighting for access to a drug that could change that.

The Kelowna, B.C. woman was born with cystic fibrosis (CF), a genetic disorder that causes mucus to clog her lungs and damages her organs. On top of that, Stringer is also infected with a superbug, a bacteria called Pseudomonas aeruginosa which can't be killed by antibiotics.

Stringer uses puffers, an oxygen machine and takes a hundred pills every day to control symptoms like fever and nausea. But she's still constantly in and out of hospital, and plagued by the knowledge that at any time, her lungs could fail.

Her best friend, also a CF patient, recently succumbed to the disease.

Stringer has tried every treatment -- including travelling to the U.S. to become the first Canadian CF patient to try an experimental treatment called phage therapy, which uses viruses to kill bacteria. No treatment so far has truly helped.

""I have developed resistance to almost all of the antibiotics that I can take,"" she told CTV News. ""So now I have lung infections that are just doing what they're going to do and I have nothing to fight them with anymore, so I am going to continue to get sicker.""

COVID-19 poses yet another risk to Stringer's life, and has kept her isolated indoors for months.

But she sees hope for her declining health in the form of a drug that is already improving the health of CF patients in the U.S.: Trikafta.

Cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in a specific gene, which create a faulty protein. Trikafta works by targeting that mutation to help the defective protein work more efficiently, with signs it can slow or even stop the progression of the disease.

""Within a week's time many people have had less mucus, they can run up the stairs, they can play with their kids, so it is a drug that's life changing, it's transformational for people with a fatal genetic disease,"" Kelly Grover, CEO of Cystic Fibrosis Canada, told CTV News.

Trikafta is a combination of three drugs: elexacaftor, tezacaftor, and ivacaftor. The therapy can potentially treat up to 90 per cent of CF patients, according to a press release by Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, the company behind the drug.

However, Stringer can't access it, because it's not approved in Canada.

""To have something that … is life-changing that it's right there, but we can't grab it, is the most frustrating thing of my life,"" she said.

Trikafta has made all the difference to Stephi Lee, an American artist and online influencer. Several American patients have documented significant improvements on their YouTube channels.

""Listen to this,"" Lee says in one video. She inhales. ""I didn't even cough.""

Part of the frustration for Canadian patients is that the drug was fast-tracked for approval in the U.S. last year, where studies show it helps to improve lung function by up to 14 per cent.

Grover said it was ""horrendous"" that we haven't seen any progress towards approving the drug here, considering it was approved so quickly within the U.S.

""In the U.K. they are fast-tracking its approval, Ireland and Switzerland have said they will fund it as soon as it becomes approved,"" she said. ""And so every country seems to be clamouring to get its hands on this drug for people with CF, and in Canada we can't even get it into Health Canada for safety reviews. So we're very concerned.

""Patients are really being held hostage in Canada because of that.""

Cystic Fibrosis Canada is calling on Canadian governments and regulators to collaborate with each other and manufacturer Vertex in order to accelerate the approval of Trikafta in Canada, so that it can be made available to patients there.

But the real problem is price. In the U.S., the listed cost for Trikafta is US$311,000 per year.

According to Cystic Fibrosis Canada, in order to get to a Canadian price, the manufacturer must first apply for Health Canada approval of the drug, after which Canada's drug review and reimbursement processes kick in. The Patented Medicine Prices Review Board will determine the maximum price a company can charge for a new patented drug sold in Canada. What public and private insurers pay is negotiated with the company. A body called the pan-Canadian Pharmaceutical Alliance negotiates the price that consumers will actually be paying on behalf of the provincial, territorial and federal programs.

The estimated cost for one Trikafta patient in Canada could be more than $400,000 a year.

And Vertex hasn't even applied to sell it here, amid speculation it would not be approved at that price.

An evidence report put out on April 27 by the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER), an independent watchdog for drug pricing in the U.S., investigated Trikafta and three other CF treatments by Vertex.

ICER gave the drug their highest ""A"" evidence rating a vote of confidence in the drug's transformative effect on patients' lives but added that the price was far too high.

They estimated that the health-benefit price benchmark for Trikafta should be between US$67,900 and US$85,000 per year, which would require a 73 to 78 per cent discount from the drug's current listed price.

In a press release for the report, David Rind, ICER's Chief Medical Officer, said that ""despite being transformative therapies, the prices set by the manufacturer costing many millions of dollars over the lifetime of an average patient are out of proportion to their substantial benefits.

""When a manufacturer has a monopoly on treatments and is aware that insurers will be unable to refuse coverage, the lack of usual counterbalancing forces can lead to excessive prices,"" Rind said.

""Patients who receive the treatments will benefit, but unaligned prices will cause significant negative health consequences for many unseen individuals those throughout society who will experience financial toxicity and may have to delay care, forego care, or even abandon insurance as their out of pocket costs and premiums are driven upward.""

But Canadian doctors and patients say that the drug being unavailable in Canada doesn't fix the price problem.

""I think we need a long-term solution,"" Dr. Pearce Wilcox, a respirologist at St. Paul's Hospital, told CTV News. ""We recognize that medication like this and others are very expensive medications and that's the reality and the public system will have challenges in coming up with that funding.

""On the other hand … cystic fibrosis is a rare disease. So, the long term solution is we need some type of strategy that recognizes rare diseases and the challenges of costs for these medications.

""In the shorter term, there needs to be some of innovative approach,"" to allow patients to get access, he added.

The pharmaceutical company does provide a compassionate care program that allows the sickest patients to have access to medication at a discount, but many patients dealing with a lot of suffering in their day to day lives still will not qualify for that, Wilcox said.

""I think everybody has the right to a life-changing drug,"" Grover agreed. ""I think at this stage we need to get it into the queue, so that the public and private payers can negotiate with the manufacturer to [a] price that makes sense to the Canadian system. And right now we can't even get it into the queue to assess its safety.""

The population of Canadians with cystic fibrosis is around 4,300, ""so you're talking about thousands that this [drug] could help,"" Grover said.

Wilcox said he has been working with cystic fibrosis patients for more than 20 years, and has seen a lot of initiatives introduced over the years to improve care.

But Trikafta is in ""the game-changer category,"" for him in how much it can improve quality of life and slow the progression of the disease.

""There is a medication that has the chance of making a dramatic difference in their, their outcome, and yet … we have very limited access to this compound,"" he said.

For Stringer, the drug feels like her last chance.

""If I don't get Trikafta, I'm going to continue to get sicker,"" she said. ""I could be one infection away from dying. That's really all it takes, is one infection.

""The life that I have right now is not life,"" she added. ""I'm at home all the time, I need oxygen a lot of the time. I barely have enough energy to get up and go into my living room. I'm 28 years old and I don't have a life.""

Stringer made her own urgent appeal directly to Vertex, through Health Canada's Special Access Programme the only way a Canadian can access medication not yet available for sale in Canada but was turned down.

There is a government push to assist her, led by Conservative MP Dan Albas from B.C.

On May 4, he and 58 MPs signed a letter addressed to Health Minister Patty Hajdu asking what she is doing to ensure that Canadians get access to the drug.

In the letter, they mention that Vertex has ""signalled their willingness to negotiate and conclude a Price Listing Agreement with the pan-Canadian Pharmaceutical Alliance.

""During the negotiation period, they have offered to supply their drugs to Canadians suffering with CF for free,"" the letter continues.

""As the Minister of Health, please provide us with an update on what you are doing to support the negotiations with Vertex and ensure that Canadians have access to these life-saving and life-changing drugs.""

Stringer, and other patients like her, are waiting to see if anything comes of the letter, and if Trikafta will come to Canada or not.

In the meantime, Canadian patients with cystic fibrosis will have to remain in limbo, caught between hope and reality.","This drug can treat 90 per cent of cystic fibrosis patients, but it's not available in Canada",8,0.6872421966577477
817,"Bank of America Corp.’s profit slid 52 per cent as it joined rivals in preparing for an onslaught of consumer defaults spurred by the pandemic’s economic fallout.

Profit at the consumer-banking unit plunged 98 per cent as the coronavirus shuttered much of the U.S. economy and caused tens of millions of Americans to lose their jobs. The company allocated $5.1 billion (U.S.) for loan losses in the second quarter, the most since 2010, as Bank of America joined its biggest rivals in predicting pain to come that contrasts with stock market optimism for a quick economic rebound.

Calling it “the most tumultuous period since the Great Depression,” chief executive officer Brian Moynihan said in a statement that “strong capital markets results provided an important counterbalance to the COVID-19-related impacts on our consumer business.”

With its 4,300 branches across the country, Bank of America is often seen as a bellwether for the U.S. consumer. Government stimulus measures and bank forbearance have kept some individuals and businesses afloat, but the largest U.S. lenders used the first full quarter with the pandemic to prepare for coming pain.

JPMorgan Chase & Co., Wells Fargo & Co. and Citigroup Inc. set aside almost $28 billion of credit-loss provisions when they reported results earlier this week, citing a deteriorating outlook.

While Bank of America’s provision rose from the first quarter, it came in at roughly half the level of its closest rivals. Executives defended the discrepancy, saying the company has been conservative in its underwriting standards, having focused on customers who are more creditworthy and trimmed its exposure to the hardest-hit industries in recent years. They cited Federal Reserve stress tests that showed Bank of America had the lowest projected loan-loss rate among the four biggest U.S. lenders.

“We’re analyzing each relationship individually,” chief financial officer Paul Donofrio told reporters on a conference call. “We’re going through the whole loan portfolio. Our teams have done that. We have really studied this and worked very closely with our customers.”

Shares of Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America slid 2.4 per cent to $24 at 12:36 p.m. in New York. They’ve declined 32 per cent this year.

“Some of the underlying numbers were a little weaker,” particularly net interest income, Atlantic Equities analyst John Heagerty wrote in a note to investors. “With interest rates likely to remain low” and trading and investment-banking revenue “likely to fade” in the second half of the year, “there are obvious concerns about the future earnings trajectory of the bank.”

Market volatility

Bank of America joined other Wall Street firms in profiting from volatility in financial markets resulting from the pandemic, notching its best quarter for trading revenue since 2012. Fixed-income trading revenue beat forecasts in the second quarter, rising 50 per cent to $3.2 billion, while investment-banking fees jumped 57 per cent to a record $2.2 billion.

Consumers and businesses are adapting to a new economic reality as some areas reopen, and others shut down again, in response to virus conditions, Moynihan said. While there are some encouraging signs of a rebound in consumer spending, economic projections have deteriorated, pointing to a recessionary environment that should last deep into 2022.

“It’s not a rosy picture,” he said on a conference call with analysts.

Net interest income — revenue from customers’ loan payments minus what the company pays depositors — fell 11 per cent to $10.8 billion in the second quarter. On a fully taxable-equivalent basis, the figure was $11 billion, falling short of the $11.2 billion average estimate of 11 analysts in a Bloomberg survey. NII may drop by a “couple hundred million dollars” because of commercial-loan pay-downs in the third quarter, Donofrio said.

819,"TORONTO - North American stock markets dropped Thursday after several days of gains amid uncertainty about the economic recovery despite strong U.S. retail sales.

Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at SIA Wealth Management, called it a “summer of sideways.”

“I still think that’s the situation we’re probably in where it’s likely to be more of a selective market than these big broad moves up and down that we’ve seen in the first half of this year,” he said.

Prospects for an economic recovery have been unclear with potential for setbacks as a spike in COVID-19 infections has prompted some U.S. states to reclose.

U.S. retail sales were “spectacular” in June, climbing 7.5 per cent after May’s 17.7 per cent jump.

However, weekly jobless claims were slightly worse than expected as 1.3 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week, the 17th consecutive week exceeding one million as 32 million Americans remained on unemployment benefits.

The cumulative effect of a number of factors, including jobless claims, rising infections and reclosings have hurt sentiment, Cieszynski said.

“It’s becoming apparent that this kind of uncertainty and choppiness could drag on awhile.”

Investors appear to have taken advantage of strong market run-ups to crystallize profits by moving capital from overperforming sectors like technology into other areas where they hope to make some money.

“It doesn’t seem like people are taking money and going to cash, they’re just taking money and redeploying it elsewhere into stocks,” he said.

The S&P/TSX composite index closed down 38.83 points at 16,024.50.

In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 135.39 points at 26,734.71. The S&P 500 index was down 10.99 points at 3,215.57, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite was down 76.66 points at 10,473.83.

Technology was the weakest sector in Canada, losing 1.5 per cent as Shopify Inc. fell 3.1 per cent.

Energy and materials also lost ground on lower crude oil and gold prices, but still remained relatively strong.

Whitecap Resources Inc. lost 2.1 per cent, Vermilion Energy Inc. two per cent and Canadian Natural Resources 1.8 per cent amid a big drawdown of U.S. crude stockpiles, as well as OPEC countries and Russia saying they will roll back 2.1 million barrels per day of production cuts from August.

The September crude contract was down 47 cents at US$40.93 per barrel and the August natural gas contract was down 5.5 cents at US$1.72 per mmBTU.

The August gold contract was down US$13.50 at US$1,800.30 an ounce and the September copper contract was 1.65 cents at US$2.90 a pound.

In the materials sector, which includes gold producers, First Quantum Minerals Ltd. saw the biggest drop with four per cent, followed by Alacer Gold Corp. at 3.6 per cent.

Gold lost a little sparkle after several central banks reporting this week didn’t increase stimulus as they’ve done in the past, said Cieszynski.

The health-care sector was also weaker as shares of Aurora Cannabis Inc. lost 5.3 per cent.

The Canadian dollar traded for 73.84 cents US compared with 73.89 cents US on Thursday.

Industrials rose even though Air Canada shares partially reversed from Wednesday’s strong gains by losing nearly four per cent in an example of future market trends, said Cieszynski.

“One of the greatest things we have seen is the number of new families who are looking to get into boating to connect with their families,"" Rick Layzell, a member of the Boating Ontario Association, tells CTV News Toronto.

Layzell says families are looking for new ways to have fun while keeping physically distant from others and that boating is one of the best ways to do that.

Andre Ganton is with United City Yachts, a company that specializes in selling large pre-owned boats, and says that many people are trying out boating for the first time while others are selling their smaller boats to upgrade up to larger one.

“My feeling is we are going to have one of our best years in a decade,"" Ganton says. “Boating is just naturally a socially distant activity. You can get on the boat, you can head out on the water, you can drop anchor and go swimming.”

And RVs sales appear to be just as popular. At the Camping in Style RV Centre in Whitby, sales manager Erroll Knight says there is a huge interest in large RVs as well as tent trailers.

“We have a great country and this summer is a great opportunity to see it in an RV,” Knight says.

The RV boom is not limited to Ontario. Knight says many Canadians across the country eager to hit the road, while staying away from the crowds.

“The amount of people looking to get out of the city and go to a campground is everybody’s goal right now,"" Knight says.

The only issue for families looking to get into boating or RVing is supply. Many boats and RVs are produced in the United States where sales are also going up, so there is growing concern that suppliers may not be able to keep up with demand.","RV and boat sales booming during COVID-19 pandemic, business owners say",0,0.05010503390228793
823,"The catalogue also features seven works from Quebec automatiste painter Jean-Paul Riopelle,

A portrait by Pablo Picasso is among the artworks on offer at Heffel Fine Art Auction House’s virtual sale tonight.

Heffel says “Tete de femme,” an oil-on-canvas painted by Picasso in 1939, could fetch between $1.2 million and $1.6 million.

It’s one of 112 lots open for bids at the Toronto auction house’s spring sale, which was originally scheduled for May, but was postponed because of COVID-19 concerns.

Heffel says it’s recreating the real-time excitement of an in-person auction with its new live online bidding system. Prospective buyers can also place bids by phone, or can submit their offers before the sale starts.

Highlights include Canadian artist Alex Colville’s 1976 painting “Dog and Bridge,” which is expected to hammer down for between $800,000 and $1.2 million.

A triptych from abstract expressionist Joan Mitchell will also hit the auction block with an estimated price tag of $400,000 to $600,000.

The catalogue also features seven works from Quebec automatiste painter Jean-Paul Riopelle, including the nine-foot canvas “Le reveil,” which is estimated to be worth $1 million to $1.5 million.

Heffel is also selling several works from the Group of Seven and associated artists.

Lawren Harris’s ”North Shore, Lake Superior III” was stowed away among a late Canadian-born painter’s possessions for decades, says Heffel. But after being uncovered by relatives earlier this year, the sketch is on sale for a pre-auction estimate of $125,000 to $175,000.

Among three works on offer from Emily Carr is the 1929 canvas “Forest Interior,” which has been valued at $150,000 to $200,000.

Heffel says buyers will also have a rare chance to bid on one of Yvonne Housser’s portrayals of Cobalt, Ont. The auction house pegs the painting’s pricetag at $30,000 to $50,000.

825,"MONTREAL -- The Business Development Bank of Canada is pledging $160 million for companies that are rich in intellectual property, but often struggle to access capital.

Jerome Nycz, the executive vice-president at Montreal-based BDC Capital, says in a statement that the money will help companies enable commercialization, increase competitiveness and expand globally.

He says the goal of the entrepreneur-focused bank is to lead by example and inspire like-minded stakeholders to support more companies and make Canada a leader in IP.

BDC's new coffers will provide financing in the form of a sub-debt, convertible debt and equity to accelerate commercialization.

The fund will target scaling companies in knowledge-based industries with rich IP portfolios including patents, design, and trade secrets and at least $1 million in annual revenue.

According to a 2017 study from U.S. intellectual property merchant bank Ocean Tomo, 83 per cent of the value of S&P 500 companies came from tangible assets in 1975, but in 2015, it shifted to 84 per cent of value coming from intangible assets like IP.

The Priestley family has put their resort at Ucluelet’s tranquil Terrace Beach on the market. (Nora O’Malley photo)

A coastal haven owned by the family of ’90s TV star is up for grabs on Vancouver Island.

Terrace Beach Resort, a commercial offering of 21 suites and cabins next to Ucluelet’s world-famous Wild Pacific Trail, was recently listed for $4,495,000.

The Priestley Family — Norma, Lorne and son Jason of Beverly Hills 90210 fame — have been welcoming guests to their vacationer’s oasis for the past 20 years.

“We are selling for simple reasons. We are getting older. Retirement age of 65 is long past,” said Lorne and Norma Priestley in an email to the VI Free Daily.

RELATED: West Coast resorts cautiously prepare to welcome tourists again

Port Alberni-based realtor Dave Koszegi is working with the Priestleys to find the right buyer.

“There is nothing available like it. It’s super unique and it has an interesting storyline with celebrity ownership and stuff,” said Koszegi. Jason Priestley became a teen heart-throb playing the character Brandon Walsh on Beverly Hills 90210.

Koszegi says he’s had a fair bit of interest in the property despite the challenges presented by COVID-19.

“It’s well-priced,” he said. “The inquiries that we’ve had, there have been a few investor/developer type people where normally they’d buy a resort and then strata title it and then split it up and sell it off, well [Terrace Beach Resort] is already strata titled.”

BC Assessment as of July 1, 2020 shows an increase to the value of each strata unit. ‘Unit One’ was valued at $510,000—previous year value was $463,000—for example, and ‘Unit Two’ was valued at $123,000—previous year value was $112,500.

Constructed in 1999, Terrace Beach Resort is designed to resemble a 1920 fishing village: the central building that houses the main office is built on pilings, with boardwalks that meander the majestic trees to adjoining beachfront cottages. Suites are fully-equipped kitchenettes and many have private decks with hot tubs.

RELATED: Without Luke Perry, ‘Beverly Hills, 90210’ cast preps reboot

Koszegi said the vacation property has been a popular and well-enjoyed spot.

“Anything on the West Coast, it feels like the day you build it nature is taking it back. I mean, it could use some upgrades,” he said.

Nonetheless, Koszegi adds that owning a resort in Ucluelet is a “world-class opportunity”.

“It’s so international. Europeans will come in the offseason. It’s a small little hideaway place with international draw and that’s the magic there. It’s unlike anywhere else on the Island,” he said.

Colville’s 1976 canvas “Dog and Bridge” sold for more than $2.4 million — doubling its estimated value. The work had been owned privately for decades and had never appeared at auction before.

“Presenting a masterpiece as special as Colville’s ‘Dog and Bridge’ was a highlight for Heffel, and we’re thrilled that our excitement was matched by our bidders,” said David Heffel, president of Heffel Fine Art Auction House, which held the sale.

Other works saw strong bidding.

Performed behind a clear plastic curtain, live music returned to Whalley Legion on Canada Day (July 1).

As part of COVID-19 control measures, the screen separated the Springsteen/Orbison tribute band from the audience during the daytime gig.

The two-piece act features Daniel Yard (as Bruce Springsteen) and Gord Rebelato (Roy Orbison), with special guest Janice Anderson as Patsy Cline.

“It was interesting playing behind a plastic curtain at Whalley legion for Canada Day yesterday, but it was a packed house,” Yard posted to the Facebook page Live Music in Surrey BC.

“First legion in the Lower Mainland to have live music. Thanks to everyone who came out for the Springsteen/Orbison show.”

During the pandemic, with capacity capped at 50 people including patrons and staff, the Legion hall will host live bands for special events only, at a temporary location at 10767 King George Blvd.

In Newton, Brewster’s Pub is advertising a “BBQ & Band” night Saturday, July 18, featuring the acoustic sounds of Sally Melo and Jay Patterson. Tickets are $12 per person for the “Customer Appreciation Day” promo.

The pub calendar also includes a Flashback! show on July 11 and The Rhythm Method band July 25.

Elsewhere, White Hart Public House continues to showcase bands on stage at the former Hook and Ladder space, including Long Run (July 11), the AC/DC tribute band Bonnie Scott (July 18) and The Gemtones (July 24), among others.

“We want to remind everyone that we have set floor plans for all shows due to covid restrictions,” pub operators posted to Facebook. “We also have curtains between some tables for safety measures, although we will always try to give everyone the best spot — we do have to follow protocol. Safety first.”

Meantime, Surrey’s online Canada Day celebration earned 45,000 views on Facebook and YouTube Live, according to city hall.

The event marked the nation’s 153rd birthday with performances by Colin James, 54-40, Bif Naked, Alex Cuba and more, in a four-hour virtual party. Canadian hockey legend Hayley Wickenheiser hosted the two-part event, which featured a morning “Family Hour” and evening concert.

The Lavazza Drive-In Film Festival, running July 20 to 31, will screen 12 movies from countries most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic at Ontario Place. It’s a partnership with the Italian Embassy, with a portion of ticket sales donated to the Canadian Red Cross.  It opens with the Toronto debut of Canadian indie film “The Cuban,” starring Oscar winner Louis Gossett Jr., and closes with the Canadian premiere of Italian drama “If Only/Magari.”  Other titles include the U.K. comedy “Fisherman’s Friends”; crime thriller “Sheep Without a Shepherd” from China; Brazilian football dramedy “Back to Maracana”; family-friendly “Spread Your Wings” from France; Second World War movie “T-34” from Russia; Indian comedy “Bala”; “ The Peanut Butter Falcon” from the U.S.; and the Italian movies “Tomorrow’s a New Day,” “If You Love Me” and “I Hate Summer.”  See icff.ca for information.  Lori Loughlin, husband ‘respectfully’ seek bail cut  Lori Loughlin and husband Mossimo Giannulli, who pleaded guilty in the nation’s college admissions scandal, want to get a better deal on their $1 million bail, and federal prosecutors in Boston are OK with it.  The couple are scheduled to be sentenced Aug. 21 on conspiracy charges in their alleged efforts to get their daughters admitted to the University of Southern California. On Monday in Boston, they filed a motion asking “respectfully” for the court to release their $1-million-US bonds secured by their property, reducing their bail to $100,000, and lift the requirement that the $100,000 bonds also be secured by money or property.  “The Government assents to the relief sought in this motion,” the couple’s team of lawyers wrote in their motion. After asserting their innocence for more than a year, Loughlin and Giannulli reversed course on May 22, formally pleading guilty to one count each of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and mail fraud, in separate plea agreements with federal prosecutors.  If the couple’s sentences from their deals are accepted by U.S. District Judge Nathaniel Gorton, Loughlin will serve two months in prison, pay a fine of $150,000, serve two years of supervised release and undertake 100 hours of community service. Giannulli would serve five months in prison, pay a $250,000 fine and have two years of supervised release with 250 hours of community service.  Tom Bergeron, Erin Andrews exit ‘Dancing With the Stars’ The dance has ended for “Dancing With the Stars” hosts Tom Bergeron and Erin Andrews.  ABC said in a statement that the show is looking to “embark on a new creative direction” and host Bergeron “departs the show with our sincerest thanks and gratitude for his trademark wit and charm that helped make this show a success.” No replacements were named; Andrews originally competed as a contestant back in 2010 and returned as co-host in 2014, while Bergeron has hosted since its premiere in 2005.  He took to Twitter to announce his departure. “It’s been an incredible 15-year run and the most unexpected gift of my career,” he wrote. “I’m grateful for that and for the lifelong friendships made.”  Last year, Bergeron made waves when he expressed his unhappiness that former White House press secretary Sean Spicer was among the contestants for the fall season. Bergeron tweeted that he earlier told producers he hoped the new season would be a “joyful respite from our exhausting political climate” and urged them not have any “divisive bookings.”  The network on Monday also said farewell to “Her signature sense of humour has become a hallmark of the show,” the statement read.  Pop Smoke and ‘Hamilton’ Shake Up the Billboard Chart The posthumous debut album by Brooklyn rapper Pop Smoke, who was shot and killed in February, debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard album chart this week, arriving as one of the biggest releases of a slow summer in the music business, one of countless industries greatly affected by the coronavirus pandemic.  “Shoot for the Stars Aim for the Moon,” Pop Smoke’s third career release after two mixtapes, had the largest opening week since Lady Gaga’s “Chromatica” in early June, earning the equivalent of 251,000 albums sold, factoring in both streaming and traditional sales. Songs from the album were streamed 268 million times — the fourth-best streaming week of the year — while bundles of the music and merchandise helped lead to 59,000 units in sales, according to Nielsen.  Pop Smoke, born Bashar Jackson, was killed during a home invasion in the Hollywood Hills section of Los Angeles, interrupting his meteoric mainstream rise from the streets of Canarsie, Brooklyn, New York, where he was at the forefront of the bubbling drill scene. Last week, the Los Angeles Police Department arrested five men in connection with the crime.  In the No. 2 spot this week is the original Broadway cast recording of “Hamilton,” which reached its highest chart placement in its 250th week on Billboard, surging nearly 300% thanks to the July 3 streaming premiere of the filmed version of the show on Disney+. The cast album, released in September 2015, previously peaked at No. 3 on the chart in 2016, following its 11 wins at that year’s Tony Awards. This time, songs from “Hamilton” were streamed 90 million times — a record for cast recordings — and the album sold 32,000 units, for a one-week total of 102,000.  The arrival of Pop Smoke and the resurgence of “Hamilton” bumped rapper Lil Baby’s “My Turn,” which sat at No. 1 for the past four weeks in lieu of major new releases, to No. 3 in its 19th week on the chart. “Blame It on Baby” by DaBaby fell one spot to No. 4, while Post Malone’s “Hollywood’s Bleeding” landed at No. 5.

Last year, Ranj Singh performed close to 220 gigs.

“And this year started off fantastic,” the Surrey-based musician said, “but then this (pandemic) came in and closed everything down.”

No question, 2020 has been a bleak year for the city’s performing artists, due to COVID-19 and the resulting lack of events to play.

In response, Surrey Civic Theatres has rolled out a series of “Digital Stage” online concerts that offer local musicians paid gigs at a time when few are available to them.

The next one, set for Friday, July 24, will feature Singh and fellow player Sami Ghawi in an hour-long showcase starting at 7 p.m. on Surrey Civic Theatres’ Facebook page and also the city’s Youtube channel.

Ghawi has performed a few of the Digital Stage concerts in recent weeks, under the banner of his FUSIONpresents brand, but for Singh it’s pretty much a new adventure in the online-gig world.

“I’ve done a few (concerts) from home, trial and error, trying to get the sound right and things working properly,” Singh said of recent attempts to enter the virtual world of concerts. “Then with Sami’s help he got me set up and I got a bit more gear for that, and now it’s pretty good.

“I type with one finger so I’m not a technical guy at all,” he added with a laugh, “so it’s been a good learning experience for me.”

• RELATED STORY, from 2016: Melodic memories for brain-injury survivors in song by Surrey’s Ranj Singh.

On July 24 the duo will perform together in the same room at Surrey Arts Centre, for an online audience only.

“We’ve been rehearsing outdoors in a park over the last month or so, with social distancing and everything, and it will be the same setup that night,” Singh explained. “It will be mostly covers, but when I do covers I usually do them quite different, and as you know Sami is a great musician so he adds a whole new flavour to it as well, so it’s been a lot of fun to play with him. It’s going to be his style mixed with my style, with a couple of originals in there too.”

(Story continues below video)

Singh and Ghawi first met in 2018 at the Surrey Arts and Business Awards, although they’d been Facebook friends prior to that. Ghawi’s FUSIONpresents company later began booking Singh at the Sheraton Vancouver Guildford Hotel’s MIXT Lounge; the upcoming showcase will mark the first time they’ll gig together.

Ghawi, who has hosted the Sunday-night jam at White Rock’s West Beach bar for more than a decade, said he’s thrilled to be a part of the Digital Stage initiative.

“I’m so grateful for this opportunity from the City of Surrey that gives artists the chance to perform and entertain the public,” he said. “Being offered a platform to perform and get paid when all our scheduled shows have been cancelled overnight is a huge blessing.”

• RELATED STORY: B.C.’s virtual ‘SoundON’ concerts kick off with sounds of Surrey festival.

Singh is currently performing five or six gigs a month, mostly outdoors.

“I’m at Krause Berry Farms (in Langley) every weekend, booked there until September, which is nice of them,” Singh explained. “And I have a few weddings to do, which have been scaled down to 20 or 30 people, pretty much, and those were booked last year. And I’ve been offered other gigs where I’m like, “nope,” where I’m just not comfortable doing them. Like, when we’re singing, you’re spitting 20 feet in front of you, so you have to have nobody near you. We have to be careful.”

Looking ahead, in a show called “Write the Future,” the Digital Stage concert on Aug. 7 will feature Devon More and her “humble, humorous and harmonious take on the human condition in 2020,” according to an event post on surrey.ca. “Building musical arrangements for her indie rock/pop tunes from scratch, she uses a loop pedal to live-mix the electric guitar, flute, glockenspiel, and whatever else is in her long arm’s reach.”

836,"A Zoom session on Saturday, July 18, will serve as a free art assessment and critique at 10 a.m.

Lalita Hamill’s childhood exposure to visual art was limited. That was until a massive snowstorm left her unexpectedly stranded at her friend’s house for three days.

Until then, Hamill’s background was mainly music, academics, and competitive swimming – plus a degree in Philosophy earned at the University of Victoria.

“Though I was taught the skills needed to appreciate music and writing, I did not learn those same skills for visual art,” Hamill explained. “My parents would drag my sister and me to galleries when we travelled, but visual art didn’t really become part of my life until I was 24.”

With nothing to do during the snowstorm, Hamill pulled a book of black and white photos off of her shelf and drew for hours.

“I thought ‘that was fun, why haven’t I done this before’?”

Hamill began taking drawing lessons, eventually moving to Walnut Grove in in 2002.

A car accident in 2005 left her husband unable to work for four years, forcing her to become the sole breadwinner of the family.

“Within a year of the car accident, I realized that if I didn’t give my art and teaching a real shot, I would likely regret it. In short, I couldn’t not do it… I was compelled,” Hamill said. “Had the accident not happened, I doubt I would be a professional artist today.”

After taking on any art-related job she could get hands on in Langley-area and beyond, Hamill eventually facilitated art critiques for artists while teaching, painting, and exhibiting her work – all while raising three children.

Now, she has launched a new website to showcase current projects, provide insight into the artistic process, and showcase videos that will provide tips for art buyers, sellers, and artists of different stages.

“Many will be free, some art instruction videos will be for sale,” she said.

Having cultivated a broader and deeper understanding of art from the perspective of an artist, Hamill said her perspective and presentation differs from the standard approach.

“Art appreciation involves a balance between trusting our subjective, personal opinion, with an enhanced ability to identify quality work,” she said.

Anyone can join in for a Zoom session on July 18, which will act as a free art assessment and critique at 10 a.m.

Spots are limited to 15 for artists submitting work and 10 for art appreciators from the general public.

“At the start I will provide a painting – historical, my own, or a students – to demonstrate the assessment process,” Hamill said.

The session will be recorded and portions will be posted on YouTube as examples for others to see. Those participants who do not wish their face to be seen can turn off their video.

Artists will be given information about how to send Hamill two images 72 hours in advance.

Registrations close 48 hours ahead.

“I hope people will come away from my videos and projects feeling inspired to learn more about visual art,” Hamill noted. “I want to help people become comfortable, capable, and empowered to speak about visual art, to choose artwork to purchase, to paint quality work, and to appreciate art for ourselves.”

Hamill advised followers to keep an eye out for new classes, videos, and projects in the coming weeks.

People can visit www.lalitahamill.com to find out more.

840,"Theatre in the Country presents an online production of Nana’s Naughty Knickers by Katherine DiSavino. (Theatre in the Country/Special to the Langley Advance Times)

Since early April, Langley’s Theatre in the Country (TIC) has been presenting live streaming productions to a growing audience of viewers.

So far, they have presented 12 distinct scripts from one-acts to full plays from material largely in the public domain.

With a rotating group of 45 plus performers they have offered shows from Oscar Wilde to the Thin Man series.

This week they will present their first full length modern play, Nana’s Naughty Knickers, with playwright, Katherine Disavino in attendance via Zoom from Los Angeles.

DiSavino is a Los Angeles writer who serves as an executive story editor on CW’s Nancy Drew.

Her four published plays have been translated into multiple languages and performed around the world.

What protagonist Bridget saw as a unique opportunity to stay with her favorite Nana in New York for the summer, quickly turns into an experience she’ll never forget.

It seems her sweet Grandma is running an illegal boutique from her apartment, selling hand-made naughty knickers to every senior citizen in the five borough area! Will her Nana get arrested – or worse – evicted?

READ MORE: VIDEO: Theatre in the Country offering weekly performances through Zoom

When Theatre in the Country shuttered its doors on March 16, artistic director Reg Parks said they had no idea when or if they would reopen, but they started planning on how to keep their performers and patrons active and engaged in a live theatre experience.

“The idea is simple: using their bank of over 45 performers they will perform a new costumed, readers theatre show each weekend on Friday and Saturday night,” he said. “The audience that has been asked to pay what they can starting at $5. It is the company’s hope that no one needs to miss out on a play just because of financial uncertainty caused by a layoff or otherwise.”

Parks said TIC will open their doors with a two-person musical titled The Last 5 Years by Jason Robert Brown.

It will feature two veteran TIC performers, and an audience reduced to 50 from their normal capacity of 200.

Other shows will also be offered with casts of two to five and will be announced at a later date.

Theatre in the Country is a community based dinner-theatre which was founded by Reg and Erin Parks in 2013.

It was first located in Maple Ridge, before moving to downtown Langley three years ago.

Nana’s Naughty Knickers will be performed nightly on July 3 and 4 at 7:30 p.m.

Tickets and information on upcoming performance is available at https://theatreinthecountry.com.

Hjin is 19 and called his album “Before We are 20.” Available on several streaming services, it includes 10 original songs, and one cover of a Leonard Cohen tune. Hjin plays guitar and sings throughout the album. It is the second recording for Hjin, who has also released an EP with four jazz standards recorded live during one of his trio’s performances at The Jazz Room in Waterloo.  As soft-spoken as he is talented, Hjin was born in South Korea. His parents are professional musicians. His father, Mike, plays guitar. His mother, Sunny, plays piano. They worked as studio musicians, arrangers and producers.  The family moved to Kitchener in 2009, and Hjin started playing guitar not long afterwards. He learned his favourite songs by Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin and Eric Clapton. “It was just a lot of blues and rock,” said Hjin. Impressed with his progress, his parents urged him to start exploring jazz. So Hjin started listening to and emulating guitarists Pat Metheny and Wes Montgomery, and the lightning-fast saxophone solos of bebop innovator Charlie Parker. “That was probably around Grade 7,” said Hjin. When he started high school, Hjin attended Cameron Heights Collegiate. It has a diverse student population, and lots of resources, including a music program. Hjin loved it.  Every Saturday he was going to Toronto to attend the Humber College community school as well. On those days Hjin’s teacher was one of the leading jazz guitarists in the country — Lorne Lofsky.  Inquisitive, hard working, with a great attitude and up for anything, is how Lofsky describes the young guitar player. “He has something called ‘perfect pitch,’” said Lofsky. “Anything he hears he can recognize it, and emulate it right away.” Calling him extremely talented, Lofsky said Hjin soaked up all the lessons. “I had a great time teaching him,” said Lofsky. “We did a lot of playing and talking, mainly playing.” The group KW Big Band Theory was playing in Hjin’s high school and working with some of the students there. Tim Moher plays tenor and soprano sax with the band, and he remembers hearing Hjin play guitar when he was in Grade 9. “By Grade 10 or so I said: ‘Dave, we have to play together.’ And I hired him for street gigs up in Waterloo,” said Moher. Moher calls Hjin “a musical genius.” For inventiveness and sensitivity, he’s never heard anyone like him. Moher’s latest CD is a fusion of jazz, classical and Celtic music called “The Clefs of Moher.” Hjin plays on every track. Moher remembers one recording session when Hjin picked up a baritone guitar for the first time and played it for a few minutes. He used it to record the next track. “He just laid it down, he liked the sound,” said Moher. When Hjin was in Grade 11 he was playing guitar for KW Big Band Theory. The 17-piece ensemble plays a mix of jazz standards and new material. For a long time, the band leader was Robin Habermehl. “Incredible,” said Habermehl. “Nice kid, unbelievable musician. He has perfect pitch and a photographic memory.” Habermehl remembers leading the band through a rehearsal. Something wasn’t right. He stopped the musicians and studied the score in front of him. He asked Hjin to come up and look at the music and see if he could spot what was wrong. “Right from his chair he said: ‘The second trumpet should have a flat nine on that chord,’ and he’s looking at this guitar chart,” said Habermehl.  “Dave had already figured it out by listening to it, then he would play the chord on his guitar and said: ‘He needs to be playing a D flat,’” said Habermehl. Moher remembers the first time Hjin played with Big Band Theory, and the reaction of the band members when they heard Hjin’s first solo. “Everyone looked over, jaws on the floor,” said Moher. “Gifted, very gifted.” Hjin practices incessantly. On the way into the Humber College community school on Saturday mornings he sat in the back of a van and played his guitar. On the way home, same thing. At home, he practices for up to six hours a day. “And the nicest kid, no ego, no crap,” said Habermehl. “He was always respectful, never bragged, was very humble.” Habermehl calls Hjin one of the finest musicians he’s ever known. “Like scary good,” he said. When Hjin graduated from Cameron Heights his parents gave him a very special guitar — a 1971 Gibson ES-335. Hjin chipped in to help pay for it. He was accepted into the Berklee College of Music in Boston, but opted for the jazz program at Humber College. He is halfway through that program, and not yet out of his teens. Hjin is still developing as a musician. And those who know his playing can not help but wonder what the future will bring. “It’s really interesting,” said Moher. “He’s still a kid.” ",Kitchener teen heralded as Canada’s next great jazz guitarist,1,0.42544407734419154
847,"KITCHENER — The COVID-19 pandemic has forced the Kitchener-Waterloo Symphony to drastically change its 75th anniversary season that begins in September. The symphony announced Tuesday during an online news conference it will stream live concerts to paying audiences in September — Mozart’s Jupiter Symphony, and others by Beethoven and Mendelssohn. The musicians will be onstage at Centre in the Square, with two metres between all the players. “Some people don’t think we are essential, but we are more essential than anyone thinks,” said symphony music director Andrei Feher, “because everybody realizes artists are important these days, and how much they help.” The exact dates, programs and ticket prices for the live streams will be made public later this summer. The coming season will also include special guest artists such as Canadian singer-songwriter Royal Wood and singer Michael Vanhevel. Nobody knows how the COVID-19 pandemic will play out, but the symphony did not want to simply wait for a vaccine. “We are trying as much as possible to get back and making music together, offer something new, offer something different,” said Feher. Feher’s first child, a boy named Mihai, was born March 10. The next day the symphony announced it was cancelling the rest of the 2019-20 season. While the economy slowly reopens in stages, concert halls will likely have to wait until there is a vaccine before audiences can pack the seats. But nobody knows for sure. Andrew Bennet, the symphony’s executive director, said governments have provided between $600,000 and $700,000 in emergency funds during the first stages of the pandemic, and a similar amount will be needed to see the symphony through the 2020-21 season. Bennett said donors large and small have given much more than usual to the organization, but specifics will not be known until the organization’s fiscal year ends later this summer. The remaining parts of the 2020-21 season will be announced in blocks, he said, because of the uncertainty caused by the pandemic. “It allows us then to keep changing what we are doing on a month-to-month basis going through the season,” said Bennett. “We will start off in one mode, and be ready to go into the next mode whenever it proves possible.” If there is a second wave of COVID-19, the entire country, or parts of it, could be locked down again. If a vaccine is available early next year, the symphony could return to live concerts with audiences inside Centre in the Square.  The original program for the 2020-21 season will be delayed for 12 months and be presented in 2021-22. That allows the symphony to meet its commitment to subscribers. Tickets already purchased for the coming season will be automatically transferred to 2021-22, said Bennett. In October, the symphony will organize a party online to celebrate its 75th anniversary. “I am looking forward to a great online party,” said Bennett. “I am looking forward to having some guests from all over the world who can possibly join us who wouldn’t be able to do so otherwise.” Heather Galt, chair of the symphony’s board, said the encore performances the symphony has streamed online every Friday evening for the past few months have attracted huge audiences. “We have been incredibly pleased,” said Galt. “We have been able to reach audience sizes that we could never have imagined before the pandemic.” Those audience numbers demonstrate the symphony brings joy and much needed breaks from the unprecedented international crisis that has impacted everyone’s life, she said. “We are absolutely committed as a board and an organization to continue doing that even during this time,” said Galt. “That sense of joy and that sense of rest, we really need now more than ever,” said Galt, adding the board is committed to surviving the short term and being around for another 75 years and beyond.",Kitchener-Waterloo Symphony to stream live concerts to paying audiences this fall,1,0.5444763147281303
853,"KITCHENER — Graffiti on the outside of Central Fresh Market inspired the idea for an art project that will look nice while also benefiting the community. Manager Josh Williamson said graffiti on the Kitchener store’s wall facing King Street is a common occurrence, with the latest spray-painted message appearing on Canada Day. That got him thinking that maybe the graffiti could be covered with a mural for everyone passing by to enjoy. “It’s always been in the back of my mind,” Williamson said. “I think we can really make this a good project for the community going forward.” He wants to partner with artists to create removable murals that will be auctioned off for charity once a year. The unique art would fill the four sections at the front of the building, now blank canvasses that attract graffiti.  Williamson put his idea out on Twitter and the response was overwhelming as artists expressed interest and others made recommendations. One spot is already reserved for art students from nearby Kitchener-Waterloo Collegiate. He’s talking with local companies to create lighted enclosures to protect the art, and other companies have contacted him asking how they can help. The details aren’t all nailed down yet, and Williamson welcomes suggestions with the aim of having a September unveiling for the first creations.  “I think it could be ongoing to hopefully get that positive message yearly,” he said. “I’m just really excited for the potential.”",Graffiti at Kitchener store sparks idea for charity art project,1,0.25656118547402607
854,"WATERLOO REGION — Mark Vuorinen wants to know if there is a safe place where choral singers can make beautiful music in a time of physical distancing, face masks and hand washing. Vuorinen, the conductor of the Grand Philharmonic Choir in Kitchener, artistic director of the Elora Festival and conductor of the Elora Festival Singers, wants health officials and governments to make evidence-based decisions about how and when choirs can resume practising, and perhaps performing live shows streamed to online audiences from empty halls. And to begin with, the focus should be on professional choirs, a tiny minority among the 3.5 million choir singers across the country, said Vuorinen. The COVID-19 pandemic silenced all of them in March.  The internationally renowned Elora Festival normally runs for three weeks in July, but it was cancelled. An online version is scheduled for early August. Professional choir singers rehearse or perform daily during the three-week long festival, and they earn a significant part of their annual income from it. So, Choirs Ontario and Vuorinen want public health officials and governments to start thinking about how to get professional choirs safely back to work. “As the other parts of our society, our economy open up we just want to signal our desire to have a conversation,” said Vuorinen, who chairs the music program at Conrad Grebel University College at the University of Waterloo. As a result, Choirs Ontario have published an open letter calling on governments to make decisions based on medical evidence when ruling if and how choirs can resume practising and performing.  “Scientific study on the transmission of COVID-19 as it relates to singing is in its infancy. To date, there is no body of scientific research that definitively links choral singing with a higher risk of infection in comparison to other group activities,” says the letter. “As such, it is of great concern to choral communities that the development of Ontario public health policy around the safety of singing could be based on anecdotal evidence of a few choirs whose membership has become sick, rather than being firmly based on scientific evidence,” says the letter. The letter is referring to a COVID-19 outbreak among members of the Skagit Valley Chorale in Washington State. On March 6 and March 10 choir members gathered for practice. Some sat close together, some further apart. They had cookies and drinks during a break. Skagit County issued social distancing guidelines on the day of the last rehearsal. An investigation by the Skagit Country Public Health department concluded one person with COVID-19 attended the rehearsals and infected 53 others (33 confirmed, 20 probable). Two members died. COVID-19 outbreaks also struck choirs in Berlin, England and Amsterdam. Maybe with research, choirs could resume practising with Plexiglas shields between members, have fewer singers at rehearsals with two metres between everyone, and have everyone wear masks while singing. “But then of course the big question is: ‘How do you then come together to perform?’” said Vuorinen.  The live streaming concerts to online audiences is used by a growing list of performers during the pandemic, and some countries allow choirs to do that, he said. “I have been able to tune into some of my favourite choirs in Europe and listen to them sing, in ways that I would not have otherwise,” said Vuorinen. “It’s a bit of an exciting opportunity in a way, to think about how can we reach a different audience in a different way,” said Vuorinen. “Live streaming or recording and streaming concerts is one way we are all going to need to adopt.” Vuorinen said the open letter and his comments are about finding ways for professional choirs to resume work. “In Ontario what we are hoping is the government will take a good look at this and help devise guidelines that we can use,” said Vuorinen.",Conductor calls for the safe return of choirs,1,0.20136363065451268
857,"Plant of Creation is entirely instrumental and moves beyond his ‘metal’ roots

An Abbotsford musician has released his fourth solo album, and this one is entirely instrumental.

Liam Pasiciel, 21, said he released Planet of Creation to showcase that he can play different kinds of music other than metal.

Pasiciel’s previous releases focused on his love of “power metal.”

He said the tracks on Planet of Creation were inspired by him wanting “to do justice to the place that we live.”

“We truly live on an incredible planet, and I’ve always been at peace during stressful times just looking around and taking it all in, and I hope that my music off of this album will trigger that same feeling in others,” Pasiciel said.

He said his creative energy was “pushed to the limit” on the album. Pasiciel wanted to make listeners feel like they are in the location that the song is describing, and he spent a lot of time studying different genres of music to capture that feeling.

Pasiciel, who performs under the band name Magnesium, also released official backing tracks for each song so that other musicians can improvise or create whatever they want using his songs as the base.

Among the tracks on the album is country-style guitar in Forest, and “some really clean background dynamics” in Oceans and Space.

Mountains is the finale, featuring lots of brass, choir and synth “to make it sound as big as possible, just like real-life mountains.”

“The track ends with an energizing sequence of power metal, coming full circle with my other music,” Pasiciel said.

Because his bedroom serves as his studio, Pasiciel said he feels fortunate that he is able to continue making music during the COVID-19 pandemic.

“It’s during times like these that we have to remember how much of a blessing it is to be able to express ourselves on the inside when we can’t show it on the outside,” he said.

Pasiciel previously attended Visible Music College in Memphis, Tennessee for a year, majoring in guitar.

He first started playing at the age of 11, and grew to love power metal when he began taking lessons at age 14.

Pasiciel’s first album was Forging the Armory in which he played piano, lead and bass guitar, as well as singing. He also made Guardian Dreadnought and Breakthrough before Planet Creation.

The four albums are available on all streaming music platforms.

859,"KITCHENER — Tech firm Monogram may be based in Kitchener, but it’s poised to take Hollywood by storm. Its technology, simplifying the photo and video production and editing process, has already been used behind-the-scenes in blockbusters like the 2019 remake of “The Lion King.” It’s in use for other film and television projects, too, ones that Monogram’s chief executive officer, Calvin Chu, says they’re “super-excited” about but can’t disclose due to confidentiality agreements. “We’re seeing more and more enterprises and larger studios using our tools,” he said. “It’s been spreading through word-of-mouth.” A new collaboration with Epic Games, the video gaming giant behind “Fortnite” and “Gears of War,” could further expand Monogram’s reach. The Monogram Creative Console, the modular system that swaps out a keyboard and mouse for a customizable series of dials, sliders and other controllers, will be integrated with Epic’s Unreal Engine. Unreal Engine is a game engine — essentially, the development software used to create the video games — but it’s gaining popularity among film and TV productions because of its ability to create and manipulate incredibly-realistic virtual locations and elements that can be blended in real time with traditional techniques.  The Star Wars series “The Mandalorian” is one example of a production that’s used Unreal Engine to create virtual sets. Epic Games awarded the Kitchener company a $50,000 grant to help develop Monogram’s Unreal Engine solution, allowing users to assign different Unreal Engine controls or connect their own custom plug-ins to Monogram modules.  “Monogram’s customizable hardware controller can unlock powerful tactile experiences in virtual worlds created in Unreal Engine,” Epic’s David Morin said in a release. Monogram technology was already compatible with popular photo, video and music production applications such as Adobe Premiere Pro, Photoshop, Lightroom Classic and Capture One. Whether it’s controlling lighting or colour balance, or even focusing or moving a virtual camera, the Creative Console can provide a customized workflow for production teams. The intuitive controls feel familiar to directors and cinematographers, said AJ Sciutto of Magnopus, the company in charge of creating a virtual production workflow for “The Lion King” last year. “It simplified the on-set experience, making it one of the crucial tools to our virtual production workflow,” Sciutto said in the release. Virtual production, which includes combining digital elements in real time with live action, rather than strictly in postproduction, was already gaining in popularity thanks to efficiencies and cost savings that don’t sacrifice quality.  Travel restrictions and physical distancing requirements brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic are proving the benefits of virtual production even more, with traditional shoots placed on hold. “We wanted to build the best tools that fit this new type of creator and new workflows that are constantly being invented,” Chu said. Virtual production blends leading-edge digital technology with cinematography techniques that have been refined for a century. “We’re excited to be at the cutting edge, and being able to work with the first handful of people who’ve started to pioneer this,” he said. Monogram is partnering with Sheridan College’s Screen Industries Research and Training Centre, located at Pinewood Toronto Studios, in the use of virtual production techniques. Monogram has also just moved to a new office at 305 King St. W. in downtown Kitchener, with a layout that offers more separate rooms and opportunity for distancing than their prior location. The company currently has 15 permanent employees and a few others on contract. Founded in 2013 as Palette, the company rebranded last year with the announcement of a new and improved version of its system, the Monogram Creative Console. Production and supply chain delays caused by the pandemic have slowed its release, but Chu said it’s expected to launch in a few weeks. “We’re just about ready to ship.” The Monogram hardware used in film and television production is identical to the consumer version; there will be an enterprise version of the software that’s a bit more specific to the studios’ needs. “All of the functionality we’ve built for Hollywood, making the hardware extremely reliable and professional quality, we’re bringing that to everybody,” Chu said.",Kitchener tech firm poised to take Hollywood by storm,1,0.4037430704820498
862,"WATERLOO REGION — The Kitchener-Waterloo Symphony is attracting larger audiences during the COVID-19 pandemic than at any other time in its history. Up to 5,000 people a week are enjoying concerts streamed online every Friday at 8 p.m. on the symphony’s Facebook page and YouTube channel. Normally, the KWS Signature Series attracts about 1,000 people to a concert at Centre in the Square. Attendance can vary significantly for symphony concerts. Performances of iconic works, such as Beethoven’s Ninth Sympny or Vivaldi’s Four Seasons, will sell out and attract 2,000 to both the Friday and Saturday night concerts. So, 4,000 people over two nights is the capacity. With the move to online broadcasts of recorded concerts, the KWS is reaching more people than ever.  “We have pivoted,” said Andrew Bennett, the symphony’s executive director. That data shows the overwhelming majority of the online audiences stick around for the entire performance.  For the first two weeks the symphony streamed audio and video. Now, it is audio only. When a symphony concert is streaming on Facebook some of the musicians are chatting on the platform about the show, and interacting with audiences. After Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony was streamed, there was a gathering of musicians and fans on Zoom. “So you actually get to do things you normally wouldn’t get to do during a concert,” said Bennett. The symphony will continue to stream concerts at no charge during the pandemic shutdown. It helps the symphony stay in contact with its loyal base of fans, and reach new ones. People as far away as the U.K. have watched the concerts. “It’s great for the organization to have this exposure,” said Bennett. “It’s a fantastic opportunity for people to hear how good the orchestra is.”  The players, conductors, guest soloists, symphony management and the Candian Federation of Musicians had to agree to provide the material online for free. The demonstrated success of the streaming does not mean the KWS is going to take the next step when the pandemic is over, and allow audience members to record short videos of the orchestra on their smartphones during a performance and post that to social media.  The internet is one of the most powerful tools for promoting events and growing audiences, but the contract between the symphony and the musicians’ union forbids the sharing of digital content, even by an audience member using a smartphone. It is the same for every unionized orchestra across Canada, said Katherine Carleton, the executive director of Orchestras Canada. The union and some symphonies in the U.S. have agreed to allow audience members to take short videos on their phones, and post that content online, for some shows, she said. “There is a little bit more flexibility in the U.S. than there is in Canada,” said Bennett. “It is an interesting and ongoing conversation.” When content is captured on a smartphone, and shared on social media, the only ones making money on it are the digital platforms, not the musicians and not their symphonies, said Bennett. Orchestras Canada, which represents 130 orchestras, does not take a position on the issue. It is up to the musician’s federation and the orchestras to negotiate the collective agreements. Paul Mitchell, the head of the Central Ontario Musicians’ Association, said allowing audience members to record short segments of a concert on their smartphone and share that online would distract other audience members. “You are opening Pandora’s Box there,” said Mitchell. Under the terms of the union contract, only the musicians’ association can make recordings of the orchestra and it retains control of the recordings. No part of a concert can be recorded or reproduced and then transmitted from the concert hall by anyone without a specific written agreement with the Canadian Federation of Musicians, said Mitchell. And that definitely covers audience members who want to make short videos with their smartphones and post that online. The clause is there because the union believes symphony musicians should always be paid for the music they create, said Mitchell. “As soon as you let the general public do whatever they want, the bottom falls out of the market,” said Mitchell.  Short snippets of a symphony concert posted online could be grabbed by other parties and included in something that is making money, and the musicians would never see a dime, he said. “You miss out on the revenue stream for something you created,” said Mitchell. “Everybody should get paid again, and it’s not out of greed, it’s because they created it and somebody else is making money from it again.” So far the KWS has streamed six pre-recorded concerts. The musicians are also producing other digital content during the pandemic shutdown as well.  When the pandemic hit, the symphony management and board of directors decided not to lay off anyone. That decision, and the fact the KWS treats its musicians as employees, means they qualify for a 75 per cent wage subsidy from Ottawa. “We are the luckiest,” said Larry Larson, the KWS principal trumpet. About half of the members of Orchestra Canada treat their musicians as employees. The others treat musicians as independent contractors. The wage subsidy is an economic life line for the musicians. Larson lost his regular gig at the Stratford Festival where he plays the fanfare at the main theatre before the plays. He was also going to play in the orchestra for the festival’s production of “Spamalot.” All of that was lost with the pandemic shutdown. “It’s just a bizarre, bizarre time, for sure,” said Larson. He credits the KWS management and board for keeping everyone on the payroll. They made that decision even before Ottawa announced the wage subsidy program. When the summer comes, the KWS musicians will apply for Employment Insurance. “What do you do? You throw up your hands and you say: ‘There is nothing can be done except try to stay self-motivated as an artist, keep honing your skills through all of this, and know that some day performances will be back,” said Larson.",Kitchener-Waterloo Symphony streams pre-recorded concerts through the pandemic,1,0.5845975982069754
863,"WATERLOO REGION — Stuart and Jenna Walker — known to millions of fans as The Reklaws — are busy writing songs during the COVID-19 shutdown and expect to release new material this summer. “I never thought we would see anything like this, this is just crazy,” said Stuart of the pandemic that’s killed live music shows probably until a vaccine is available. The brother-and-sister country music sensation from Cambridge had planned to be in Nashville for the entire month of May for an intense round of songwriting with producers and lyricists. Now, they are doing that via Zoom from their homes in Toronto. “People are learning to get by with Zoom calls and the songs are just as good, so we are like: ‘OK, this is what we are doing for a while,’ but it seems to be working, so that’s good,” said Jenna. The Reklaws had a full calendar of shows booked for 2020 but then the pandemic hit and everything was shut down. The reopening of some retail stores, parks, marinas and golf courses in no way signals a return to live music. The magic of live shows absolutely requires a venue packed with fans. And that will not be allowed until a vaccine is available.  But The Reklaws are as upbeat about it as their music. They exploded onto the country music scene in 2017 with their song “Hometown Kids.” In less than three years fans streamed their songs more than 33 million times, they garnered a Juno nomination, released am EP and performed all over North America. “Things were moving so quickly we were kind of taking things for granted for a while,” said Jenna. The pause is unexpected, but also welcome. They spent the Victoria Day long weekend at their cottage near Sauble Beach. They have been going to that cottage for 20 years this summer. These days they live near one another in Toronto and get together for regular songwriting sessions. “It’s time we can use for songwriting, and just getting our things in order for when it starts up again because it is going to be wild when it does,” said Jenna. They each bring 10 to 20 ideas to a songwriting session, written on their smartphones or laptops. They pitch those ideas to hotshot lyricists and producers in Nashville during Zoom calls. “Titles and ideas, whatever,” said Jenna. “Exactly — it could be a word, it could be an entire chorus written out,” said Stuart. “If people are into it that’s great, if not then you take it with a grain of salt and carry on.” Their creative method is working music industry wonders. The 2018 single “Long Live the Night” went Gold and was streamed more than any other Canadian country song that year. The Canadian Football League used it as a theme song for weekly television broadcasts. “We go in with titles and we do like to write to tracks,” said Stuart. “So, if there is a producer or track guy in that day, we hope that he has a beat ready to go, and we try to write to that and see what the vibe is of everybody in the room.” Signed to Universal Music, their story is like something straight out of the movies. They went from their hometown of Cambridge to festivals and venues around the continent. Already successful, they are touted as the next country music superstars. “We are just going to try and stay in a creative space, keep on writing and stay positive in every way we can,” said Stuart.  No surprise there. Their music is not the sad twang of lonely hearts, cheating wives, lost farms and dead dogs. The Reklaws are joyous and celebratory. “I think we are lucky as artists. We have a fan base that is pretty strong. They know it’s not over. They know we are going to come back even bigger,” said Jenna. Human trials of three different vaccines are underway in Canada, England and the U.S. There is a prototype of one vaccine that has already protected lab monkeys from COVID-19. It will take a vaccine to save the live music business. “That means the world to us,” said Jenna. “We are going to get stuff in order in terms of songwriting. It’s funny, when we are running and we are playing shows we run out of time to get everything else together. And when we do go to song-write it kind of feels like we are flying by the seat-of-our pants and just trying to keep up.” Stuart believes the pandemic shutdown is a test of every single musician. And while he and Jenna like the interaction with individual fans that happens during online shows, there is nothing like a venue packed with loud, appreciative fans dancing to the music. “I think the place we thrive the most is live, onstage, before a crowd,” said Stuart. “The online shows are a different set up than that, but we have been doing a lot of them and it has been good so far.” New songs will be released this summer, material that was recorded in Nashville before the shutdown. They will do as many online shows as possible to connect with fans.  “We can’t look at it negatively because the whole world looks at it negatively,” said Jenna. “When the vaccine is here, we can all have a big party.”",The Reklaws using pandemic downtime to write more songs,1,0.04011908435692091

866,"""Feast Your Eyes"" by Myla Goldberg (Scribner, 2019 362 pages) ""Feast Your Eyes"" is a beautiful evocation of New York from the 1950s to 1970s, as told through the eyes of Samantha Preston, as she goes through the archival materials, photographs and ephemera of her mother, Lillian Preston. Samantha is helping to mount a photography retrospective of her work for a show at the MOMA, and it is through these documents that Lillian's story is told.

867,"Harrison Festival Society is keeping the arts coming this summer, and the community has clearly been thirsty for it.

Though the traditional Festival of the Arts is canceled for this year, the Festival Society has planned a number of cultural events for the near future, beginning with Will’s Jams in honour of the Festival Society’s annual Children’s Day.

There will be three shows on July 15 on Maple Street in Harrison Hot Springs at 11 a.m. , 12:30 p.m. and 2 p.m. Only 50 people will be allowed at any given gathering, which also accounts for the band, crew and volunteers, so space is limited to an audience of 35. Tickets are $6.

On Saturday, July 18, learn the secrets of traditional drum making from Darren Charlie of the Sts’ailes First Nation. The class takes place outside Memorial Hall in Harrison Hot Springs.

Charlie’s class will allow participants to create their own drum; the cost of admission depends on the size of drum you wish to make. Prices range from $37 to $182 for drums anywhere from seven inches to 20 inches.

This event will be physically distanced per provincial health guidelines related to COVID-19 and pre-registration is required.

As far as either event is concerned, anyone feeling sick or experiencing symptoms of COVID-19, including coughing, sore throat, fever and shortness of breath, is asked to stay home.

The Harrison Festival Society has had a successful summer so far, given the extreme circumstances brought on by the pandemic. The July 11 concert featuring Bentall Taylor Ulrich – the first of the summer – sold out within 14 hours of announcement.

“We then started to take down names for a wait list,” the most recent statement from the Festival Society reads. “When that list got as big as a full show, we added a third show and most of the tickets went to the people on the wait list. So with only one email and one Facebook post, we have three sold-out shows within just a few days.”

The BTU concert was professionally filmed and will be available soon through the Festival Society’s website.

Will Stroet of Will’s Jams performs interactive rock and pop songs with plenty of kid-friendly wordplay and catchy choruses. His work is famous CBC Kids, Universal Kids TV and children’s music as a whole, spreading positive messages like loving bike riding, cheering for libraries and making a strong case for vegetables.

Stoet is a JUNO nominee and recently released his 10th album, Rocks and Roots, which is nominated for a 2020 CFMA and WCMA. Rocks and Roots celebrates the natural world, outdoor activities and trying new things, hailed as “a masterpiece of creativity and fun, further cementing Will as the ultimate star of children’s rock ‘n’ roll.”

Will’s Jams is found online at www.willsjams.com.

869,"Bozzini’s will be bringing the Chilliwack born-and-raised musician to its intimate lounge

Chilliwack born-and-raised trumpeter and vocalist, Bonnie Northgraves, will be performing at Bozzini’s Upstairs Lounge on Thursday, June 25. (Submitted)

After months of silence at Bozzini’s Upstairs Lounge, music is once again ringing out from the intimate Chilliwack concert space.

On June 4, Tsean Miller brought the Church of Rock to the stage. It was the first concert in almost three months to take place there after venues around Chilliwack and the world shut down due to COVID-19.

Now artistic director Emmanuel Asprakis is bringing in the next artist – Chilliwack born-and-raised trumpeter and vocalist Bonnie Northgraves on June 25.

With the Vancouver Jazz Festival being cancelled this year Asprakis took that as the inspiration for a jazz show being one the first events happening at Bozzini’s now that COVID-19 restrictions have eased.

“I was supposed to be playing at the Jazz Fest this year and singing the anthem on Canada Day, so it’s really lovely to have been invited to Bozzini’s to play,” said Northgraves, who now lives in Vancouver. “[I’m] so looking forward to performing in my home town.”

Northgraves performs her own original music as well as being a key member in Company B Jazz Band, Jeff Gladstone and the Bad Ideas, T Lizzy, and many others. She is a performer, recording artist, teacher, and clinician. She is passionate about music and hopes to spread her love of jazz through performance and education.

Her singing is smokey and rich, and her trumpet playing is a call to the early jazz styles of New Orleans. In 2019 Bonnie Released her debut album Between Then And Now.

Bozzini’s Upstairs Lounge typically seats 32 people, but due to physical distancing measures, only 16 seats will be available.

Bonnie Northgraves performs Thursday, June 25 at 8 p.m. (doors at 6:30 p.m.) at Bozzini’s Upstairs Lounge. Tickets are $20. To reserve call 604-792-0744.

Surrey’s White Hart Public House is among the first bars in Metro Vancouver to feature live entertainment in the post-COVID world.

The Newton-area pub welcomed back live bands a couple of weeks ago, starting with “house band” The Wingnuts on June 5.

“I think we’re one of the first bars to have live music again, definitely, because we wanted to get ahead of that curve,” said pub operator George Hart. “We knew we could do it safely, so we figured why not, let’s get it going again.”

For now, measures to stop the virus from spreading include clear plastic sheets hung between tables and encouraging physical distancing, among other rules.

“The hardest part is reminding people that they can’t dance, which isn’t easy,” Hart said with a laugh.

At a news conference Monday (June 15), provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry was asked about dancing in nightclubs and bars.

“It is going to be challenging because we know there are some things like dance floors that are not going to happen right now, as well as we know that singing, singing in a group, can be a very dangerous thing for this virus,” Henry said.

“We’ve seen that in a number of places around the world, including recent examples in the States south of us where singing groups in churches, even with physical distancing, have led to transmission of cases, and singing in other situations as well. So those are all things we need to work through, and I know Worksafe is working with the industry to come up with some reasonable guidance for that.”

Restaurants and pubs across the province were allowed to reopen to dine-in guests more than three weeks ago, as part of Phase Two in B.C.’s Restart Plan. Last Thursday (June 11), Henry removed the 50 per cent capacity restriction, allowing restaurant and pub operators to determine their capacity so long as guests are able to physically distance by at least two metres.

On Friday night (June 12) at the White Hart, the band Spank The Plank played a mix of classic rock songs for a few dozen people who paid $10 admission online, through Eric McCauley’s Good Time Bookings page on eventbrite.ca.

“It’s a family-run business, and we want to make sure everyone is safe and follow the proper restrictions put in place by Worksafe,” said McCauley, who books bands at the White Hart.

“We’re sold out tonight, pretty much, and we’re keeping it to around 42 people,” Hart added. “We’re doing advance ticket sales, and one of the shows sold out in an hour, the Tragically Hip tribute, Roadside Attraction (on June 27). Other bands have sold out in a couple of days, and some are selling out at the door. People can line up, six feet apart obviously, and if we have room then they can come in.”

• RELATED STORY: B.C.’s new COVID-19 cases remain low, no deaths since Friday.

Other bands on the calendar this month include Robert Graves Band (June 19), March Hare (June 20), The Rattlers (June 24) and Rob Montgomery/Nadine States (June 30), plus karaoke Tuesdays.

Hart and his family took over operations of the former Hook and Ladder pub site last year.

“We changed the name to White Hart after our soccer team’s stadium, which is White Hart Lane,” said Hart. “It’s an ode to Tottenham (the soccer club in London). My family is from there, I have the tatttoo, we’re diehard fans. In September of 2019 we came up here from Bear Creek (Pub), just a better location, bigger. We renovated it, painted it with Tottenham colours, everything, got the sign up and yeah, we’re ready.”

Spank the Plank drummer Wes Lawrie said it’s fun for the band to again perform “for people who appreciate it.”

Prior to Friday night at the White Hart, his last gig was set for March 16 at a venue in Whistler.

“We were just ready to leave my place, everything loaded, and we got the call to not bother, it was closed, everything was shut down,” Lawrie recalled.

“As a musician this has been very tough, and just very different,” he added. “But it looks like we’re getting going again, and we’re hearing about other gigs happening at some places, so I’m sure we’ll be playing again soon. This is definitely something I haven’t experienced before.”

871,"The Chilliwack Independent Film Festival is the first film festival in B.C. to make the move

Pawan Deol and Michael P. Vidler, who created the short film Unkept, won best short and best director at the 2019 Chilliwack Independent Film Festival (CIFF). The founder of CIFF, Taras Groves, is waiving entry fees for all Black, Asian and minority ethnic filmmakers for his festival. (Submitted)

The founder and director of an independent film festival has made it easier for Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) filmmakers to submit their work and have their voices heard.

Taras Groves of the Chilliwack Independent Film Festival (CIFF) announced this week that he is waiving submission costs for all BAME filmmakers.

CIFF is the first film festival in B.C. to do this, he added.

“Whilst we have been able to showcase numerous minority and Indigenous filmmakers over the years… we feel compelled to do more, especially given what is currently going on in the world today with Black lives and systemic racism,” Groves said.

“This is no different in the arts. And actions are louder than words.”

Submissions costs can quickly stack up for independent filmmakers making it very difficult for them to break through.

This is a “conscious attempt to form an enduring effort to provide a platform for more voices to be heard,” Groves said. He is encouraging other organizations and festivals to follow suit.

Film and the arts may seem small with everything that is going on in the world today but Groves said he still believes it’s an important means for sharing new voices and changing perspectives.

The festival, which began in 2017, normally takes place in November each year. A date for the 2020 CIFF has not yet been set, but it will be going ahead.

876,"LOS ANGELES—Stuart Cornfeld, who produced “Zoolander,” “Dodgeball” and “Tropic Thunder” with Ben Stiller, died on June 26 of cancer. He was 67.

The news was confirmed by his friend, actress Liliana Greenfield-Sanders, and others on social media. “He was the funniest person on the planet,” she wrote. “I will miss him terribly.”

The Los Angeles native was born in 1952 and graduated from the American Film Institute in 1975. After working with Anne Bancroft on two projects at AFI, he was introduced to her husband, Mel Brooks, and became his assistant on the 1977 film “High Anxiety.”

Cornfeld went on to work with the couple on several more projects and got his first executive producing credit on Brooks’ 1980 film “The Elephant Man.”

In the early days of his career, he produced “National Lampoon’s European Vacation” (1985), David Cronenberg’s “The Fly” (1986), Steven Soderbergh’s “Kafka” (1991) and Guillermo Del Toro’s “Mimic” (1997). He also had bit parts in several movies including “Fast Times at Ridgemont High,” in which he played the Pirate King of Captain Hook Fish ’n’ Chips.

In 1999 he teamed with Stiller to launch Red Hour Films, under which they enjoyed success with the comedies “Zoolander” (2001), “Duplex” (2003), “Starsky & Hutch” (2004), “Dodgeball” (2004), “Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny” (2006), “Blades of Glory” (2007) and “Tropic Thunder” (2008), which earned an Academy Award nomination for Robert Downey Jr. and won best comedy at the Broadcast Critics Film Awards and the Hollywood Film Awards.

“A really great person left the planet today,” Stiller said on Twitter. “Stuart Cornfeld ... was my friend, producing partner and creative confidant. He knew movies, made movies and loved movies. World = less better without him.”

Toward the end of his career, Cornfeld produced Jack Black’s 2017 film “The Polka King” and did some work in television. He was awarded the Franklin J. Schaffner Alumni Medal by AFI in 2013 and most recently produced the documentary “Have a Good Trip: Adventures in Psychedelics” for Netflix.

877,"Tyra Banks is waltzing onto “Dancing with the Stars.”

The former supermodel and “America’s Next Top Model” host has been tapped as the new host of ABC’s reality dancing show, the network announced early Wednesday.

Banks will step into the dancing shoes of longtime co-hosts Tom Bergeron and Erin Andrews, who won’t be returning for the upcoming season.

“I’ve been a fan of ‘DWTS’ since its beginning,” Banks said in a statement. “The fun mixed with raw emotion, seeing celebrities push past their comfort zones, the sizzling dance performances ... it’s always transported me to my days of turning it up 10 notches on the catwalk. Tom has set a powerful stage, and I’m excited to continue the legacy and put on my executive producer and hosting hats.”

The 46-year old has also been named an executive producer on the show.

“As we gear up for the show’s 29th season, we can’t wait to welcome Tyra Banks to our ‘Dancing’ stage,” ABC Entertainment President Karey Burke said in a statement.

“Tyra is an award-winning multihyphenate whose fierce female prowess and influence across many industries have made an indelible mark. Her fresh take on America’s favourite dancing competition will surely bring more than a ‘Smize’ to fans everywhere.”

Banks, the first black model to appear on the cover of Sports Illustrated’s Swimsuit edition, created and hosted “America’s Next Top Model” for 22 seasons until it was cancelled in 2015, then hosted the second season of the revived modelling competition show in 2018.

Her own talk show, “The Tyra Banks Show,” lasted five seasons and she hosted two cycles of “America’s Got Talent.” Banks has also had roles in movies like “Life Size” and “Love & Basketball.”

Bergeron had hosted “Dancing with the Stars” since its 2005 launch and his exit seemed to come as big a surprise to him as to longtime fans.

“Just informed (”Dancing with the Stars”) will be continuing without me,” he tweeted Monday night. “It’s been an incredible 15 year run and the most unexpected gift of my career. I’m grateful for that and for the lifelong friendships made. That said, now what am I supposed to do with all of these glitter masks?”

Andrews joined the cast in 2014 after taking third place during the 10th season.

“Thank you ABC and the entire ‘Dancing With the Stars’ family for 6 memorable seasons,” she tweeted Tuesday. “Those years wouldn’t have been as special without my loving host Tom Bergeron, the talented dancers, and witty judges.

878,"Independent concert venue owner Jeff Cohen simply wants his famed Horseshoe Tavern to survive the COVID-19 pandemic.

For the past four months, the legendary Toronto stage that’s hosted the likes of the Rolling Stones and the Police has gone dark, and its famed checkerboard floors immortalized in the Tragically Hip’s “Bobcaygeon” left empty.

Like most smaller Canadian music venues, the future is anything but certain.

“The live-venue industry right now in Canada is on the verge of bankruptcy,” Cohen said.

“We’re not opening, probably, until the end of this year — maybe next year ... We have no income coming in whatsoever. It’s a bad scene.”

Along with several other indie concert venue owners, Cohen has been making noise about the troubling years ahead for Canada’s live music scene in hopes the federal government will take more action.

There was a glimmer of hope on Tuesday when Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault outlined a program that lets owners of for-profit venues apply for a piece of $20 million promised to support the live music sector.

The money will be divided among numerous corners of the industry, including venues, concert promoters, booking agents, managers and music festivals. The funding is part of the second phase of support in the $500-million emergency support measures introduced in May for Canada’s arts and culture organizations.

Anyone who’s granted approval will receive a minimum contribution of $5,000 that’s supposed to last until the end of September.

Beyond the live music business, the federal government has earmarked $5 million for the recording industry that will be administered by Factor and Musicaction, which specialize in developing and supporting Canadian music talent.

Erin Benjamin, chief executive of the Canadian Live Music Association, which advocates for the industry, called the move by Canadian Heritage to support venues “a good start” that needs to be built upon in short order.

“It’s better than nothing,” she said.

“It’ll help some companies for a very short amount of time ... but we’re not done here. We can’t be done.”

While Cohen doesn’t know if he’ll qualify for a portion of the venue funding, he’s skeptical about how much it’ll actually help the Horseshoe.

“I’ll be able to pay two weeks of rent,” Cohen said, pointing out it’s roughly $40,000 a month for the downtown location.

“It’ll be something, and we’ll be grateful for it ... but I’m skeptical until I actually see the payments.”

He suspects the Horseshoe may also fail to meet some of the requirements outlined on the Factor website. Among them, a venue must have booked at least 50 per cent Canadian musicians at its venue last year to qualify.

“Horseshoe Tavern was open 360 days last year, I don’t think we wrote down which bands were Canadian and weren’t. I don’t think we even know,” Cohen said.

“The eligibility makes no sense.”

Smaller venues have been able to tap into other financial support measures, which include the Canada Emergency Response Benefit and the emergency wage subsidy.

In Toronto, city council recently passed legislation that allows property owners to claim a tax break of 50 per cent tax on spaces that operate primarily as live music venues. The intention is for those savings to trickle down to the tenants who are still not allowed to reopen.

Live venues in other Canadian cities are at different stages in a process many anticipate could stretch well into next year.

Vancouver bars were some of the first to reopen, though several clubs in the city warned that patrons may have been exposed to COVID-19 in recent weeks.

Montreal’s music venues were allowed to legally reopen in late June, but concertgoers have to remain seated and dancing is forbidden.

In Halifax, Karen Spaulding reopened the Carleton Music Bar and Grill in the final days of June, but it hardly feels the same to her.

“It is at half capacity for three days a week, instead of normally five to seven, and it’s acoustic shows only,” she said.

“Just the world, the audience and the guests, all feel different.”

The Carleton operates as a restaurant, which helped Spaulding’s attempt to get the business back on its feet, though she said overall revenues have dropped somewhere between 50 to 75 per cent.

But as much as she’s concerned for her business, she’s also worried about local Canadian musicians who relied on these venues to make a living. That’s motivated her to look for solutions as she faces a long winter that brings a whole new round of questions.

Spaulding said she’s been in conversations with lenders, while also tapping into other government programs that help support her staff. She’s also looking into whether it would be worthwhile to launch streaming online concerts that would “put more money in the artists’ pockets” over the coming months.

“I’m going to personally go out on a limb to keep the venue going,” she said.

“We’re huge believers in live music.”",Concert venues still in a pinch as Canada’s live music industry gets fed support,1,0.5256272138017167
879,"Move follows decision by Lady Antebellum to change to Lady A after acknowledging the word’s association to slavery

The Dixie Chicks, now The Chicks. (The Associated Press)

Grammy-winning country group The Dixie Chicks have dropped the word Dixie from their name, now going by The Chicks.

The band’s social media accounts and website were changed on Thursday to the refer to the new name for the band, which is made up of Martie Maguire, Natalie Maines and Emily Strayer. The band also recognized that the name was already in use by a band in New Zealand.

“A sincere and heartfelt thank you goes out to ‘The Chicks’ of NZ for their gracious gesture in allowing us to share their name. We are honoured to co-exist together in the world with these exceptionally talented sisters,” the band said in a statement.

The move follows a decision by country group Lady Antebellum to change to Lady A after acknowledging the word’s association to slavery. A statement on The Chicks’ website said “We want to meet this moment.” The term Dixie refers to Southern U.S. states, especially those that belonged to the Confederacy.

The Chicks, who are releasing their first new album in 14 years next month, also released a new video for their new song, “March March” that features videos and images from the recent Black Lives Matter rallies.

Lady A received criticism with their name switch after a Black singer revealed she’d been performing as Lady A for years.

The Chicks are the best selling female group in America with more than 33 million albums sold in the United States, according to the Recording Industry Association of America. Formed originally in Texas as a bluegrass group, the band hit commercial fame with their breakthrough album “Wide Open Spaces.” The band has won 13 Grammys.

The band was shunned by country radio over an incident in 2003 when lead singer Maines criticized then-President George W. Bush because of the Iraq War. They responded to the backlash with their song “Not Ready to Make Nice,” and swept the Grammys in 2007 winning three of the top all-genre categories.

NEW YORK - The studio is largely empty, but Jimmy Fallon is out of his home and back to the “Tonight” show stage.

The NBC late-night host returned to NBC's Rockefeller Center headquarters Monday, saying he hoped he could provide his audience with a little more “normal” during the corona virus pandemic.

“I'm here to show you that there is a light at the end of the tunnel if we keep each other safe,” Fallon said.

Fallon, along with other late-night hosts, have been working remotely the past few months of months. The corona virus pandemic shutdown TV and film production in March for safety reasons. New York has slowly been reopening as other parts of the country are now feeling the full effects of the epidemic.

He began his show with a filmed piece showing him “walking” to work, pulling down his mask so a Rockefeller Center security guard knew he was indeed an employee.

His backup band, the Roots, were in place. Studio crew members wore face shields and masks. Everyone there had tested negative for COVID-19, he said. There was no audience.

Fallon was dressed more informally, with a sweater instead of a suit.

“Normalcy, any type of normalcy, feels great,” he said. “So hopefully we can put a smile on your face an hour every night and let you sit back and relax while we try to bring you a little bit of normal.”

Guests, including New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Charlize Theron, weren't in the studio as the celebrity interviews continued remotely.","Jimmy Fallon, 'Tonight' show return to studio, sans audience",1,0.4083007693497043
883,"June was Pride month, commemorating the 1969 Stonewall riots that birthed the gay liberation movement. As in other journeys toward recognition, equality and freedom to be, the world has come far, and not far enough. And as always, there are arguments about which way to go.

June may be over. But television goes on, and we would like to propose some recent relevant series to keep the party going. One caveat: Not all that follows constitutes a party.

‘Pose-a-Thon’

Mostly a party is the isolation-shot “Pose-a-Thon,” a fundraising special featuring the cast and creators from the FX ballroom drama “Pose” that dropped on the eve of the Stonewall anniversary weekend. Offering songs and stories and testimonials, with a brief history of Stonewall from showrunner Steven Canals, the show makes a point of declaring that the “queer liberation movement was begun by black and brown trans women,” the very people at the heart of “Pose.”

‘Visible: Out on Television’

TV has indeed made progress in the intervening years, if stumbling along the way. Last year brought a same-sex marriage on the PBS cartoon “Arthur,” while the May series finale of Netflix’s “She-Ra and the Princess of Power” made explicit what fans already understood, that it was a long arc lesbian love story. The five-part documentary “Visible: Out on Television,” which premiered on Apple TV Plus in March, reaches back to the earliest days of the medium and gives a pretty thorough account of how LGBTQ people have been portrayed and employed across the decades — from invisibility to subjects of (invariably misguided) analysis, to objects of censure and pity and low comedy, to fodder for concerned social comment and big drama.

A running theme of “Visible” is that we should look for ourselves reflected in popular culture, how what we find or fail to find changes us and how in the absence of real representation, we look for what we can adapt and use. LGBTQ characters have moved from guest shots to supporting parts to central roles — to being played, in the bargain, by performers whose identity matches the character’s — as queerness has become something not always worth comment in and of itself. This too raises issues in a still imperfect world — as Times TV editor Matt Brennan pointed out in his piece on the series, the arc toward justice will require more bending.

‘Disclosure’

“Visible” pairs well with (and overlaps) “Disclosure,” a Netflix documentary specifically about trans actors and images, directed by Sam Feder and narrated and featuring “Orange Is the New Black” superstar Laverne Cox. Its view is less historical — though it supplies ample context, back to silent film — than it is concerned with the present and immediate future. Autobiographical, philosophical and political at heart, “Visible” and its contributors are erudite, articulate and disinclined to simplify.

‘Welcome to Chechnya’

HBO has put up a pair of documentaries that demonstrate in different ways the effects of homophobia. The just-premiered, ironically titled “Welcome to Chechnya” is an on-the-ground documentary shot in 2017, when authorities in the Russian Federation republic waged war on its LGBTQ population. They carried out what has been described as a “purge” — allegedly making arrests, torturing citizens to name other citizens, encouraging “honour” killings and generally trying to will difference out of existence. It feels shockingly medieval. The film, directed by David France, focuses on a group of underground activists smuggling refugees through halfway houses and out of Russia to countries willing to take them. It has all the elements of a classic escape film and is often difficult to watch, both for the subject matter and cinematic tension. But it is not without hope.

‘Bully. Coward. Victim. The Story of Roy Cohn’

Seven minutes into the first episode of “Visible,” legal attack dog Roy Cohn turns up next to U.S. Sen. Joseph McCarthy at the televised Army-McCarthy hearings, which, among other things, targeted LGBTQ people as security risks during the so-called Lavender Scare. Broadcast to an audience of some 80 million over its run, the hearings introduced the fact of homosexuality to television and, one would suppose, to much of America. Cohn is never heard from, or, for that matter, talked about, in “Visible,” but HBO’s excellent “Bully. Coward. Victim. The Story of Roy Cohn” discusses him at feature length.

The film takes its title from a panel in the AIDS memorial quilt that director Ivy Meeropol and her father happened upon. It was a moment of particular significance for them, as Meeropol is the granddaughter of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, whom Cohn helped send to the electric chair; he also was, significantly, a closeted gay man, who would die of AIDS complications. A high-living social climber who made it a point of honour to pay as few bills as possible, and no taxes, Cohn was a mentor to Donald Trump, if that word may be used in such a negative context, and an attorney for various organized crime figures.

Cohn died in 1986, and Meeropol’s film offers a picture of a gone world — a time when gay culture was influencing the mainstream, without the mainstream quite recognizing that fact. (Cohn was a regular in gay-friendly Provincetown, Mass., and at Studio 54.) Given the Rosenberg connection, “The Story of Roy Cohn” is remarkably even-handed, nearly sympathetic and more than a little sad. Cohn may have been a villain, but he was a victim not only of HIV but also of his generation. In hiding his sexuality, even as he was dying, his case was little different from that of actor Rock Hudson, who died of AIDS complications a year before Cohn. Both were 59.

‘Hollywood’/‘Now Apocalypse’

A fictionalized young Hudson, played by Jake Picking, is a central character in Ryan Murphy’s Netflix miniseries “Hollywood.” It’s an alternative-history postwar fantasy in which fear of a gay Hollywood is overcome as early as 1947, giving Rock the happy beginning, and we assume the ending life denied him — or he denied himself in life. It is a weird mess of a show that works best taken not quite as seriously as it wants to be. But it works as a kind of camp art film — something along the lines of Gregg Araki’s exuberant, future-camp, polysexual, porn-adjacent sci-fi farce “Now Apocalypse,” a Hollywood fable of a different sort. Starz sent it into the world last year. But the glossy, madcap first season is still available to stream, and worth seeking out.

‘A Secret Love’

For a lovely documentary take on the theme, see “A Secret Love,” which debuted on Netflix in April. It tells the story of Pat Henschel and Terry Donahue, a lesbian couple who didn’t reveal the nature of their relationship until they were in their 80s. Made by a family member, Chris Bolan, it’s moving not only for its somewhat reluctant, matter of fact intimacy but also for its sweep. The film takes in their younger lives with photos and home movies that capture a full domestic, romantic and social life in a time when exposure might mean ruin, even imprisonment. That Donahue was a member of the all-American Girls Professional Baseball League, the one pictured in “A League of Their Own,” is a historical bonus.

884,"ROME - Ennio Morricone, the Oscar-winning Italian composer who created the coyote-howl theme for the iconic Spaghetti Western “The Good, the Bad and the Ugly” and often haunting soundtracks for such classic Hollywood gangster movies as “The Untouchables” and the epic “Once Upon A Time In America,” died Monday. He was 91.

Morricone’s longtime lawyer, Giorgio Assumma, said “the Maestro,” as he was known, died in a Rome hospital of complications following surgery after a recent fall in which he broke a leg bone.

Outside the hospital, Assumma read a farewell message from Morricone.

“I am Ennio Morricone, and I am dead,” began the message. In the greeting, the composer went on to explain that the only reason he was saying goodbye this way and had requested a private funeral was: “I don’t want to bother anyone.”

During a career that spanned decades and earned him an Oscar for lifetime achievement in 2007, Morricone collaborated with some of Hollywood’s and Italy’s top directors, including on “The Untouchables” by Brian de Palma, “The Hateful Eight” by Quentin Tarantino , “The Battle of Algiers” by Gillo Pontecorvo and “Nuovo Cinema Paradiso,” a nostalgic ode to the importance of movie houses in Italian small town life, by Giuseppe Tornatore.

The Tarantino film would win him the Oscar for best original score in 2016. In accepting that award, Morricone told the audience at the ceremony: “There is no great music without a great film that inspires it.”

In total, he produced more than 400 original scores for feature films.

His iconic so-called Spaghetti Western movies saw him work closely with the late Italian film director Sergio Leone, a former classmate.

Morricone practically reinvented music for Western genre movies through his partnership with Leone. Their partnership included the “Dollars” trilogy starring Clint Eastwood as a quick-shooting, lonesome gunman: “A Fistful of Dollars” in 1964, “For a Few Dollars More” in 1965 and “The Good, the Bad and the Ugly” a year later.

Morricone was celebrated for crafting just a few notes — like the four notes played on a miniature pan flute favoured by a character in Leone’s 1984 movie “Once Upon A Time in America” — that would instantly become a film’s highly memorable motif.

That movie is a saga about Jewish gangsters in New York that explores themes of friendship, lost love and the passing of time, starring Robert De Niro and James Woods. It is considered by some to be Leone’s masterpiece, thanks in part to Morricone’s evocative score, including a lush section played on string instruments.

“Inspiration does not exist,” Morricone said in a 2004 interview with The Associated Press. “What exists is an idea, a minimal idea that the composer develops at the desk, and that small idea becomes something important.”

In a later interview, with Italian state TV, Morricone cited “study, discipline and curiosity” as the keys to his creative genius. “Writing music, like all creative arts, comes from a long path” along life’s experiences, he said.

“A great phenomenon of world music” was how Italian film director Dario Argento described Morricone, who scored five of his films.

In his late 80s, Morricone provided the score for “The Hateful Eight,” Tarantino’s 2015 70-mm epic and the first time in decades that he had composed new music for a Western. It was also the first time Tarantino had used an original score.

In accepting Morricone’s Golden Globe for the music in his place, Tarantino called him his favourite composer.

“When I say ‘favourite composer,’ I don’t mean movie composer. ... I’m talking about Mozart, I’m talking about Beethoven, I’m talking about Schubert,” Tarantino said.

Italy’s head of state, President Sergio Mattarella, in a condolence message to the composer’s family, wrote: “Both a refined and popular musician, he left a deep footprint on the musical history of the second half of the 1900s.”

Morricone’s sound tracks, Mattarella said, “contributed greatly to spreading and reinforcing the prestige of Italy in the world.”

Morricone’s style was sparse, made of memorable tunes and unusual instruments and arrangements, and often stirred deep emotions.

His music punctuated the long silences typical of the Spaghetti Westerns, with the characters locked in close-ups, staring at each other and waiting for their next moves. The coyote howl, harmonicas and eerie whistling of “The Good, the Bad and the Ugly” became Morricone’s trademark and one of the most easily recognizable soundtracks in cinema.

Minutes before handing Morricone the Oscar for lifetime achievement in 2007, Eastwood recalled hearing for the first time the score of “A Fistful of Dollars” and thinking: “What actor wouldn’t want to ride into town with that kind of music playing behind him?”

It was a night to remember for Morricone, who had been nominated for Oscars five times (“The Hateful Eight” was his sixth) but until then had never won.

Born in Rome on Nov. 10, 1928, Morricone was the oldest of the five children. His father was a trumpet player.

After studying trumpet and composition at the Conservatory of the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia in the Italian capital, he started working as a trumpeter and then as an arranger for record companies.

“I started working on very easy kinds of music pieces for the radio, for television and then for the theatre, and then little by little I started to compose the film scores,” he told the AP in 2016.

In 1961 he wrote his first score for a movie, a bittersweet comedy set in the final moments of Fascism called “Il Federale” (known in English as “The Fascist”). That decade also saw Morricone co-operate with Pontecorvo, first on “The Battle of Algiers,” the black-and-white classic depicting the Algerian uprising against the French; and later on “Queimada,” a tale of colonialism starring Marlon Brando.

Morricone received his first Oscar nomination for original score with “Days Of Heaven,” a 1978 movie by U.S. director Terence Malick. Beside “The Hateful Eight,” the others were for “The Mission” (1986), “The Untouchables” (1987), “Bugsy” (1991) and “Malena” (2000).

Shortly before his lifetime Oscar, Morricone joked that he would have been happy without the coveted statuette, saying “I would have remained in the company of illustrious non-winners.”

But he also made no secret that he thought “The Mission,” with its memorably sweet theme of “Gabriel’s Oboe,” deserved the Academy Award. That year, he lost to Herbie Hancock’s “Round Midnight.”

Morricone had recently composed music to be performed in Genoa’s Carlo Felice Theater later this summer in honour of the 43 victims of that city’s 2018 Morandi Bridge collapse, Genoa Mayor Marco Bucci said. The music will be performed on the eve of a ceremony inaugurating the bridge’s replacement, the mayor said.

Highly versatile, Morricone also orchestrated Italian pop tunes that include enduring classics, like one version of an eternal summer hit, “Sapore di Sale” (“Taste of Salt”), which was written by famed Italian troubadour Gino Paoli.

Another renowned maestro, Riccardo Muti, cited his “friendship and admiration? for Morricone. Muti on Monday recalled that when he directed the composer’s piece “Voci dal Silenzio” (Voices from the Silence” ) the work elicited “true emotion” from the audience, both in Chicago, where Muti directs the symphony orchestra, as well as during a performance in Ravenna, Italy.

Muti called Morricone an “extraordinary” composer both for films and in classical music.

Asked by Italian state TV a few years ago if there was one director he would have liked to have worked with but didn’t, Morricone said Stanley Kubrick had asked him to work on “A Clockwork Orange.” But that collaboration didn’t happen because of a commitment to Leone, Morricone recalled.

Morricone is survived by his wife Maria Travia, whom he cited when accepting his 2016 Oscar. Married in 1956, the couple had four children, Marco, Alessandra, Andrea and Giovanni.

LOS ANGELES -- Kelly Preston, who played dramatic and comic foil to actors ranging from Tom Cruise in “Jerry Maguire” to Arnold Schwarzenegger in “Twins,” died Sunday, husband John Travolta said. She was 57.

Travolta said in an Instagram post that his wife of 28 years died after a two-year battle with breast cancer.

“It is with a very heavy heart that I inform you that my beautiful wife Kelly has lost her two-year battle with breast cancer,” Travolta said. “She fought a courageous fight with the love and support of so many.”

The couple had three children together.

“Shocked by this sad news,” Maria Shriver said on Twitter. “Kelly was such a bright loving soul, a talented actress, and a loving mom and wife. My heart breaks for her family who have already known such sadness and grief.”

Preston had a lengthy acting career in movies and television, starring opposite Kevin Costner in the 1999 film “For the Love of the Game.” In 2003, she starred in “What a Girl Wants” and as the mom in the live-action adaptation of “The Cat in the Hat.” The following year she appeared in the music video for Maroon 5's “She Will Be Loved.”

Russell Crowe tweeted that he met Preston “first in late `92 I think,” adding, “In 1995 we auditioned together for Breaking Up, Salma Hayek got that gig.” Crowe said he hadn't seen Preston much, “but when I did, she was always the same sparkly eyed gem.”

She occasionally appeared in films with her husband, as they did in the box-office bomb “Battlefield Earth” in 2000.

Preston and Travolta were married at a midnight ceremony in Paris in 1991 while the couple were expecting their first son, Jett.

In January 2009, Jett Travolta, 16, died after a seizure at the family's vacation home in the Bahamas. The death touched off a court case after an ambulance driver and his attorney were accused of trying to extort $25 million from the actors in exchange for not releasing sensitive information about their son's death.

Travolta testified during a criminal trial that ended in a mistrial and was prepared to testify a second time, but decided to stop pursuing the case and it was dismissed. He cited the severe strain the proceedings and his son's death had caused the family.

Both Preston and Travolta returned to acting, with Preston's first role back in the Nicholas Sparks adaptation, “The Last Song,” which starred Miley Cyrus and her future husband, Liam Hemsworth.

They had two other children, daughter Ella Bleu in 2000 and son Benjamin in 2010. Ella wrote on Instagram Sunday: “I have never met anyone as courageous, strong, beautiful and loving as you. Anyone who is lucky enough to have known you or to have ever been in your presence will agree that you have a glow and a light that never ceases to shine and that makes anyone around you feel instantly happy.”

Travolta and Preston met while filming 1988's “The Experts.”

They last starred together in the 2018 film “Gotti,” with Travolta playing John Gotti and Preston playing the crime boss's wife, Victoria.

“Kelly's love and life will always be remembered,” Travolta said on Instagram. “I will be taking some time to be there for my children who have lost their mother, so forgive me in advance if you don't hear from us for a while. But please know that I will feel your outpouring of love in the weeks and months ahead as we heal.”

Preston's death was first reported by People magazine.","Actress Kelly Preston dies of breast cancer at age 57, husband John Travolta confirms",1,0.3019103864650702

LOS ANGELES -- Authorities were searching a Southern California lake Thursday for “Glee” star Naya Rivera a day after her 4-year-old son was found alone on a rented boat.

More than 80 people using helicopters, drones, and all-terrain vehicles, including divers, were involved in the search, the Ventura County Sheriff's Office said. The search began Wednesday and was suspended overnight, but resumed Thursday morning on Lake Piru, 55 miles (90 kilometres) northwest of Los Angeles in the Los Padres National Forest.

Rivera rented a pontoon boat at about 1 p.m. Wednesday, and planned to go swimming with the little boy in the reservoir's recreation area, authorities said. Another boater found her son on the north end of the lake asleep on the boat and wearing a life vest.

“We're going on the belief that she did go in the water and we have not been able to locate her,” Sheriff's Capt. Eric Buschow said at a news conference. “So this may well be a case of drowning.”

Rivera's identification was found on the boat and her vehicle was found in a parking area, authorities said. The boy was safe and healthy and with family members.

There have been occasional drownings through the years in the popular recreation area of the lake, technically a reservoir, which is about an hour's drive from downtown LA. It was shut down Thursday for the search.

Rivera's 4-year-old son is from a marriage with actor Ryan Dorsey. The couple finalized their divorce in June 2018 after nearly four years of marriage.

She called the boy, her only child, “my greatest success, and I will never do any better than him” in her 2016 memoir “Sorry Not Sorry.”

The most recent tweet on Rivera's account, from Tuesday, read “just the two of us” along with a photo of her and her son.

Singer Demi Lovato, who played a Rivera love interest in a guest stint on the show, posted an Instagram story that showed a candle with the text, “Please pray for â†•nayarivera to be found safe and sound.”

Rivera was engaged to rapper Big Sean in 2013, but their relationship ended a year later. The pair met on Twitter and collaborated musically, with the rapper appearing on Rivera's debut single “Sorry.” She married Dorsey a few months later.

Rivera played Santana Lopez, a singing cheerleader in the musical-comedy “Glee” that aired on Fox from 2009 until 2015. She appeared in 113 episodes of the series and dated co-star Mark Salling, who killed himself in 2018 at age 35 after pleading guilty to child pornography charges.

WASHINGTON - Perched on a flowering shrub on a windy Andean mountainside, the tiny Ecuadorian Hillstar hummingbird chirps songs of seduction that only another bird of its kind can hear.

As the male sings, he inflates his throat, causing iridescent throat feathers to glisten princely purple. The female may join in a courtship dance - or chase him off.

For the first time, scientists have shown that these hummingbirds can sing and hear in pitches beyond the known range of other birds, according to research published Friday in the journal Science Advances.

The male's ballad is sung at around 13.4 kilohertz. That's considered “ultrasonic” for birds, which generally can't hear above 9 or 10 kilohertz.

“Something very interesting is going on in the ears of these hummingbirds to allow them to hear such sounds,” said Christopher Clark, a biologist at the University of California, Riverside, who was not involved in the study.

“That's just an incredibly high pitch for a bird.”

Among birds, only some owls have previously been shown to hear ultrasonic sounds - which they use to locate prey, but not to communicate. Biologists have studied other hummingbird species in South America that make high-pitched sounds, but it's been difficult to confirm whether those birds also hear the sounds.

For the new study, scientists climbed into the Ecuadorian Andes to reach high grasslands called paramos and locate the Hillstars' breeding grounds. There they recorded the males singing, then played back their romantic ballads to test the reactions of other birds.

Other Hillstars craned their necks and turned toward the speaker as it played the high-pitched chirps; one also flew over the speaker to inspect it. In the lab, the scientists verified that the part of the brain typically engaged in auditory communication had been activated.

“We confirmed that this song has a social function,” said Fernanda Duque, a study co-author at Georgia State University, where she researches hummingbird brains.

Mammals generally hear a wider range of pitches than birds. Humans can hear pitches up to about 20 kilohertz, but lose sensitivity to high-pitch sounds with age.

During fieldwork, the younger scientists could usually hear the Hillstar hummingbird songs, but the older participants couldn't, Duque said.

The researchers believe the birds may have evolved to sing at high pitches so that their love songs wouldn't compete with background noises in their environment, such as mountain winds, streams and the songs of other birds, said Marco Monteros, a study co-author and biologist at Universidad Tecnica del Norte in Ibarra, Ecuador.

“For some hummingbirds, it's like a private channel of communication - other bird species don't use these high-frequency sounds,” said Timothy Wright, a behavioural ecologist at New Mexico State University, who was not involved in the study.",Ecuadorian hummingbirds chirp ultrasonic songs of seduction,1,0.5862676586235078

Organizers said Tuesday that they are pushing forward with plans for its 77th instalment, which will include a slightly reduced number of films in the main competition as well as some outdoor and virtual screenings. If the schedule stays intact, it will be the first major film festival since COVID-19 essentially shut down the industry in mid-March.

Festival director Alberto Barbera said in a statement that he is “extremely pleased that the Biennale Cinema can be held with a minimum reduction of films and sections” and that “a significant number of directors and actors will accompany films to the Lido.”

There will still be 50 to 55 films in the official selection, which will be announced on July 28, and screenings will take place in the traditional venues as well as two outdoor arenas (at the Giardini della Biennale and a skating rink on the Lido) with adopted safety measures established by authorities.

The festival will take its Virtual Reality section online and this year forego its Sconfini section, which hosts smaller films and genre fare, to accommodate more socially distanced screenings of the major films in competition. Actress Cate Blanchett is presiding over the main competition jury.

Travel to Italy, an early epicentre of the COVID-19 pandemic, is allowed from European countries. The European Union last week said it would reopen its border to 14 nations, but most Americans have been refused entry due to soaring coronavirus infections in the U.S. Press from countries with travel restrictions will be able to view press conferences virtually, Barbera said.

“Without forgetting the countless victims of these past few months to whom due tribute shall be paid, the first international festival following the forced interruption dictated by the pandemic becomes the meaningful celebration of the re—opening we all looked forward to, and a message of concrete optimism for the entire world of cinema which has suffered greatly from this crisis,” Barbera said.

The Toronto International Film Festival, which is typically held on the heels of Venice in September, has already announced plans for a smaller 2020 version, with fewer films and virtual red carpets. Both festivals serve as major launching grounds for awards hopefuls, although no one know how exactly it will work now that runway to the Oscars has been extended by two months.

This was especially true when he decided to play the piece he played for his very first competition when he was eight years old, “Valse Triste” by Rheinhold Glière.

In this Musical Moment, he also shares a traditional tune called “Romanian Hora,” which brings back childhood memories of hearing his mother play in a Klezmer band, and falling in love with the clarinet.

894,"When we find ourselves in times of trouble music is a solace we turn to. It can uplift, relax, transport or energize us. Live music, in particular, is exciting because anything can happen: it’s intimate; it’s urgent, and everyone in the room experiences and shares it together. United.

But what does a musician do when they don’t have an audience? And audiences when they can’t access live music? Here in our coronavirus self-isolation being able to share music is a gift.

The Toronto Symphony Orchestra has teamed up with the Toronto Star to offer an exclusive weekly Musical Moment — a new performance by one of the TSO’s musicians every week — a respite from the hard headlines and tough news we hear every day.

“Like the Toronto Star, the Toronto Symphony Orchestra is here to serve Torontonians throughout the GTA,” said its CEO, Matthew Loden. “We hope that this exclusive Toronto Star performance series serves as a hopeful musical tonic as readers review challenging but important headlines.”

Here’s how it works: the musician records themselves playing their instrument live at home, then sends their recording to TSO producers; as in the first performance by concertmaster Jonathan Crow, to be paired with the piano of Philip Chiu.

Pieces will be no longer than three minutes. And because they’re recorded at home, you’ll get new insight into each musician; a glimpse into their lives beyond the stage. Each week will offer up a new experience — as you would at a live performance, you never know what might happen. There’s an energy and an intimacy.

There are many couples at the TSO — maybe they’ll play together. Other family members, children perhaps, might join in somehow. Ensembles might record separately with each musician in their own home and then be joined together in production.

The new video will be posted each Thursday at thestar.com/musicalmoments; check in every week for music to unite the city.

Digital TIFF Bell Lightbox comes after last month's announcement that TIFF will have a digital platform in September.

Organizers say the festival, slated to run Sept. 10-19, will be a mix of physical and online experiences adhering to COVID-19 health and safety protocols.

Digital TIFF Bell Lightbox will offer feature films, talks and interviews until Aug. 14, after which the platform will be preparing for the festival.

In mid-October, year-round presentations of films and events will resume at digital TIFF Bell Lightbox.

896,"Think of the ways our lives have changed since we began social distancing to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. Music and theatre lovers can’t go to concerts; dance lovers can’t go to recitals; nor art lovers museums; foodies to restaurants. That doesn’t mean the richness of our lives diminishes; it just means we need to look at it differently, for now. There are still plenty of new things to experience — alone and together, in person and virtually. And each week the Star brings you that in our Life, Entertainment and Books section — now At Home.

Art is something we can all experience together — even if we’re apart. Each week, we’re presenting Star readers with a work of art.

This week, Carlos Bunga’s new work, at Toronto’s Museum of Contemporary Art, seems to be made for our times — the strong, visual image evokes a sense of us all staying apart while still being together.

But Bunga created this piece even before the COVID-19 social distancing we’re all experiencing. He methodically organized hundreds of standard packing boxes into a vast grid covering a significant portion of MOCA’s second floor.

Bunga’s work encourages us to situate ourselves within art, and thereby, the conditions of the present.

The boxes are labelless and open-ended, uniformly facing upward, as if offering themselves up to be physically or imaginatively filled. Collectively, the composition suggests an anonymous geography or urban plan, a camp or modular storage system.

There are no specific directions, no designated beginning or end. Each viewer’s passage is entirely their own.

We’ll all get through this together, even as we all take our own slightly different path while doing it.

The students at Etobicoke School of the Arts, like other pupils honing their creativity across the city, the country and the world, usually have a year-end exhibition. They show and sell their work, hold a Portfolio Day to showcase the fruits of their labour and create connections with the larger, outside world.

This year, the Class of 2020 has taken the sale online.

“The tension with teaching and having the sale online is the loss of personal interaction with other people,” observes Matthew Varey, head of contemporary art at the Toronto high school. “We are used to engaging with brilliant, creative, humble, powerful and ambitious people every day. That is the loss I am feeling, and the one I hear from the students that is being felt most deeply.”

For Ella Webber, the just-graduated Grade 12 student and young artist who painted this portrait of “Charlotte,” her art is a way of connecting with her peers, with the people she encounters in the world each day. She creates large-scale portraits — the size of the art, she says, “increases the intimate connection that I share with it, strengthening my personal bond with my subjects and allowing my paintings to take on a life of their own.

“Through portraits I’m working to understand the complexities, nuances and possibilities of human connection.”

In exhibition, her portraits command our attention. The people in them demand we see their perspective and understand their stories.

These students are graduating to a wider world. By supporting them in their creativity and understanding the way they see the world, together we can all graduate to a better one.

To see the exhibition, learn more about these young artists or to buy a painting, go to the online sale at www.esava.ca.

Capturing history: Everyday snapshots tell the story of Canada’s LGBTQ people

Toronto’s culture is nothing without Black artists. But the predominantly white art world is part of the obstacle

As one of the few Black theatre leaders in Toronto, for Weyni Mengesha systemic racism is nothing new",Want to learn more about Black art? These Toronto curators can help you find it,1,0.4643646424409569
906,"Our past and our present live together. It may seem there’s a huge chasm between them, but the space is much less than we think. As we begin to come together again with family and friends — with our community — we talk about the life we lived before the pandemic and look to the life we might live after.

Between Before and After lies what is possible. It’s a space to think, to reflect, to dream, to innovate. It is the space, perhaps, where there is a stillness, like that needed for prayer.

These are lessons captured by Inuit artist Elisapee Ishulutaq and her painting “Tusiarvik (A Place for Prayer)” — in which an understanding of what went before leads to innovation and creation.

“As an artist who participated in the founding of the print studio in Pangnirtung (in Nunavut), Ishulutaq is recognized as a pioneer of artmaking in her community and thus given the respect due an elder,” Christine Lalonde wrote of Ishulutaq, who died in 2018, in the catalogue “Builders.”

“Despite being the elder in the group, Ishulutaq emerged as the most capable and ready to experiment … New directions are not only taken up by emerging artists, they are pursued actively by elder artists whose technical experience allows them to adapt processes to new media with confidence and perhaps innovate further than their younger contemporaries,” wrote Lalonde, associate curator of Indigenous art at the National Gallery of Canada.

In “Vision, Space, Desire: Global Perspectives and Cultural Hybridity,” Indigenous artist and curator Jolene Rickard, quoted by Lalonde, notes that Indigenous artists “have densely packed cultural survival kits that transfer knowledge from one generation to the next, despite unremitting attempts at genocide, culturacide, and other forms of political and philosophical erasure. Native communities or nations have something the world needs to know about: the insight of continuity.”

Instead of forgetting the past, we must learn from it. Let us share our stories, our experiences; let the time we’ve spent become part of our collective knowledge. Then we can weave the past and present in a future that has learned its lessons.",Elisapee Ishulutaq’s ‘Tusiarvik’ bridges the past and the present,1,0.37263302978751556

Toronto has cancelled all city-led and permitted events through the end of September and will also revamp its all-night Nuit Blanche art festival into an online-only affair for this year only.

The city had previously cancelled all permitted events with attendance of more than 250 people through the end of July and all events with attendance of more than 25,000 people through the end of August.

Mayor John Tory, however, confirmed at his bi-weekly briefing on Monday that a decision has now been made to cancel all city-led and permitted events though Sept. 30.

That will wipe out a number of popular street festivals such as the Taste of the Kingsway, the Cabbagetown Festival and the Roncesvalles Polish Festival. It will also preclude the Toronto Internarial Film Festival from staging its annual “Festival Street” event along King Street, though TIFF itself is expected to continue in a reduced form.

“To continue the progress we have made to reduce the spread of COVID-19 the city is extending the cancellation of city-led and city permitted outdoor special events through Sept. 30,” Tory said in making the announcement. “I know that this is a decision that is very disappointing for many and it is a difficult decision for us to make but we believe that it is the right thing for us to do based on public health advice.”

City plans drive-in entertainment to fill gap

The city has already cancelled numerous major summer events, including Pride Toronto, the Caribbean Carnival and the Taste of the Danforth.

The announcement of the cancellation of dozens of more events through the end of September comes as the city unveils plans to provide free entertainment programming at a number of drive-thru style venues this summer as a way to give residents a few more things to do during the COVID-19 pandemic. .

The city has also announced that it will reopen the Riverdale Farm, the High Park Zoo and its conservatories as of tomorrow.

The “DriveInTO” program, which was detailed by Tory on Monday, will see the city partner with a number of festivals and organizations to provide film screenings and other programming at Ontario Place and at the new CityView Drive-In at Polson Pier.

The city says that free DriveinTO nights at Ontario Place will feature programming by Hot Docs, imagineNATIVE and TIFF while the venue at Polson Pier will have programming by the Inside Out LGBTQ Film Festival, the Reel Asian Film Festival, the Reelworld Film Festival and the Regent Park Film Festival.

“From films, to concerts, to sports broadcasts drive in entertainment is a terrify opportunity for Torontonians to reengage with their city and experience the very things that bring us joy,” Tory said. We are doing things differently and learning to adapt to this new way of life.”

Waterfront marathon also cancelled

The organizers of the Toronto Waterfront Marathon also confirmed on Monday that the race scheduled for Oct. 18 has been cancelled due to “COVID-19 related health and safety concerns.”

The cancellation of that event comes on the heels of most other major international marathons being cancelled, including the Chicago Marathon earlier in the day

""Sadly, we have reached a point where it is clear we will not be able to bring a mass event of 25,000 people from more than 75 countries, safely to downtown Toronto this October, and have officially canceled the 2020 in-person event,” Race Director Alan Brookes said in a statement. “We have shared so many unforgettable moments over 30 years at this race and are enormously disappointed.""","Toronto cancels city-permitted events until October, will stage online only Nuit Blanche",1,0.4814203811335208
909,"“The Phantom of the Opera” has garnered plenty of superlatives over the years, including the longest-running show in Broadway history. But in recent months, it has also laid claim to a more unlikely title: path-breaking musical of the COVID-19 era.

As theatres around the globe were abruptly shuttered by the pandemic, with no clear path to reopening in sight, the world tour of “Phantom” has been soldiering on in Seoul, South Korea, playing eight shows a week. And it has been drawing robust audiences to its 1600-seat theatre, even after an outbreak in the ensemble led to a mandatory three-week shutdown in April.

The musical, with its 126-member company and hundreds of costumes and props, is believed to be the only large-scale English-language production running anywhere in the world. And it has remained open not through social-distancing measures — a virtual impossibility in the theatre, either logistically or financially, many say — but an approach grounded in strict hygiene.

And it’s one that its composer, Andrew Lloyd Webber, is arguing can show the way for the rest of the industry, a point he is hoping to demonstrate to the world, as he prepares to turn the Palladium, one of seven theatres he owns in London, into a laboratory for lessons learned in Seoul.

“I don’t think we should just be sitting on our hands and saying, it’s all doom and gloom, we can’t do anything,” he said in an interview last week. “We have got to make the theatres as safe for everybody as we possibly can,” he said. And South Korea, he said, shows that it can work.

That the show, at the Blue Square cultural complex in central Seoul, has gone on is a testament not just to the protocols in the theatre, but to South Korea’s rigorous system of test, trace and quarantine, which has kept the virus largely under control.

It was also a matter of sheer timing and luck, though it didn’t seem that way at first.

When the tour’s previous stop in Busan, South Korea’s second biggest city, wrapped up in mid-February, the country was emerging as the latest epicentre of the pandemic.

The company mostly went home for a break to Britain, Italy, North America, Australia and elsewhere. Serin Kasif, vice president of Lloyd Webber’s company, the Really Useful Group, and the producer of the tour, said she was fielding daily messages from company members anxious about whether to return.

On March 2, when Kasif flew to Seoul to begin preparations to open there, South Korea had the second-highest number of confirmed cases, and the pandemic had not yet fully hit Britain.

She contrasted the “overwhelming sense of fear” that developed in London with what she had experienced in Seoul, with its clear governmental directives and local partners who had lived through previous epidemics like SARS.

“When I was speaking to our Korean partners, in lead-up to the decision to continue, one said, ‘The word “unprecedented” keeps getting used, but it’s not unprecedented here,’ ” she explained.

“Amazingly,” Kasif said, the entire company returned to Seoul. Matt Leisy, a Northwestern University graduate who plays Raoul, said that when he went home to New York during the break, friends were “freaking out” at the idea that he might go back to Korea. But he said he was reassured by the producers’ constant communication about safety protocols, as well as their videos of daily life in Seoul.

“It was quite scary leading up to us coming back,” he said. “Who knew we’d end up being in the safest place in the world?”

The protocols, which are mandated by the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, are strict, but they are not particularly space-age. Before entering the theatre, audience members are sprayed with a light mist of disinfectant. Thermal sensors take each person’s temperature, and everyone fills out a questionnaire about symptoms and recent places they’ve visited, so they can be notified of any exposures they may have had through the country’s contract-tracing app.

There are hand-sanitizing stations throughout, and ubiquitous signs and announcements reminding everyone that masks must be worn at all times. And in contrast to movie theatres, where alternating rows or seats are left empty, no seats are blocked off (though the first row was removed).

Backstage, there’s a similar drill: no embracing, no handshakes, no inessential physical contact. Reusable water bottles are forbidden, along with sharing food. Wigs, props and costumes are regularly sprayed or wiped with antibacterial cloths. Everyone must wear a mask, except for actors when they are being made up or go onstage, and some members of the orchestra.

Sharon Williams, the head of wardrobe, said that masks and “constant handwashing” aside, protocols for the 17-member costume department are not that different than they would be normally, beyond extra cycles of high-temperature washing with antibacterial soap.

The crucial element, she said, is the whole company’s rigorous co-operation. “No one is saying ‘I’m not going to do it,’” she said.

As for the onstage action, Kasif said there have been no modifications — and yes, Raoul and Christine still kiss.

Which isn’t to say the actors haven’t had nerve-racking moments. Leisy said initially he was “hyperaware” of all the saliva flying around the stage, especially in big numbers like the Act Two showstopper “Masquerade.”

“When I enunciate, the spit really flies out of my mouth,” he said. “At one point, we’re all dancing and singing our faces off and I look around and see all this saliva flying. I thought, ‘My goodness!’”

(The first row of seats is a seemingly safe 5.2 meters from the edge of the stage, according to a video issued by the show’s Korean producer in early May detailing the safety precautions.)

The run, which has been extended until August (after the touring production of “War Horse” set to follow in the same theatre cancelled), has not been without its bumps. In late March, about two weeks after the show opened, one of the show’s ballerinas said she wasn’t feeling well. She was tested, and the result — positive — was back by 9 a.m. the next morning.

Authorities moved swiftly to lock down the theatre and check if all guidelines were being followed. A mobile testing unit was installed on the roof of the apartment building where the cast and nonlocal crew live, and everyone was immediately tested both for active virus and antibodies. (A male ensemble member also tested positive but remained asymptomatic.)

All 76 members of the touring company were quarantined for 15 days in their apartments. The local employees were also tested, and quarantined at home. (A local production of “Dracula: The Musical” also decided to suspend performances in this period, in response to the outbreak at “Phantom,” according to local news reports.)

In keeping with local policies, the more than 8,000 people who had seen “Phantom” received text alerts informing them of the outbreak. Another announcement, which Kasif said was drafted in conjunction with authorities, was sent to patrons, describing the safety measures that had been in place.

Kasif suggested the fact that the virus had not spread more widely in the company was proof, at least “anecdotally,” as she put it, that the protocols work.

“The ballerinas are a very close ensemble,” she said. “They share a dressing room, warm up together, perform together, warm down together. They happen to be very good friends socially. So if the guidelines weren’t working, on paper they all should have had coronavirus.”

The show reopened on April 23, and ticket sales have been about 70 to 85 per cent full since, Kasif said. Even last Thursday, when a spike in cases in the country led authorities to close all public museums, galleries and entertainment venues across greater Seoul until June 15, the seats were mostly full, according to a reporter who attended. (Publicists for the show declined to provide box office information.)

Private venues, like the Blue Square, were allowed to remain open, and “Phantom” continues to operate “in accordance with KCDC guidelines and instructions,” Kasif said in a statement.

Several audience members expressed concern about the spike, but said they trusted the theatre’s measures and the country’s larger public health response.

Yi-seul Lee, 28, a graphic designer, had seen the musical in March and said she didn’t want to miss the chance to see it again. “Unless we shout very loudly while watching the show or take off our masks, I think we are more or less safe,” she said.

Still, some fans thought the uncertainties of the pandemic had dampened spirits a bit. In-hae Bae, 36, a human resources manager who was seeing “Phantom” for the sixth time, said that every time the actors embraced, the virus popped into her head. And the applause at the curtain call, she said, seemed “timid.”

“They were way too calm,” she said of the audience. “It made me think, ‘Coronavirus must have strangled our passion, too.’”",How ‘Phantom of the Opera’ survived the pandemic,1,0.33654130539639904

Music is known to help improve people’s lives.

From children in hospitals to seniors, palliative care patients, those with AIDS and HIV, at-risk youth, people in rehabilitation and people grieving the loss of others.

However, music therapy programs across the country are facing an uncertain future.

Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, some programs have put on pause, while other therapists have turned to virtual methods to support their students.

But, a musical therapist with the Ridge Meadows Association for Community Living came up with a novel way of bringing her services to those who need them – drive-by music therapy sessions.

“I realized that we all had to adapt and find ways to function, and that I needed to model not only survival but also how to thrive in a rapidly changing world,” said RMACL music therapist Birgit Giesser.

Ridge Meadows Association for Community Living provides services for adults and children with disabilities and Giesser thought it was crucial to connect with her students who might potentially feel isolated due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

People, “who may not fully understand the pandemic but are still experiencing the full breakdown of their normal lives,” she said.

So, Giesser created mobile sessions for her students following provincial health guidelines.

“Music therapy for me is about activating the joy, curiosity and skills we have within us and sharing them with one another. Music makes our lives meaningful and helps us cope with challenges,” noted Giesser.

Music Heals, an organization that raises money and awareness for music therapy across the country, funds the Community Living program in Maple Ridge, and matched money raised from last years Tea-ki Bar Social hosted by T’s Once Upon A Tea Leaf, where the back alley is turned into a cocktail party with DJ’s, vendors and food trucks.

But, like many charities across the country, Music Heals has lost about $970,000 in revenue due to the cancellation of fundraising events, including this years Tea-ki Bar Social.

Since Taryn Stephenson, who runs the Music Heals Charitable Foundation and who is also co-owner of T’s, started working with Music Heals, she has become more “hyper-aware” of the healing power of music.

“I really wanted to make sure that people in Maple Ridge had access to that,” she said.

And, said Stephenson, if they don’t have people who believe in the power of music and want to make donations to the charity, then they run the risk of current programs not being sustainable.

“What a sad day to not have music fill the hallways of facilities and hospitals,” she said.

Since 2012 the organization has funded 32,000 hours of music therapy across Canada.

911,"The Canadian Opera Company has cancelled all of its in-person performances and events slated for this fall, including “Parsifal” and “The Marriage of Figaro,” due to continued limits on travel and large gatherings in Toronto in the battle with the COVID-19 pandemic.

The company’s production of Wagner’s “Parsifal” will be rescheduled for the 2022/23 season. “Marriage of Figaro” is simply cancelled. Also falling victim to the new rules is a popular free noon concert series and other events.

The remainder of the COC’s 2020/21 season is, for now, intended to proceed as planned, with Bizet’s “Carmen,” Verdi’s “La Traviata” and more still scheduled for January through May 2021.

The company’s spring 2020 season was cancelled in March as the pandemic arrived in Canada.

Since then, COC general director Alexander Neef said in Monday’s release, it’s been pondering what its near future could safely be, but “opera gathers talent from all around the world to work together in close quarters, requires an extensive rehearsal schedule, plenty of advance planning and — to remain economically viable — an auditorium full of people, without whom no live performance is complete.

“Taking all of these factors into account, plus the many unknowns around public health guidelines in the fall, this was the only viable course of action to ensure the continued safety of our artists, staff and audiences.”

The COC Ensemble Studio will continue to develop Canada’s top young opera artists by working remotely as required. The company says that in recent months its trainers have used digital resources to deliver vocal, diction, language, dramatic and performance kinetics coaching among others.

The cancellation of the COC’s first production of “Parsifal” will “come as a disappointment to many,” Neef said. “This production caps a decade-long, community-led effort to stage Wagner’s final work here.”

A recently commissioned production of “Fantasma,” by COC composer-in-residence Ian Cusson with libretto by Colleen Murphy and intended for young audiences, will be moved from December to sometime in spring 2021. The company is working to create webinars, interactive programming and other educational material in a digital format.

Options for affected ticket-holders range from tax receipts issued for ticket donation, converting ticket value to gift certificate credits that never expires, or full refunds; complete details are listed at coc.ca/FallTickets.

Both the COC’s home venue, the Four Seasons Centre for the Performing Arts, and the company’s administrative office remain closed to the public until further notice, with full-time staff continuing to work off-site.

The COC has created a digital content hub at coc.ca/Hub, home to a “Virtual Choir,” a video chorus that received hundreds of submissions from all over the globe; “Songs of Hope,” an intimate online concert from the COC Ensemble Studio slated to premiere on July 9; and “Opera Makers,” a series of bite-sized video tutorials for young people.

912,"NEW YORK—The shutdown on Broadway has been extended again — until at least early January.

Although an exact date for performances to resume has yet to be determined, Broadway producers are now offering refunds and exchanges for tickets purchased for shows through Jan. 3.

“The Broadway experience can be deeply personal but it is also, crucially, communal,” said Thomas Schumacher, chairman of the board of The Broadway League, which represents producers.

“The alchemy of 1,000 strangers bonding into a single audience fuelling each performer on stage and behind the scenes will be possible again when Broadway theatres can safely host full houses,” he added. “The safety of our cast, crew, orchestra and audience is our highest priority and we look forward to returning to our stages only when it’s safe to do so.”

Broadway theatres abruptly closed on March 12, knocking out all shows — including 16 that were still scheduled to open — and postponing indefinitely the Tony Award schedule. Producers, citing health and city authorities, previously extended the shutdown to June 7 and then again to Sept. 6.

In London, producer Cameron Mackintosh has said his company’s West End productions of “Hamilton,” “The Phantom of the Opera,” “Mary Poppins” and “Les Miserables” won’t reopen until 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic. The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C., has cancelled most previously announced performances and events through the end of 2020, as has the Huntington Theatre Company in Boston.

Broadway grossed $1.8 billion (U.S.) last season and attracted a record 15 million people. Producers and labour unions are discussing ways theatres can reopen safely.

The latest extension wipes away many shows planned for the fall. Many have just moved to next year, including a revival of “The Music Man” with Hugh Jackman and Sutton Foster that was to start rehearsals on June 29 but will now open in May 2021.

Shows that were to open this spring have abandoned their plans, including “Hangmen” and a revival of Edward Albee’s “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” A production of “The Minutes” by Tracy Letts and “American Buffalo” by David Mamet will arrive on Broadway in Spring 2021, opening exactly one year after their originally scheduled opening dates.",Broadway shutdown due to coronavirus extended again until January,1,0.35449675578396944
913,"A play about the Black experience in the American South and a dance-theatre hybrid about the legacy of a residential school in Brantford were the big winners at Monday night’s Dora Mavor Moore Awards, which honour the performing arts in Toronto.

914,"LOS ANGELES—The wall had 30 framed pictures. All the pictures were of faces. All the faces were white.

That wall was the first thing Kelly Park saw when she stepped through the glass front doors of the Groundlings Theatre & School in L.A. day after day in the late aughts. It celebrated the comedians who had been voted into the main company and earned the honour of being called Groundlings after a rigorous program that could last years.

The wall made Park sad, and as a Black administrator at the school, she grew determined to change it.

“Imagine being a young Black person walking into this place,” she said. “The wall showed you that you can’t be that.”

Park resigned from the company in 2010, the wall of white faces staring silently forward as she left. From 2006 until 2016, not one member of the Groundlings’ main company was a person of colour.

There is finite room in the top ranks of L.A.’s leading improv and sketch comedy groups, and the performers selected to breathe the rarefied air have long been white. This was the painful sentiment echoed again and again in interviews with 14 people of colour — past and present comedians, teachers, students and administrators at Upright Citizens Brigade and the Groundlings, prestigious comedy schools and theatres that have launched some of the biggest names in film and TV.

Critics said the self-perpetuating white power structure fostered by these institutions led to the belittling and marginalizing of diverse voices, racial bias in voting for team members, and lip service to the concept of inclusion while providing little mentorship or paths for advancement to Black, Indigenous or other people of colour.

“The reason you take these classes and get involved is because you want to be seen on UCB stages. It could change your struggle immensely, it’s why you do it for free,” said Robert L. Hines, a Black comedian who took classes at UCB from 2015 to 2019, during which time he unsuccessfully auditioned for UCB’s coveted Harold teams performing in marquee slots. “But every time you go it’s always the same white guys at Harold shows.”

The difficulties faced by BIPOC comedians in improv and sketch comedy are neither new nor secret. But the nationwide protests against police brutality and systemic racism that arose after the killing of George Floyd, combined with the coronavirus pandemic and its disproportionate effect on communities of colour, have opened a larger window on these grievances. The concerns are receiving plenty of air, particularly on social media, and for what feels to many like the first time, grievances are being met with action.

In early July, a group of current and former performers at the Groundlings sent an open letter to the company listing actions to “create the real systemic change that the theatre needs.” The letter said that when the theatre released a statement in support of Black Lives Matter, BIPOC performers associated with the company felt let down by “a theatre that touts itself as a meritocracy while operating like a country club.”

Veteran BIPOC comedians at UCB in June launched an initiative called Project Rethink with the goal of dismantling “systemic oppression of all kinds” at the company. Included in the one-page list of goals and demands sent to management: that the powerful, traditionally white role of artistic director be broken up, that BIPOC and disabled performers must have a seat at the table where administrative decisions are made, and that they be involved in company discussions about seeking non-profit status — part of the company’s restructuring plan prior to the pandemic.

“Because of COVID-19, that capitalist hamster wheel has had to stop, and there’s now time to breathe and realize what’s going on, and to make changes,” said “Superstore” actor Colton Dunn, who started working with UCB in New York City in 1999. He was one of the first teachers at the L.A. school in 2005, and he was one of three Black people out of dozens of performers. “So when UCB or Second City or the Groundlings reopen, how do we make sure they do so like phoenixes from the ashes of this old system that is infected with institutional racism?”

Chicago-based Second City, which has a branch in L.A., erupted in controversy in June when an open letter from prominent alumni including Chris Redd and Sam Richardson called for an investigation of racism and sexism in the company culture. CEO and co-owner Andrew Alexander resigned June 5, acknowledging a failure to create an anti-racist environment.

“There seems to be a pattern in comedy groups in general when it comes to issues of sexism and racism in how theatres are run, how casting is done and who is and isn’t getting favours,” said Geoff Ross, who took his first improv class in 2008 and has been with UCB in L.A. since 2016.

Ross, who is Black, said he hopes Project Rethink will effect change, but the pandemic has caused him to reconsider how he invests his time and energy.

“Is it wiser to try to get an existing organization to change and function the way you would like it to,” Ross asked, “or is it better to use your energy to carve out your own space?”

Project Rethink members said their demands are being taken seriously by UCB, which was founded by Amy Poehler, Matt Walsh, Matt Besser and Ian Roberts in the early 1990s. The fact that the UCB 4, as the founders are known, are all white is not what rankles critics. It’s that a largely white male power structure has remained in place for more than 20 years.

The same feeling is prevalent at the Groundlings, founded in 1974 and also an important pipeline for improv and sketch artists cast in shows like “Saturday Night Live.” Famous alumni include Will Ferrell, Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig.

In solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement, the Groundlings posted a commitment to change on its website, including a pledge to expand diversity, outreach and scholarship programs; to be actively anti-racist as an institution; to put more BIPOC performers onstage; and to be more inclusive in its hiring practices. It also launched a “listening committee” to field concerns about racism and sexism in classrooms and on stages.

“Comedy institutions have a lot of work to do because the basis of comedy was white straight male humour for so long, and everybody is trying to dig out from under that past,” said Groundlings Managing Director Heather de Michele. She said a lot of positive changes have taken place since the Groundlings instituted its diversity initiative in 2015, and she said the company has awarded more than 600 diversity scholarships totalling more than $175,000. “But I will say we have to do more and we recognize that.”

The Groundlings’ 10-year white streak was broken in 2016 by Lyric Lewis. Today she is joined in the main company by two other Black performers, Leonard Robinson and Julian Gant.

Members of the main company, still capped at 30, are voted in by other main company members after completing up to 18 months of weekly performances as part of an ensemble student sketch company. Rick Davis, an outside counsel for the Groundlings and a former board member who helped to formulate the diversity initiative, said the changes will take time. The goal, he said, is to have BIPOC performers represented in the Groundlings at the same level that they are represented in the community at large. In L.A. County, for example, that would mean about 49 per cent Latino, 15 per cent Asian, 9 per cent Black and 2 per cent American Indian, Native Alaskan or Native Hawaiian.

Critics lament that, despite all the talent that has flowed across the Groundlings stage in three decades, you still could count on two hands the total number of BIPOC performers who have been in the main company — and have a few fingers left over.

Robinson said his experience with the Groundlings has been largely positive and that the company is on a path toward meaningful change. Other critics with the Groundlings and UCB echoed his feelings, likening the groups to family and saying they want to encourage better habits and behaviours.

The issues faced by these companies, they said, are not the result of villainous and overt racism at the top but rather the manifestation of the institutional racism rooted in American life.

“It’s an entertainment industry problem, it’s a state of comedy problem,” Robinson said. “People are in the streets burning buildings down, literally, because it’s a problem with the history of the world — diversity and inclusion.”

Robinson’s wife, Roxana Ortega, who is Latina and was a student at the Groundlings from 2003 to 2008, submitted ideas to the listening committee including striving for more transparency in the voting process, hiring a school counsellor or mediator to resolve conflicts, and creating a recruitment committee to diversify the classrooms and the stage. Like Robinson, she said the Groundlings is on a path toward meaningful change.

Others, however, question whether institutions hobbled by systemic racism for so long are capable of reform — or worthy of the effort. A number of Black performers recently have built successful homes for themselves, including “A Black Lady Sketch Show” on HBO and “Astronomy Club: The Sketch Show” on Netflix, the latter from a group whose members branched off from UCB.

Park, the former Groundlings administrator who also took classes there in the early aughts, called the group “the Whitelings” and said the pain and humiliation she experienced struggling to recruit and retain BIPOC students manifested in the form of general anxiety disorder and gastroesophageal reflux disease.

Park said she went to comedy clubs and coffee shops in Inglewood and South L.A. and invited Black performers to come and audition.

“Every single one of those Black faces was turned away,” Park said. “The board was four or five white people, and every week I’d go to the board with my concerns, and they were never addressed or talked about.”

Park said she resigned after a white teacher mocked her with a racial stereotype in front of his students. That teacher, she said, was put on temporary leave but has since been reinstated and still teaches at the school. A representative for the Groundlings said the incident predates the current administration and encouraged Park to report the incident to the listening committee for further investigation.

Critics and management alike agree that the problem facing the institutions, when it comes to adequate representation of BIPOC performers, starts at the bottom with recruitment and retention.

Daniel Robbins, who taught at the Groundlings for four years, left in 2017 after sending a letter to the school about implicit bias that he felt was not being addressed. His letter said he could not in good conscience continue to teach BIPOC students “knowing that as they worked their way through the school, it was going to become harder and harder for them,” Robbins said.

The problems are not just ideological but also financial. Improv and sketch comedy can be careers of privilege. An eight-week course of classes at UCB costs $450; a series of 12 improv classes at the Groundlings runs $525. Both companies offer diversity scholarships, but BIPOC students said financial barriers are one reason they often find themselves to be the sole performers of colour in a class or on a stage.

Being “the only,” as one former student called it, has a particular set of challenges when writing a sketch. A Black writer can’t create a sketch that involves a family member, for example, unless that family member being white is the punch line.

Writing your experience, in general, becomes problematic, especially when you are expected to immediately understand and react to white cultural references (think Harry Potter and Wes Anderson). Meanwhile, your own cultural references remain largely misunderstood by white performers.

Misty Monroe is a former member of the Groundlings’ Sunday Company, an upper-level group of performers who are being evaluated to become main company members. She said one reason she rarely does improv is because as a Black woman, she constantly found herself reduced to stereotypes based on white prejudice.

“You will be labelled a prostitute. You will be labelled ignorant. You will be labelled a criminal. You will be labelled someone who does hair,” Monroe said. “All the experience specific to my Blackness can never be reflected on that stage. I did not find white people having the same limitations that I had.”

When you can’t pull from your own life experiences, BIPOC performers said, you won’t go as far in your career. White teachers can compound the problem by having a limited perspective themselves.

Jasmine Elist, an Iranian American who spent six years with the Groundlings (and is a former Times employee), said that when she was a member of the Sunday Company, a teacher would give her grief every time she tried to pitch or play a Middle Eastern character. The teacher would say the characters were the same or similar, even though they were different ages and had different physical attributes and vocal cadences.

“She reduced and minimized a character to the character’s cultural background, determining that one character from Iran was like any other character from Iran,” Elist recalled in an email, adding that she considered the treatment of some other cast members overtly racist.

In January, Elist reported the teacher to managing director De Michele, but Elist was never told how the complaint was handled, only that it had been “taken seriously, and addressed in a timely manner.” The teacher is still at the Groundlings. De Michele said privacy rules prevented her from sharing more information.

Elist raised the issue again with the Groundlings listening committee, and she had a Zoom meeting with a fact collector recently hired by the Groundlings. Management said this person will work with outside attorneys to investigate specific concerns and report recommendations for further action.

Other performers said they never felt overt discrimination but microaggressions and seemingly small challenges did put them at a disadvantage.

Navaris Darson, who teaches diversity workshops and core-track improv classes at the Groundlings, said that when he was a student, he had to drive to Crenshaw to buy his own high-quality wigs while white classmates could save money by sharing wigs. Little things like that add to a larger sense of frustration and go largely unnoticed by white teachers and performers, he said.

Darson, who has been involved with the diversity committee since its inception, said he has high hopes that the company is on the right track, and he gets emotional thinking about his love for his fellow performers.

“I wouldn’t have a career if it wasn’t for the Groundlings. It’s more than just a job for me. Those people are my family,” Darson said. “I really do trust them to do the right thing.”

Doing the right thing, however, can have pitfalls, critics said. A focus on diversity can swiftly become a matter of optics, said UCB writing partners Eileen Soong and Julie Hoang.

The Asian American women have been on the same writing team since 2018 and had developed a great writing dynamic and relationship, they said, but they were recently broken up. The reason, they heard: Keeping two Asian women together on a team would be perceived as racist.

Soong said race never would have been part of the discussion about two white writers.

“It feels like we were broken up to diversify the other teams,” Hoang said. “That just shows there aren’t enough diverse people to begin with.”

BIPOC performers must find and champion one another within the community in order to thrive, but mentorship can be lacking. Shaun Diston, who has been with UCB since 2008 and is one of the comedians behind Project Rethink, said BIPOC performers must work five times as hard as other performers to get to the top. Once there, they can get picked up for jobs in Hollywood and move on quickly. (Hollywood, he said, checks in now and again looking for BIPOC talent when it’s trendy to do so.) But the churn means that UCB regularly has a diversity gap, and promising students of colour are sometimes moved up in the ranks before they are ready.

“After that well-intentioned move, they end up floundering because there’s no support,” Diston said. “They get spit out in a way that feels like, ‘You don’t value my diversity, you’ve used it, the joy has been crushed out of it.’”

The devaluation of BIPOC students as performers can be particularly bad during the audition process, when 20 white people are in a room analyzing a performer who may be traumatized by the unconscious bias and microaggressions of those same people.

Diston said he would go to these auditions as a judge and try to voice his opinions, only to be told that it wasn’t the time to talk, or that what he said was wrong.

“If my voice isn’t going to be heard, I’m not going to sit here so that you can say there were Black people watching the auditions,” Diston said.

The Times repeatedly reached out to UCB Artistic Director Christine Bullen and Academic Director Johnny Meeks for comment. Meeks did not respond, and Bullen said she was no longer qualified to speak on behalf of UCB because her continuing role with the company was undetermined. She said she wholeheartedly supports Project Rethink.

In mid-June the UCB 4 issued a statement to company members that as of Aug. 1, the founders will no longer handle day-to-day operations of the school and that once they received non-profit status, they would hand over control of UCB theatres to a new board of “diverse individuals.”

It is unclear who these individuals will be, but Project Rethink has plenty of ideas.","Groundlings, Upright Citizens Brigade face racism and the ‘comedy problem’",1,0.01816357668492674

The broadcast journalist announced the news in a video on his social-media accounts, calling his two years on the TV program “an incredible time” and praising the crew and co-host Dina Pugliese.

Neither he nor Citytv gave a reason for his departure.

Petersen only said he’s “done for now” and “taking a little break.”

A statement on Petersen’s departure from a Citytv representative said they “are always striving to best serve” their audiences “and deliver a great morning experience to ‘Breakfast Television’ viewers.”

Charmaine Khan, senior manager of communications for Citytv, said they thank Petersen “for his dedication and significant contribution to ‘BT’ and CityNews” and wish him “continued success.”

Khan said there are no immediate plans to replace Petersen, who joined the show in July 2018.

He had replaced the role vacated by Kevin Frankish on the show, after working as a news reporter and anchor.

“All good things must come to an end,” Petersen wrote Tuesday on Twitter.

“Won’t miss waking up at 3:30. Will miss our amazing viewers and crew.”

916,"It’s been 11 years since “Glee” introduced viewers to Santana Lopez, the fierce and passionate high school cheerleader played by Naya Rivera, who died last week at age 33 while on a boating trip on Lake Piru with her four-year-old son. A body authorities believe to be that of Rivera was found Monday morning in the lake after a days-long search, said Ventura County Sheriff Bill Ayub.

Rivera appeared in all six seasons of “Glee,” elevating ensemble numbers with effortless harmonies and riffs while commanding a sweeping range as a soloist. As an actor, she delivered one of the show’s most compelling character arcs, transforming Santana from a textbook popular girl into a complex young woman figuring out her sexuality and coming into her own as a performer.

Here’s a sampling of Rivera’s greatest “Glee” performances, from Amy Winehouse’s “Valerie” to Taylor Swift’s “Mine.”

‘The Boy Is Mine’ (season 1, episode 18)

“Laryngitis” is one of the first “Glee” episodes to showcase Santana’s vocal talents, featuring one of multiple knockout duets she shared with Amber Riley’s Mercedes. While competing for Puck’s (Mark Salling) affection, the pair harmonize on a cover of Brandy and Monica’s “The Boy Is Mine.”

‘River Deep, Mountain High’ (season 2, episode 4)

In “Duets,” Santana makes the strategic decision to partner with Mercedes for the glee club’s duet competition — reuniting the dynamic duo for a powerful cover of Ike & Tina Turner’s “River Deep, Mountain High.”

Though they don’t end up winning, the pair rock the rehearsal room with high energy and sharp harmonies.

‘Valerie’ (season 2, episode 9)

“Special Education” sees Rachel (Lea Michele) take a back seat at the Western Ohio Sectional Championship show choir competition, giving other talented members of New Directions, including Santana, a chance to shine.

Onstage, Santana leads the group in an upbeat rendition of Winehouse’s “Valerie,” which secures them a spot at the upcoming regional competition.

‘Back to Black’ (season 2, episode 21)

In “Funeral,” Mr. Schuester (Matthew Morrison) holds auditions for solo parts ahead of the national show choir competition, and Santana opts to sing Winehouse’s “Back to Black.” Despite applauding Santana for her smooth, stylized performance, Schuester ultimately decides that no one will be featured as a soloist for nationals.

‘America’ (season 3, episode 5)

“The First Time” sees Santana lead a dazzling ensemble performance of “America” as Anita in McKinley High’s production of “West Side Story.” The number begins and ends with Santana centre stage, dancing and singing circles around her castmates in a stunning red dress.

‘Rumour Has It’ / ‘Someone Like You’ (season 3, episode 6)

In “Mash Off,” Mercedes and Santana lead the all-female Troubletones in a seamless mash-up of Adele’s “Rumour Has It” and “Someone Like You.” The performance also sees Santana in a rare moment of vulnerability after she has just been outed as a lesbian.

‘Smooth Criminal’ (season 3, episode 11)

In the show’s Michael Jackson-themed episode, New Directions’ Santana faces off against the Warblers’ Sebastian (Grant Gustin) for an intense duet of “Smooth Criminal.” She challenges Sebastian after the Warblers attack their former choir-mate, Blaine (Darren Criss), during a parking-lot showdown of “Bad” (which also features impressive solo work by Santana).

At the end of their heated duet, Santana declares, “I was better.” Yep.

‘Mine’ (season 4, episode 4)

“The Break-Up” sees Santana return to McKinley High to visit her girlfriend, Brittany. She later serenades Brittany with an intimate, tearful cover of Swift’s “Mine” before suggesting that they take a break from their relationship.

‘Cold Hearted’ (season 4, episode 16)

In “Feud,” Santana confronts Rachel’s love interest, Brody (Dean Geyer), with a dynamic performance of “Cold Hearted” closely mirroring Paula Abdul’s original music video.

Santana leads the dance-heavy number with the help of some students from the New York Academy of Dramatic Arts.

‘Don’t Rain on My Parade’ (season 5, episode 9)

“Frenemies” is the second “Glee” episode to feature Barbra Streisand’s “Don’t Rain on My Parade” from “Funny Girl.” The first was season 1’s “Sectionals,” which sees Rachel (Lea Michele) deliver a show-stopping performance of the tune during a choir competition.

In the fifth season, Santana stuns Rachel with an effortless performance of the same song that rivals her own while unexpectedly auditioning to be Rachel’s understudy in a Broadway revival of “Funny Girl.”",Naya Rivera lent her immense talent to ‘Glee.’ Here are her greatest musical numbers,1,0.26023304736439834
918,"NEW YORK—The dance has ended for “Dancing With the Stars” hosts Tom Bergeron and Erin Andrews.

ABC said in a statement that the show is looking to “embark on a new creative direction” and host Bergeron “departs the show with our sincerest thanks and gratitude for his trademark wit and charm that helped make this show a success.”

No replacements were named.

Bergeron has hosted “Dancing With the Stars” since its premiere in 2005.

He took to Twitter to announce his departure. “It’s been an incredible 15-year run and the most unexpected gift of my career,” he wrote. “I’m grateful for that and for the lifelong friendships made.”

Last year, Bergeron made waves when he expressed his unhappiness that former White House press secretary Sean Spicer was among the contestants for the fall season.

Bergeron tweeted that he earlier told producers he hoped the new season would be a “joyful respite from our exhausting political climate” and urged them not have any “divisive bookings.” Producers apparently disagreed. “We can agree to disagree, as we do now, but ultimately it’s their call,” Bergeron wrote.

The finale that season — No. 28 — ended with Hannah Brown and Alan Bersten taking the trophy but scored a new low in total viewers among the show’s previous finales. Still, the show was the most watched program on broadcast television with 7.7 million total viewers.

The network on Monday also said farewell to Andrews, who originally competed as a contestant back in 2010 and returned as co-host in 2014. “Her signature sense of humour has become a hallmark of the show,” the statement read.","Tom Bergeron, Erin Andrews exit ‘Dancing With the Stars’",1,0.5895771368306654
919,"You might say that it all began with a Strauss waltz.

Then again, you might say that the seeds of Victor Feldbrill’s career as a conductor were sown even earlier, at a rehearsal of the Harbord Collegiate Orchestra, when the teacher-conductor handed his baton to his youthful concertmaster so the instructor could walk out front and listen to the orchestra.

The native Torontonian was a violinist then, as he was when Sir Ernest MacMillan subsequently handed him a baton to conduct the Toronto Symphony Orchestra in Strauss’s “Artist’s Life Waltz.”

The year was 1943, he was soon to be stationed in London with the Royal Canadian Navy (still as a violinist) and — following part-time studies at the Royal Academy and Royal College of Music — to return to postwar Toronto and a long professional life facing orchestras.

It is never easy to explain what makes a real conductor. When I was in university a popular textbook was Max Rudolf’s “The Grammar of Conducting” (I still own a copy). I later had the opportunity to hear Rudolf himself conduct in Cincinnati, thanked him and was promptly told that following the conducting diagrams in his book was the barest beginning.

He was right, of course. Two conductors can use those same diagrams and produce greatly different results.

On another occasion I asked a member of the TSO what he considered to be the role of a conductor and, with the cynicism born of long experience, he replied, “to not get in the way.”

Feldbrill did not get in the way. He knew what it was like to play in orchestras and knew better than to treat them without respect for their knowledge.

His own knowledge was acquired more on the front lines than academically. Conducting is something you learn by doing, and he started doing it regularly while still in school.

Did he become a great conductor? No, he became a valuable conductor, championing the work of Canadian composers more than any of his contemporaries did.

He knew the composers on a personal level, worked with them on their premieres and during his decade as music director of the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra starting in 1958, he set a precedent that has sadly not been followed of making Canadian music a regular feature of his programming.

He did conduct internationally, mostly in England and Japan. In the latter country he became the first Canadian guest conductor at Tokyo’s National University of Art and Music in 1979. Throughout the 1980s he conducted and taught regularly in the Land of the Rising Sun.

It was back home in the true north, strong and free, that he made his mark, teaching and conducting at the University of Toronto and appearing with orchestras, both youth and professional, across the country.

His association with the TSO was particularly close, not only as a frequent guest but as sometime director of youth programming and founding conductor of the Toronto Symphony Youth Orchestra.

Although he never became the orchestra’s music director — recognizing that he was too much the hometown boy to be considered for the job — he stepped up at a critical point in its history, following the 1973 death of Karel Ancerl, to act as resident conductor during the search for Ancerl’s successor.

I think it broke his heart when the then-manager of the orchestra finally terminated his annual appearances at Roy Thomson Hall. He last conducted a full concert at the age of 83.

Seven years later he was still conducting at an Arts and Letters Club celebration of his 90th birthday. I was one of the speakers at that occasion, remarking that critics and conductors have at least one thing in common: we tend to outlive everyone else. When he died in Toronto on June 17, Victor Feldbrill was 96.","Victor Feldbrill, hometown conductor, became Canadian composers’ champion",1,0.28714490644357715

Alessia Cara emerged the top winner at this year’s Juno Awards, scooping up three trophies in a pre-recorded ceremony that paired celebration with an acknowledgment that more needs to be done to represent the diverse voices of Canadian artists.

While the Junos usually mark the biggest night for the country’s music industry, the Monday event, which streamed online, took on a noticeably different tone in isolation. Missing were those euphoric acceptance speeches inside a massive venue filled with adoring fans, replaced with a handful of intimate performances and some serious reflection on the future.

Running a bit over 90 minutes, the Junos were handed out at historic speed, with 42 categories announced by presenters that included “Stranger Things” actor Finn Wolfhard and singer Jessie Reyez, who also pocketed her third career Juno during the event.

But it was the 23-year-old Cara who shone brightest as her deeply personal 2018 “The Pains of Growing” picked up both album and pop album of the year, while she also won songwriter of the year for her work on several of its tracks.

It was an uplifting finish for the Brampton, Ont.-raised pop singer after her dreams of hosting the awards show were dashed in the wake of COVID-19. She was originally lined up to be MC for the televised event in Saskatoon last March before organizers pulled the plug in response to the pandemic.

Cara was quick to jump onto Twitter after she came out on top, posting a characteristically humble “um whaaaaaaat” before retweeting congratulatory messages from a couple of her followers.

Aside from the big wins, Monday’s ceremony took on a sense of social urgency as greater awareness surrounding representation of Black, Indigenous and other artists of colour became a topic some of the presenters addressed.

CBC Radio host Odario Williams, who’s also a member of hip-hop collective Grand Analog, opened the show with a candid acknowledgment of the many shortfalls of Juno Awards past.

He noted that it took 15 years after the first ceremony in 1970 before soul and reggae artists were included in the list of categories, while it wasn’t until 1991 when the first rap recording award was given to Maestro Fresh Wes.

“I’ve got to give a shout out to the Black and Indigenous Canadian artists of the ’70s, the ’80s, the ’90s that are true pioneers in the growth of our musical landscape,” he said, pointing to Liberty Silver, who was the first Black woman to win a Juno in 1985.

While Juno organizers have made efforts to improve diversity among its nominees in recent years, president Allan Reid recognized that much work still needs to be done.

“We are committed to the long-term inclusion and amplification of Black voices and a more equitable industry for all,” he said at the outset of the show.

“We are working on an action plan with specific commitments that we will reveal this July. We must do better for our BIPOC members of the music community, and we welcome you to hold us accountable.”

A number of the night’s music performances also put the subject of racism in Canada at the forefront.

Halifax alt-pop duo Neon Dreams, who were selected as breakthrough group this year, gave a sombre performance of “We Were Kings.” The coming-of-age reflection was co-written by lead singer Frank Kadillac about his own experiences rising above stereotypes, racism and high school bullying.

Indigenous singer Iskwe went outdoors to play ”Little Star,” a song paying tribute to Colten Boushie, Tina Fontaine and the lives of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls, filmed within the Mississaugas Of Scugog Island First Nation territory.

Other highlights included two-time winner Shawn Mendes, who was selected as artist of the year. “Senorita,” his duet with girlfriend Camila Cabello, won single of the year, making him the first artist to pick up that award for three consecutive years.

Breakthrough artist went to Oshawa, Ont.-born pop singer Lennon Stella, who’s already established herself as an actress on the primetime musical-drama series “Nashville.”

Avril Lavigne pocketed the fan choice award, which is voted on by viewers, for the second year in a row, and the third time in her career.

Among this year’s most surprising winners is Governor General Julie Payette, who’s a member of the Ottawa Bach Choir that won best classical album, vocal or choral.

Bryan Adams’ “Shine a Light” won adult contemporary album, giving the musician his 17th Juno win and putting him behind only Celine Dion and Anne Murray as the artist with the most Junos.

922,"A stripped-back presentation of the 2020 Juno Awards on Monday will toast the Canadian music scene, and the show’s head organizer hopes it’ll mark a bright moment for an industry hit hard by COVID-19.

With concert venues closed and most performers staying at home without gigs, Allan Reid said he’s focused on giving this year’s Juno nominees the recognition they missed after the pandemic sidelined a weekend of accolades in Saskatoon several months ago.

But he said this year’s show, which is skipping broadcast TV and going directly to CBC Gem, will look undeniably different than ones in the past.

“This is not the Juno broadcast that you would see on television — it’s not 12 performances and six awards,” explained Reid, who serves as president of the Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (CARAS).

Instead, the show is cramming two nights of trophies into a brisk ceremony recorded in isolation.

Winners in a dizzying 42 categories will be announced over 90 minutes, putting the marquee nominees for single and album of the year in the same spotlight as more obscure ones, such as world music and children’s album.

Presenters include Toronto Raptors’ Chris Boucher and two-time Juno winner Jessie Reyez, while songs will be performed by Iskwe, Neon Dreams, the Dead South, and Alessia Cara, who was originally supposed to host the cancelled television event.

The Junos will stream on CBC Gem, and CBC’s Facebook, YouTube and Twitter pages on Monday at 7 p.m. ET.

Reid spoke with The Canadian Press about making a different sort of Junos show, how the virus is slamming the music industry, and what it all means for the 50th anniversary of the awards set for next March.

CP: There are a number of significant changes to this year’s Junos, including that Alessia Cara stepped away from hosting duties. But she’s also this year’s top nominee with six nods. How will she be involved in the show?

Reid: Alessia is going to have a one-time performance of “Rooting for You” (a song that helped her pick up the songwriter of the year nomination). It’s an exclusive premiere from her new EP called “This Summer: Live Off The Floor,” which is coming out in July. She recorded it pre-pandemic.

CP: How about Jann Arden, who was originally supposed to be inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame by Anne Murray on the broadcast? Those plans have been sidelined, but is something going to materialize later?

Reid: We felt this was not the time… those are lifetime moments. So we haven’t finalized details. We are trying to figure out how to accomplish that, whether it’s around the 50th anniversary, or another way, we’re not sure. (There were) so many disappointments with the show not happening and that was definitely one of them.

CP: Speaking of the 50th anniversary, the Junos are slated for Toronto next year to mark the momentous occasion. The celebration would be the first time in a decade that the awards have taken place in the city. But considering the virus, is that still on?

Reid: Obviously, COVID is has changed everything. As a music event that is a mass gathering — from all of our events to the broadcast — we have to be taking into consideration: What if there is a second wave? Things are still relatively unknown about what the future will hold, so we need to make plans, and alternate plans, to make sure that we can still do a celebration. But what exactly that’s going to be, right now we’re still working through. I don’t think there’s anybody who can say for sure if we’re going to be able to gather 15,000 people in the Scotiabank Arena next March.

CP: After the last-minute cancellation of the 2020 Junos, do you plan to return to Saskatoon?

Reid: We’re working on a three- to five-year plan at all times with future cities. The challenge for Saskatoon is that everything was spent — it wasn’t like we cancelled a month before the event, (it was) 48 to 72 hours. And so all the food had been delivered to the convention centre for the gala dinner, the stage was fully built, we were starting rehearsals. The whole machine was rolling. So, from an investment standpoint, it requires new investment to make that happen again. Hopefully we’ll get a chance to go back.

CP: What about the Canadian music industry as a whole? Since the country effectively shut down live entertainment, we’ve seen musicians rally for financial support from the federal government, but there’s a more uncertain road ahead for live music. You’re head of CARAS, a non-profit that supports performers, so how do you see this shaping up?

Reid: The music industry — like sports, like restaurants — has been hit incredibly hard. It’s devastating to see artists lose their livelihoods who can’t tour. Yes, we’re very fortunate to have a government that’s providing (assistance) to try to make ends meet, but I’ve had so many conversations with artists who are just going, “I don’t know much how longer I can go. I’ve got to find another way to make a living.” If they’re not on the radio and not generating that kind of performance income, it comes from performing live. And I’m extremely worried of what’s going to happen to the venues across this country. If this is prolonged from three-and-a-half months into next year, how do those venues survive? And if they go away then where do the bands go to play?

929,"LONDON, ONT. -- They are the fiction writers judged to be the best in their genre, by rest of their genre.

Every May the Crime Writers of Canada name their Arthur Ellis Award Winners for excellence in Canadian crime writing.

Those awards were announced Thursday night in Toronto. Although COVID-19 concerns caused the cancellation of the normal awards gala, the winners were no less honoured.

The best crime novel award was won by Michael Christie for his novel Greenwood. His story is told in the future and the past, and reveals a tragedy that bonds two boys over the course of time. It is a family story that grows over time to include omissions, half-truths and outright lies. This is not the only honour secured by Greenwood; it was also long listed for the prestigious Scotiabank Giller Prize last fall.

The best crime first novel award went to Philip Elliott for Nobody Move, a hard-boiled crime story set - where else - but Los Angeles. A debt collection turned double murder fuels the plot that draws in the debt collector, his mob boss employer, an ex-assassin, the femme fatale, and of course, police.

Author Robin Harlick served as one of the judges this year and praises the quality of the work submitted.

She says “For the most part the entries were well-written with good story telling and engaging characters.”

In fact, she says there are more Canadian crime writers out there than she realized, “many of which would stand up to the best in British or American crime writing, a standard often used by avid crime fiction readers.”

Harlick was also pleased to see that many of authors set their books here in Canada.

In a genre where location is often a character in its own right, she says there is persistent pressure from international publishers to “set crime fiction anywhere else other than Canada.”

Other winners included: best crime novella, won by Wayne Arthurson for The Red Chesterfield. Arthurson’s award was sponsored by Mystery Weekly, an online monthly journal of short crime fiction based in London, Ont.

The best crime short story was won by Peter Sellers for Closing Doors.

The best French crime book honour went to Andree A. Michaud for Tempetes.

The best juvenile or young adult crime book went to Keep This to Yourself by Tom Ryan.

The best nonfiction crime book was won by Charlotte Gray for Murdered Midas: A Millionaire, His Gold Mine, and a Strange Death on an Island Paradise.

932,"VANCOUVER -- The Vancouver Symphony Orchestra hasn’t performed in front of an in-person audience since mid-March, but that hasn’t stopped the musicians from making beautiful music to lift spirits during the pandemic.

Now the VSO has recorded a loving tribute to front-line health care workers that features Juno-award winning musician Dan Mangan, and some of the health care workers themselves.

“I actually had no idea that hospital front line workers would be performing as well,” Mangan told CTV News Vancouver. “I was brought to tears to see these professionals just laying it down from operating rooms.”

The song they picked to record sends a fitting message during this time of fear and anxiety: ‘All You Need Is Love’ by the Beatles.

The performance was organized by Michelle Goddard, who plays the clarinet for the VSO. She said 20 health care workers and 30 orchestra members took part, playing everything from piano to violin to trombone and even bagpipes.

Dr. Julia Reynolds provides primary obstetric care at Royal Columbian Hospital in News Westminster, and is one of the health care workers who took part with her violin, tapping into her previous musical training as a member of a symphony when she was in medical school.

“It was awesome,” said Reynolds. “I couldn't stop smiling when I watched it. It was such a joyful and creative project.”","Vancouver orchestra, Dan Mangan, health care staff team up to perform 'All You Need Is Love'",1,0.09137723642916373
933,"GREYHOUND: 4 ½ STARS

Tom Hanks is the above the title star of “Greyhound,” a new naval thriller now streaming on Apple TV+, but the star of the film is the tension that takes hold in the first ten minutes and does not let go.

Set during the onset of the United States' involvement in the Second World War, Hanks plays Commander Ernest Krause, a stoic sailor on his first command. His mission is to lead an international convoy of 37 Allied ships across the North Atlantic with a wolfpack of German U-boats in hot pursuit. Running out of depth charges and fuel, the convoy needs air cover, which is hours away.

That’s it. “Greyhound” isn’t so much story driven as it is propelled by the action. In a breathless ninety minutes director Aaron Schneider, working from a script written by Hanks, adapted from C. S. Forester’s 1955 book “The Good Shepherd,” ratchets up tension, creating an old-fashioned action movie that mines a life and death situation for real cinematic thrills. That being said, there’s no fight scenes, you never see the face of the enemy and the only dead bodies are wrapped in linen, getting a proper burial at sea.

Inspired by the Battle of the Atlantic, the movie takes place completely on board the USS Keeling (Call sign ""Greyhound""). Krause is in the ship’s claustrophobic helm for ninety percent of the running time, barking orders, peering through binoculars, making hard decisions with consequences that will affect the lives of hundreds of people.

Hanks plays Krause as a man with nerves of steel who hides his concern behind his furrowed brow. In the heat of battle every second counts and both Hanks and Schneider understand that the mental gymnastics required to do the job must be front and centre. This is a movie where the fiercest action is verbal. Sure, there’s gunfire, torpedoes and explosions, but the exciting stuff comes from Krause’s mental perspective. Never have coordinated turn equations and rudder work been this exciting.

“Greyhound” was originally set for a theatrical release. The more sweeping shots, those of the ships as specks in the vast ocean, feel like they would have benefited from the big screen treatment, but the story, driven by intellect, the effectiveness of team effort, and old-fashioned thrills, works well in any format.

THE OLD GUARD: 2 ½ STARS

“The Old Guard,” a new superhero flick starring Charlize Theron on Netflix, has the earmarks of an action flick, but brings the genre kicking and screaming into the twenty-first century by focusing the story on not just one, but two female characters.

Theron channels the dark side that made her characters in “Mad Max: Fury Road” and “Atomic Blonde” so compelling. She’s Andy, a tough-as-nails immortal mercenary with the power to heal herself, no matter how deep the wound.

“She has devised more ways to kill than entire armies will ever know,” says unkillable sidekick, and former soldier for Napoleon, Booker (Matthias Schoenaerts). For centuries they have fought the good fight—depending on which side you take—along with Joe (Marwan Kenzari) and Nicky (Luca Marinelli), sticking up for the maltreated and oppressed. “Through history, we’ve protected this world,” says Andy, “fighting in the shadows.”

In modern day they come across Nile (KiKi Layne), a Marine who shares their “extremely rare skillset.” “She stabbed me,” Andy says admiringly, “I think she has potential.”

Nile is the first of their kind they have come across since 1812 and soon they recruit her to join their ranks. “You haven’t figured this out yet?” Andy asks her. “You can’t die.” At the same time a mad-scientist big pharma type (Harry Melling) sets his sights on them as lab rats in his experiments to find a cure for death. “If we can unlock their genetic code, the entire world will be begging us for the key.”

“The Old Guard” is an action film, with carefully staged and exciting fight scenes, but first and foremost it’s a set-up for a franchise. Like an action-packed trailer for a movie it teases the possibility of the next film. The origin story is talky, illustrated by flashbacks, while the main plot is resolved quickly in a hail of bullets and a few swings of an axe. Then the set up begins, as they hint at further adventures. Trouble is, I’m not sure “The Old Guard’s” appeal is as immortal as its characters.

Theron and Layne are strong characters who deliver in the fist-to-the-face action department, but the movie doesn’t let them shine. As mentioned, the fight scenes are well staged but their relationship is never fully developed. Everyone, except for Melling who appears amped up on something he didn’t share with the rest of the cast, is on a slow simmer which gives the movie a laid-back vibe which doesn’t spark interest.

“The Old Guard” does a good thing by placing two women at the center of an action movie but the all-set-up all-the-time script doesn’t do the characters or the movie any favors.

FISHERMAN’S FRIENDS: 3 ½ STARS

Another entry in the Real-Life-Underdog-Brits-Overcoming-Adversity genre of movies—think “The Full Monty,” “Calendar Girls” and more recently “Military Wives”—“Fisherman’s Friends,” now on VOD, is a good-natured crowd pleaser with some deep laughs but no major surprises.

Daniel Mays is Danny, a “proper bigshot” London music biz executive, on a quick weekend get-a-way with some mates in Port Isaac in Cornwall. They are fish out of water in the village. The locals poke fun at their city-slicker ways, treating them like outsiders. “We have our ways down here,” Jim (James Purefoy) warns Danny, “and once you cross the River Tamar you’re not in England anymore. We’re a land apart. You get my drift, son?”

After hearing a local group of fishermen, led by Jim, Jago (David Hayman) and Leadville (Dave Johns), singing a cappella sea shanties Danny’s pals jokingly convince him that he should sign the band to a record contract. He’s skeptical at first, but there’s something about the music that speaks to his soul. But first, he has to persuade the fishermen who are suspicious of his motives. “We have no need to sell our souls for fifteen minutes of fame,” Jim tells him.

His friends can’t believe he fell for the joke. “Do you really think we’d sign a boy band with the combined age of 643?”

But, convinced the public will want to see real people with real talent communicating 500 years of naval history, Danny perseveres. “In a world saturated with manufactured pop bands,” he says, “the fishermen are a real catch.” Plus, he’s fallen for life in the village and Jim’s daughter Alwyn (Tuppence Middleton).

The story of the band’s success is almost stranger than fiction. In real life The Fisherman's Friends “buoy band” signed a contract with Island Records and their debut went on to become the biggest selling traditional folk album of all time.

“Fisherman’s Friends” keeps the bones of the real story but amps up the big emotional moments. The highs soar and the lows have a heartfelt sentimentality. None of it quite feels like reality but by the time the end credits roll it’s clear that Port Isaac in Cornwall is a nice place to visit for 115 minutes.

“Fisherman’s Friends” is formulaic, clearly manipulative, and any sense of subtlety was clearly cut adrift around the second draft of the script but the story’s feel-good underdog story mixed with innate messages of decency and loyalty make it as refreshing as a gust of sea air in our cynical times. “We stick together down here,” Says Jago. “One and all. That’s the difference between sinking or swimming in a place like this.” A good message, even when delivered with a heavy hand.

WHITE RIOT: 4 STARS

The cultural, moral and emotional impact that music has is undeniable. Songs like “Times They Are A-Changin’,” “Them Belly Full (But We Hungry),"" and “What’s Going On” or events like Live Aid or The Concert for Bangladesh brought with them societal change by mobilizing music fans to action. “White Riot,” new documentary from director Rubika Shah streaming on Virtual Cinema Screening sites (see below), details the fight between Rock Against Racism and Britain’s National Front.

In the macro the film’s story is set against the rise of xenophobic politician Enoch Powell and violent, far-right hate group the National Front. Language that would get anyone kicked off Twitter or cancelled today was casually tossed around in the papers and on television. In one inspired sequence Shah pieces together a montage of outrageous racist remarks pulled from mainstream sitcoms.

In August 1976 guitarist Eric Clapton, whose entire career was based on the elements of blues created by Black American musicians, added his voice to the rhetoric, endorsing Powell from a stage in a drunken rant.

“I think Enoch’s right,” he said. “I think we should send them all back. Stop Britain from becoming a Black colony. Get the foreigners out.""

His comments caught the attention of music photographer Red Saunders who wrote a letter to the music press, calling for rock to be a force against racism. Bigtime outlets like NME, Melody Maker and Sounds all published the letter. The resulting and overwhelming response from like-minded Brits inspired Saunders to create the grassroots movement, Rock Against Racism (RAR) and a fanzine, Temporary Hoarding geared toward reporting on the stories the mainstream press ignored.

“Our job,” Saunders says, “was to peel away the Union Jack to reveal the swastika.”

Their reports on immigration and the police’s racist “suspected persons” powers among other hot button topics appealed to a generation of young people who embraced new ideas politically and musically, in the form of rebel music, punk rock and reggae.

Despite violent resistance from the National Front RAR persevered and “White Riot” ends, not at the end of Rock Against Racism’s mandate—they remained a potent force until 1982—but with their first massive public outing, 1978’s Carnival Against the Nazis. Headlined by The Clash, Steel Pulse and Tom Robinson, it attracted 100,000 people who began marching a march at Trafalgar Square, before the concert at Victoria Park.

“White Riot” pieces together archival footage, like unsettling shots of National Front supporters parading through London, recent interviews with the main RAR players and piles of ephemera, like old gig posters, punk badges and photos, to define the film’s time and place. Shah weaves the elements together, punctuating the info with sonic blasts of music courtesy of live footage of The Clash, The Selecter, Sham 69, Steel Pulse and others.

It is compelling stuff and even though it details a time more than forty years ago it doesn’t feel dated. Racism and rise of neo-fascism are still with us but “White Riot” reminds the viewer that resistance not only comes in many forms but that fighting the good fight is never out of date.

VOLITION: 3 ½ STARS

James (Adrian Glynn McMorran) is a young man with extra sensory perception, but is it an ability or an affliction? That is the question asked in “Volition,” a new thriller now on VOD.

“They say when you die, your whole life flashes before your eyes,” James says in the opening minutes of the movie. “I wish it were that simple.” It’s a signal of sorts to the viewer that nothing in the next ninety minutes is going to be simple or follow the accepted rules.

James, a clairvoyant, makes his money using his insight into the future and doing odd jobs for local crime outfits. On one such job, involving a load of stolen diamonds and a gangster named

Ray (John Cassini), James intuits a bad end for the caper and himself. With the help of a stranger, Angela (Magda Apanowicz), he tries to find a path to alter the future and his fate.

“Volition” is a mix-and-match of speculative fiction and neo-noir crime drama. Driven by ideas rather than special effects, it favors intellect over action, philosophy over fisticuffs. There are tense scenes and gun play but, like movies such as “Looper” or “Next,” it uses time as an ever fluctuating, nonlinear construct.

The bending of the sequence of time makes for some heady filmmaking but the story never allows itself to get lost amid the twists and turns. Director Tony Dean Smith, who co-wrote the script with brother Ryan W. Smith, teases out the thrills and the head-scratching in equal measure, making for a film made up of fragments, to come together to form one fascinating mosaic.",Movie reviews: 'Greyhound' a naval thriller propelled by action,1,0.12947012637659616
935,"NEW YORK -- Rapper Megan Thee Stallion said Wednesday that she was shot multiple times on Sunday, but expects to fully recover.

“I suffered gunshot wounds, as a result of a crime that was committed against me and done with the intention to physically harm me,” the 25-year-old Texan whose legal name is Megan Pete wrote in an Instagram post, without saying who shot her or why. “I'm incredibly grateful to be alive and that I'm expected to make a full recovery.”

Los Angeles police had no immediate comment on the incident in the Hollywood Hills early Sunday. But Officer Jeff Lee confirmed that rapper Tory Lanez, who was with Pete that evening, was arrested on a concealed weapons charge.

Lee said the Instagram post has been pointed out to the detectives in the case, who are looking into it.

Lanez was released after posting bail later Sunday, Los Angeles County jail records showed.

Messages left with representatives for the two rappers seeking more details were not immediately returned.

Pete said she wanted to correct an inaccurate narrative about what happened that evening, apparently referring to a TMZ story on Lanez's arrest that said she was treated only for broken glass in her foot, and did not mention gunfire.

Pete said on Instagram that “the police officers drove me to the hospital where I underwent surgery to remove the bullets,” adding that “it was important for me to clarify the details about this traumatic night.”

Megan Thee Stallion has seen a serious recent rise on the rap and pop music scene, topping the all-genre Billboard Hot 100 chart this year with her Beyonce-assisted remix of “Savage,” which had a viral moment on the video-sharing platform TikTok. The song is from her nine-track album “Suga,” which was released in March and helped the performer win best female hip-hop artist at last month's BET Awards, besting Cardi B, Nicki Minaj and Lizzo.

She's also scored Top 40 pop hits with “Hot Girl Summer,” “Cash Shit” and the recent single “Girls in the Hood.”

“Suga” comes after the release of the projects “Fever” and “Tina Snow” that helped establish Stallion's name in music. Last year she made the 2019 TIME 100 Next List, was named one of the AP's Breakthrough Entertainers of the Year, won prizes at the MTV Video Music Awards and BET Hip-Hop Awards, and was honoured by Variety and Billboard magazines.

The former first lady will host ""The Michelle Obama Podcast"" on the streaming service, the Obama's Higher Ground and Spotify announced Thursday. The podcast will exclusively debut on Spotify on July 29.

""My hope is that this series can be a place to explore meaningful topics together and sort through so many of the questions we're all trying to answer in our own lives,"" Obama said in a statement.

The new podcast is the first title in the ongoing collaboration between Spotify and Higher Ground, a production company founded by Barack and Michelle Obama. Last year, the former president and first lady partnered with Spotify to produce exclusive podcasts for the platform.

Michelle Obama's new podcast expects to hold candid and personal conversations with a focus on topics concerning relationships and health. She expects to have several guests on the series including talk-show host Conan O'Brien and Valerie Jarrett, business woman and former senior advisor to Barack Obama.

""Perhaps most of all, I hope this podcast will help listeners open up new conversations -- and hard conversations --- with the people who matter most to them,"" she said. ""That's how we can build more understanding and empathy for one another.""

The ESO played outside the Shamrock Curling Club last month as part of their summer concert series.

“I do believe that is the first time the ESO played at a curling rink,” says Konstantine Kurelias who is the symphony’s media relations officer.

Since COVID-19 restrictions kept the orchestra out of the Winspear, they’ve taken the show on the road — literally. ESO members have performed on streets, cul-de-sacs, frontyards, and backyards.

“That’s the silver lining of a pandemic; the ESO will come to you and play”, says Kurelias.

Stephanie Morin, has played flute onstage with the ESO for years, performing indoors in the Winspear Centre, considered one of the best concert halls in the world for acoustics. But she says playing music for a small group of people in their own yard creates a special connection.

“We know that having a fancy concert hall and dressing up and the whole thing that goes around with orchestral symphony concerts, it kind of creates this barrier sometimes so it’s nice we have this opportunity to show people it’s not really like that.”

You can book members of the ESO by going to the Winspear’s website, and not only will they play in locations that are safe, they’ll also create a custom show.

“These are world-class musicians so they will arrange some music that is perfect for the event outdoors, people can physically distance around the music, and have a good time,” says Kurelias.

People are asked to make a donation to the symphony to show their appreciation. And Morin appreciates that these neighbourhood shows lets her play music for people again, something she hadn’t done until performing in someone’s backyard recently

AUSTIN, Texas - Vanilla Ice has indefinitely postponed a Texas concert that drew fierce criticism due to the coronavirus pandemic.

The 1990s rapper with the hit single “Ice Ice Baby” had been scheduled to play a lakeside concert just outside Austin on Friday, but on Thursday he announced it was being postponed.

“Due to the increase in COVID-19 numbers in Austin we're gonna move the concert to a better date,” Vanilla Ice tweeted. “We were hoping for better Coronavirus numbers by July but Unfortunately the numbers have increased quite a bit so for the safety and health of everyone we're going to stay home.”

Barrett Brannam, who owns the venue where Vanilla Ice had been scheduled to play, said the star - real name Robert Van Winkle - had expressed concern about the health of his fans and himself. Brannam said he didn't know when the show would be rescheduled.

“Hard to say. Could be later this summer or not until next summer. We don't now how long this virus will be around,” he said.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott last week shut down bars and clubs in an effort to halt what he called a “massive spread” of the coronavirus. But the Emerald Point Bar & Grill is still open and hosting live music because it is a restaurant and performances can take place outside.

The Vanilla Ice show drew widespread attention - and criticism - when the rapper posted about it on social media Wednesday. Only 84 tickets had been sold before the online ticket broker suspended sales, Brannam said.

“I take the coronavirus serious. But we can't live in a bubble,” the rapper tweeted before cancelling Thursday. “I think at this point we all understand the severity of it. (P)ractice social distancing and wear a mask. This is an outside venue, Fourth of July on the lake with fireworks. Plenty of room for distancing.”

The rapper's management company didn't immediately respond to messages seeking comment.

Brannam said he hadn't come under any pressure to cancel the show from state or local governments but he has been swamped with calls of complaints.

The performer played the same venue last year in front of 1,800 people and is booked for the holiday weekend for the next two years, Brannam said. Friday's concert was booked in 2019, he said.

“I didn't know about COVID when I booked this show. Nobody did,” Brannam said.

Brannam said the rapper had committed to asking fans to wear masks and follow proper social distancing guidelines. The venue was going to be checking patrons' temperatures at the entrance and giving a mask to anyone who needed one, he said.

The restaurant has been hosting live music performances since it reopened in May. Brannam said no one complained until it was a Vanilla Ice concert.

Brannam said he postponed upcoming concerts by Coolio and Tone Loc next weekend because he wouldn't lose money.

“Vanilla Ice, he's poised for people to poke fun at. Nobody was saying anything until he made his post. That's when everything went crazy,” Brannam said. “I'm the most hated person on the planet right now over a Vanilla Ice show.”",Coronavirus concerns freeze Vanilla Ice show in Texas,1,0.5344861777266802

DJ and record producer Kaytranada, interdisciplinary musician and visual artist Lido Pimienta, and electronic composer Caribou have all made the short list for the $50,000 Canadian honour.

The Polaris is held in high esteem in the music world as it recognizes the best full-length Canadian album from the previous year based on artistic merit, not on sales or genre.

Montreal-based Kaytranada (a.k.a. Louis Kevin Celestin), who won the prize in 2016, made the cut this time for “Bubba.”

Toronto-based Pimienta, a 2017 winner, is in the running for “Miss Colombia.”

And 2008 winner Caribou, masterminded by Dundas-raised Dan Snaith, is a contender for “Suddenly.”

The short list was announced on a CBC Music radio broadcast on Wednesday.

The 10 finalists also include Grammy-nominated, Toronto-based R&B-pop artist Jessie Reyez for her debut full-length album, “Before Love Came to Kill Us.”

Reyez can also be heard on another shortlisted album: “Studio Monk” by Junia-T of Toronto, who is also Reyez’s tour DJ and combines a variety of genres, including hip-hop and R&B.

Transgender rapper and producer Backxwash of Montreal is on the list with the sophomore album “God Has Nothing to Do With This Leave Him Out of It.”

Other contenders include the self-titled album from Pantayo, a Toronto-based, all-women, queer Filipinx ensemble that combines traditional kulintang music from the Philippines with pop influences.

First Nations indie rockers nehiyawak of Edmonton are in the running with the debut album “nipiy,” a collection of songs heavily inspired by the Idle No More movement.

The list also includes “Heavy Light” by U.S. Girls, the solo project of Toronto-based multi-genre artist Meghan Remy; and the Ethio jazz/R&B/hip-hop fusion “DNA Activation” by singer-songwriter Witch Prophet of Toronto.

The group of finalists was whittled down from a long list of 40 contenders, who included The Weeknd and Daniel Caesar.

A team of journalists, broadcasters, and bloggers will decide the winner.

Organizers usually announce the winner at a gala event, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, they’re doing a webcast on Oct. 19.

NEW YORK - Controversial music producer Dr. Luke was once pop music's top hitmaker, crafting hits for virtually every female pop star, from Katy Perry to Kelly Clarkson to Britney Spears. He's returned to the charts in 2020, working on songs for rising and established rap stars, including Lil Wayne, Juice WRLD, Saweetie and Doja Cat.

The songmaster, who has been entangled in a bitter lawsuit with former collaborator Kesha since 2014, has produced and co-written Saweetie's new single “Tap In,” the follow-up to her double-platinum smash “My Type.” Dr. Luke also co-wrote and co-produced Juice WRLD's “Wishing Well,” taken from the rapper's first posthumous album “Legends Never Die,” released last week.

The recent successes mean all three major U.S. record label companies have worked with Dr. Luke this year, even if he hasn't always put his widely recognizable professional name to the new collaborations.

Dr. Luke marked a major comeback this year with the success of the Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 hit “Say So” by rapper-singer Doja Cat, who is signed to Dr. Luke's Kemosabe Records. Dr. Luke, born Lukasz Sebastian Gottwald, produced several songs on Cat's sophomore album “Hot Pink,” including single “Like That,” which is No. 5 on Billboard's Hot R&B songs chart. He is the only producer with two songs in the Top 10 on the latter chart (“Say So” sits at No. 2).

For his work with Cat, he used the alias Tyson Traxe. He used the same pseudonym for his production credit on Toronto rapper-singer Benny Mayne's “Hokey Pokey,” released this year. For Lil Wayne's “Shimmy,” a track featuring Cat on the deluxe edition of his latest album “Funeral,” Dr. Luke used the name Loctor Duke.

Label representatives for Saweetie, Juice WRLD, Lil Wayne and Cat didn't immediately reply to emails seeking comment. Neither did a representative for Dr. Luke.

Luke has sprinkled his comeback among the major labels. Cat is signed to Sony Music's RCA Records, while Saweetie is part of the Warner Music family. Lil Wayne releases music through his Young Money imprint and Republic Records, a division of Universal Music Group.

Before Dr. Luke topped the charts this year with “Say So,” he last had a No. 1 with Katy Perry's “Dark Horse” in 2014. Months later, Kesha accused him of sexual assault during their yearslong partnership (Dr. Luke has vigorously denied the allegations.)

A New York court dismissed Kesha's sexual abuse-related claims in 2016 because of legal issues, without ruling on whether the allegations were true. Kesha lost another round in February, when a New York judge said she made a defamatory statement about Dr. Luke on a different occasion: a 2016 text message telling Lady Gaga the producer had also raped Perry. Both he and Perry have denied it, and the judge said there was “no evidence whatsoever” to support the claim.

Kesha's lawyers have said they plan to appeal the ruling, but it didn't resolve other aspects of his defamation and breach-of-contract suit, including the crucial question of whether Kesha's allegation that he raped her is true. The judge said that's for a jury to decide at trial.

Outside of rap in 2020, Dr. Luke has produced music for pop singer Kim Petras, using the pseudonym MADE IN CHINA.","Dr. Luke rebounds, thanks to Saweetie, Doja Cat, Juice WRLD",1,0.5528338602115798

Earlier this year, Trebek, who is battling Stage 4 pancreatic cancer, announced he had beaten the one-year survival rate which is 18%. “I’m very happy to report I have just reached that marker,” Trebek said in March.

Jeopardy!, which hasn’t aired any new episodes since June, will re-air some material from its archives this month, including its series premiere, which debuted in 1984.

“For the first time ever, we’re going to open the Jeopardy! vault and take a look at some of our Jeopardy! episodes, including the very first show I ever hosted, moustache and all,” Trebek said.

The Ontario-born game show host also updated fans on his health, saying, “I’m doing well, I’ve been continuing my treatment, and it is paying off, though it does fatigue me a great deal. My numbers are good, I’m feeling great.”

After a brief attempt to film without a live studio audience, Jeopardy! suspended production in March due to safety concerns surrounding the coronavirus pandemic.

Trebek has used his time away from the show to put the finishing touches on his memoir, The Answer Is..., which is due out July 21. In the book, which will feature his “thoughts on a range of topics, including marriage, parenthood, education, success, spirituality, and philanthropy,” Trebek said he wants “people to know a little more about the person they have been cheering on for the past year.”

NEW YORK - Carl Reiner, the ingenious and versatile writer, actor and director who broke through as a “second banana” to Sid Caesar and rose to comedy's front ranks as creator of “The Dick Van Dyke Show” and straight man to Mel Brooks' “2000 Year Old Man,” has died. He was 98.

Reiner's assistant Judy Nagy said he died Monday night of natural causes at his home in Beverly Hills, California.

He was one of show business' best-liked men. The tall, bald Reiner was a welcome face on the small and silver screens: In Caesar's 1950s troupe, as the snarling, toupee-wearing Alan Brady of “The Dick Van Dyke Show” and in such films as “The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming” and “It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.”

In recent years, he was part of the roguish gang in the “Ocean's Eleven” movies starring George Clooney and appeared in documentaries including “Broadway: Beyond the Golden Age” and “If You're Not in the Obit, Eat Breakfast.”

Tributes poured in online, including from Steve Martin, who said: “Goodbye to my greatest mentor in movies and in life. Thank you, dear Carl.” Actor Josh Gad called Reiner “one of the greatest comedic minds of all time” and Sarah Silverman said ”his humanity was beyond compare."" Actor Alan Alda tweeted: “His talent will live on for a long time, but the loss of his kindness and decency leaves a hole in our hearts.” Billy Crystal added “all of us in comedy have lost a giant.”

Reiner directed such films as “Oh, God!” starring George Burns and John Denver; “All of Me,” with Martin and Lily Tomlin; and the 1970 comedy “Where's Poppa?” His books include “Enter Laughing,” an autobiographical novel later adapted into a film and Broadway show; and “My Anecdotal Life,” a memoir published in 2003. He recounted his childhood and creative journey in the 2013 book, “I Remember Me.”

But many remember Reiner for “The Dick Van Dyke Show,” one of the most popular TV series of all time and a model of ensemble playing, physical comedy and timeless, good-natured wit. It starred Van Dyke as a television comedy writer working for a demanding, eccentric boss (Reiner) and living with his wife (Mary Tyler Moore in her first major TV role) and son.

“The Van Dyke show is probably the most thrilling of my accomplishments because that was very, very personal,” Reiner once said. “It was about me and my wife, living in New Rochelle and working on the Sid Caesar show.”

The pilot, written by Reiner, starred himself as Rob Petrie, and aired in July 1960. When the show was reworked (CBS executives worried Reiner would make the lead character seem too Jewish), Van Dyke was cast and the program ran from 1961 to 1966. One famous fan, Orson Welles, was known for rushing to his bedroom in the afternoon so he could be near a TV when the show was on.

“Although it was a collaborative effort,? Van Dyke later wrote, ”everything about the show stemmed from his (Reiner's) endlessly and enviably fascinating, funny, and fertile brain and trickled down to the rest of us.“

The story line had Petrie as the head writer for “The Alan Brady Show,” a comedy-variety series not unlike “Your Show of Shows,” in which Reiner, as Brady, was the egocentric star. Petrie's fellow writers were character actors Morey Amsterdam as Buddy Sorrell and Rose Marie as Sally Rogers.

It was an early parody of the Caesar show, which would later be dramatized in the film “My Favorite Year” and Neil Simon's play “Laughter on the 23rd Floor.”

Besides acting in and producing the “Van Dyke” series, Reiner wrote or co-wrote dozens of episodes. Although the show was the best of good clean fun, it wasn't clean enough for network censors. Reiner often battled network officials over the sleeping arrangements of Rob and his wife; the Petries slept in twin beds. He wanted them to sleep in a double bed.

Reiner joined the classic comedy revue “Your Show of Shows” in 1950 after performing in Broadway plays. Much of Reiner's early work came as a “second banana” - although, as Caesar once put it, “Such bananas don't grow on trees.” He performed in sketches - satirizing everything from foreign films to rock `n' roll - and added his talents to a writing team that included Brooks, Simon, Woody Allen and Larry Gelbart.

“As second banana,” he told TV Guide, “I had a chance to do just about everything a performer can ever get to do. If it came off well, I got all the applause. If it didn't, the show was blamed.”

It was during the “Show of Shows” years that Reiner and Brooks started improvising skits which became the basis for “The 2000 Year Old Man.” Reiner was the interviewer, Brooks the old man and witness to history.

Reiner: “Did you know Jesus?”

Brooks: “I knew Christ, Christ was a thin lad, always wore sandals. Hung around with 12 other guys. They came in the store, no one ever bought anything. Once they asked for water.”

After the pair performed the routine at a party, Reiner said Steve Allen insisted they turn their banter into a record. The album, “2000 Years with Carl Reiner and Mel Brooks,” appeared in 1960 and was the start of a million-selling franchise.

The duo won a Grammy in 1998 for their “The 2000 Year Old Man in the Year 2000” and Reiner won multiple Emmys for his television work. In 2000, he received the Kennedy Center Mark Twain Prize for Humor. When the sound system failed at the start of the ceremonies, Reiner called from the balcony, “Does anybody have four double-A batteries?”

Besides “All of Me,” Reiner directed Martin in “Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid,” “The Man With Two Brains” and “The Jerk.”

Reiner was the father of actor-director Rob Reiner, who starred as Archie Bunker's son-in-law on “All in the Family” and directed “When Harry Met Sally...” Rob Reiner said in a tweet Tuesday that his “heart is hurting. He was my guiding light.”

Carl Reiner was born in 1922, in New York City's Bronx borough, one of two sons of Jewish immigrants. He grew up in a working-class neighbourhood, where he learned to mimic voices and tell jokes. After high school, Reiner attended drama school, then joined a small theatre group.

During World War II, Reiner joined the Army and toured in GI variety shows for a year and a half. Back out of uniform, he landed several stage roles, breaking through on Broadway in “Call Me Mister.”

He married his wife, Estelle, in 1943. Besides son Rob, the couple had another son, Lucas, a film director, and a daughter, Sylvia, a psychoanalyst and author. Estelle Reiner, who died in 2008, had a small role in Rob Reiner's “When Harry Met Sally...” - as the woman who overhears Meg Ryan play-acting in a restaurant and says, “I'll have what she's having.”

Carl Reiner's greatest disappointment was “Bert Rigby, You're a Fool,” a 1989 musical he wrote and directed that starred Robert Lindsay, a British actor Reiner believed could be a new Dick Van Dyke. The film flopped, and Reiner's career as a director faded.

Reiner, inducted into the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences' Hall of Fame, remained involved in other entertainment projects. In the 1990s, he reprised the Alan Brady character for an episode of “Mad About You.”

His death was first reported Tuesday by celebrity website TMZ.

Guess they didn’t get the memo on social distancing, or we’ll assume they’re a family or a bubble that have been socializing together throughout COVID.

A group of six deer were spotted lounging in the front yard of a home near Black Sheep Pub Friday morning, about 10 a.m.

These girls and boys were caught resting and sleeping in the front yard shrubs, not far from the road, said photographer Colt McMyn, who couldn’t believe his eyes.

The four bucks and two does were snuggled together in the front yard of his great uncle Ron McMyn’s one-acre property on 128th Avenue.

Maple Ridge assistant fire chief Doug Armour passed away over the weekend from cancer. (THE NEWS-files)

Maple Ridge fire department is mourning the loss of assistant fire chief Doug Armour who passed away from cancer this past weekend.

Armour started with Maple Ridge Fire and Rescue in 2001 as a paid-on-call firefighter and received a career position in 2007. In 2015 he became a training officer for the department, and in July 2017 he began his new job as an assistant fire chief.

At the time, Armour said his new responsibilities would revolve around fire prevention.

“I’ll now be looking at inspections for residential and commercial buildings, and then I’m also in operations, so I’ll be looking after the trucks and equipment through all the halls,” he said in a 2017 interview.

Armour worked with his older brother, Stuart, for 17 years in the security alarm industry before he was hired full-time at the fire department.

“He was a fantastic guy,” said Stuart.

When the opportunity came, Armour quit the security industry without being hired and spent every waking hour at the fire hall to make sure they knew how badly he wanted to be part of the team, Stuart recounted.

It was a huge, life-changing decision, but it was the right one, added the elder sibling.

“You could tell that’s where he wanted to be. That became his life and it was either that or his family,” he noted.

Either Armour was spending time with his family at soccer games or ball hockey – or other activities his sons were involved in – or he was at the Justice Institute helping with training or working with new recruits, said Stuart.

Armour just celebrated his 20th wedding anniversary three weeks ago, two days before he drove himself to the hospital for what was supposed to be routine day surgery.

He drove there with his wife and her mother, who were going to pick him up after lunch.

However, Stuart said, there were complications that led to more complications and he was eventually diagnosed with cancer, that – it turned out – had been there for some time.

“The type of cancer that doesn’t show up until it was quite advanced,” Stuart explained.

“The one consolation is he didn’t know how sick he was and he didn’t suffer,” he added.

Armour’s family moved to Canada from Scotland in 1973, so Stuart said, they don’t have a lot of family here.

“The fire department was his other extended family,” his brother said.

Comments and condolences poured in on Facebook after a post announcing Armour’s death by the Maple Ridge firefighters union, IAFF 4449, on Sunday, July 12.

Stuart wrote on Facebook how proud he was to be his brother.

“So sad you have been taken away from us way too soon. I know you will find peace knowing that your immediate family and all your family in the fire service will make sure that you will never be forgotten and that the impact you have made on so many people will be remembered forever,” he said.

“We will stay strong and continue to live our lives like you would want us to. I love you brother. Say hi to Dad for me,” added Stuart.

Armour’s cousin Gary Bell wrote about how missed he will be, by so many.

“Not only were you an exceptional husband, father, friend, firefighter – you were an exceptional person. I loved all the times that we have had together from when I used to take you for car rides when you were little, to watching your career as a firefighter grow, and as you became both a husband and a father,” said Bell.

“You were an amazing person and you will be missed. I’m going to miss you cous and all our laughs together,” he said.

City of Maple Ridge Mayor Mike Morden released a statement on behalf of himself and council saying that Armour was a trusted member of the fire department who gave back to his community and served with honour and integrity.

“He brought a calm influence, perspective and a quick wit to those around him,” read the statement.

“Our hearts go out to Danica, Cade, Tavis, his family, friends, and fellow firefighters. He will certainly be missed by all, and we thank him for his service and dedication to our community,” the statement finished.

Online Morden posted personal comments about how Armour gave to the community and served with “honour and professionalism each and every day.”

“I’ve personally known the Armour boys for more than two decades, Doug left Stu and I to follow his passion in the fire service after working in the security industry. RIP Doug,” said the mayor.

“This is such sad news. My condolences to the Armour family. RIP Doug,” wrote Maple Ridge Councillor Judy Dueck.

“We are so incredibly saddened by this news. To assistant chief Armour’s family, and to all his brothers and sisters at City of Maple Ridge fire [department], please know you are in our thoughts and in our hearts,” the Ridge Meadows RCMP wrote.

“Heavy hearts today as we learned we’ve lost another fellow firefighter from our first responder family to cancer. We will take it from here Doug, rest easy sir,” said the BC Professional Fire Fighters.

Carmen Van Dop wrote what a kind and good man Armour was.

“May Danica and their boys be surrounded by love and support as they face these difficult days ahead. May we each honour Dougs memory by loving our families with the same intensity that Doug loved his. Rest easy Doug, you are loved,” wrote Van Dop.

In addition to his brother, Armour also leaves behind his 83-year-old mother Elizabeth Armour, wife Danica, and two sons, Tavis, 15, and Cade, 17.

Some Lower Mainland bottle depots have been overwhelmed during the pandemic, seeing huge lineups. (Black Press Media files)

Now that summer is officially here, British Columbians will be spending more time enjoying the outdoors.

And whether the activity is hiking or camping in the forest, soaking up the sun at the beach, hitting a bike trail, or simply relaxing on the patio, many will be cooling down with a refreshing beverage in a recyclable can.

That’s why Return-It is launching a suite of modernization initiatives that manage the province’s recycling system for beverage containers with refundable deposits, and it’s why Haney Bottle Depot has signed on to be part of one of those initiatives.

Specifically, they’ll be part of a six-month single-stream pilot program that enables consumers to return both alcohol and non-alcohol aluminum beverage cans together for recycling – without having to sort them. It is all done in one stream with one deposit amount.

READ MORE: B.C. Return-It to double recycling deposits for pop cans, juice boxes

This and other initiatives reflect feedback from consumers and put a clear focus on enhancing the Return-It recycling system to divert more material from our landfills, oceans, and waterways, said Allen Langdon, president and CEO of Return-It – a province-wide, not-for-profit product stewardship organization is also using new transportation technologies to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions associated with recycling.

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Return-It has been adapting and evolving its system by reducing touch points while improving convenience.

A series of other initiatives being rolled out this year to modernize the beverage container recycling system for a greener future will include:

· Expanding the number of Return-It Express Plus and solar-powered Express & GO contactless return stations around the province, including Vancouver Island, with new stations located in partnership with major retailers and shopping centres;

· Implementing a 10-cent unified deposit for all beverage containers – starting this fall – to simplify the overall system and make it even easier for consumers to recycle all their beverage containers – regardless of the size;

· Reducing greenhouse gas emissions through the implementation of a hybrid compaction truck that will reduce the number of vehicles used to transport containers for processing;

· Partnering with the Salvation Army to expand Return-It’s popular textiles collection program to safely drop off used clothing for recycling; and

· Introducing new automated sorting technologies and reverse-vending machines inside select Return-It depots to limit touch points in order to improve safety for depot employees and support the recycling experience.

“Even in these unprecedented times, British Columbians agree that recycling is important,” Langdon said.

“That’s why we are doing even more to help consumers easily return their empty beverage containers for recycling, with innovations that build on our success and provide new, convenient options for today’s busy lives.”

RELATED: Ridge Meadows recycling depot to relax car limit

Even as the COVID-19 pandemic has forced many into new routines, people can’t lose sight of the importance of maintaining good recycling habits, said Alison Wood, co-founder of Ocean Ambassadors Canada, an organization committed to turning the tide of marine pollution by empowering youth, creating ambassadors, and inspiring change.

“I applaud Return-It for finding new ways to help British Columbians return their beverage containers – safely and conveniently – so we can ensure they don’t end up in our oceans and waterways,” she said.

“It is great to see Return-It modernizing its system to make beverage container recycling more convenient for British Columbians,” said Brock Macdonald, CEO of the Recycling Council of BC. “These initiatives are a positive step forward in improving recovery rates and keeping material out of our landfills.”

Haney Bottle Depot is located at 22935 Lougheed Hwy.

971,"ARMS concerned proposed development along Alouette River will go to fourth reading

The Alouette River Management Society is frustrated they have heard nothing from the city about what is happening with a proposed residential development along the banks of the river.

“We’ve heard nothing,” said executive director of the local conservation group Greta Borick-Cunningham.

A letter was sent June 16 from ARMS president Ken Stewart addressed to the City of Maple Ridge mayor, councillors and CAO Al Horseman, asking where they were at in the process, but they have heard nothing back.

Specifically they wanted to know the city’s response following the submission of Eyford Partners solicitor Nathalie Baker’s legal opinion regarding the city’s handling of the development application – an opinion submitted on behalf of ARMS.

“We expected to get some response either way from the city’s solicitors back to our solicitors so we kind of knew did they agree or not agree with the contents of that letter,” explained Borick-Cunningham.

But, again, they heard nothing.

READ MORE: Maple Ridge conservation group takes legal action against city

Borick-Cunningham is concerned that it is now going on nine months that the city received their lawyer’s letter and they have had no response.

“We don’t know whether the city’s lawyers have discussed anything with the Mayor and council about this. What their recommendations are,” said Borick-Cunningham.

And she feels that the community deserves to know what the City of Maple Ridge’s legal advice is to the mayor and council on this issue based on their lawyer’s critique of that proposal’s process. Especially after a huge turnout to a public hearing that took place early last year.

The city, though, said they are unable to comment.

“As this item is a legal matter, the City and/or Mayor and Council are unable to engage or respond to any related inquiries,” wrote Tracy Camire, with the City of Maple Ridge, in an email on behalf of Mayor Mike Morden.

Right now ARMS is waiting for the “shoe to drop”, said Borick-Cunningham.

READ MORE: Cocooning pays dividends for local environmental group

“Either for best case scenario that the entire residential proposal is pulled and is not given fourth reading. Or it is sent back to the application process where they’ve found fault where the application process erred and then to redo those steps again and to go to another public hearing,” she noted.

However Borick-Cunningham and her team at ARMS are preparing for the worst case scenario – if the proposal goes through to a fourth reading, which would trigger ARMS to demand a judicial review.

They are currently raising money for their legal fees through their Save Our Salmon campaign, fees that are expected to cost the group upwards of $60,000.

So far they have raised about $31,000.

And they are calling on the city for full transparency.

“ARMS Board of Directors is officially asking that the city and our elected officials disclose the city’s legal response to the legal claims put forth by Ms. Baker on behalf of ARMS, prior to moving the application to 4th reading, as we believe it is a matter of public trust,” concluded Stewart in his letter to the city.

972,"Unjust harm can come from those close to biased ideas

Re: “Mayor recognizes we haven’t always dealt with racism well,” Progress Letters, July 2, 2020.

While research has shown that infants demonstrate an innate preference for adults of their own race, any future racist tendencies generally are environmentally acquired.

One way of rectifying this bias is by allowing young children to become accustomed to other races in a harmoniously positive manner.

Adult racist sentiments, however, are often cemented by a misguided yet strong sense of entitlement, perhaps also acquired from rearing.

Fortunately, at an impressionably young age I was emphatically told by my mother about the exceptionally kind and caring nature of our Black family doctor.

She never had anything disdainful to say about people of colour. In fact, she loves to watch/listen to the Middle Eastern and Indian subcontinental dancers and musicians on the multicultural channels. She only saw/sees what is in one’s heart.

Conversely, if she’d told me the opposite about the doctor, et cetera, I could’ve aged while blindly linking his colour with an unjustly cynical view of him and all Black people.

When angry, my (late) father occasionally expressed displeasure with Anglo immigrants, largely due to his own experiences with bigotry as a new Canadian citizen in the 1950s and ’60s.

Like mom he emigrated from Eastern Europe and didn’t resent non-white immigrants, for he realized they had things at least as bad. Plus he noticed – as I also now do – in them an admirable absence of a sense of entitlement.

Thus essentially by chance I reached adulthood unstricken by uncontrolled feelings of racial contempt seeking expression.

Not as lucky, some people – who may now be in an armed authority capacity – were raised with a distrust or blind dislike of other racial groups.

The first step towards changing our irrationally biased thinking is our awareness of it and then its origin.

But until such progress, racist sentiments must be either suppressed or professionally dealt with, especially when considering the mentality is easily inflamed by anger. For, great harm can come to those unjustly exposed to the racism, including the racists’ own susceptible young children.

974,"As of Thursday, Lyft is now offering service throughout Metro Vancouver

Another ridesharing company has expanded to include service in Maple Ridge and Pitt Meadows. (Lyft/Special to The News)

Another ridesharing company has moved further east into Pitt Meadows and Maple Ridge today.

On Thursday, July 9, Lyft announced the expansion of service, claiming to hear from both riders and drivers that there’s a “significant appetite” for the service not only in these communities, but also in eastern Langley, the Belcarra area, Lions Bay, and Bowen Island.

Pitt Meadows Mayor Bill Dingwall and Maple Ridge Mayor Mike Morden both said they’re keen to see the additional transportation option available for local residents.

“Pitt Meadows residents have been eagerly awaiting ridesharing in our community, and I’m pleased to say that day has come with Lyft now launching here,” Dingwall said.

“Ridesharing helps to reduce impaired driving by providing a safe and convenient way home. It is also yet another transportation option for residents to travel and a welcomed service to our city,” added the retired Mountie turned mayor.

As B.C. continues to re-open amid COVID, Metro Vancouverites are more inclined to explore the area again, believes Ted Lee of Tourism Vancouver.

And that’s been substantiated, Lyft’s B.C. general manager Peter Lukomskyj.

Since the beginning of Phase 2, he said the company has seen rides to restaurants and bars increase by more than 500 per cent and trips to public transport and ferry terminals double, indicating people are looking to move around the region, Lukomskyj said.

“At Lyft, we’re thrilled to become the first rideshare company to serve all of Metro Vancouver. While we’re all staying closer to home this summer, we have an opportunity to really explore what our region has to offer. We’re looking forward to being a reliable, responsible, and convenient way for all Metro Vancouverites to move around our beautiful backyard,” he added.

“It’s great to see another transportation option for our citizens being launched today,” Morden said.

“Our council has been committed to ensuring that rideshare companies are able to operate with the collaborative regional approach to licensing. Congratulations to Lyft for this exciting announcement.”

Riders and drivers must self-certify that they will wear face masks throughout the ride, are symptom-free, and will follow health officials’ guidance related to COVID-19.

For more information, including inquiries about becoming a driver, people can also visit the Lyft website.

Benito Tuyor is an LPN at Ridge Meadows Hospital who was recently thanked for exceptional care to a patient. (Special to The News)

Benito Tuyor is a bit of a fixture on the 3 North medical ward at Ridge Meadows Hospital, and his efforts for going above and beyond were recently acknowledged by a patient and hospital, alike.

Tuyor – who has worked at the Ridge Meadows Hospital since 2009 (two years as a care aide and since 2011 as a licenced practical nurse) was singled out as a Caregiving Angel.

Often a patient is grateful for the care that they receive and they want to do something to say thanks, explained Debbie Kennedy, with the Ridge Meadows Hospital Foundation.

Such was the case recently, when Tuyor was lauded for his efforts.

“A donation was made in Benito’s honour for his outstanding care and compassion, and for being there for the patient and their family,” Kennedy said.

RELATED: Patients given way to say thanks to outstanding hospital staff in Maple Ridge

The foundation has developed a program whereby people can acknowledge a staff member who does that little extra, and Tuyor was the latest to be recognized, Kennedy said.

By making a donation to the hospital, the person saying thank you not only expresses gratitude to the institution, but more importantly the individual Caregiving Angel, who receives a special angel pin and a letter honouring them from the foundation, Kennedy explained.

983,"LETTER: 40 people turned out to thank Barbara Duncan for her contribution to the arts in Maple Ridge

Dear Editor,

The community is celebrating Barbara Duncan, curator of the ACT Art Gallery.

Many of you may not know that the art gallery and the gallery store at The ACT were closed and its curator Barbara Duncan and her assistant Susan Thompson were fired by the arts council in late April, a mere five weeks into the lockdown of the COVID19 pandemic.

The gallery as we have always known it, is now referred to as the gallery space.

The arts council has never publicly admitted that they fired the curator.

In May, two high profile articles in The News featured the financial disaster the ACT was experiencing, but there was no mention of closing the gallery and firing Barbara Duncan.

The subsequent press releases from the arts council are cloaked around the pandemic creating a financial disaster.

RELATED LETTER: Board defends tough decisions ahead for arts centre

This decision has been kept from the public.

Consistent reference to the incident as a personnel matter that couldn’t be discussed, raised questions regarding Barbara’s competence or whether she was charged with something unlawful and this speculation has resulted in harming her reputation.

In a letter I received from the executive director, Curtis Pendleton, she stated that, “Barbara has done exemplary work in our community in her position as curator and she will be missed.”

Why would an employee who has done exemplary work be suddenly fired?

The arts council is effectively standing by and watching the fallout after they lit the bomb!

A 1,250 strong petition has been presented to the arts council and city council requesting a reinstatement of Barbara Duncan. An impressive result considering that not many people knew about it and was collected within a two-week period during a pandemic.

If the arts council had appealed to the public for support to keep the gallery and retain their their employees, I am certain the community would have responded generously.

They showed no confidence that the community would choose to save the gallery. However, taking this unilateral step ensured that the community would have no input nor be given the opportunity to keep this valuable cultural asset alive.

Instead of cutting two jobs, everyone could have agreed to take a pay cut or cut back on work days. But perhaps there always was a different plan before the pandemic and a perfect opportunity presented itself.

I felt proud to have such a professional be in charge of the many facets that a high quality gallery demands and I am requesting a thorough review by a third-party investigator to see if all the proper procedures were followed, if all other avenues to save the gallery were explored and whether the two employees were compensated for their sudden dismissal and given due process financially.

It is a publicly funded organization and this decision has made the public lose trust in this arts council. They have forgotten that they are accountable to the public. I feel the arts council owes Barbara and the community an honest explanation, and perhaps we can start there.

RELATED LETTER: What’s happening to key staff at The ACT?

On the sunny June 19, 40 supporters of the art community organized a surprise car and heart parade to honour Barbara Duncan. It should be noted that so many others wanted to attend, but we respected the provincial guidelines regarding large gatherings.

Barbara was our curator for 10 years and in that time, she built an exciting, well respected gallery, which was known for its support of local artists, professional artists and artisans, as well as featuring both contemporary and unique exhibitions.

She was the face of gallery, always respectful, innovative, and open to ideas.

The community did not want Barbara to disappear without a heartfelt appreciation within the park grounds outside of the ACT.

It was not a rally nor a demonstration, but a public celebration in recognition of Barbara’s support of our community and showcasing artists in their best light.

The arts community and its supporters wanted to honour and thank Barbara by giving her a warm, genuine, and joyful send off to remember the community of Maple Ridge by, because June 19 would otherwise be only remembered as a very sad day for Maple Ridge.

Betty von Hardenberg, Maple Ridge

987,"It’s July 1, and as Canadians we have so much to celebrate

Canada Day, on July 1, is typically a day for people across the country to gather for festivities and to feel good about our nation.

But this year, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the traditional celebrations cannot go ahead as planned.

In an effort to slow the spread of the pandemic, physical distancing regulations are in effect and gatherings of more than 50 people are prohibited. This means gatherings in the park and other festivities cannot proceed. Public events must be scaled down, at least for this year.

But Canada Day is not just about getting together for a flag-raising ceremony, a barbecue, and a piece of national birthday cake.

Instead, this is a day to feel good about this country where we live. It is a day to appreciate the things that make Canada a special place.

There is a lot to celebrate about Canada.

This is the place we call home. This is where we belong.

Some have deep ties to this land, going back many centuries. These connections must be respected and appreciated.

Many have family stories of how our parents, grandparents, or an earlier generation chose to come to this country to escape oppressive regimes, poverty or violence.

Some among us have made this choice themselves.

Some can appreciate the freedom to live as who they are, or the freedom to follow their religious beliefs.

These freedoms do not exist in all parts of the world.

And even when we disagree with trends or decisions, we are able to voice our disagreements. We have the right to hold contrary opinions. This is not a universal right.

For these reasons and more, there is plenty worth celebrating on Canada Day. In fact, there is a lot for each of us to celebrate, on July 1 and throughout the year.

Whether you mark the day by celebrating with family, friends, or complete strangers via our new virtual realities, the team here at the Maple Ridge-Pitt Meadows News wants to take this moment to wish you the very best for July 1 and the year ahead.

Whatever you have planned today, please take this sentiment with you.

Know that your local news team – which is dedicated to bringing you information about our hometown of Maple Ridge & Pitt Meadows – is proud to have been part of this community for almost 40 years now and we are excited to continue serving you well into the future.

From our family, to yours, Happy Canada Day everyone!

Submit letters to the editor through our website, via email or in writing.

Dear Editor,

[RE: Get tough on crime but leave law abiding, registered gun owners alone, June 13, The News]

Mr. O’Brian spelled out quite clearly the implications of the Order In Council (OIC) firearm ban on legal firearm owners in his well-written letter, but there is a greater issue behind it.

That is the use of an Order In Council to pass such major, wide-sweeping legislation without parliamentary procedure and due process.

All 338 of our sitting MPs were elected by the people to represent all citizens in Canada.

This use of an OIC has robbed Canadians proper debate in the House of Commons and second reading in the Senate, thus denying Canadians due process in a fully functioning democracy.

On that basis alone, the use of the OIC tool must not be allowed to stand, for it sets a dangerous precedent.

If it is allowed to stand, what’s to stop future governments from using this tool to pass legislation to trample the rights of another group?

UNRELATED LETTER: Maple Ridge thrifter thrilled hospice store reopens

Will an Order In Council, for example, be used to enact mandatory euthanasia for anyone over, say, 85 years old, because they might be a burden to the healthcare system?

Impossible, you say?

I urge anyone reading this to revisit history, for things like this have happened before, and it would be incredibly naive to think it couldn’t happen again.

Disarming a population – from farmers, ranchers, sport shooter, and collectors – was proven to be the first step to some of the greatest human rights abuses in history by governments that have lost their way.

This use of an Order In Council, or, shall I say, abuse, was not just a slap in the face of democracy. It was a right cross, and Canadians need to remember the lessons of history in order to avoid repeating it.

Ridge Meadows RCMP are looking to the public for help identifying a pair of credit card scammers who targeted seven locations in May.

Police say two women completed fraudulent transactions in-and-around Maple Ridge from May 14-27.

Media relations officer, Const. Julie Klaussner, said investigators have exhausted all avenues in identifying the two suspects, so are hoping someone might recognize them by their pictures and descriptions.

Both women are white with dark hair, tied back into pony tails.

The first suspect was approximately 20-years old with a slim build. She was seen wearing large black sunglasses, a black t-shirt with turquoise sleeves, and black leggings.

She might have a tattoo on her right forearm, and was seen carrying a cross-body bag with red and green straps.

Suspect number two was sporting a pink and purple hoodie with brown boots, and was carrying a black purse.

Anyone who recognizes the women is asked to contact Const. Sam Ko of the Ridge Meadows RCMP at 604-463-6251 and reference file #2020-10569.

Racist graffiti was discovered in Memorial Peace Park on Sunday, July 12.

At least one historical plaque was damaged with black marker or crayon containing an expletive and the letters “Blck Lives”.

It is unclear if racist graffiti appeared elsewhere in the park.

“There was some graffiti on the bandstand and there has been the theft of some of the plaques, but the two things might not, and are likely not, be related,” said Valoree Richmond, director of parks and facilities for Maple Ridge Parks, Recreation & Culture.

RELATED: Windows broken, racist graffiti left on Okanagan home

Last week, as part of the regular maintenance of Memorial Peace Park, explained Richmond, a staff member noted that there was some graffiti markings on the bandstand on the concrete surface.

There were six markings in total, she said.

City staff began cleaning off the graffiti on Tuesday using a power-washer and returned on Wednesday to do an overall washing of the bandstand and the surrounding site.

RELATED: Maple Ridge BIA: Tagging doubled in downtown core

General clean-ups, said Richmond are part of the regular maintenance of the park and just had to be moved forward by one week because of the graffiti.

The removal of the dedication plaques is an ongoing issue and is separate from the graffiti.

Five plaques were reported missing last November, said Richmond, and in January, 12 went missing, which prompted a police file being opened up on the matter.

Currently staff are looking at options, in consultation with the Maple Ridge Concert Band Society, on a long term solution to recognize the contributions of donors rather than plaques that will reduce the opportunity for theft, said Richmond.

The graffiti was reported to the Ridge Meadows RCMP through their online reporting system by a Maple Ridge resident as mischief or theft under $5,000.

A BC SPCA staff member is shown rescuing a dog from a hot car. During the month of July, animal lovers are being encouraged to take a No Hot Pets pledge to keep their pets safe this summer and to warn others of the dangers of leaving animals in their vehicles. (BC SPCA photo)

The BC SPCA is asking pet owners to take a pledge this summer not to leave their animals in vehicles – for any length of time.

Every year the BC SPCA receives nearly 1,000 calls to rescue animals who have been left inside vehicles on hot days.

The No Hot Pets pledge will serve as a reminder to pet owners to keep their pets safe, as well as a warning to others of the dangers of leaving animals in vehicles.

It’s an issue in every single community, said Krista Shaw, manager of the Maple Ridge branch of the animal welfare organization.

“Dogs can pretty much expire in 10 minutes if left in a hot car,” said Shaw, adding that she thinks everybody should take the pledge.

Dr. Aman Preet with Meadowvale Animal Hospital in Pitt Meadows sees a few cases every year of dogs suffering from heatstroke.

If an animal is left in a car accidentally and may be suffering from some form of heatstroke, Preet suggested cooling down the animal by putting water on the paws and on the animals head.

Even spraying rubbing alcohol on the animal’s extremities, especially the paws, will help cool the animal down, noted Preet.

“But it is best to take the pet to the clinic because it could be life threatening,” she added.

Lorie Chortyk, general manager of communications for the BC SPCA, calls the death of a pet left in a hot car a completely preventable tragedy.

READ MORE: Adoptions skyrocket, emergency boarders up at Maple Ridge SPCA

“We know that people love their pets and would never knowingly put them in danger, but many pet guardians are just unaware of how quickly their pets can suffer when left in a vehicle in warm weather,” said Chortyk.

“Even parked in the shade, with windows cracked open, the temperatures inside a vehicle can become deadly,” she added.

Dogs don’t sweat like humans, so they can’t release heat from their bodies as quickly, meaning they can succumb to heatstroke and heat exhaustion in a short period of time, noted Chortyk, especially senior pets and those with flatter faces.

Signs of heat stroke, she said, include exaggerated panting, rapid or erratic pulse, salivating, anxious or staring expression, weakness or lack of coordinated, vomiting, convulsions and collapse.

READ MORE: Pets still being locked in hot vehicles, Maple Ridge SPCA

If you see a dog in a car in hot weather, the BC SPCA recommends taking the following steps:

• If the animal is showing clear signs of heatstroke or distress, call your local animal control agency, police, RCMP or the BC SPCA Call Centre at 1.855.622.7722. Do not attempt to break a window to rescue an animal – not only do you risk injuring the animal, but only RCMP, local police and BC SPCA Special Constables have the authority to enter a vehicle lawfully to help an animal.

• If the animal is not in distress, but you are concerned, note the license plate and vehicle description and ask managers of nearby businesses to page the owner to return to their vehicle immediately. You may wish to stay with the vehicle to monitor the situation until the owner returns.

“Even if you are just popping in for a minute to pick something up, even if you think you are only going to be two minutes and you parked in the shade and the windows are cracked, it’s still not appropriate to leave a dog in a car,” added Shaw.

So just leave your pets at home, she said.

A provincial summer impaired driving campaign has been underway since July 1, and Ridge Meadows RCMP are also carrying out Project Domino Effect, a local initiative which resulted in 553 impaired driving investigations in 2019.

Inspector Allison Good said although the program has bean considered a success – as there have been no deaths attributed to impaired driving since March 2019 – there is still work to be done to reduce the numbers of drunk drivers on local roads.

As a result of last months high numbers, three local constables have become part of Alexa’s team, a provincial program named in honour of four-year-old Alexa Middelaer, who was killed by an impaired driver in 2008.

The program recognizes officers who completed 12 impaired driving investigations in a year.

“The numbers speak for themselves and people need to know that police will be out there this summer looking to ensure our community stays safe.”

1010,"Golden Ears Provincial Park in Maple Ridge is one of B.C.’s busiest. (Tom Fletcher/Black Press)

A Maple Ridge woman wants to see a fair public consultation process over the reservation system for B.C. Parks.

Angela Dunne-Massey, who lives only 15 minutes away from Golden Ears Provincial Park, wants the system to change to include a portion of first-come, first-serve sites for the public.

“It is tremendously awful,” Dunne-Massey said of the current system.

She is angry that there is a lack of camping spots available at the park, but a lot of no-shows.

And she isn’t the only one to complain.

Kathie Rennie, who also lives 15 minutes outside the park said the system has taken the fun out of, “packing up on a whim and heading to go camping”.

READ MORE: ‘Unhappy campers’ protest booking system

And, she added, without first-come, first-serve she probably won’t go back to Golden Ears.

About two years ago Dunne-Massey started a petition to keep access open for first-come, first-serve campers that currently has 10,618 signatures.

“There should be a balance between the groups,” explained Dunne-Massey.

There are groups that can’t do reservations, she said, like seniors and health care workers, who can’t possibly know four months in advance if they are able to book a site.

And Dunne-Massey feels that based on Dr. Bonnie Henry’s recommendation about staying micro-local, B.C. Parks should have made all camping first-come, first-serve.

“But they didn’t do any of that,” she said.

READ MORE: B.C. residents can now reserve a provincial campsite for a stay starting June 1

Instead, campgrounds are empty, added Dunne-Massey, and, “people who are actually the taxpayers are not getting the benefit that they are supposed to be able to use”.

Dunne-Massey said her friends were at Golden Ears the last weekend of June. They had reserved their sites but noticed that there was no one at the sites around them. So they drove to the main booth where you pay for your spot and asked if they could purchase the sites for their friends, said Dunne Massey.

However they were told that the sites were booked.

But, said Dunne-Massey, for the five days they were there nobody showed up.

Dunne-Massey and her team – Lucien Campeau, Mel Turner, and Mike Babor – want a meeting with the Minister of Environment and Climate Change Strategy, George Heyman, who oversees B.C. Parks.

They were supposed to meet with him in March but the meeting was cancelled due to COVID-19.

“I’m not saying we need 100 per cent, I’m saying we need a portion of it,” said Dunne-Massey of having first-come, first-serve spots.

“I think that as taxpayers we should have access to a park, especially when it is 15 minutes down the street.”

Dear Mr. Andrew Wilkinson, and members of the BC Liberal caucus:

I was very disappointed by the apology… because you dared to advertise in a Christian publication. That is a reason to apologize?

You have been bullied and you have surrendered. The LGBTQ community will call us homophobes and accuse us of the very actions they are taking to persecute and bully us for our beliefs and our faith.

And the destruction of our families and our society as we have known it is happening and we have closed our eyes.

The distraction of COVID-19, climate change, riots and ‘racial inequality’ are not the real problems we face.

The real problem is a lack of will to stand up for moral values, to love and respect all people equally, and have the courage to stick to our moral values, while loving and respecting those who accuse and persecute us.

I am not condemning the LGBTQ community nor do I judge or persecute them. They too are my brothers and sisters.

The attacks by the LGBTQ community and those who have a ‘progressive’ agenda – stealing the minds of our children in our schools; the purposeful and treasonous attacks of extremists both ‘right’and ‘left’ on our values and religious ideals, and especially the consistent attacks on our families and family values, are leading to destruction.

The Communist Manifesto states that the Communist goal is to destroy the family, the church and the state.

We are in crisis and I pray that you will stand up for all our freedoms in this province and not exclude religious people. That is what your apology did.

That is persecution of those who have Christian, or Jewish, or Hindu or Islamic values, which are strong, healthy families which will lead to a strong healthy society.

I hope you have the courage to respond to all the people of British Columbia.

The Fraser Valley Regional Library (FVRL) has been bringing virtual story times to Chilliwack for the past few months, but an upcoming one will be a lot more colourful than all the others.

In celebration of Fraser Valley Pride week (July 10 to 18) Chilliwack librarians Julie Penner and Janet Woyke have put together a pride story time and craft video.

“The library is a place of promoting diversity and inclusion of all people,” Penner said.

This isn’t the first video they’ve worked on together where Penner reads stories and Woyke teaches a craft or activity.

For the special pride video, Penner will be reading from the book What makes us unique: Our first talk about diversity. It’s a Canadian children’s picture book by Dr. Jillian Roberts.

“It’s actually very beautiful. It talks about all the different people in the world and how we all need love and we all need kindness,” Penner said. “It’s just such a nice message overall.”

The story is geared towards preschoolers, but elementary kids can also learn from it, she added.

When the story is finished, Woyke will show kids how to make rainbow-coloured friendship bracelets.

She will describe how to make three different styles of bracelets using a forward knot, a half-hitch knot and a simple braid for younger kids.

They filmed the video in the rainbow crosswalk at the University of the Fraser Valley on June 26. When Penner and Woyke reached out to UFV, not only were they happy to let the two onto university property, but they also blocked the road and provided security.

“We’re really thankful to UFV,” Penner said.

The pride story time comes on the heels of their ‘Explorytime’ project.

Penner describes Explorytime as “story times on the go” and it is part of the FVRL’s Summer Reading Club program.

The first Explorytime was a fairy-themed video where Penner and Woyke got dressed up in woodland fairy costumes to read a story and show kids how to make a magic wand, fairy crown and fairy dolls.

It was filmed in the River’s Edge Fairy Village near the Vedder River and released on June 25 on the Chilliwack, Sardis and Yarrow FRVL Facebook pages as well as on the FVRL YouTube channel.

Future Explorytimes include bird-watching at the Great Blue Heron Nature Reserve and “sky-watchers” filmed at the Dark Sky Park (McDonald Park) in Abbotsford.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, FVRL has been offering virtual story times, baby times, podcasts and how-to videos for teens and adults.

Although the pride story time is not an official Explorytime video, it’s in the same style where kids get a story plus a craft in the seven-minute long video.

It’s also a great way for kids to learn about diversity, something that is near to Penner’s heart.

Her interest in the LGBTQ community came a number of years ago when she did a research project while studying at the University of the Fraser Valley around 2008. Her project was on LGBTQ elders living in seniors homes and the abuse they had suffered.

“I cried so many times. I could not believe the abuse that was happening to these older people,” she recalled.

Now she and Woyke are teaching kids at a young age about the importance of acceptance and kindness.

“It’s one of my core beliefs that all people should be free to be themselves and to love whomever they choose,” Penner said.

The pride story time video will be released on Tuesday, July 14 at 10:30 a.m. You can find it on the FVRL’s main Facebook page; the Facebook pages of the Chilliwack, Sardis and Yarrow libraries; and the FVRL YouTube channel.

1022,"The event will be held in mid-August at the Chilliwack Golf Club

The Chilliwack Sports Hall of Fame and Chilliwack Ringette Association are holding a golf tournament fundraiser in August.

The Chilliwack Ringette Association and the Chilliwack Sports Hall of Fame (CSHOF) have teamed up to host a fundraiser golf tournament at the Chilliwack Golf Club August 17. Proceed from the event will be shared between both non-profit societies, which work year-round to promote sport in Chilliwack.

The Chilliwack Sports Hall of Fame recognizes and promotes sporting excellence in Chilliwack through annual inductions and displays.

The Chilliwack Ringette Association has 70 members who play, coach and volunteer.

“Working together allows our groups to pool resources and to deliver an event that goes beyond raising money for sport, but also allows us to come together as a sports community and a ringette family,” said Chilliwack Ringette president Mike Kinar. “Our association will not be able to do our usual fundraising events this season due to the pandemic, so every little bit we raise will help us continue to provide a low-cost team ice sport for the community.”

The partnership formed as both societies look for ways to engage their members during the challenging times of the pandemic.

“Golf is one of the few sports that we can participate in from a safe distance from one another right now” said CSHOF president Shannon Bettles. “Our society had to postpone this year’s induction event. The golf tournament provides an opportunity to put our volunteers to work promoting the Hall of Fame and local sports organizations. We want to help create a fun event where people can get outdoors, make memories, and support one another.”

The tournament will follow all of the safety guidelines of the provincial health officer, as well as the Chilliwack Golf Club. First tee times start at 10:30 a.m.

Registration for the tournament is available through the Chilliwack Sports Hall of Fame and Chilliwack Ringette Association websites.

1028,"Restoration now complete on seven pioneer grave markers vandalized in April

Headstone repairs have finally been completed at Surrey Centre Cemetery.

After seven grave markers were vandalized in April, the City of Surrey started repairing the more than 100-year-old tombstones.

Now with the work done, Sue Bryant, a member of the Surrey Historical Society, said she was delighted with the effort.

“We can’t say enough of how well the City of Surrey’s cemetery division took care of the repairs—and even fixed a few more that were in need,” Bryant said, on behalf of the historical society. “Overall, it was quite a good job.”

Laurie Cavan, the general manager of the Parks, Recreation, and Culture department, told the Cloverdale Reporter in April the repair work was done in an effort to restore the grave markers in such a way that they would retain their historic appearance.

“To prevent future vandalism, the repaired monuments will be fastened with a metal rod through the monument into its base,” Cavan said at the time. “It is rare for historic monuments in Surrey to be defaced or damaged by acts of vandalism.”

The vandalized markers—nearly all one metre or taller in height—were all located in the pioneer section of the cemetery.

At the time, Michael Gibbs, president of the Surrey Historical Society, wondered, given the profile of the pioneers, the historical value of the pioneer section, and its century-old markers, if security cameras were an answer to prevent further acts of vandalism.

Bryant said she’ll be resuming her cemetery history walks this summer beginning with a paranormal walk hosted by Gypsy Moon.

“I’ll be leading one at the end of July, with social distancing measures in place.”

She said the July walking tour is already full, but there will be another one in September. The details for the September walking tour will be posted on the Museum of Surrey’s website in the coming weeks.

“I’ve been busy behind the scenes researching more stories to share on these walks as well, so they should be even better than ever.”

A Go Fund Me campaign has been launched to help a family of seven who lost their home to this fire in Whalley on Tuesday, June 23, which Surrey firefighters tackled at 103rd Avenue and 143rd Street. (Contributed photo: Rick Chapman)

It is comforting to know that, in cases of personal tragedy and extreme adversity, not only family and friends but also complete strangers are more than willing to help you.

Three recent local tragedies come to mind.

On June 1, Jasvinder Singh Riar, age 31, died at work, at the Canadian National Railway’s Thornton Yard in North Surrey, leaving behind his wife, his nine-month-old son, and his mother, paternal grandmother and sister. That was one mighty responsibility he shouldered, being the sole provider for his family.

But at this time of writing, 866 donors have contributed $96,959 through a GoFundMe campaign online, toward helping his family.

READ ALSO: Go Fund Me campaign for family of CN rail worker who died at Thornton Yard in Surrey

This past Sunday, which happened to be Father’s Day, tragedy struck another local family when Surrey realtor Kashif Sheikh, 46, drowned while trying to save his daughter who had slipped into a creek near a waterfall in the Okanagan.

Sheikh leaves behind a wife and four children.

By Wednesday morning, 939 donors to a GoFundMe campaign had raised $95,230 to help Sheikh’s family.

Of course, no amount of money will ever replace these two men. But the money being raised in their memory will surely help take some of the burden off their survivors, who are undoubtedly suffering from the shock, confusion and grief that is particular to sudden and unexpected deaths.

Now, a third local fundraising initiative has been launched to help a Surrey family of seven whose home was destroyed in a fire on Tuesday in Whalley.

The fact that strangers, some of whom can ill afford it, will help others in times of need serves to remind us that ultimately none of us are really alone.

And we can all take some comfort in that.

1032,"It’s shocking that during COVID-19, dog owners carry on as usual, disregarding laws that don’t suit them

Submitted photos taken from March 23 to May 1 in Surrey show dog owners allowing their dogs to roam and play – and even do their business on – using sports fields, despite signs clearly stating dogs are prohibited.

The Editor,

Dogs are prohibited on athletic fields everywhere to protect the health and welfare of the athletes who use the fields. Why do dog owners purposefully disregard the welfare of those athletes and others who use the fields for their intended purpose?

It’s shocking that during the COVID-19 crisis, when people are expected to raise their social consciousness and take actions to protect the health of other people, that dog owners carry on as usual, disregarding laws that don’t suit them.

Dog owners who use athletic fields for their own private off-leash dog park and dog toilet, are breaking municipal laws. I see more than 35 dogs a week on the South Surrey Athletic fields at 20th and 148 Street. Things are as bad or worse at Sunnyside Park. Thirty-five dogs equal 35 piles of defecated excrement on the fields and and urine everywhere.

I know people think it is convenient to use the local sports field, that driving to the dog park adds unnecessary carbon to global warming, and that their dog is perfect. But owning a dog carries responsibilities to the environment, to your city and to other people.

We don’t spread human waste on sports fields or send it to the landfill for obvious reasons. Dog turds are worse.

Obey the laws and leave the athletic fields to the athletes.

A Brown, Surrey

1033,"It’s horrible to break into a school at any time, let alone during a pandemic, to steal equipment children need.

Equipment police say was stolen from Surrey schools. (Surrey RCMP photo)

Once again, we are confronted with the good, the bad, and the ugly.

First, the good. It’s heartening that, despite the risk and fear generated by this pandemic, volunteers such as those at Whalley’s City Centre Church have nevertheless stepped up to make more than 10,000 bag lunches for people in need of a break, at Surrey Urban Mission.

The selflessness of such sandwich slingers is, shall we say, soul-inspiring.

READ ALSO: Surrey church bags sandwich number 10,000, served with love

READ ALSO: One man charged after Surrey schools hit with 20 break-and-enters

Second, there is the bad and the ugly. The following covers both categories.

Year-round, we are confronted with examples of loathsome behaviour.

People who steal money from poppy trays during Remembrance Day, people who run off with Salvation Army donation kettles at Christmas time, people who taint candies at Halloween. Behaviour both ugly, and bad.

It’s unconscionable that someone would break into a school at any time, let alone during a pandemic, to steal equipment that children need.

But 20 counts of breaking into schools?

That’s no one-off ‘mistake,’ hopefully to be remedied by an attack of conscience. Nor is it an act of down-and-out desperation, nor mischief.

It’s a career choice, and a bad one at that.

Bad, and ugly.

Thankfully, people who choose to do good instead help push that pendulum back in the right direction, which makes their work all the more profound.

Those who prey on others must live with themselves.

1034,"Melvyn Mani (right) and mentor Jerry Gunadasa were connected through a Surrey Crime Prevention Society program. (submitted photo)

A Surrey Crime Prevention Society program that helped Melvyn Mani become an award-winning volunteer has been relaunched with funding of $150,000 through grants, sponsorships and private donations.

The organization’s Community Safety Mentorship Program pairs mentors with vulnerable youth who may be experiencing bullying or isolation.

Mani was one such teen five years ago when he first met Jerry Gunadasa, a volunteer and trained mentor with SCPS who was studying criminal justice at the time.

Both mentor and mentee sought careers in policing.

Back in 2015, Mani was struggling to fit in at high school. He ended up valedictorian of his grad class and today, at age 23, works at an electronics company and studies at Kwantlen Polytechnic University.

“Jerry was there through the rough patches,” Mani recalled. “Jerry motivated me to prepare for a career in policing and worked with me to secure a spot in the prestigious RCMP Youth Citizens Academy.”

(Story continues below video)

Mani was recently given the Pursuit of Excellence Award by Surrey Crime Prevention Society for his volunteer work in the Citizens Community Safety Watch Program.

“He’s come a long way,” Gunadasa said of Mani. “When he started off in the program he was pretty shy and timid and really closed off. It took a while for him to open up to me, and I was able to share a lot of my knowledge about policing with him.”

Surrey Crime Prevention Society announced the relaunch of its mentorship program on Tuesday (July 7).

“We are profoundly grateful for the generosity of our donors and sponsors,” said Karen Reid Sidhu, executive director of SCPS. “This program will support vulnerable youth while engaging them in activities that help them develop a sense of civic pride in their community.”

Since 1984, the volunteer-based Surrey Crime Prevention Society has backed community safety programs in Surrey. Today, SCPS has 350 volunteers, most of them university and high school students. Over the past five years, 1,600 volunteers contributed 145,000 hours toward the enhancement of community safety. More details are posted to preventcrime.ca, or call 604-502-8555.

The organization’s annual awards event for 2020 has been cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

This year’s Volunteer of the Year is Darren Brierley, who joined Surrey Crime Prevention Society in March of 2019. Since then, he has volunteered close to 350 hours of his time. “He participates in multiple programs including Citizens Community Safety Watch, Special Events and Traffic Safety,” according to a bio.

“Darren continues to demonstrate strong leadership, professionalism and has a can do attitude. He is reliable and always here to support programs above and beyond his program requirements. Darren leads new volunteers providing them with mentorship ensuring they are following proper procedures. His problem solving skills are superior and is capable of handling difficult situations that arise in his roles. SCPS is very fortunate to have such a dedicated volunteer.”

Other SCPS volunteer awards have been given to Samantha Mitchell, Kushal Patel, Amandeep Brar, Rob Gelderman, Gazaldeep Cheema, Anny Zhang, Amritvir Singh, Jasjot Sandhu, Manveer Rai and Simone Saini.

1037,"KITCHENER -- Pride Month has come and gone, but Wilmot Township raised the Rainbow Flag for the first time on Friday.

Councillors hope that this will be a positive new chapter for the township after experiencing a fair share of controversy over the past few weeks.

They're hoping that, by raising the Pride Flag, they'll be delivering a sign of acceptance and inclusion in a community that appears divided.

Council stood united at Castle Kilbride as they raised the flag at 11 a.m. Friday.

Coun. Jennifer Pfenning brought forward the motion on June 22, and it was unanimously approved by council on July 13.

Near the end of June, the statue of Sir John A. Macdonald, which is located just steps away from the new Pride Flag, was repeatedly vandalized amid calls for its removal.

Pfenning says she hopes this ceremony will continue to encourage respectful dialogue in the community.

""We are having very difficult conversations right now but they need to happen. Difficult conversations are not bad, they're necessary—without them, we can't ever moving anything forward,"" she explains.

""The key is to remain respectful and to understand where the other person is coming from.""

Members of the LGBTQ2+ community who gathered for the ceremony says the flag is a step in the right direction.

People at a “Keep the RCMP in Surrey” rally outside city hall on Monday, July 13. (submitted photo)

Close to 100 people rallied to keep the RCMP in Surrey on Monday (July 13).

The event was staged outside city hall as Surrey council met remotely, in another virtual meeting.

“Great evening at Surrey City Hall protesting the Mayor’s vanity SPD (Surrey Police Department),” Ramona Kaptyn posted to Facebook.

“Many many Surreyites turned out supporting #keepthercmpinsurreybc,” wrote Kaptyn, president of the Surrey/White Rock chapter of CARP (Canadian Association of Retired Persons).

“Our ‘honking’ cars circled City Hall, people waved at us from the street and from their vehicles. One supporter was on a recumbent bike and several RCMP vehicles in the area sounded their sirens and gave us a thumbs-up.”

Photos of the rally were posted to social media.

(Story continues below)

On June 29, the provincial Ministry of Public Safety and Solicitor General announced the members of Surrey’s new police board, as part of the city’s transition from the RCMP to a municipal police department.

The board will be responsible for “setting the direction and strategic priorities” of the Surrey Police Department, to replace the Surrey RCMP.

A next step in the City of Surrey’s transition plan will be for the new board to hire a chief constable.

In 2018, Surrey city council voted unanimously to terminate their agreement with the RCMP and transition to a municipal police department.

1040,"North Delta History and Heritage was researched and written by members of the Delta Heritage Society

North Delta History and Heritage is a labour of love researched and written by a dozen members of the Delta Heritage Society’s North Delta Advisory Group. (James Smith photo)

A new book penned by a local history group explores North Delta’s past, tracing the community’s roots from the site of Indigenous fishing camps, through early settlement by European (and other) pioneers and into modern times.

The recently released North Delta History and Heritage is a labour of love researched and written by a dozen members of the Delta Heritage Society’s North Delta Advisory Group. The 190-page book offers a first-of-its-kind look at the history of the various communities that now comprise North Delta, including numerous photographs — many seldom seen before — and both single-page and pull-out maps to help readers put the past into context today.

Local historian John Macdonald, who edited the book and contributed to its writing, said readers might be surprised to learn how far back the history of the area goes.

“[When] most people think of the history of North Delta they think … it started with Annieville, and it did in a way, but it started long, long before the Norwegians got there, and of course the First Nations people have been here for thousands of years,” said Macdonald, who has written several articles about local history and authored the book Kennedy’s Trail: Past to Present.

“There’s never been a book like this on North Delta, and because of the history of Delta a lot of things tend to be Ladner-centric. That’s why I think it’s been so well received.”

The book’s initial printing of 200 copies in May sold out in just 10 days, and fewer than 75 copies remain of the book’s 300-copy second printing in mid-June. A third printing of 300 copies will be coming soon.

“We’ve had people take one, get as far as their car and come back and get another one. So I’ve started saying to people, ‘Are you sure you don’t want more than one?’” Macdonald said.

The book features several maps and aerial photographs to help readers orient themselves with the North Delta that was, and navigate the past in the here-and-now.

“There’s so much you can miss. My wife and I have driven all over Delta exploring places, but some places you just don’t notice.”

For example, people may not realize the reason 112th Street takes a turn at 90th Avenue is because the land in the area was pre-empted by early settler James Kennedy before the government survey in 1873 that laid the groundwork for the orderly grid of streets seen elsewhere in North Delta and Surrey.

“In 1861, the provincial government allowed people to go out and pre-empt land, which means driving a stake in the ground — or four stakes in the ground — and that’s what happened in Annieville. That’s what James Kennedy did and others along there, all the way from 96th [Avenue] all the way to Burns Bog.”

“The back of Kennedy’s lot became 114th [Street] at an angle, and the same with a little piece of 90th [Avenue] that jogs down to River Road there. That was the edge of Kennedy’s property, and that was where Kennedy’s Trail came up.”

Copies of North Delta History and Heritage are available for $20 (tax included) by contacting John Macdonald at johnmac609@gmail.com.

1043,"‘I didn’t choose this country as “my home and native land” but I’m so thankful I was born a Canadian’

I didn’t have any choice to be born white or brown and neither did you.

United States President Donald Trump didn’t choose not to be born Black or anything else. The people of our countries are diverse in colour.

People who are rioting are not addressing the underlying problem, and governments on most levels have not addressed or dealt with it correctly.

People are hurting and dying because they want to be heard and start change in society. This is no excuse for violence. Burning cities, looting someone’s livelihood and destroying the economy for any reason does not “right the problem.” It is hoped peaceful protests will.

I didn’t choose this country as “my home and native land” but I’m so thankful I was born a Canadian – a second generation person growing up in Chilliwack. I have not had to live under oppression like some of our neighbours have experienced. It must be difficult, but rioting is not the answer.

Stay safe and be kind.

1044,"As the Chilliwack Progress reported, MP Mark Strahl had some harsh words to say about the announcement by the prime minister and his officials banning the sale of military-type arms to private individuals.

The action was at long last brought to the fore by the recent event in Nova Scotia, but this issue has been discussed by Canadians over many decades. And so, after much consultation prior to the last election and acutely in recent days, a federal government finally took action.

I couldn’t disagree with Strahl’s words more. There is nothing “cowardly” or “underhanded” about doing what a majority of Canadians have wanted for a long time, that is the elimination of firearms capable of mass murder. It comes as no surprise that a Conservative MP along with his party and now today the ignorant words of a Tory candidate for the Conservative leadership would accuse their own government of malfeasance.

Now, I completely understand that Mr. Strahl would want to curry favour with his base.

I am positive that there is seething anger in gun shops over this ban, but the inescapable truth is that legal gun owners and hunters, even those that go to our nice shooting range, do not think that assault-style weapons should be in civilian hands. As for the problem of guns coming into Canada from mainly the U.S., I agree that a lot more should be done to interdict these illegal weapons.

Some research into Mr. Strahl’s public statements shows no propensity on his or even his party’s part when in power, to budget enough funds for stricter border enforcement, nor does one find strong statements from Strahl advocating for more punitive jail terms for those who own illegal handguns or those who commit crimes with their use.

I wonder if this MP has been lobbying the provincial government to enact more severe punishments for illegal hand gun use?

Illegal hand guns can be obtained easily in Mr. Strahl’s riding.

They have been used here. They are regularly found mixed with drugs, money, knives and other dangerous items in homes right here in Chilliwack.

It is time for Mr. Strahl to begin at long last to advocate to the proper authorities, at least in this province, for a complete rethinking of the effects of illegal firearms. His rhetoric may save lives and help our society which is one of his jobs.

So, perhaps a little less indignation for political purposes and a lot more positive action would be a way forward for this MP.

One can continue to hope.

Remember we elect our official to work for us!

Thank you for publicizing your views. They are indicative of the problems we face here locally, where poisonous ideals and white privileges have been fostered and fed so well that they might be so articulately regurgitated by people like yourself.

It has been a problem in this town since my grandfather collonial-strolled into it more than 120 years ago.

This underbelly of outdated viewpoints, flawed since inception, has grown unchallenged due to the socioeconomic climate contained within. It’s bad for business, bad for politics, bad for safety to challenge or criticize the local extremist ideology and so it’s seldom done. When progression is ventured, as it was ever so mildly by Mayor Ken Popove, it is met with a white backlash only comparable to deep southern states or South Africa.

You use several terms that indicate you have researched support for ideals and feelings that you already held. It is a tragic commonality to all of the well-articulated letters.

Your argument is so ridiculously outdated and ill-informed that trying to educate you on any of your points would be akin to explaining calculus to a seven-year-old. They must be intended to elicit the support of other local racist extremists.

Your letter is an abhorrent encapsulation of why we need leaders like Mayor Popove to take the small incremental steps this enclave of racism and homophobia will allow.

I implore co-operation and togetherness but there is no starting point for commentary like this. These views will never make this area a better part of Canada for our indigenous, minority or LGBTQ citizens. Citizens who contribute to the community equally but receive no equal regard. These views will never allow for sociological growth or social justice or rich diversity. These views are dangerous. These views are wrong.

Thank you Mayor Popove. At first I felt you didn’t say enough, now I remember why you couldn’t say more.

This might sound harsh but it’s said out of love. Love for the beauty of this geographic location and genuine love for the people of my community. But it’s time to grow up now Chilliwack and take a stand against the continued fostering of these tragic ideals.

A Surrey man is celebrating after winning Lotto 6/49’s $1 million guaranteed prize on Canada Day.

Surinderpal Gill said he’s been playing the lottery since he came to Canada 26 years ago, adding he’ll always have fond memories about July 1.

“I checked at the self checker,” said Gill, who initially didn’t believe his ticket was a winner. “I told my son, and then I had to go to another gas station to make sure it was correct. After I told my wife, they both thought I was joking and didn’t believe me.”

He added that the win will allow him to “take a step back from work” and start his own business.

Along with starting a new business, Gill said he’ll be putting some of the money toward a new house he’s building.

Gill bought the winning ticket at the Chevron Town Pantry on 58th Avenue.

According to the BC Lottery Corporation, B.C. players have redeemed more than $73 million in winning from Lotto 6/49 so far in 2020.

Surrey council has given third-reading approval to a 25-storey office tower for the southeast corner of Central City mall, at 10045 King George Boulevard.

A “virtual” public hearing was held Monday, July 13.

Council then gave its approval with no debate.

Guildford resident Richard Landale, the first speaker to address council, noted a traffic impact study indicates 473 vehicles will impact the area at a “peak-hour” period while a report has 982 commercial parking stalls.

“Obviously there is more critical information staff is withholding from council that is relevant to any decisions made by council this evening,” he charged.

He also noted 89 trees will be removed in exchange for a $12,000 contribution by the applicant to the city’s Green City Fund.

“I do not understand why this 25-storey office building is not required, under the capital amenity contribution program, is not required to pay its fair share, especially in regards to policing and fire department services,” Landale said, “which is particularly important as the building is 25 storeys high.”

South Surrey resident Ivan Scott supported the application, saying it’s the “perfect time and place” to build such an office tower.

“Office towers are very seldomly built these days with developers instead going for a residential tower,” he told council. “This shows the confidence genuine business people have in the future of Surrey.”

South Surrey resident C0lin Pronger opposed the development.

“I believe that the city should be improving Whalley as a whole rather than perpetrating its division of King George Boulevard.”

The west side, he said, is for the “well-dressed” who may never have to cross over to the east side of the boulevard.

“Developers are only building for the ‘haves’ in Surrey, so they won’t be inconvenienced when they have to visit their lawyers and financial advisors,” Pronger said.

Elizabeth Model, CEO of the Downtown Business Improvement Association, supports the project

“It’s the first commercial building in quite some time,” she noted. “It’s going to provide a huge amount of economic development, with jobs and obviously with a spin-off of all the commercial build and the businesses coming to our area.”

A “Drive Thru Food Truck Festival” is coming to Cloverdale Fairgrounds.

The two-day event will be hosted by Greater Vancouver Food Truck Festival on the weekend of July 18-19, from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily. Admission is free.

“We’re featuring seven of your favourite food trucks and one heck of a good time,” event organizers say in a Facebook post.

The venue is on 62A Avenue, under the wooden arches by the rec centre, off 176th Street.

The Saturday lineup of vendors will include Tin Lizzy Concessions (mini doughnuts), Mo-Bacon, Holi Masala, Lenny’s Lemons, Next Gen. Concessions (“street dogs,” fries and poutine), Ford Concessions (Steve O’s Fried Chicken) and Betty’s Greek Honey Ballz (loukoumades).

On the Sunday, vendors are Rocky Point Ice Cream, REEL Mac And Cheese, Wings Tap And Grill, Next Gen. Concessions (funnel cakes), The Truckin’ BBQ, Ford Concessions (Los Tacos Hermanos) and Lenny’s Lemons Less.

Presented by Coast Capital Savings, similar drive-through events were held at sites in Abbotsford and Langley in June, and another is planned in Chilliwack.

(Story continues below)

Festival owner/operator Jason Faria said signage directs guests to the main parking lots on site, and are then directed to the lineup of their choice. Patrons order from the food truck, and a person wearing personal protective equipment will collect their payment.

Customers will then exit the parking lot. There will not be any on-site seating, and tailgate parties aren’t permitted.

Menus and more details are posted to greatervanfoodtruckfest.com.

The Greater Vancouver Food Truck Festival (GVFTF) is billed as “the largest roaming food truck festival in Canada.”

A pair of new arrivals at the White Rock RCMP detachment this month won’t put more ‘boots on the ground’ in the seaside city – but the speckled siblings have certainly added an appreciated lightness to the job, says the city’s top cop.

Staff Sgt. Kale Pauls said the journey that ultimately led to a rescue operation on Thursday (July 9), began June 26 with the discovery of three seagull eggs on the detachment’s Pacific Avenue rooftop.

Ever wonder what’s on the roof of the @WhiteRockRCMP detachment? A seagull home with a great front lawn and three soon to hatch eggs. pic.twitter.com/zQ3r9OKs8s — White Rock RCMP (@WhiteRockRCMP) June 27, 2020

The find was made during maintenance efforts, Pauls told Peace Arch News Friday (July 10).

Just under a week later, the eggs started to hatch, and on July 8, “two fuzzy hatchlings were observed running around the roof.”

Update on the @WhiteRockRCMP seagull hatchlings: they are running around the detachment roof now! Only 5 days old. Super zoom camera caught this. #whiterock #seagull pic.twitter.com/yHP1gpzRun — White Rock RCMP (@WhiteRockRCMP) July 8, 2020

It’s unclear what became of the third egg, Pauls said, surmising it may not have survived.

July 9, a little drama unfolded after one of the two hatchlings somehow made it off the roof. It was found on the ground, seemingly unsure what to do with itself, after an officer noticed a parent seagull “squawking quite loud” from the rooftop, Pauls said.

“The parent bird was communicating with the hatchling, but would not go to the ground to help it,” he continued.

Animal control was contacted, and bird-rescue society officials advised that the hatchling should be returned to the roof by capturing it in a box, he said.

“The parent bird did not oppose the capture of the hatchling, possibly realizing that it was helpful. The hatchling was convinced to come into the box and was reunited with their sibling on the roof, which has an elevated ledge that acts as a fenced in playground.”

Pauls said the detachment roof “appears to be the safest place in the city for the hatchlings to avoid being prey.”

And while the adventure won’t be showing up in any police files, Pauls said it has been a nice journey to witness.

“I think the best part is that you rarely see a gull hatchling, so actually seeing these fuzzy creatures experiencing their first look a life is a nice addition to the daily operations at a detachment,” he said.

A Chilliwack artist’s property was aglow with lighted sculptures Saturday night as she held a public art exhibition outside her own home.

Not knowing when the next time her work would be installed inside a gallery, Sylvie Roussel-Janssens decided to create her own gallery. She opened her home and yard to friends and the public for a one-night show on June 6.

“I feel like sometimes you really have to take things in your own hands. Cultural institutions are very prudent. They may not be the ones who will think outside the (white) box first,” Roussel-Janssens said. “If and when they do, they will have been nudged by the daring ones: the artists.”

During the COVID-19 pandemic, she has been busy by working on new projects which were on display that night.

Large house-shaped structures of red, blue and yellow stood at the foot of her driveway as smaller pieces lit up the deck and the walls of the garage.

For a long time she has dreamt of travelling with her art, but due to the fact that her work is in three-dimensional sculpture form, it needs to be easily transportable.

READ MORE: Origami-inspired art lights up Chilliwack art gallery

Showing, moving, storing and selling sculpture is difficult, she admits.

Roussel-Janssens is constantly figuring out new designs so she can make her sculptures foldable, collapsable or stackable.

“Nothing makes me sadder than looking at boxes containing artworks that do not get a chance to live. For me, it is not enough to make a piece. I want it to have a life after the studio, to go in the world.”

1062,"Dear Editor,

With regard to the article in the Langley Advance Times of Thursday, July 2 [Fort Langley principal apologizes as blackface picture re-surfaces 13 years later], I did want to express my thoughts regarding the whole issue of ‘blackface’ which occurred more than a decade ago.

I think it is unreasonable and unfair for people to stand here now and look through the lens of 2020, and criticize someone for something which was done 14 years earlier when no one gave the behaviour a second thought at the time – including many of those who are now wagging their finger in disapproval.

Anyone who was a mature adult in 2006 knows that times were different then, with very little feedback coming from minority groups about how they felt by some of the things which were being done at that time.

Many of the things that Caucasians did were not done with malicious intent. Had we known that what we were doing was hurtful and demeaning, I believe that we would not have continued to do them.

Why would we think ‘blackface’ was hurtful or demeaning if we, as Caucasians, wouldn’t be hurt by a non-Caucasian doing ‘whiteface’?

Now that Caucasians are aware that certain behaviours or practices are hurtful, criticism is only justified if the behaviour continues going forward.

There are numerous things from history that were not acceptable by today’s standards, whether it was related to ethnicity, male vs. female, or even treatment of children. Many of those issues are gone or there have been improvements. People spoke up. People have been educated.

Let’s move on and work at continuing to improve things for everyone, rather than blame or punish people for behaviour which had been acceptable for the times.

Langley Township has unveiled the expected cost-per-household required to hit local carbon dioxide reduction targets during the next 20 years – $130 per year.

That’s a pretty decent price.

I’m not saying that it isn’t a decent chunk of change. As an increase in property taxes, it would be a fair bit. But if you’d like to think of it in a different way, it’s about 35.6 Starbucks grande lattes, or 5.7 medium pizzas a year.

Better yet, consider the cost of not acting.

The upfront cost of fire insurance and car insurance and home insurance is a lot, too, but you don’t see anyone sensible suggesting that you should go without them.

So let’s consider the costs of doing nothing about climate change.

How much would it cost the Township if the Fraser River overtopped the dikes around Glen Valley and Fort Langley and flooded low-lying areas?

I’m pretty sure that repairs to roads, sewers, water mains, bridges, and other vital infrastructure would cost a pretty penny. Not to mention the cost of evacuating everyone from Fort Langley – which was an island during the 1948 floods.

How about the cost to Langley farmers in agricultural failures if the weather becomes ever more unpredictable?

What will it cost rural landowners if parching summers cause excessive draw on local aquifers and wells run dry?

Some of those costs would fall to the Township, and thus be borne by every taxpayer. Others costs would fall harder on individual property owners.

Climate change mitigation is an insurance policy. We’re already seeing the impacts of climate change, and we’ll keep seeing them. But if we and our neighbours, our provinces, our federal government, and our fellow nations work together, we can save a lot of money.

It’s save now, or spend tomorrow.

1069,"Normally, Maple Ridge resident Jay Radke would be watching his 16-year-old son Pierce play shortstop for the Langley Blaze baseball team from a seat close to the action, on the stands behind home plate at McLeod Athletic Park.

Instead, on Sunday afternoon, July 5, Jay was viewing the action from the parking lot behind the outfield, and regretting leaving his binoculars at home.

“I’ve had my bum parked on that bench 25 feet away from the action many times,” Jay recalled, smiling, describing the parking lot viewpoint as “the cheap seats.”

It was one of the first practices by the team since the novel coronovirus forced a lockdown of most sports, and it took place under restrictions that kept fans out of the stands and the players well separated.

It was an opportunity to show their stuff to a Team Canada scout, who spent much of the workout positioned behind the mesh netting of the batting cage, looking to add some talent to the national team.

Pierce, who plays for the Junior Blaze, was called up to the senior team for the event, his father recounted.

“He got the call a couple of days ago.”

Pierce is aiming to follow in the footsteps of his stepbrother, Jon Bauer, a Blaze pitcher who parlayed his athletic talents into a “full-on scholarship” to a U.S. university, Jay explained.

“[Jon] was never drafted [by a major league team] but he got an education out of it,” Radke remarked.

READ MORE: Langley Blaze back on the field but only for practices

On the field, Blaze general manager Doug Mathieson was pleasantly surprised by the players’ commitment to maintaining a safe distance.

“I thought it would be like herding cats,” Mathieson told a Langley Advance Times reporter.

Mathieson is hoping the team will be able to open up their practice sessions a little more in the near future, possibly in about a week, but that will depend on what the health authorities say.

While there won’t be a traditional ball season, the club may continue summer session until August, instead of the traditional July stoppage.

“If we get the green light, we’ll play exhibition game schedules,” he added. “If we further get a green light, we’ll probably do some September tournaments but that’s all speculation at this point. We’re just going day by day and see what we can do.”

More sports have resumed in the U.S. which is seeing record virus spread.

Word that a phased-in return to play has been approved was welcome news for the Langley Rugby Club, which, like all rugby organizations in B.C., has been idled by the coronovirus pandemic and the need to maintain social distancing.

On Tuesday, July 7, BC Rugby, the provincial governing body of the sport, released their ‘Return to Rugby’ plan and announced existing restrictions would be eased, very slightly.

There are five phases to the plan, with phase two launching with the roll-out of the plan.

Maximum rugby gatherings will go from 10 to 50 people, and total time allowed at rugby events will be extended from 45 to 60 minutes.

Inter-club or contact activities are still banned, and physical distancing of two metres must be maintained at all times, with rugby balls as the only permitted shared equipment.

The next phase, expected to begin in September, would see some “small-sided, non-contact games” within clubs and additional shared equipment, the announcement detailed.

Players would be allowed “brief, limited breaches” of social distancing, getting within one metre of each other.

Regular full-contact play is not expected until there is an effective treatment or vaccine for COVID-19.

“Rugby is coming back but it’s up to all of us to make sure it’s brought back in a safe and responsible manner,” said BC Rugby CEO Annabel Kehoe.

“While we won’t be returning to full-contact rugby for the foreseeable future, we’re excited to support clubs delivering modified training before progressing to non-contact rugby, like touch and flag rugby.”

Langley Rugby Club chair Brian Anderson said the club will be reviewing and implementing the new rules.

““It might not be the sport as we know it,”” Anderson told the Langley Advance Times, noting the restrictions on full-contact are a big change for a sport known for its physicality.

Older players, especially, may find it hard to break full-contact habits, so Anderson expects the initial return to the field will probably involve younger players.

“We’ll focus on player development at the younger ages, because they’ll probably respect social distancing,” Anderson commented.

He doubts there will be any kind of competition against other clubs in 2020.

“We won’t be playing this year,” Anderson predicted.

“That was my gut feeling.”

He was optimistic about the long-term prospects of the non-profit club, which celebrated it’s 50th anniversary last year.

“We’ll make it through, but there will be some skinny times,” Anderson commented.

Unlike many clubs, Langley Rugby happens to own it’s own playing field, at 21280 Crush Crescent, unlike other clubs which have to pay to play.

“We are fortunate that we own our own grounds.”

Since the Langley Rugby Club was founded in 1969 , it went on to purchase and develop the playing field that has been the club home for almost 30 years.

Before the pandemic hit, the club ran several teams including minis (5 years and up), junior boys and girls, women, and two squads of senior men.

Over the years, Langley Rugby Club has won several league and provincial championships and many Langley Rugby players have gone on to play for regional, provincial and national teams.

The club motto is “Respect All, Fear None, Expect Victory.”

Under the BC Rugby plan, clubs will be required to complete the World Rugby COVID-19 courses and appoint one or more COVID-19 Safety Coordinators.

Until further notice, BC Rugby will require participants in any in-person rugby session to complete an attestation that they do not have COVID-19 and have not been in contact with a confirmed or possible case within the previous 14 days.

Formally known as the British Columbia Rugby Union, BC Rugby is the governing body for the sport in British Columbia and represents over 7,500 individuals in 60 member clubs and associations in the province.

Second place prize are growlers and fills from four local breweries, brewery swag, and dinner vouchers for an entire team.

Third place prize is a Dead Frog Brewery tasting tour and four free admissions to Langley Exit Room.

Each day, names will be drawn at random and these participants are then eliminated from the competition.

Teams are not eliminated until every team member has been drawn and removed from the running.

“Immunity Idols“ are available for purchase with registration – a $50 redeemable chance to get back in the game.

A team’s immunity idol can be redeemed only once in the competition when a team member is eliminated in the draw.

The team captain must confirm with Big Brother’s Big Sisters when they would like to redeem the immunity idol.

The contact-free fundraiser is being held virtually due to COVID-19, but programs facilitate through Big Brothers Big Sisters are continuing in different capacities.

Matches are currently not able to see each other in person, but mentors are still engaging virtually in order to provide support and friendship for children.

Longtime Langley resident William “Bill” Cutress passed away on July 2 at the age of 100.

Born in Calgary, Alta, Cutress served in the Royal Canadian Navy for the duration of the Second World War, working on mine sweepers on the Atlantic Ocean.

He later moved to Burnaby, eventually moving to Langley with his second wife Molly Hill-Tout and joining Aldergrove Legion Branch 265.

Cutress celebrated his 100th birthday on May 8th amid COVID-19 restrictions, but was treated to a celebration outside of his balcony at Harrison Landing.

Dressed in his legion uniform, members of the Aldergrove branch presented Cutress with a 75 year pin alongside a drummer and piper.

More than 15 well-wishers gathered to sing Happy Birthday to the centenarian from across the facility’s fence.

According to his obituary, Cutress was active in the legion, the chiefs and petty officers, the oldsmobile club, and the Vancouver Maritime Museum.

He is survived by three daughters, two step-daughters, one son, six grandchildren, and eight great-grandchildren.

Daughter Linda Dunaway said the Aldergrove legion lowered their flag to half mast upon hearing of Cutress’s passing.

A Celebration of Life will be planned and announced at a later date.

Fort Gallery is featuring isolation-themed works created during COVID-19. (Joy Kinna/Special to the Langley Advance Times) Fort Gallery is featuring isolation-themed works created during COVID-19. (Fort Gallery/Special to the Langley Advance Times)

The Fort Gallery presents Together Alone, a group exhibition exploring the impacts of quarantine and isolation as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

As people tentatively emerged from quarantine, the Fort Gallery invited artists to consider themes of connection, community isolation and the innovative ways to find ‘togetherness” while being physically alone.

The community responded enthusiastically.

This exhibition features thirty emerging and established artists from Langley and beyond presenting photographs, drawings, paintings and sculpture.

As many have spent the last months finding ways to connect even while physically isolated, the artists included in this exhibition have taken refuge in their creative practices as a way to cope with and understand our changing reality.

READ MORE: Fort Langley Artists Group showcases art virtually to help hospice

Some artists use the language of abstraction to describe the complex dynamics of the inner life during this time.

Other artists explore the ways that nature has provided an important refuge and escape from the monotonous four walls of of homes.

Still others, through drawings, paintings and photographs of the human figure, consider the ways that the world is re-thinking what it means to connect and be together.

Resonances of loneliness, solitude, distance and connect echo through the works in this diverse exhibition.

Together Alone runs from Friday, July 17 until August 16 at the Fort Gallery.

The gallery is located at 9048 Glover Rd.

Due to social distancing measures, short artist talks will be posted on the gallery’s social media throughout the run of the exhibition.

1089,"For years, Marie Tary had suffered with symptoms she dismissed as simply “part of being a woman,” including extreme pelvic pain and anemia due to heavy menstrual bleeding. Eventually referred to the care of specialists, including Dr. Elaine Mah, an obstetrician, gynecologist and surgeon at Langley Memorial Hospital, an ultrasound revealed a 15-centimetre uterine fibroid.

Shortly after diagnosis, while waiting for surgery, Tary was back in hospital: the fibroid had gotten so big her body was reacting to toxins it was creating. Dr. Mah surgically removed the fibroid using a process similar to a Caesarian section that let Tary recover in about six weeks, and share her gratitude to the Langley Memorial team:

“Listen to your body – just because they’re often considered ‘women’s problems’ doesn’t mean potential symptoms should be ignored,” Tary says. “If I hadn’t gotten mine looked at it could’ve gone very badly – I could have gone septic. We need to make women’s health less of a stigma and more normalized.”

Dramatic changes for women’s health care

From fertility support and maternity care to cancer diagnosis and innumerable other conditions like Tary’s fibroid, women’s health care is front and centre at Langley Memorial Hospital’s medical imaging and BC Cancer – Breast Screening and mammography clinic.

Site co-ordinator Tammy Karoway has worked in medical imaging for more than 30 years, and has seen the dramatic evolution in the diagnostic and treatment tools her team have to treat the women in their care.

“When I started, cancer was still seen as a death sentence for many. Now, advances in technology to diagnose cases and new, less invasive treatments have made a huge difference in survival rates,” Karoway says, noting that for patients waiting for diagnosis or treatment, where every minute feels like a week, tools to make those happen quicker are vital.

At Langley Memorial, in a typical day, the medical imaging team performs:

hysterosalpingograms, looking for fallopian tubes blockages impacting fertility. In fact, sometimes the exam itself can actually become therapeutic if the contrast opens a blockage and resolves the issue.

female-focused ultrasound exams – scanning breasts to review lumps and performing pelvic studies to help identify issues within the reproductive system.

ultrasound supporting the hospital’s Fetal Maternity Clinic, to ensure baby is well and there’s enough fluid for baby to stay safely inside for a few more days.

breast biopsies under ultrasound after a patient has had a suspicious mammogram.

support for new studies showing the preventive health benefits of review images of dense breasts, which can be more prone to tumours.

The ability to care for women in their community goes a long way to easing the burden on patients and their families – reducing the need to travel to larger centres for diagnostics or treatment, Karoway notes.

To better support those efforts, Langley Memorial Hospital Foundation is working to purchase equipment, including hysteroscopes to help doctors conduct less invasive surgeries. To screen women for breast cancer, the MRI suite will have a specialized coil able to perform breast scans – an upgrade that the community generously supported.

Police have recovered $75,000 worth of stolen goods, including 3,200 pounds of rice, from a Langley warehouse.

A statement released Tuesday, July 14, by the Burnaby RCMP Prolific Offender Suppression Team (POST), said the investigation began with the theft of a large shipping container of rice.

On May 10, 2020, officers received a report that a container full of rice, worth an estimated $20,000, had been stolen from a business in South Burnaby.

1098,"A Ravaged Soul: Anatomy of an Addict was originally released by v12films in 2014

Langley resident Brian MacDonald recalled sneaking around between classes to score drugs throughout the 1990s.

He was an instructor at the time, owning and operating Vancouver’s Broadcast College in the midst of a career that had taken him on-air and into the management side of the industry.

MacDonald told the Langley Advance Times that was also the time an addiction to heroin took over his life.

After cleaning up in 2002, MacDonald decided to follow a passion for film and start his own production company – v12films.

“We produce documentaries on the human condition and struggle,” he said. “Stories of redemption.”

MacDonald began with his own story and began to explore the journey of addiction through a one-hour documentary called A Ravaged Soul – first released in 2014.

“It takes a look at the downtown East Side of Vancouver,” MacDonald explains. “It’s an ugly story and hard to watch.”

The filmmaker said he left no stone unturned, frankly discussing sexual and physical abuse that preceded his addiction.

Key members of his life speak in A Ravaged Soul, including MacDonald’s mother and his ex-wife, the mother of his child.

He credits their son as his major inspiration for turning his life around.

“It’s a really emotional 60-minute ride,” he assured.

Stan Mingo, a former dealer from the Vancouver Downtown East Side also appears in the documentary, a man MacDonald referred to as “the king of the heroin trade.”

MacDonald said Mingo speaks openly about his experiences and a time when he even plotted to kill MacDonald.

READ MORE: VIDEO: National Film Board streams documentary shot in Langley for free

Altogether, the documentary charts MacDonald’s experiences of getting sober through his own eyes and the views of others who were and remain close to him.

“I guarantee it is as honest of a documentary that you will see and I’m proud of it,” MacDonald assured.

His first attempt at the production in 2014 led to an Official Selection award at the REEL Recovery Film Festival in New York.

MacDonald has since released a myriad of documentaries in the past five years, most of them dealing with drug addiction and the stigmas that go with the territory.

Today, the owner of v12films said he updated his inaugural work by updating the situation and some of the documentary’s technical aspects.

“The production value was weak so I brought it up to a more professional standard and up to speed,” he said.

With the stresses of COVID-19, MacDonald said the documentary had plenty for relevancy as drug use as, in his words, gone off the charts.

With other productions in the works including a dramatic pilot called The Orchestration of Audrey, MacDonald invited people to contact him at v12films.canada@gmail.com to view the documentary.

“If someone you love is suffering from addiction, please contact me to show them the film,” he said.

MacDonald is 18 years clean and moved to Langley 14 years ago to be closer to his ex-wife and son.

People can visit http://www.v12films.com/home to find out more about MacDonald and the production company.

Sue Simning, mother of the the late Bradley McPherson, stands with her son’s black 1980 GMC Short Box, named “Emma.” (Special to the Aldergrove Star)

Arranged as an annual meetup of car lovers, family, and friends, the late Bradley McPherson’s memorial car show is hitting the road this summer to keep up with COVID-19 safety guidelines.

What went off last August without a hitch at Aldergrove’s Twilight Drive-In, Burnouts In The Sky, is switching gears in 2020 to an event where participants drive around the Fraser Valley, completing challenges in a bid to beat the clock.

RELATED: Brad McPherson still makes his mark, eight years later

“We felt this is the right thing to do with all that is involved and to protect the ones we love and all of you,” said McPherson’s mother, event organizer Sue Simning.

“The Twilight Drive-In has been unfairly controlled by Fraser Health and continues to be limited to only 50 cars at their venue,” Simning said.

McPherson, a 28-year-old victim of murder in 2011, is remembered most fondly by friends and family for working on cars like his black 1980 GMC Short Box, named “Emma.”

Russell Bidesi, was sentenced to life in prison in 2018, eight years after McPherson stood up for a woman being harassed at a house party in Newton.

READ MORE: Life sentence handed to killer of young Langley man

This is the eighth year that his family has paid tribute to his life by hosting an event to raise money to fund scholarships for young adults just like him.

“We do this so we can keep the memory of Bradley alive,” said Simning, at last year’s event, which raised more than $11,369 for the Bradley McPherson Memorial Scholarship Fund.

Already in 2020, the group has doled out post-secondary scholarships to two high schoolers that faced challenges in the classroom, having attention-deficit disorder.

One of them is Walnut Grove Secondary’s Bethany Meszaros, who received $1,000.

“I have fought really hard to do well in school and I hope to become a teacher so that I can support others who have ADHD,” Meszaros told the family in a handwritten card.

Scheduled on the same day as Burnouts In The Sky was to be, Aug. 23 will see the group host the first-ever Bradley McPherson Memorial Cruise/Cannonball Run.

Participating cars, trucks, and motorcycles will line up at Langley’s Colossus multiplex parking lot by 11 a.m.

From there, the vehicles will follow a set-out route within the Fraser Valley and contestants face-off for first place.

RELATED: Murdered man’s memorial car show moves to Aldergrove

The winner will be awarded $500 donated by Titanium Autogroup LTD. Second place is to receive $300 from Canngro Garden Supply, and third place will take home $200.

Registration is free for the event before Aug. 8. Email burnoutsinthesky@gmail.com with a name, vehicle type, and phone number that will be used.

Donations are encouraged.

“This is why we do this [to fundraise for scholarships] and we’re so proud of these kids, Simning said.

From now until July 31, people can peruse FLAG’s website http://www.fortlangleyartistsgroup.com/ or their Facebook page to check out local art for sale.

People can purchase 10 X 10 paintings; half of the proceeds goes to the artists while the other half of sales will support Langley Hospice Society.

Gabrielle Strauss, FLAG’s organizer, said Langley Hospice received $650 from FLAG’s charity gallery last year.

“Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the need for physical distancing, the Langley Heritage Society has made the difficult decision to keep the CNR Station closed for the season,” Strauss said.

Virtual viewing will be people’s only chance to experience FLAG’s new creative works, since the Flagstop Gallery will be closed.

FLAG artist’s work typically hangs in CNR Station and has been an anonymous gallery in the past with artists name’s written on the back of the peice so buyers don’t know until after purchase.

“Instead of mounting a theme-based show, the members of the Fort Langley Artists Group [FLAG] have chosen to showcase some of their favorite new creations online in a virtual, visual feast,” Strauss explained.

Alison Philptt, Annie Segelkin, Beverly Lawrence, Caroline Ashley, Daphne Scaman, Diane Zepeski, Ela Cholewa, Gabrielle Strauss, Kim Bucholtz, Margo Harrison, Marguerite Whelton, Patricia Falck, Robin Bandenieks, and Ursula Bolivar all contributed a variety of different pieces of artwork for the cause.

A new community market is coming to Langley City this weekend featuring all things local.

Langley school trustee Shelley Coburn and local business owner Brenda-Lee Hunter from The Village Work and Play Space are partnering up to host a market in the City to support local crafters and farmers.

“I really want to give the community something to enjoy in the summer,” Coburn stressed.

The market will debut on Saturday, July 18 from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. in downtown Langley City at 20471 Douglas Cres.

READ MORE: Clayton Community Farmer’s Market to return June 14

Having put the call out to vendors on Sunday, Coburn says there are about 15 vendors signed up so far, and more are welcome.

“It’s a grassroots, community-led community,” she noted.

Coburn and Hunter have partnered with the Downtown Langley Business Association who will be offering guests at the market a chance to win downtown dollars to spend at local businesses.

The venue includes indoor and outdoor space for vendors to showcase their offerings. Those vendors who wish to secure a spot at this weekend’s market and have their own tent and table will be charged a $30 fee, for those who require a tent and table will be charged $40.

The market in the City will feature things like fresh produce, honey and locally crafted jewelry.

Coburn will be offering her products from her line called Lucky’s LemondAid.

“Most of my products (bath salts, soaks, scrubs and cleaners) are all natural handmade with lavender and roses from my garden,” she explained. “I also will be selling fresh blossoms all from my garden… plus some recycled and up-cycled items with an eye on sustainability.”

The idea to host a market came after the COVID-19 pandemic cancelled many community events leaving local crafters and farmers with limited options to offer their products, Coburn explained.

“It’s a shame these events got cancelled,” she said.

Coburn hopes there is enough interest from vendors and the community that the market can take place each Saturday, but says they will be taking it one week at a time.

“I’m hoping it starts catching,” she said.

Vendors and those who attend will be expected to hear to Fraser Health guidelines. For more information contact Coburn at shelleyfcoburn@gmail.com.

On the West Coast, we know that the province’s fertile valleys are ripe with, well, food and wine. But did you know that the area that stretches from the fields of the Fraser Valley to the vineyards of the Okanagan is also an ideal spot for outdoor play?

For every fresh peach that’s devoured, there’s an orchard to cycle through. For every Pinot that’s sipped, there’s a paddle that first needs to be dipped in a cool lake. So, embrace this delectable yin and yang, and rediscover your next great BC adventure.

Explore the Fraser Valley

In British Columbia, we’re blessed with natural settings that are as fruitful as they are beautiful. Rolling fields, vineyards, and wide-open spaces are all ready for exploration – and adventure.

A trip just east of the city to the Fraser Valley is the quickest way to immerse in farm life. Beginning in Langley, you can nibble your way from farm to farm to Abbotsford and beyond – all family-run operations that boast everything from fresh-from-the-garden fruits and vegetables to homemade waffles, ice creams, and ciders. Among the pretty landscapes and grazing cattle, you can ride the rapids during a river-rafting excursion or try your hand at catch-and-release sturgeon fishing near Chilliwack. To understand more about local Indigenous culture, opt for a guided tour of the area’s significant sites.

Road Trip to the Okanagan

There are many ways to journey to the Okanagan, and we know them all: the oft-travelled Highway 1; scenic Highway 7; Highway 5/Highway 97, a.k.a. “the fast route”; and Highway 3/Highway 97. But don’t rush along these corridors.

Fuel up at coffee shops and dig into some of the best home cooking anywhere at famed roadside diners in Hope. With bellies full, test your mettle on winding trails or seek out quiet spots at local green spaces. Pedal fast and furious at bike parks or visit historic ranches and outdoorsy resorts, and consider staying awhile.

Valley summers were made for places like Vaseux Lake. Grant Harder photo.

Enjoy Lakeside Adventure

Spend more than five minutes in BC’s sun-kissed Okanagan, and you know that wine touring, craft breweries, cideries, and meaderies are prime for summer visits. Also prime for warmer months? Hours spent on a boat, swims in hidden coves, and long, leisurely paddles with your pod.

Beyond the shorelines, explore the bucolic valleys and the sustainable agritourism that fuel this lakeside lifestyle. Try two-wheeling among the vineyards – a novel way to visit local wineries near Penticton. Hike the Okanagan’s many trails, discover local Indigenous culture near Osoyoos, or visit a family farm for homegrown treats. Another option? Take it all in from a patio at one of the region’s premier winery restaurants. Cheers to that!

“Last Saturday’s pink flag display on Christ Covenant Church’s lawn was a sobering memorial for the victims of sex selective abortion,” said Elyse Vroom, one of the events organizers.

Held annually to spotlight opposition to sex-selective abortion, participants placed 1,000 pink flags up on the lawn of Christ Covenant Church 6866 Glover Rd.

“We had great, enthusiastic local volunteers who were passionate about this issue and helped with set-up and take down as well as monitoring the flags throughout the day,” she explained.

The location was right off Glover Road, which Vroom said, with its high vehicle traffic, meant many slowed down to read the signs or to honk and wave.

“Those who stopped by were able to sign a petition in support of MP Cathay Wagantall’s Bill C-233, the Sex Selective Abortion Act,” Vroom added.

The bill would make it illegal to have an abortion based on the predicted sex of the pre-born baby.

“In a country that values equality of the sexes, a law against sex selective abortion is something we can all support,” Vroom said.

1119,"Langley RCMP say they found cocaine and cash during a search in April

A 45-year-old Langley man has recently been charged with drug possession for the purpose of trafficking, months after a raid on a Brookswood home.

The Langley RCMP Drug Section investigation led to surveillance on a home in the 20300 block of 38A Avenue.

On April 15, local officers executed a search warrant for both the home and a vehicle that was seen leaving the home, said Cpl. Holly Largy, spokesperson for the local detachment.

Officers found 17 “flaps” of cocaine, along with some cash, packaging materials, and a digital scale.

The suspect was arrested after the search warrant was served, but was released from custody.

He has now been charged with possession of a controlled substance for the purpose of trafficking, and is due to appear in court in mid-August, said Largy.

Probationary firefighter Nick Stobbe, firefighter Tim Payne, and lieutenant Andrew Penny all participated in the 2018 firefighter boot drive for Muscular Dystrophy Canada at the Save-On-Foods on 64th Avenue. COVID-19 has forced the firefighters charity to cancel a number of fundraisers, but the boot drive could still happen. (Langley Advance Times file)

When the COVID-19 pandemic scuttled their fundraising mayor’s gala this year, Langley firefighters had to come up with a backup plan to support local charities.

Nick Short, co-executive director of the Township of Langley Firefighter’s Charities Society (TLFCS), said if anything, there is even more of a need to help.

“Everyone has been hurt by COVID and charities are no different,” Short commented.

A golf fundraiser had been discussed in the past, but didn’t get very far.

“We bounced around the idea,” explained Short.

“But we already do a number of big events like the mayor’s gala and the boot drive. “

But now, with no gala, the appeal of an event that carries built-in social distancing was evident.

“We decided we could make it work,” Short told the Langley Advance Times.

On Monday, August 24, the first annual charity TLFCS golf tournament to benefit the Langley Hospice Society will take place at the Redwoods Golf Course near Fort Langley.

Fees range from $850 for a foursome, to $450 for a twosome.

Presented by POWER Earth Enterprises Inc and Vulcan Metalworks, the “Chip In” tournament includes a full 18 holes of golf, food and beverages, including smokie and beer or cider on Hole 10, as well as dinner with a choice of a sirloin steak, BBQ chicken, and and prizes.

Among the restrictions listed by Redwoods, everyone attending the tournament will be required to maintain physical distancing at all times.

There will be a consecutive tee times start, golfers are not permitted to show up earlier than 45 minutes prior to their tee time, no more than six people are permitted at registration or on a hole at any time, and no bag drops are permitted.

Short rates the response so far as “really good” while firefighters scramble to find more sponsors in a limited time.

He thinks there will be another golf tournament next year, but possibly moved to a different date to avoid conflict with the gala, which he described as “postponed” until 2021, not cancelled.

Another casualty of the pandemic was the firefighters annual daffodil campaign to help fight cancer, which was planned for Easter.

There is a possibility the boot drive may still happen, Short added, but that will depend on what restrictions health authorities have in place.

“The boot drive is fairly doable if we have to keep it to five or six [firefighters collecting donations at a time],” he elaborated.

On Sept. 3, Redwoods will host the Greater Langley Chamber of Commerce Golf Tournament, featuring 18 holes, lunch on the 10th holes and a Steak and lobster plated dinner, but no physical banquet.

Cost per golfer is $250, plus tax.

Richmon RCMP report Shawn Johnson was last seen in Chilliwack on June 30, 2020. (RCMP)

The Richmond RCMP is asking for the public’s assistance to help locate a missing 35-year-old man.

Shawn William Johnson was last seen in Chilliwack on June 30, 2020 near the 9000-block of Main Street in the downtown area, according to a July 11 press release.

Johnson is described as a Caucasian male; 35 years old; 180 centimetres tall (5’10”); with a slim build; brown or auburn hair; and blue eyes.

Mounties say Johnson may be driving a Grey 2001 Nissan Altima with a damaged rear window. The licence plate is KA6 O3N.

This the second time a Lower Mainland police detachment has reported Johnson as missing in the last two months. On June 6, 2020, the New Westminster Police sought assistance to find Johnson who had last been seen on June 4 in that city.

At that time, police said Johnson was in need of medication and described him as a “high risk” individual, he was located several days later.

Anyone who sees Johnson is asked to call police. The Chilliwack RCMP detachment number is 604-792-4611.

A Thanksgiving tradition that draws tens of thousands of Lower Mainland residents to Fort Langley every fall has been cancelled due to COVID.

Fort Langley’s 25th annual Cranberry Festival – always held on the Saturday of the Thanksgiving Day weekend in October – will not happen as a direct result of the pandemic, said Meghan Neufeld, the former festival coordinator and Fort Langley Business Improvement Area board member.

RELATED – VIDEO: Fort Langley Cranberry Festival rated a ‘huge success’

“This year’s Fort Langley Cranberry Festival was to take place on Saturday, Oct. 10 and would have been the festival’s 25th annual celebration,” she explained.

“Unfortunately, the desire to host the festival, even in an alternate-capacity, did not outweigh the need for public safety and regulatory compliance,” Neufeld said, acknowledging that the streets of Fort Langley are usually packed, shoulder to shoulder with festival goers for the one-day event.

READ MORE – LETTER: Fort Langley festival reminds us to be thankful

Due to the restrictions on gathering sizes limiting both the number of people and number of vehicles, the BIA directors made what she described as “the difficult decision to not proceed with the festival this year.”

The Fort Langley Cranberry Festival has been running since 1996 and has grown into a highly anticipated event of significant size – with more than 60,000 people visiting the village each year for the scheduled festivities.

“While it is disappointing that the event cannot happen this year, the Fort Langley BIA has high hopes that the village will celebrate the festival’s 25th anniversary in 2021,” Neufeld said, encouraging the public to still visit Fort Langley and “explore all it has to offer.”

Riders in the MS Bike Fraser Valley Experience travelled through Abbotsford on July 13, 2019. This year, the event goes virtual. Abbotsford News file photo

MS Bike goes virtual this year as the Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Society of Canada brings communities together all summer to support Canadians affected by multiple sclerosis.

The virual event takes place on July 25 and 26 at msbike.ca, replacing the annual group rides, including the MS Bike Fraser Valley Experience which travels through Langley and Abbotsford every summer.

The weekend-long virtual event brings together participants to share their stories and connect with one another. Participants raising money for the cause can choose when and how far they ride througout the summer.

This year’s Virtual MS Bike will have weekly challenges such as the fastest kilometre and longest ride, event weekend distance goals of 40 to 200 kilometres, and a a virtual ride across Canada (7,117 kilometres).

RELATED: MS Bike ride travels through Abbotsford as part of scenic route

A live-stream rally featuring members of the MS community begins at noon on July 25.

Interested participants can register online at msbike.ca, set a goal and start cycling. Once registered, they will be able to connect with virtual MS Bike participants across Canada and see how other cyclists are participating from coast to coast.

Typically, the MS Society of Canada and the MS community come together each summer to hold MS Bike events across the country to create awareness and fundraise.

Pamela Valentine, president and CEO of MS Society of Canada, siad it’s important to continue to find ways to connect as as a community and to support one another.

“The current health crisis has impacted all Canadians, and for those affected by MS it’s another uncertain and unpredictable concern on top of an already challenging disease. The need for information and resources for people affected by MS is as important as ever, which is why we must continue our efforts to support the MS community and fund critical research,” she said.

1135,"In Dead Soldiers, one of the paintings in the Sandstorm series, Chris Woods alludes to a long tradition of depicting battles in art. (Chris Woods)

People will once again be allowed to visit the O’Connor Group Art Gallery at the Chilliwack Cultural Centre, but only a handful of folks will be allowed in at a time.

After being closed for more than three months, the gallery doors will open today (July 8) for ‘Sandstorm,’ an exhibition by Chilliwack-based artist Chris Woods whose hyper-realistic work takes a look at the original Star Wars trilogy through the eyes of the antagonist Darth Vader.

The huge paintings in this famed series are based on screen captures from the genre-defining sci-fi action films.

Woods goes beyond the ‘good-guy, bad-guy’ Hollywood dichotomy by turning the narrative of the Star Wars trilogy inside out and exploring the idea that Vader’s history of personal trauma, isolation and abuse stands at the root of an adult who never truly had the chance to choose good over evil.

The re-opening of the gallery will limit patrons to five at a time to ensure proper physical distancing. Face masks covering both nose and mouth must be worn at all times by anyone entering the Chilliwack Cultural Centre, and enhanced operating protocol must be followed.

Many of Woods’ other paintings depict his immediate environment: close friends and the consumer landscape composed of malls, fast-food restaurants and 7-Elevens that surrounds them. He uses his friends as subjects, painting them against a backdrop of belligerent branding, pop-culture symbols, and omnipresent advertising.

Woods has exhibited 18 solo shows since 1988, and appeared in numerous group shows in Canada and the United States. His work is held in numerous public and private collections worldwide, and has appeared in Naomi Klein’s book No Logo as well as magazines like Saturday Night and Adbusters.

Sandstorm will be on display in the art gallery from Wednesday, July 8 to Friday, August 17. Gallery hours are from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., Monday to Friday (closed on holidays). Admission is free.

Mac was a pup-ular dog at the University of the Fraser Valley sports building in early March, 2019, where he celebrated his 15th birthday and his retirement as a therapy dog at the University of the Fraser Valley. (Dustin Godfrey/Black Press)

One of the Fraser Valley’s most pup-ular dogs has passed away.

Mac the Therapy Dog has been featured in local newspapers and on the evening news for all the good work he did, comforting students and staff at the University of the Fraser Valley.

Mac the Therapy Dog, who comforted untold numbers of people throughout his career, gets a cuddle from his handler Dawn Holt. (Submitted/ The Progress)

The last story was in March of last year, when he announced his retirement. He passed away on June 26, 2020, at the age of 16. The news of his passing was announced a few days ago on his own Facebook page, which chronicled his important life as a therapy dog.

It was written as a farewell and a love letter, from the viewpoint of Mac himself, “meant for the heart of each and every one of you.”

“My body is tired and although I love life, it’s time to let go these trappings of age which have begun to weigh me down,” the post reads.

On his Facebook page, his handler Dawn Holt is referred to as MomBoss.

Holt, a UFV counsellor, is registered as a clinician with the Provincial Emergency Health Services, and Mac was registered with PADS (Pacific Assistance Dogs Society). The duo went to Kamloops in 2017 to help comfort victims of wildfires there.

But most of their service was at UFV, and the farewell letter was written to those who knew and loved Mac deeply.

“I want you to truly know, just how much you have given to this great golden life,” it reads. “For every moment of connection, unconditional love and encounter, I gave you a piece of my heart. You might think that after all these years, my heart would be depleted. But no. For every piece of my heart that was given away, I received at least one in return. Because love has no beginning and no end and as long as you let that love in, you need never feel empty.”

1154,"COURTENAY, B.C. -- An unfortunate accident, not a technical breakdown, is being blamed for knocking one of the newest BC Ferries vessels out of service.

The Island Discovery, which sails the waters between Powell River and Texada Island, was removed from service on Wednesday morning after a mishap occurred while crews were working on the vessel Tuesday night.

According to BC Ferries spokesperson Deborah Marshall, the problem is comparable to a problem with an electrical breaker in a house.

""A piece of equipment got damaged during the maintenance work, so it wasn't that the ship had an issue before the damage was caused,"" Marshall said Thursday.

Repairs were attempted Wednesday night but were unsuccessful. Crews are now waiting for a replacement part to be delivered and installed.

""What I'm told is the actual fix or the switching out of the switchboard isn't a big deal, it's actually getting our hands on the part,"" Marshall said.

The service interruption for the vessel, which only went into service on the route a month ago, is being criticized by some ferry users on social media.

Cindy Babyn, president of the Texada Island Chamber of Commerce, says the group's members are concerned.

""The chamber's been made aware that losing our Island Discovery has affected people trying to get their business done in Powell River for sure"" Babyn said.

She said islanders are happy to see the replacement Salish Orca stopping off at Texada during its runs between Comox and Powell River but the infrequency of getting vehicles and off the island is causing lengthy delays.

BC Ferries has also brought in a water-taxi service to transport foot-passengers between Texada and Powell River.

""Yes the water taxi is a very helpful way of crossing, however there are many entrepreneurs who need to use their vehicles to get to work and doing deliveries and other things so we really do require a ferry with vehicle accessibility,"" Babyn said.

BC Ferries also attempted to service the route with a different vessel, the Quadra Queen II, but incompatibility issues with the ramp and the stand-by vessel prevented that from happening.

The replacement part and a duplicate are being sourced from within Canada and in Europe where the Discovery and two other identical vessels were constructed. Marshall said whichever part arrives first will be installed.

There is currently no estimated time of arrival for when the Island Discovery will be returned to service. It is currently docked at Saltery Bay, awaiting the replacement part.

1155,"WENDAKE, QUE -- On the 30th anniversary of the start of the Oka Crisis, Assembly of Firest Nations Quebec-Labrador Regional Chief Ghislain Picard penned an open letter to Quebec Premier Francois Legault.

Below is the letter in full.

Mr. Premier,

Thirty years ago, Quebec entered one of its worst human, social, and political crises. The climate of violence that we witnessed from July to the end of September 1990 had dramatic consequences, including the death of a serving police officer.

Although the Oka crisis has sadly left its indelible mark in our minds, it can still serve as a reference because nothing has really changed in thirty years. However, the social and political divide between First Nations and part of the Quebec population is the result of decades of injustice and forced measures. It is obvious that subjecting an entire population to such actions can only leave wounds that are still open today. Quebec is no exception in this regard; examples abound around the world.

The AFNQL is addressing you today, publicly, first to respectfully acknowledge the memory of the summer of 1990 and to share with you, as Premier of Quebec, ways to prevent history from repeating itself.

The COVID-19 pandemic, police misconduct of a racist nature, a sad thirtieth anniversary, it is in this sensitive context that the debate on racism and discrimination is resurfacing in Quebec, to which the systemic nature is added, whether we like it or not.

Systemic racism and discrimination are not just concepts or theoretical notions. Rather, they are a set of facts and behaviors and we should not be afraid to name and denounce them if we are genuinely willing to correct them.

From the point of view of the AFNQL, when a people denies the fundamental rights of another on the basis of its race, we are in the presence of racism. When this denial is formally and systematically exercised by a State, we are in the presence of systemic racism and discrimination. Again, let us not be afraid of words. They help us face reality.

We must be reminded that the United Nations adopted the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples more than ten years ago, with the aim of breaking with such behavior and proposing viable solutions to States to redefine their relations with Indigenous peoples on a respectful basis. Moreover, the Declaration called for minimal standards to ensure the survival, the dignity and wellbeing of Indigenous peoples. In our view, the political decisions that led to the Oka crisis are a perfect example of actions to be prohibited under the Declaration.

The lesson could easily have been learned.

Against all odds, through recent court actions, your government is today challenging the fundamental right of First Nations to be self-governing, our right to take charge of our own services for our families and children.

Must we remind the premier that denying our right to self-determination will only make us redouble our collective efforts to ensure that Indigenous peoples get the respect they deserve? Putting so much energy and resources into impeding First Nations' desire to better serve their populations will only exacerbate systemic racism and discrimination.

It is difficult to be optimistic in the search for constructive solutions when the wounds of the relationship that should unite us are still contaminated by contempt.

We need to learn from the past and act to move in the right direction, one that will ensure that there is no turning back on mutually agreed principles. As leaders, we share the duty to find a path that is respectful and beneficial to our respective peoples. It is a matter, Mr. Premier, of willingness.

In Peace and Friendship,

1156,"CALGARY -- Calgary is once again in the developmental periphery for stormy weather.

Unstable activity will glide off the foothills this afternoon but likely won’t reach its maxima for potential energy until it’s beyond the city. That notwithstanding, severe storm watches are again possible for Calgary this afternoon.

The storm bands could potentially offer ping pong ball-sized hail at their peak, but conditions are expected to work against the likelihood of hail that size; yesterday’s wave of storms through Edmonton and down toward Red Deer were guided along by a cold front whereas today’s activity is guided by a westerly upper air pattern, which is far from the same degree of organization that yesterday saw. Generally that translates to ""less teeth"" in our storm outlook, though our isolated severe storms could still yield a measure of damaging hail, driving rain, and strong wind.

Funnel clouds could be a factor this afternoon and evening through central and northern Alberta. These are capable of producing landspout tornadoes, which are the weakest type of tornado but still demand respect for their ability to topple trees and fling debris. Speaking of, yesterday offered two tornado watches; one through the Leduc – Wetaskiwin – Camrose area around the dinner hour, and the other through Red Deer – Ponoka – Stettler just past 7 pm. I’ve seen no confirmed reports of a tornado as of yet.

The exact same formula for severe activity (golf ball-sized hail, tornado potential) that was patterned over central Alberta yesterday has repositioned through southern Manitoba today.

Here’s our forecast:

Today:

Partly cloudy, late-day showers and thundershowers possible

Daytime high: 21°

Evening: overnight showers, then clearing, low 10°

Tomorrow:

Partly cloudy, late-day thundershower potential

Daytime high: 21°

Evening: some cloud, low 11°

Sunday:

Partly cloudy, late-day thundershower potential

Daytime high: 22°

Evening: mainly clear, low 12°

Monday:

Mainly sunny

Daytime high: 22°

Evening: some cloud, low 13°

Tuesday:

Partly cloudy, late-day thundershower potential

Daytime high: 26°

Evening: some cloud, low 13°

As a quick recap to yesterday’s storm band, the cold front responsible for those storms didn’t swing far enough south to affect us, which is why we’re leading by thanking Marion in Vulcan and Karen from north of Hanna for these shots of yesterday’s storms!

1157,"BEIJING -- Engorged with more heavy rains, China's mighty Yangtze River is cresting again, bringing fears of further destruction, as the seasonal floods that already have left 141 people dead or missing have grown in force since last month.

The heavy rains are putting renewed pressure on the massive Three Gorges Dam that straddles the river upstream of the city of Wuhan in Hubei province.

The official Xinhua News Agency said the rate of flow in the reservoir behind the dam would hit a record for the year on Friday night, at 55,000 square meters (almost 600,000 square feet) per second.

Rivers in the Yangtze system have broken their banks in places, and in Hubei, a helicopter was used to drop stones into the breach to block the inrushing waters.

Crews were dispatched with poles to probe waterlogged embankments for weakness and thousands of sandbags were being filled in preparation for more breaches that would need to be swiftly closed.

Water rose to the level of first-floor windows in exposed ancient towns and crops were completely inundated around vast Poyang Lake, a network of waterways that empty into the Yangtze below Wuhan.

On the lake's eastern edge in Jiangxi province, 45-year-old Xu Yongxiang said his village of Liufang had been without running water or electricity for almost a week. Although it was time for the rice harvest, that crop, along with cotton, corn and beans was now underwater.

""We do not have one inch of dry ground. It has all been flooded,"" Xu, who sells pork for a living, was quoted as saying on the official newspaper China Youth Daily's microblog.

Flooding since the beginning of the month has forced evacuations of around 1.8 million people in 24 provinces, mainly in southern China. Direct losses attributed to flooding are estimated at more than 49 billion yuan (US$7 billion), according to the Ministry of Emergency Management.

Floodwaters reached as high as 1.4 metres (almost 5 feet) in Linshui county in the southwestern province of Sichuan, the ministry's rescue department reported.

Torrential rain also caused three landslides Thursday in a town in mountainous Chongqing, upstream on the Yangtze, causing three deaths and leaving three more missing, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.

Seasonal flooding strikes large parts of China each year, especially in its central and southern regions, but conditions this year have been especially bad. Major cities have thus far been spared but concerns have risen over Wuhan and other downstream metropolises that are home to tens of millions of people.

China's worst floods in recent years were in 1998, when more than 2,000 people died and almost 3 million homes were destroyed, mostly along the Yangtze.

The Three Gorges Dam was built mainly to generate electricity, but the government also said it was expected to mitigate catastrophic flooding.","China's mighty Yangtze nears crest again, new floods feared",4,0.1395748967710433
1158,"ATLANTA -- The Rev. C.T. Vivian, an early and key adviser to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. who organized pivotal campaigns in the civil rights movement and spent decades advocating for justice and equality, died Friday at the age of 95.

Vivian began staging sit-ins against segregation in Peoria, Illinois, in the 1940s -- a dozen years before lunch-counter protests by college students made national news. He met King soon after the budding civil rights leader's leadership of the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott, and helped translate ideas into action by organizing the Freedom Rides that eventually forced federal intervention across the South.

Vivian boldly challenged a segregationist sheriff while trying to register Black voters in Selma, Alabama, where hundreds, then thousands, later marched across the Edmund Pettus Bridge.

""You can turn your back now and you can keep your club in your hand, but you cannot beat down justice. And we will register to vote because as citizens of these United States we have the right to do it,"" Vivian declared, wagging his index finger at Sheriff Jim Clark as the cameras rolled. The sheriff then punched him, and news coverage of the assault helped turned a local registration drive into a national phenomenon.

Former diplomat and congressman Andrew Young, another close King confidant, said Vivian was always ""one of the people who had the most insight, wisdom, integrity and dedication.""

President Barack Obama honoured Vivian with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2013, saying that ""time and again, Reverend Vivian was among the first to be in the action: in 1947, joining a sit-in to integrate an Illinois restaurant; one of the first Freedom Riders; in Selma, on the courthouse steps to register blacks to vote, for which he was beaten, bloodied and jailed.""

Obama continued: ""Rosa Parks said of him, `Even after things had supposedly been taken care of and we had our rights, he was still out there, inspiring the next generation, including me,' helping kids go to college with a program that would become Upward Bound."" He praised Vivian, then 89, for being ""still in the action, pushing us closer to our founding ideals.""

The King Center in Atlanta tweeted a tribute: ""Rev. C.T. Vivian. Courageous. Brilliant. Sacrificial. A powerfully well-lived life that lifted humanity. We will miss you."" The Rev. Al Sharpton, who heads the National Action Network, tweeted that Vivian ""made this nation and world a better place.""

""RIP, my friend,"" Sharpton's message ended.

Speaking with students in Tennessee 50 years after the Voting Rights Act was signed into law, Vivian urged them to act strategically as they advocated for justice and equality. The civil rights movement was effective not only because of its nonviolence, but because activists made sure their messages were amplified, he said.

""This is what made the movement: Our voice was really heard. But it didn't happen by accident; we made certain it was heard,"" Vivian said.

Cordy Tindell Vivian was born July 28, 1924, in Howard County, Missouri, but moved to Macomb, Illinois, with his mother as a young boy. He later studied theology alongside future civil rights leader and U.S. Congressman John Lewis at the American Baptist College in Nashville, Tennessee, where they trained waves of activists in nonviolent protest.

King made Vivian his national director of affiliates at the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and sent him around the South to register voters, an effort that brought Vivian to Selma in 1965. Standing on the Dallas County courthouse steps as a line of Black people stretched down the block behind him, he argued for their voting rights until Clark's punch knocked him flat.

Vivian stood back up and kept talking before he was stitched up and jailed, and his mistreatment helped draw thousands of protesters, whose determination to march from Selma to Montgomery pressured Congress to pass the Voting Rights Act later that year.

Vivian continued to serve in the SCLC after King's assassination in 1968, and became its interim president in 2012, lending renewed credibility and a tangible link to the civil rights era after the organization stagnated for years amid financial mismanagement and infighting.

""There must always be the understanding of what Martin had in mind for this organization,"" Vivian said in a 2012 interview. ""Nonviolent, direct action makes us successful. We learned how to solve social problems without violence. We cannot allow the nation or the world to ever forget that.""

Vivian died at home in Atlanta of natural causes Friday morning, his friend and business partner Don Rivers confirmed to The Associated Press.

Vivian had a stroke about two months ago but seemed to recover, Rivers said. Then, ""he just stopped eating,"" he said.

Rivers, 67, said he was 21 when he met Vivian at Shaw University in Raleigh, North Carolina. Back then, he worked as an audio director when Vivian was the dean of the university's divinity school. The two remained close over the years and Rivers said he handled the business side of Vivian's work.

""He's such a nice, gentle, courageous man,"" Rivers said, adding that the reverend wasn't in it for the money. ""He was always giving, giving, giving.""","Rev. C.T. Vivian, key civil rights leader, has died at 95",2,0.5080783647537448
1159,"WASHINGTON -- Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said Friday she is receiving chemotherapy for a recurrence of cancer, but has no plans to retire from the Supreme Court.

The 87-year-old Ginsburg, who has had four earlier bouts with cancer including pancreatic cancer last year, said her treatment so far has succeeded in reducing lesions on her liver and she will continue chemotherapy sessions every two weeks ""to keep my cancer at bay.""

""I have often said I would remain a member of the Court as long as I can do the job full steam. I remain fully able to do that,"" Ginsburg said in a statement issued by the court.

Ginsburg, who was appointed by U.S. President Bill Clinton in 1993, is the senior liberal justice on a court that leans conservative by a 5-4 margin. Her departure before the election could give President Donald Trump the chance to shift the court further to the right.

Ginsburg's history with cancer goes back more than 20 years. In addition to being treated without surgery for a tumour on her pancreas last year, she also underwent surgery for colorectal cancer in 1999, pancreatic cancer in 2009 and lung cancer in December 2018.

Dr. Alan Venook, a pancreatic cancer specialist at the University of California, San Francisco, who is not involved in Ginsburg's care, said that ""clearly, she's got incurable disease now"" because of the spread to her liver.

On average, patients with advanced pancreatic cancer live about a year, but the fact that her disease took so long to recur from her initial pancreatic cancer surgery in 2009 and previous treatments ""suggests that it's not been growing rapidly,"" he said.

""She's above average in many ways."" and has done remarkably well with all her treatments so far, Venook said. ""There's no reason to think she would die imminently.""

Asked earlier this week about a possible opening on the court before the election, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said the president would act quickly if any opening were to arise. Meadows commented after news that Ginsburg had left the hospital after receiving treatment for an infection, which she said Friday was unrelated to the cancer.

""I can't imagine if he had a vacancy on the Supreme Court that he would not very quickly make the appointment and look for the Senate to take quick action,"" Meadows said, adding that he didn't want any comment to be seen as wishing Ginsburg ""anything but the very best.""

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has said that if there were to be a vacancy on the court during this year's election cycle, the Republican-controlled Senate would likely confirm a nominee selected by Trump.

Ginsburg said she was disclosing her cancer treatment now because she is satisfied ""that my treatment course is now clear.""

Venook said the chemotherapy drug Ginsburg said she is getting, gemcitabine, is one that's often used. Immunotherapy, which Ginsburg's statement said she tried unsuccessfully, has not worked well for pancreatic cancer, Venook said.

Ginsburg said a medical scan in February revealed growths on her liver and she began chemotherapy in May.

""My most recent scan on July 7 indicated significant reduction of the liver lesions and no new disease,"" she said. ""I am tolerating chemotherapy well and am encouraged by the success of my current treatment.""

Ginsburg noted that she is able to ""maintain an active daily routine"" and that throughout her treatment she has ""kept up with opinion writing and all other Court work.""

When the justices heard arguments via telephone in May because of the coronavirus pandemic, Ginsburg participated one day from a hospital room in Baltimore. She was being treated for gall stones, and said Friday that hospitalization also had nothing to do with the cancer.

1160,"NEW YORK -- Brooks Brothers, the 200-year-old company that dressed nearly every U.S. president, filed for bankruptcy protection Wednesday, the latest major clothing seller to be toppled by the coronavirus pandemic.

Founded in New York in 1818, Brooks Brothers survived two world wars, the Great Depression and even managed to stay afloat as dress standards eased in the office. But the pandemic pushed it into Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection with so many stores closed and, with millions working from home, a crisp suit pushed to the very bottom of shopping lists.

Brooks Brothers will permanently close more than a quarter of its 200 stores.

The retail sector was under severe pressure even before the pandemic. Rival Barneys New York filed for bankruptcy protection late last year. Since COVID-19 began to spread in the U.S, J.Crew,Neiman Marcus,J.C. Penney and other national retail chains have followed suit.

The virus has hollowed out spending in many places and the accelerated the shift to online shopping, mostly to the benefit of big retailers like Walmart, Target and Amazon.com. Stores have begun to open in some parts of the country, but millions of people are still hunkered down at home. There are regions in the U.S. that are now getting hit with a wave of infections and some companies like Apple are shutting down stores again in those areas.

Brooks Brothers said Wednesday that it will continue operations as it restructures and is looking to reopen shops that are not being closed permanently. The company employed 4,000 people in March, before it furloughed about a third of its workers.

Jonathan Pasternak, a bankruptcy lawyer at Davidoff Hutcher & Citron, said that even before the pandemic, Brooks Brothers' store expansion and the cost of making clothes in the U.S. had created a financial burden, but he does not believe the company will disappear.

“The good thing about Brooks Brothers: It's a very strong brand,” he said.

The company has a storied history, dressing at least 40 American presidents, including Abraham Lincoln, who was wearing a Brooks Brothers coat when he was assassinated in 1865. Brooks Brothers' two-button suits were a favourite of President John F. Kennedy.

But its cultural influence has been broad.

Clark Cable wore Brooks Brothers and Jennifer Aniston appeared on the cover of GQ magazine wearing nothing but a red, white and blue Brooks Brothers tie.

It will be using purified protein provided by its research collaborator, Canadian company ZYUS Life Sciences, according to a news release.

Preliminary research results from ZYUS show that plant-based antigens are reactive to anti-COVID-19 antibodies and potentially offer immunity from COVID-19, the company said.

The company, which specializes in medical cannabis research, says it was able to express a coronavirus protein in Nicotiana benthamiana, a variety of the tobacco plant, and showed that the plant-based SARS-CoV-2 protein is recognized by antibodies in the serum of recovered COVID-19 patients.

That suggests that plant-based protein, in this form of a vaccine, could potentially provide protection from COVID-19 infection.

“Rapid production of large quantities of an antigen with suitable purity and quality is a critical step in developing a vaccine for COVID-19,” said Brent Zettl, ZYUS CEO.

“These preliminary test results are an important step forward, offering scientists and researchers more options to scale vaccine production in the global fight against COVID-19.”",Vaccine developed with help of Saskatoon medical cannabis firm to enter animal testing phase,8,0.9089999196574396
1166,"MONTREAL -- Air Canada is again urging the government to ease COVID-19 travel restrictions, this time by adopting a ""science-based approach"" that would open travel to countries with low risks of infection.

In a letter sent Wednesday to various ministers, the country's largest airline says the situation is becoming ""increasingly urgent"" as Canada has made virtually no change to its quarantine restrictions since mid-March despite improvements in containing the spread of the virus.

Air Canada's chief medical officer, Dr. Jim Chung, wrote that the restrictions are severely impacting the airline, its customers and employees, as well as an overall recovery.

He says the proposed measures mirror those adopted by the European Union, Britain and other jurisdictions.

The Montreal-based airline says it is not proposing relaxing U.S. border restrictions that are expected to be extended until at least late August.

It notes that requirements in place to travel to various countries include pre-departure medically certified negative COVID-19 tests to enter the Caribbean; a waiver of quarantine requirements after a negative test on arrival to Iceland, Austria and Luxembourg; and mandatory testing on arrival to South Korea, Hong Kong, Macau and the United Arab Emirates.

""There are many other interests affected by the quarantine restrictions -- not only jobs and pensions, but also the social and economic well-being of individuals and communities that rely on air travel, as well as basic freedoms of mobility,"" says Chung.

""Business and labour leaders alike have implored the government to act on easing these restrictions in order to strike a better balance, without adversely impacting public health.""

1169,"TORONTO -- Canada's busiest airport is cutting approximately 500 jobs because of a significant drop in air traffic due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Greater Toronto Airports Authority (GTAA) announced on Tuesday it is cutting 27 per cent of its workforce at Toronto's Pearson Airport to allow for a more ""nimble, innovative, and recovery-focused"" operation.

""These changes reflect a significant decrease in global air traffic, with passenger numbers at Toronto Pearson currently at approximately 1996 operating levels,"" the GTAA said in a statement.

The GTAA said passenger numbers in April of this year were reduced by 97 per cent compared to the same period of 2019.

The reduction of jobs will come through the elimination of about 200 unfilled positions, combined with voluntary departures and layoffs totally about 300 employees.

The reductions come into effect beginning on Monday, with job losses extending through fall 2020.

Among the high-ranking departures are two of the GTAA's vice-presidents, whose work will be redistributed under a revamped management structure headed by Craig Bradbrook.

Bradbrook had been the GTAA's vice-president for aviation services and is now in the newly created position of chief operating officer.

""This reduction in force is a difficult but necessary step, and one that we take with great sadness,"" GTAA president and CEO Deborah Flint said in a statement.

""We are committed to maintaining our operations and the health and safety of the airport as we evolve our organization to drive our recovery. I am confident that we have a capable and resilient team and the right approach to come through these challenging times with strength.""

Among the management departures was Kim Stangeby, vice-president and chief strategy officer, who had also been GTAA's interim vice-president for human resources.

GTAA said it will complete a search for a new chief human resources officer.

The airport operator says it's also working with the Unifor union and Pearson Airport's firefighter association to implement the changes while respecting their labour contracts.

Health Canada posted a recall notice Thursday for Rocky Mountain Bikes' Instinct, Instinct BC and Pipeline mountain bikes from 2018, 2019 and 2020. The notice says 1,466 of the bikes were sold in Canada and 1,527 were sold in the United States.

1171,"HALIFAX -- The Theodore Tugboat replica that has long been a children's favourite in the Halifax harbour is being put up for sale as COVID-19 causes a crash in tourism revenues in Nova Scotia.

The owners, Ambassatours Gray Line, are selling the vessel, which is a life-sized version of the TV character.

The asking price is $495,000.

Company CEO Dennis Campbell says the firm was thinking of selling before the pandemic, as they had to subsidize the boat's daily tours due to reduced demand.

Now, with COVID-19 causing huge reductions in travel to the province, Campbell says the company can't afford to keep operating the tug at a loss.

He says he's open to an out-of-province buyer, but is hoping a local group can find a way to continue operations in some form.

""With a severe reduction in visitation to the waterfront, due to COVID-19, we're encouraging Theodore, now age 20, to start a new life chapter,"" Campbell said.

Theodore Too, the vessel's official name, was built in Dayspring, N.S., in 2000 as a replica of the title character of the children's TV show, which aired on CBC TV between 1993 and 2001.

In the early years, the replica spent summers on the Great Lakes in Ontario and on the eastern seaboard of the United States and Canada, promoting tourism in Nova Scotia.

From the mid-2000s onward, the tugboat hosted child-themed tours of the Halifax harbour, with passengers including former fans of the television show.

However, Campbell notes that most children who watched the program in the 1990s are now in their 30s, and demand for tours has significantly decreased in recent years.

In an interview, Campbell said potential uses for the vessel range from a waterside cafe to a summer ferry, as the boat can carry up to 49 passengers.

At present, with social distancing rules in effect, the vessel could only take about 12 people per trip, he estimated.

He said the vessel has received full marine maintenance annually.

Campbell estimated a new owner would face monthly expenses of more than $2,000 to maintain it while dockside as a new use is developed.

Theodore Too is listed with Scruton Marine, marine brokers and consultants who specialize in the sale of commercial marine vessels.

1173,"Burger King is staging an intervention with its cows.

The chain has rebalanced the diet of some of the cows by adding lemon grass in a bid to limit bovine contributions to climate change. By tweaking their diet, Burger King said Tuesday that it believes it can reduce a cow's daily methane emissions by about 33%.

Cows emit methane as a by-product of their digestion, and that has become a potential public relations hurdle for major burger chains.

Greenhouse gas emissions from the agriculture sector made up 9.9% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in 2018, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Of that amount, methane emissions from livestock (called enteric fermentation) comprised more than a quarter of the emissions from the agriculture sector.

With an over-the-top social media campaign that teeters between vulgarity and science (sprinkled with more vulgarity), Burger King is banking on the heightened awareness of climate change and its responsibility to limit its own role.

According to a recent poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, about two out of three Americans say corporations have a responsibility to combat climate change. The gravitational pull of climate change is increasingly finding its way onto national political stage.

Potential customers are also cutting down on the amount of meat they consume, citing both environmental and dietary concerns. Burger King and rival McDonald's have added meat alternatives to their menus.

Two years ago McDonald's said it was taking steps to cut the greenhouse gases it emits. It tweaked the manner in which the beef in its Big Macs and Quarter Pounders was produced. The company said at the time that it expected the changes to prevent 150 million metric tons (165 million tons) of greenhouse gas emissions from being released into the atmosphere by 2030.

Burger King worked with scientists at the Autonomous University at the State of Mexico and at the University of California, Davis to test and develop its formula of adding 100 grams of lemongrass leaves to the cows' daily diets. Preliminary tests indicate that the lemongrass leaves help the cows release less methane as they digest their food.

""In them, we found some of our names, photos, and IP addresses,"" the organizers, who belong to a collective called C’est assez, said in a statement.

C’est assez was created to denounce sexual and psychological abuse following a wave of anonymous allegations on Instagram in Quebec over the past few weeks.

Multiple Instagram accounts created as a safe space for survivors to anonymously share their stories popped up for various Quebec regions.

Montreal’s, in particular, was a place for people to call out alleged abusers in the city’s music, tattoo, and piercings scenes – though the scope expanded as time progressed. The account, called victims_voices_montreal, is where popular TV personality Maripier Morin was called out, as was Simple Plan’s David Desrosiers.

""We’re taking this situation very seriously,"" C’est assez said of the threats that began to circulate online before the event. ""It’s a dark day for history.""

The event, titled Manifestation contre les agressions sexuelles, is currently scheduled to begin at 12 p.m. on Sunday in Montreal’s Parc Lafontaine.

""We need to take a step back and make sure it is truly our voices that will triumph during this day, rather than fear,"" the statement reads.

Despite the pushback, the group says it won’t be bullied into remaining silent.

""We must continue to confront the stereotypes and prejudices that result in some experiences not being considered legitimate,"" the statement says. ""Collectively, we must continue to fight. This demonstration of hate is just another example of daily violence that we are constantly confronted with, that we are denouncing through this new wave.""

The Montreal Instagram account for survivors' stories was deactivated indefinitely after it became difficult to manage, both due to a flood of submissions as well as harsh criticism from some – particularly when stories were posted about alleged abusers who had only been accused by one person.

That being said, accounts for several other Quebec regions – including Quebec City, the Laurentians, Monteregie and Outaouais – remain active, and one for Montreal universities was created just last week.

1176,"TORONTO -- News that 16 international flights carrying passengers who were later diagnosed with COVID-19 have landed in Canada since June 29 may have taken some Canadians by surprise.

After all, aren't borders closed? Hasn't the near-universal response to the pandemic been for countries to encourage their citizens to come home and discourage everyone else from visiting?

Why, then, are flights still arriving in Canada from international destinations including Addis Ababa, Cancun and Charlotte, N.C.?

The answer: Discouraging something is not the same as stopping it.

Yes, Canada's border has been closed to most non-Canadians since March 18, and to most Americans since March 21. Yes, the orders enacting those closures are still in force – until at least Aug. 21 for Americans and at least July 31 for the rest of the world. And yes, the demand for international flights plummeted in the early days of the pandemic and remains low now.

But flying a plane into Canada was never banned. When WestJet and Air Canada announced that they were suspending all their regular international flights, it wasn't because the government forced them to. It was because they calculated that doing so would be best for their business, as there were simply nowhere near enough passengers to make flying the routes worthwhile.

Since then, both airlines have resumed flights between Canada and destinations in the U.S. and overseas, albeit at frequencies far reduced from the pre-pandemic era. Many foreign airlines are flying between Canadian and international airports as well. A scan of the arrivals board on the website for Pearson International Airport in Toronto found that seven international flights from three different continents were scheduled to arrive within a three-hour span Wednesday afternoon.

Those flights, like all arriving from outside Canada, are still subject to many restrictions. For one, they are only allowed to land at four airports – those in Vancouver, Calgary, Toronto and Montreal. Additionally, only certain passengers are allowed to fly into the country: Canadian citizens and permanent residents, citizens' immediate family members, diplomats and air crews. There are also exemptions for temporary foreign workers, some students, anyone delivering urgent medical supplies, and others whose purpose for being in Canada is deemed to be essential.

Everyone entering the country for a non-essential reason must self-isolate for 14 days. Not doing so is a violation of the Quarantine Act and carries a maximum penalty of a $750,000 fine and six months in jail, although the publicly known penalties that have been levied during the pandemic are much smaller.

The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), which is tasked with following up with those who arrive in the country, has informed the RCMP of more than 21,000 cases in which they either could not contact the travellers or received what they describe as an ""indication of non-compliance"" with the Quarantine Act.

Nearly 1,500 of those cases were identified by the RCMP as serious enough to warrant a physical check-up, a PHAC spokesman said, and four resulted in fines.

It is not clear how many of the cases, check-ups or fines involved people who arrived in Canada by air. The spokesman said PHAC and the RCMP have been notified of 237 cases by the Canada Border Services Agency, which screens passengers at all entry points to Canada.

Similarly, although the government recommends that Canadians avoid all non-essential travel outside the country, it is not stopping anyone from leaving.

Border restrictions in some parts of the world may make it difficult for Canadians to get in, but other regions – including the nations of the European Union and some Central American and Caribbean countries – have made it clear that they are welcoming Canadians and other visitors.

There is nothing legally stopping any Canadian from taking a vacation to swelter in the sun in Jamaica, for example, by flying directly to and from Toronto, provided they self-isolate for 14 days upon their return.",Why a closed border hasn't kept international flights out of Canada,5,0.34625609407939617
1180,"GRETNA, LA. -- An appeals court has granted the killer of NFL player Joe McKnight a new trial because his manslaughter conviction was delivered by a split jury.

Ronald Gasser's 30-year sentence and manslaughter conviction were vacated Wednesday by the Louisiana 5th Circuit Court of Appeal, news outlets reported.

The panel's decision comes after the U.S. Supreme Court outlawed split-jury verdicts in April. The ruling was retroactive for all cases with convictions currently under appeal.

Gasser was convicted of manslaughter by a 10-2 vote in 2018. He had been tried for second-degree murder, but most of the jurors settled on the lesser charge.

Gasser fatally shot McKnight on Dec. 1, 2016 after a 5-mile (8-kilometre) chase over a bridge led to an altercation.

Witnesses at the trial said McKnight had been weaving in and out of traffic at high speed before the shooting. Prosecutors acknowledged to the jury that he was, in the words of Assistant District Attorney Seth Shute, ""driving like a jerk."" But they argued that Gasser escalated the conflict, following him down an exit that he would not ordinarily have taken moments prior to the shooting.

Gasser said he was defending himself because McKnight lunged into his car. The prosecutor said physical evidence proved Gasser lied.

Gasser's attorney, Dane Ciolino, praised the decision. Ciolino said Gasser would remain in custody until a bond hearing could be scheduled.

1183,"TORONTO -- While this summer may be a more subdued one for Earthlings, it’ll be a different story elsewhere in our solar system.

The population of Mars is on the verge of tripling as three new Mars missions from three different countries are set to launch within the next month, with two new rovers coming to the planet.

Curiosity is about to get some company.

Although Mars has been an object of fascination for years for humans millions of kilometres away on Earth, it is still a planet of vast mystery, and has been only marginally explored.

The Curiosity Rover, a NASA project, has called Mars home since 2012. Over the last few months, scientists have been commanding Curiosity from the comfort of their sofas at home instead of their offices at NASA.

The rover has been alone on the planet ever since Opportunity — which was sent to Mars with the Spirit rover in 2003 — stopped responding in 2018 following a massive dust storm that swept over the rover’s location on Mars. Opportunity’s mission was officially deemed complete in 2019 after months of NASA attempting to reconnect and revive the rover.

On July 30, NASA is sending Curiosity a new friend: their fifth Mars rover since the start of the program, called Perseverance.

Perseverance’s main mission is to look for signs of past life on Mars by studying the geology and taking rock and soil samples to be analyzed on Earth later. Previous explorations — including work done by Opportunity — have shown evidence that there was once water on Mars’ surface.

As water is one of the main building blocks of life as we know it, further evidence that Mars didn’t always used to be a dry, rocky wasteland could open up our understanding of how life could exist outside of our planet.

NASA has been sending rockets and landing craft to Mars for decades. But America’s martian monopoly is being challenged by China and the United Arab Emirates this summer, with both aiming to join the outer space elite.

Like the Americans, China is landing a rover on Mars this summer, called Tianwen-1, according to a press release from the China National Space Administration.

Although not many details of the mission have been released, the rover is set to launch sometime in July, and is China’s first Mars exploration mission.

The United Arab Emirates are not landing a rover on the planet, but are instead launching a mission to orbit Mars and observe from space.

The Hope Probe will circle the planet for two years studying weather and atmosphere, and will be the first of the three missions to launch this summer: a countdown on the UAE Space Agency website shows that the mission is launching next week, on July 15.

The mission is aiming to understand the climate dynamics of Mars, the structure of Mars’ atmosphere and why hydrogen and oxygen are escaping from the upper atmosphere into space.

So why are so many missions to Mars launching in the same month?

Because there is a unique window of opportunity right now. This is when Earth and Mars are closest together — something that only happens every two years.

Although these three missions are being operated by different countries, and have different goals, they all serve as important stepping stones towards the ultimate quest: achieving a human expedition to Mars by the end of the century.",Here are the three missions to Mars that are happening this month,4,0.2939317953132611
1184,"Methane emissions are at their highest level ever, with agriculture and fossil fuels the biggest drivers, according to new research.

Climate models suggest that continued increases in methane levels could see global temperatures increase by 3-4 degrees Celsius by 2100, researchers from the Global Carbon Project said in a statement published Wednesday.

Researchers looked at methane emissions from 2000 to 2017, the last year for which complete global data are available, and warn that the current path leads toward a ""dangerous temperature threshold,"" according to the statement.

Both natural disasters, such as wildfires, floods and droughts, and social disruptions, including mass migrations and famines, would become ""almost commonplace,"" it said.

Methane is 28 times more effective than carbon dioxide at trapping heat over 100 years, the team said, and human activity accounts for more than half of methane emissions.

Annual emissions of the greenhouse gas have risen by 9% since 2000, which has the same effect on warming as adding 350 million cars to our roads.

The team, led by Rob Jackson, a professor of Earth system science in Stanford University's School of Earth, Energy & Environmental Sciences, published two papers in the journals Earth System Science Data and Environmental Research Letters on Wednesday.

The research showed that cattle ranching is the main reason for increased methane levels.

""Emissions from cattle and other ruminants are almost as large as those from the fossil fuel industry for methane,"" Jackson said. ""People joke about burping cows without realizing how big the source really is.""

Agriculture as a whole produces two-thirds of total emissions, with rice cultivation and biomass burning also significant contributors, according to the researchers.

Fossil fuels account for most of the remaining third, and the two sources have contributed almost equally to the recent increases.

While carbon emissions fell significantly during the coronavirus lockdown, as manufacturing and transport activity fell off a cliff, that's not the case for methane, according to Jackson.

""We're still heating our homes and buildings, and agriculture keeps growing,"" he said.

Africa and the Middle East, China, and South Asia and Oceania saw the sharpest rises in methane emissions, with the US close behind.

In the US, the increase has been driven by increasing use of natural gas. This reduces CO2 emissions by offsetting the use of coal, but it releases more methane.

Europe is the only region where methane emissions have fallen, thanks in part in greater efficiency in agriculture and reduced emissions from chemical manufacturing.

""Policies and better management have reduced emissions from landfills, manure and other sources here in Europe. People are also eating less beef and more poultry and fish,"" said Marielle Saunois of the Université de Versailles Saint-Quentin in France, lead author of the paper in Earth System Science Data.

The biggest rises in emissions were seen in tropical and temperate regions.

Researchers say it is hard to work out where natural methane emissions are coming from, compared with human-driven emissions.

In order to reduce methane emissions we need to cut the use of fossil fuels and control emissions from leaky pipelines and wells, the researchers said, with Jackson optimistic that drones, satellites and aircraft monitoring wells will lead to major progress in the field in the next five years.

We also need to implement new ways of growing and eating food, the team said, for example by supplementing cattle feed with algae that can reduce the amount of methane burped out by cows.

On Tuesday, fast food chain Burger King announced a plan to improve its cows' diet by adding lemongrass to their feed.

This change in diet will reduce the cows' methane emissions by 33% a day, the company said.",World's methane emissions at record high and burping cows may be driving the rise,4,0.816135550597578
1186,"A heatwave in Siberia that saw temperature records tumble as the region sweltered in 38-degree Celsius highs was ""almost impossible"" without the influence of man-made climate change, leading scientists said.

An international team of researchers found that the record-breaking warm period was more than 2C hotter than it would have been if humans had not warmed the planet through decades of greenhouse gas emissions.

The five hottest years in history have occurred in the last five years and there's a better-than-even chance that 2020 will be the hottest ever recorded.

Earth's poles are warming faster than the rest of the planet, and temperatures in Siberia -- home to much of the world's carbon-rich permafrost -- were more than 5C hotter than average between January and June.

One town, Verkhoyansk, recorded a temperature of 38C (100.4 Fahrenheit) -- smashing previous records.

Andrew Ciavarella, senior detection and attribution scientist at Britain's Met Office, described the findings released Wednesday as ""staggering"".

""This is further evidence of the extreme temperatures we can expect to see more frequently around the world in a warming climate,"" he said.

The impact of climate change on extreme weather events such as super storms and droughts is now well established, but until fairly recently scientists have been unable to definitively link an individual event to global warming.

As part of a growing area of climate research known as attribution science, the team ran computer simulations of temperatures with the climate as it is today -- around 1C hotter than the pre-Industrial era baseline.

They then compared this to a model generating temperatures over Siberia this year without human influence -- that is, without the additional manmade 1C.

They found that the prolonged heat would happen less than once every 80,000 years without human induced climate change.

This makes the heatwave ""almost impossible in a climate that had not been warmed by greenhouse gas emissions"", the team said, adding that carbon pollution had made the extreme event at least 600 times more likely to occur.

'IMPORTANT FOR EVERYONE'

The team behind the calculations stressed that the Siberian heatwave was a problem for the entire globe.

Some 1.15 million hectares of forest going up in flames released millions of tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere. At the same time, the wildfires and sustained heatwaves accelerated the region's permafrost melt.

This caused an oil tank built on frozen soil to collapse in May, leading to one of the region's worst-ever oil spills.

Russia's aerial forest protection service, the agency that specialises in forest fires, said Wednesday that more than 5,000 people are working on 197 fires across Russia in an area of over 40,000 hectares, including eight in nature reserves.

""Such a prolonged heat wave is important, not only for its influence on people, but also from a scientific point of view,"" said Olga Zolina, from Russia's P.P. Shirshov Institute of Oceanography.

""The arctic is very, very important generally for forming of weather and circulation. So such high temperatures are really important for the whole globe.""

While the research was compiled rapidly and has not yet been subjected to peer-review, authors said it produced ""among the strongest results of any attribution study conducted to date.""

'NO CHANCE’

The 2015 Paris climate deal commits nations to capping temperature rises to ""well-below"" 2C (3.6 degrees Farenheit) above pre-industrial levels and to strive for a 1.5C limit if at all possible.

With just 1C of warming so far, Earth is already buffeted by record-breaking droughts, wild fires and super storms made more potent by rising sea levels.

To keep in line with the 1.5C target, the United Nations says global emissions must fall by 7.6 percent every year this decade.

Sonia Seneviratne, from ETH Zurich's Department of Environmental Systems Science, said the research showed the heatwave was an example of ""extreme events which would have almost no chance of happening"" without manmade emissions.

1188,"SINGAPORE, SINGAPORE -- Twin red-ruffed lemurs have been born at Singapore zoo, officials said Thursday, a rare double delivery that is a boost for the endangered saucer-eyed primates.

It was the first birth at the zoo of the endangered creatures, which are native to Madagascar, in over a decade, Wildlife Reserves Singapore said.

The arrival of the yet-to-be-named twins was ""particularly special"" because the creatures breed only once a year, it said.

The fluffy lemurs are a distinctive rust colour, with black faces, hands, feet and tails, and a distinctive white patch on their heads.

The last of the species to be born at the zoo was the twins' father, Bosco, 11 years ago. The mother is eight-year-old Minnie, who arrived in Singapore from a Japanese zoo in 2016.

Although the twins were born earlier this year, they have only recently become an attraction as the zoo was closed for months as a result of a coronavirus lockdown.

Red-ruffed lemurs are classified as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature due to logging and hunting.

1189,"CAPE CANAVERAL, FLA. -- Spacewalking astronauts completed their part of a three-year power upgrade to the International Space Station on Thursday, replacing six more outdated batteries with powerful new ones.

It was the third spacewalk in as many weeks involving battery work by NASA's Bob Behnken and Chris Cassidy.

Running more than an hour ahead of schedule, they managed to complete the battery swaps in a single spacewalk rather than two. Their fourth spacewalk next week will now focus on other chores.

""Great job,"" Mission Control radioed.

Behnken and Cassidy swiftly removed six of the remaining old nickel-hydrogen batteries and plugged in three new lithium-ion units.

The lithium-ion batteries -- big, boxy units with a mass of more than 400 pounds (180 kilograms ) -- are so powerful that only half as many are needed. The batteries store power gathered by the station's solar panels for use on the nighttime side of Earth.

The effort to replace all of the space station's 48 aging batteries began in January 2017, requiring 11 spacewalks to date.

One new battery shorted out in 2019 and the old ones had to be re-installed. One more spacewalk remains, likely this fall. NASA is putting it off instead of tackling it next week because it would involve powering down that power channel.

Besides, the two remaining old batteries are working well with all the new ones, said Rob Navias, a spokesman at Johnson Space Center in Houston. ""We are fat with power and there is no rush,"" he said in an email.

NASA expects these new batteries to last the rest of the space station's operational life -- another four years from now at least.

Much of Thursday's six-hour spacewalk unfolded more than 260 miles (420 kilometres) up under the bright glare of daylight. ""Can't control the sun,"" Cassidy noted. ""Small price to pay for it not going away, I guess. It's nice to be in daylight the whole time.""

Behnken arrived at the space station at the end of May on a SpaceX capsule, the company's first astronaut flight. He and Doug Hurley are scheduled to return to Earth in the Dragon capsule in early August.

Cassidy, the space station's commander, is halfway through a six-month mission. A Russian Soyuz capsule is his ride to and from the orbiting outpost.

1194,"OTTAWA -- John Bolton, the former national security adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump is imploring Canada to “bear with” the United States when it comes to the extradition proceedings of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou. Bolton says, despite the ongoing and “clearly” political detention of Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, there shouldn’t be a “prisoner swap” some are suggesting.

“I know Canada's being abused now. Its citizens are being held without any reason what[so]ever by the Chinese authorities, and I know there's a debate about this in Canada. All I can say is, bear with us on this. It's important we stick together,” said Bolton told Evan Solomon in a radio interview about his newly released book memoir about working in Trump’s White House: The Room Where It Happened.

The full interview aired Tuesday on the national iHeartRadio talk show The Evan Solomon Show.

“If this is the way China treats a country like Canada now, imagine how it will treat Canada when its influence around the world has expanded,” Bolton said.

As The Associated Press has reported, Bolton’s book details his time in the White House, and includes several allegations including a claim that Trump asked China for help winning the upcoming presidential election.

Bolton also writes that Trump made matters worse by implying that Meng’s extradition could be used as a bargaining chip in trade negotiations.

'BIG MISTAKE' TO RELEASE MENG

Asked if the Trump administration was using Canada by asking the Trudeau government to act on the U.S. extradition order and arrest Meng in Canada in order for Trump to have leverage with China, Bolton said Trump was the only one in the administration to think of Meng’s arrest as a political tool in China trade talks.

“It would be a big mistake to trade a criminal prosecution against Huawei and its chief financial officer for some kind of trade deal with China, which honestly, I don't think China is going to abide by anyway,” Bolton said.

For U.S. politicians the trade-based argument against dropping the extradition proceedings is different than the current conversation unfolding in Canada, where 19 high-profile former diplomats, politicians and academics have all called on Canada to consider halting the extradition process in order to get ""the two Michaels"" released.

Kovrig and Spavor were arrested separately in the days following Meng's arrest. Both men had been held in China without charges from December 2018 until June 19 when they were formally charged with espionage.

When asked about a swap, the prime minister strongly shot down the idea saying, if countries around the world including China saw that “arbitrarily arresting random Canadians” would be leverage to “get what they want out of Canada,” that would put Canadians abroad at risk.

Asked whether he thought the arrests of Kovrig and Spavor was retaliatory, Bolton said: “I think it clearly was for political reasons.”

“I don't think it should be a prisoner swap,” Bolton said.

“Huawei is an arm of the Chinese State... It's heavily subsidized and guided by decisions of the Chinese government, and it's part of the of the Chinese effort to affect telecommunications and information technology systems all over the world,” Bolton said.

TRUMP 'TOLERATED' TRUDEAU

Among the revelations in the book was that, according to Bolton Trump doesn’t like Trudeau and that he “tolerated” him. Asked why he thought Trump allegedly is not a fan of the prime minister, Bolton cited the early tensions of the NAFTA renegotiations.

“Part of the problem with the way Trump approaches foreign policy, in my view, is that he has difficulty distinguishing between the national interest of the countries involved, let's say the U.S. and Canada on the one hand versus the personal relationship between the leaders of the two countries on the other,” Bolton said.

He said, in his view, Trump’s personal feelings towards Trudeau “made it a lot harder to get things done.”

One particularly acrimonious interaction was at the 2018 G7 summit Canada hosted in Charlevoix, Que. It was after that meeting that Trump pulled out of the joint communique before he and his administration officials took aim at Trudeau, calling him “meek and mild” and “very dishonest and weak.”

“Trump felt that he had been backed into a corner in the G7 communique… When he saw Prime Minister Trudeau giving a closing press conference, he thought that he was unfairly treated, that led him to withdraw the U.S. from the communique… But that was an example where that personal reaction to what was being said led to a consequence that made the subsequent NATO Summit, for example, even more difficult than it would have been anyway,” Bolton said.

'HOPED TO MAKE A CONTRIBUTION'

Bolton did not testify in the Trump impeachment trial, and he has been criticized for saving the accusations about his former boss for his book, which Trump’s lawyers tried to get stopped from being released.

Asked to respond to those who have said Bolton has lost his moral authority after withholding what he knew to cash in with his book, Bolton said it’s “completely wrong.”

“Look, if my objective in life had been to make money, I never would have worked for the administration of Ronald Reagan, George HW Bush, George W. Bush or Donald Trump,” Bolton said.

He said he joined the Trump administration because he didn’t think it could have been as bad as people were saying.

1197,"TANZANIA, Tanzania - Russia scored a victory for its ally Syria on Saturday by forcing the Security Council to limit humanitarian aid deliveries to the country’s mainly rebel-held northwest to just one crossing point from Turkey, a move that Western nations say will cut a lifeline for 1.3 million people. Russia argues that aid should be delivered from within the country across conflict lines, and says only one crossing point is needed. U.N. officials and humanitarian groups argued unsuccessfully — along with the vast majority of the U.N. Security Council — that the two crossing points in operation until their mandate expired Friday were essential for getting help to millions of needy people in Syria’s northwest, especially with the first case of COVID-19 recently reported in the region. The Security Council vote approving a single crossing from Turkey was 12-0, with Russia, China and the Dominican Republic abstaining. The vote capped a week of high-stakes rivalry pitting Russia and China against the 13 other council members. An overwhelming majority voted twice to maintain the two crossings from Turkey, but Russia and China vetoed both resolutions — the 15th and 16th veto by Russia of a Syria resolution since the conflict began in 2011 and the ninth and 10th by China. Germany and Belgium, which had sponsored the widely supported resolutions for two crossing points, finally had to back down to the threat of another Russian veto. The resolution they put forward Saturday authorized only a single crossing point from Turkey for a year. In January, Russia also scored a victory for Syria, using its veto threat to force the Security Council to adopt a resolution reducing the number of crossing points for aid deliveries from four to two, from Turkey to the northwest. It also cut in half the yearlong mandate that had been in place since cross-border deliveries began in 2014 to six months. Before adopting the resolution Saturday, the council rejected two amendments proposed by Russia, including one suggesting that U.S. and European Union sanctions on Syria were impeding humanitarian aid. That contention was vehemently rejected by the Trump administration and the EU, which noted their sanctions include exemptions for humanitarian deliveries. It also rejected an amendment from China. Russia’s deputy U.N. ambassador, Dmitry Polyansky, said after the vote that from the beginning Moscow had proposed one crossing — from Bab al-Hawa to Idlib — and that Saturday’s resolution could have been adopted weeks ago. He said Russia abstained in the vote because negotiations over the resolution were marred by “clumsiness, disrespect.” Polyansky accused Western nations on the council of “unprecedented heights” of hypocrisy, saying they were ready to jeopardize cross-border aid over the references to unilateral sanctions. He said cross-border aid to Syria’s northwest doesn’t comply with international law because the U.N. has no presence in the region, which he described as being controlled “by international terrorists and fighters” that make it impossible to control and monitor who gets aid. German Ambassador Christoph Heusgen retorted that while Russia talks about delivery of aid across conflict lines, “in practice it doesn’t” happen. He said his side fought to maintain multiple crossing points for aid, including the Al-Yaroubiya crossing point from Iraq in the northeast that was closed in January, because that is what is needed for efficient delivery of aid to millions in need — and he asked Polyansky “this is clumsy?” “This is what we tried to do over these past weeks, to get the optimum to the population,” Heusgen said. U.S. Ambassador Kelly Craft told the council: “Today’s outcome leaves us sickened and outraged at the loss of the Bab al-Salaam and Al Yarubiyah border crossings.” “Behind those locked gates are millions of women, children, and men who believed that the world had heard their pleas. Their health and welfare are now at great risk,” she said. Still, Craft called the authorization of access through Bab al-Hawa for 12 months “a victory” in light of Russia and China’s “willingness to use their veto to compel a dramatic reduction in humanitarian assistance.” “This solemn victory must not end our struggle to address the mounting human needs in Syria — that fight is far from over,” Craft said. Belgium and Germany said in a joint statement that 1.3 million people, including 800 000 displaced Syrians, live in the Aleppo area, including 500,000 children who received humanitarian aid through the Bab al-Salam crossing — and now have that aid cut off. “Today is yet another sad day.

On Thursday, the vessel’s operator Ambassatours Gray Line announced they are selling Theodore for $495,000.

“While we are deeply aware of Theodore’s significance as a Halifax icon, the reality is that we've been subsidizing Theodore’s operation for several years,” Dennis Campbell, the CEO of Ambassatours Gray Line, said in a press release.

With a red ball cap and friendly smile, the life-sized replica Theodore Tugboat was modelled after the title character in the popular children’s Canadian television program of the same name, which aired from 1993 to 2001.

Campbell made note of the fact that the character’s popularity has waned in recent years as the generation that watched the show grew up.

“Most children who watched the television show in the 90s, are now in their 30s,” he explained. “Demand for TV-show themed Theodore tours of the Halifax harbour has significantly diminished over the past several years.”

In addition to its fading popularity among children, Campbell said the COVID-19 pandemic has also added to the tour company’s woes.

“With a severe reduction in visitation to the waterfront, due to COVID-19, we’re encouraging Theodore, now age 20, to start a new life chapter,” he said.

The 20-metre long (65 foot) passenger vessel, which is also known as Theodore Too, was built in Dayspring, N.S. in 2000. Ambassatours Gray Line said the boat spent its early years promoting Nova Scotia tourism by travelling through the Great Lakes and Canadian and American eastern seaboard.

By the mid-2000s and onwards, Theodore was used solely for themed tours of the Halifax Harbour.

Now that it’s up for sale, Campbell said the vessel, which is registered to carry 49 passengers, may have value in a new role as a waterside cafe or pub, event venue, summer ferry, or unique Airbnb.

Theodore is equipped with two washrooms, sleeping quarters for eight passengers, an interior dining area, and a full kitchen, according to the operator.

The seller also said the boat has undergone annual “full marine maintenance.”

The listing for Theodore Too by Scruton Marine, marine brokers and consultants specializing in the sale of commercial vessels, includes several other specifications for the iconic boat.

Following news of Theodore’s listing, a couple of GoFundMe pages have popped up with the aim of purchasing the tugboat in order to keep it in the Halifax Harbour.",A new life chapter': Beloved 'Theodore Tugboat' replica vessel up for sale,6,0.021664682628631304
1200,"TOKYO - China is pushing harder to make territorial claims in the regional seas and even using the coronavirus pandemic to expand its influence and take strategic superiority, posing a greater threat to Japan and the region, Japan’s government said. The report highlighting the government’s defence priorities was adopted by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s Cabinet on Tuesday, less than a day after the Trump administration rejected outright nearly all of Beijing’s significant maritime claims in the South China Sea in a statement likely to deepen the U.S.-China rift. The Abe government’s Defence White Paper 2020 highlights what are potential Chinese and North Korean threats as Japan tries to further increase its defence capability. Under Abe, Japan has steadily increased its defence budget and capability and purchased costly American arsenals. Defence Minister Taro Kono recently scrapped the deployment of a pair of costly U.S. land-based missile intercepting systems due to technical issues, and Abe quickly announced his intention to revise Japan’s defence guidelines, possibly allowing Japan to go beyond its conventional defence-only role under the Japan-U.S. security alliance, including discussing a possibility of acquiring a preemptive strike capability. The White Paper accused China of using propaganda, including spreading disinformation, about the spread of the coronavirus. “The COVID-19 pandemic may expose and intensify strategic competition among countries intending to create international and regional orders more preferable to themselves and to expand their influence,” the report said. “We need to closely watch their move with serious concern affecting the national security.” As evidence, a Japanese Defence Ministry official noted that a Chinese Foreign Ministry official had posted on Twitter in March an accusation that the U.S. military had spread the coronavirus in Wuhan and that Chinese media have touted herbal medicine as effective COVID-19 treatments. He spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing department rules. The annual report said China has “relentlessly” pushed to “change the status quo” in the Asian seas, including sending 3,000-ton class government vessels into Japanese waters around Japan-controlled disputed East China Sea islands called Senkaku in Japanese. Beijing also claim the islands and call them Diaoyu. China is also pursuing its unilateral attempt in the South China Sea even more aggressively and even expanding its area of activity into more distant seas, a concern shared by the international community, the report said. The South China Sea problem “directly affects peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.” “As China now boasts its capability and makes attempts to unilaterally change the status quo in many places, we must closely grasp what China’s intentions are,” Kono told a news conference Tuesday. Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said that Japan’s defence paper is full of prejudice and false information against China, and that it tried its best to hype the so-called “China threat.” “China has always firmly maintained its sovereignty, security and development interests. All attack or discredit on China are futile,” Zhao said. He urged Japan to stop deliberately intensifying tensions and get along with China. The report also cited North Korea’s continued development of its nuclear and other weapons programs. The North is “relentlessly pursuing increasingly complex and diverse modes of attack and is steadily strengthening and improving its attack capabilities,“ the report said. It said North Korea since May 2019 has launched three types of new short-range ballistic missiles that use solid fuel and fly at lower altitudes than their conventional missiles that can breach Japanese missile defence system. As Japan’s relations with South Korea have plunged to their lowest levels recently over wartime history, export control and territorial issues, the report prompted Seoul to protest Japan’s claims over a set of small South Korea-controlled islets between the countries. The report mentions the islands as part of Japanese territories that remain unresolved. Foreign ministry spokesman Kim In-chul issued a statement urging Tokyo to “immediately” remove such claims from the report, saying that the islets called Dokdo in the Koreas and Takeshima in Japan are South Korean territory by international law. ___ Associated Press writer Kim Tong-hyung in Seoul, South Korea, and researcher Liu Zheng in Beijing contributed to this report. ___ Follow Mari Yamaguchi on Twitter at https://www.twitter.com/mariyamaguchi ",Japan says coronavirus adds to security threat by China,5,0.38323864066304636
1202,"BEIJING -- China has moved a rocket into position to launch a rover to Mars in one of three upcoming missions to the red planet, one from the U.S. and another by the United Arab Emirates.

The Long March-5 carrier rocket is China's heaviest-lift launch vehicle and has been used experimentally three times, but never with a payload. Dubbed Tianwen-1, China's mission to Mars aims to land a rover to gather scientific data.

The rocket is due to blast off from the Wenchang Space Launch Center in the southern island province of Hainan in late July or early August, according to state media reports Friday that quoted the China National Space Administration.

The mission is one of the most ambitious yet for China's space program, which has advanced rapidly since launching its first crewed mission in 2003. Since then, it has sent astronauts to an experimental space station, begun work on a larger, more permanent facility and landed a probe on the less-explored far side of the moon.

This summer's trio of missions in the most sweeping effort yet to seek signs of ancient microscopic life while scouting out Mars for future astronauts.

The timelines for such missions are daunting and the countries involved are striving to take best advantage of a one-month window in which Mars and Earth are in ideal alignment on the same side of the sun, minimizing travel time and fuel use. Such a window opens only once every 26 months.

Preparations have continued amid the coronavirus outbreak, which in part prompted Europe and Russia to drop their plans to send a life-seeking rover to Mars this summer.

Each spacecraft will travel more than 480 million kilometres (300 million miles) before reaching Mars next February. In the process, they will loop out beyond Earth's orbit and sync up with Mars' more distant orbit around the sun.

The U.S. is sending over a car-sized six-wheeled rover named Perseverance to collect rock samples to be returned to Earth for analysis in about a decade. It's launch date has been set for between July 30 and Aug. 15.

The UAE spacecraft, named Amal, or ""Hope"" in Arabic, is an orbiter built in partnership with the University of Colorado Boulder and is now scheduled to launch from Japan on Monday. It will be the Arab world's first interplanetary mission.

Scientists want to know what Mars was like billions of years ago, back when it had water sources that may have supported tiny life forms before turning into the frozen world it is today.

So far, the U.S. has been the only country to successfully put a spacecraft on Mars, doing it eight times. Two NASA landers are operating there, InSight and Curiosity. Six other spacecraft are exploring the planet from orbit: three U.S., two European and one from India.

China's last attempt at a Mars mission in collaboration with Russia ended in failure in 2011.

1203,"TOKYO -- The liftoff of a United Arab Emirates' Mars orbiter, postponed due to bad weather at the launch site in southern Japan, is now set for Monday.

The orbiter named Amal, or Hope, is the Arab world's first interplanetary mission. The launch, initially scheduled for Wednesday from the Tanegashima Space Center, has been reset for 6:58 a.m. Monday (2158 GMT Sunday), Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, the provider of the H-IIA rocket, said Friday.

Mitsubishi, however, said there is a slight chance of further postponement depending on the weather. The company has set a launch window through Aug. 13. A final decision is expected Sunday.

Hope is to reach Mars in February 2021, the year the U.A.E. celebrates 50 years since its formation. A successful Hope mission would be a major step for the oil-dependent economy seeking a future in space.

Two other Mars missions are planned in coming days by the U.S. and China. Japan has its own Martian moon mission planned in 2024.

Hope carries three instruments to study the upper atmosphere and monitor climate change and is scheduled to circle the red planet for at least two years. The U.A.E. says it will provide a complete view of the Martian atmosphere during different seasons for the first time.

""I'm looking forward to a successful launch,"" Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi said. He said the scheduled launch of a Japanese rocket carrying U.A.E.'s Hope probe ""is a symbol of our firm relations between Japan and U.A.E.""

Resource-poor Japan has traditionally kept friendly ties with Middle Eastern countries. In recent years, Japan has increasingly stepped up trade and defence ties with the U.A.E, and now seeks to expand its space business.

1207,"PARIS, FRANCE -- Scientists said Thursday they had obtained the closest ever images taken of the sun as part of a pan-European mission to study solar winds and flares that could have far-reaching impacts back on Earth.

The European Space Agency's Solar Orbiter blasted off from Florida's Cape Canaveral in February and completed its first fly by of our star last month, sending back unprecedented images of phenomena close to its surface.

""The first images are exceeding our expectations,"" said Daniel Muller, Solar Orbiter project scientist at ESA.

""We can already see hints of very interesting phenomena that we have not been able to observe in detail before.

""This makes us confident that Solar Orbiter will help us answer profound open questions about the Sun.""

In particular, the team observed dozens of miniature solar flares, known as ""campfires"", which until now had never been captured on film.

David Berghmans, from Belgium's Royal Observatory, said the campfires were several million times smaller than solar flares, which can be observed from Earth.

""The Sun seems relatively calm on first viewing but when you look at it in detail you can see miniature eruptions everywhere,"" he said.

Solar winds and flares emit billions of highly charged particles that impact planets, including Earth. But the phenomena remain poorly understood despite decades of research.

The largest solar storm on record hit North America in September 1859, knocking out much of the continent's telegraph network and bathing the skies in an aurora viewable as far away as the Caribbean.

Solar ejections can also disrupt radar systems, radio networks and can even render satellites useless, though such extremes are rare.

During its first orbit, the craft -- developed in conjunction with NASA -- travelled around 77 million kilometres (48 million miles) from the surface, about half the distance between the Sun and Earth.

Equipped to withstand temperatures as high as 500 degrees Celsius (930 Fahrenheit), it will eventually travel as close as 40 million kilometres from the surface, protecting its instruments with a heat-resistant structure that will be exposed to sunlight 13 times stronger than on Earth.

Its operators plan to gradually tilt the craft's orbit, enabling scientists to obtain the first ever images of the Sun's poles.

1209,"OTTAWA -- Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has confirmed that Canadian and U.S. officials have agreed to keep the border between the two countries closed to non-essential travel until August 21.

The ban on discretionary travel was first introduced in March and has been extended each month since. The latest extension was set to expire on July 21.

""Once again, Canada and the United States have agreed to extend the current border measures by one month until August 21, and we're going to keep working closely with our American neighbours to keep people safe on both sides of the border,” Trudeau said on Thursday.

The extension was expected, with sources telling CTV News earlier this week that it was coming.

The agreement, as it stands, exempts the flow of trade and commerce, as well as temporary foreign workers and vital health-care workers such as nurses who live and work on opposite sides of the border. Tourists and cross-border visits remain prohibited.

This is the fourth renewal of the border restrictions since the coronavirus pandemic was declared, and comes as cases of COVID-19 continue to surge in the United States. Canada’s epidemic curve has flattened and most of the country is reopening under ongoing precautions in what’s been described as the new normal for the foreseeable future.

As of June 9, foreign nationals who are immediate family members of either Canadian citizens or permanent residents can enter Canada to be reunited, under a limited exemption to the current border restrictions. This has allowed both foreign and cross-border Canada-U.S. families to reunite under certain stipulations.

1210,"JACKSON, Miss. - A Confederate monument that’s long been a divisive symbol at the University of Mississippi was removed Tuesday from a prominent spot on the Oxford campus, just two weeks after Mississippi surrendered the last state flag in the U.S. with the Confederate battle emblem. The marble statue of a saluting Confederate soldier was taken to a Civil War cemetery in a secluded area of campus. Students and faculty have pushed the university for years to move the statue, but they have said in recent weeks that their work was being undermined by administrators’ plan to beautify the cemetery — a plan that critics said could create a Confederate shrine. A draft plan by the university indicated that the burial ground will have a lighted pathway to the statue. It also said headstones might be added to Confederate soldiers’ graves that have been unmarked for decades. Ole Miss Chancellor Glenn Boyce said Tuesday that the plan for headstones was being abandoned. Boyce said a recent survey with ground-penetrating radar showed that bodies are buried close to the surface. “I feel excavating within the walls of the cemetery presents a significant risk of disturbing remains,” Boyce said in a statement. “This is a risk I am not prepared nor willing to take.” The University of Mississippi was founded in 1848, and the statue of the soldier was put up in 1906 — one of many Confederate monuments erected across the South more than a century ago. Critics say the statue’s location near the university’s main administrative building has sent a signal that Ole Miss glorifies the Confederacy and glosses over the South’s history of slavery. The state College Board on June 18 approved a plan to move the monument. The decision happened amid widespread debate over Confederate symbols as people across the U.S. and in other countries loudly marched through the streets to protest racism and police violence against African Americans. The statue at Ole Miss was a gathering point in 1962 for people who rioted to oppose court-ordered integration of the university. In February 2019, a rally by outside pro-Confederate groups at the monument prompted Ole Miss basketball players to kneel in protest during the national anthem at a game later that day. Student government leaders voted two weeks later for a resolution asking administrators to move the monument to the cemetery, where Confederate soldiers killed at the Battle of Shiloh are buried. One of the student senators sponsoring that resolution was Arielle Hudson of Tunica, Mississippi, who graduated this year and has been selected as a Rhodes scholar. She said Thursday that her joy at knowing the statue was moved was tempered by concerns about the university’s elaborate cemetery plan. Hudson said she was pleased to hear that Boyce abandoned the headstone plan but she wishes he had done it without having to be pressured by hundreds of students, faculty members and alumni. As a student, Hudson gave tours to prospective students through an “ambassador” program. She said ambassadors were generally told to avoid the Confederate statue, but she once ended up near it. “Those conversations were hard, especially as a Black student trying to convince other Black students and their families that they belong here,“ Hudson said Thursday. ”You’re standing a few feet away from an object that tells them that space wasn’t made for them.” The University of Mississippi has worked for more than 20 years to distance itself from Confederate imagery, often amid resistance from tradition-bound donors and alumni. The nickname for athletic teams remains the Rebels, but the university retired its Colonel Reb mascot in 2003 amid criticism that the bearded old man looked like a plantation owner. In 1997, administrators banned sticks in the football stadium, which largely stopped people from waving Confederate battle flags. The marching band no longer plays “Dixie.” Because of a student-led effort, the university in 2015 stopped flying the Confederate-themed Mississippi flag. A groundswell of support from business, religious, education and sports leaders recently pushed legislators to retire the flag. Since 2016, the university has installed plaques to provide historical context about the Confederate monument and about slaves who built some campus buildings before the Civil War. A plaque installed at the base of the Confederate statue said such monuments were built across the South decades after the Civil War, at a time when aging Confederate veterans were dying. “These monuments were often used to promote an ideology known as the ‘Lost Cause,’ which claimed that the Confederacy had been established to defend states’ rights and that slavery was not the principal cause of the Civil War,” the plaque says. “Although the monument was created to honour the sacrifice of Confederate soldiers, it must also remind us that the defeat of the Confederacy actually meant freedom for millions of people.” ___ Follow Emily Wagster Pettus on Twittter at http://twitter.com/EWagsterPettus.

1211,"BOSTON - Facing eight federal lawsuits and opposition from hundreds of universities, the Trump administration on Tuesday rescinded a rule that would have required international students to transfer or leave the country if their schools held classes entirely online because of the coronavirus pandemic. The decision was announced at the start of a hearing in a federal lawsuit in Boston brought by Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs said federal immigration authorities agreed to pull the July 6 directive and “return to the status quo.” A lawyer representing the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said only that the judge’s characterization was correct. The announcement brings relief to thousands of foreign students who had been at risk of being deported from the country, along with hundreds of universities that were scrambling to reassess their plans for the fall in light of the policy. With the policy rescinded, ICE will revert to a directive from March that suspended typical limits around online education for foreign students. ICE did not immediately comment on the decision. Harvard President Lawrence Bacow called it a “significant victory.” “While the government may attempt to issue a new directive, our legal arguments remain strong and the Court has retained jurisdiction, which would allow us to seek judicial relief immediately to protect our international students should the government again act unlawfully,” Bacow said in a statement. MIT’s president said his institution also stands ready “to protect our students from any further arbitrary policies.” “This case also made abundantly clear that real lives are at stake in these matters, with the potential for real harm,“ President L. Rafael Reif said in a statement. ”We need to approach policy making, especially now, with more humanity, more decency — not less.” Under the policy, international students in the U.S. would have been forbidden from taking all their courses online this fall. New visas would not have been issued to students at schools planning to provide all classes online, which includes Harvard. Students already in the U.S. would have faced deportation if they didn’t transfer schools or leave the country voluntarily. Even if an outbreak had forced colleges to move all their classes online during the semester, international students would have been forced to transfer to a school with campus instruction or leave the country. Immigration officials issued the policy last week, reversing the earlier guidance from March 13 telling colleges that limits around online education would be suspended during the pandemic. University leaders believed the rule was part of President Donald Trump’s effort to pressure the nation’s schools and colleges to reopen this fall even as new virus cases rise. The policy drew sharp backlash from higher education institutions, with more than 200 signing court briefs supporting the challenge by Harvard and MIT. Colleges said the policy would put students’ safety at risk and hurt schools financially. Many schools rely on tuition from international students, and some stood to lose millions of dollars in revenue if the rule had taken hold. Harvard and MIT were the first to contest the policy, but at least seven other federal suits had been filed by universities and states. The unexpected decision was welcome news to students across the nation who had been on edge. “I feel relief,” said Andrea Calderon, a 29-year-old biology graduate student from Ecuador. “It would have been a very big problem if I had to leave the country right now.” The City College of New York student said returning home would have made it much harder to finish her thesis and pursue a Ph.D. Internet access at home in Ecuador is spotty, she said, and going through the process to come back to the U.S. in the future would be too expensive. Rahul Lobo, 19, from Goa on the west coast of India, said he feels “an immeasurable amount of relief.” “As it is, we’re living in very uncertain times, and the recent ICE policy just made things even more uncertain,” said Lobo, a rising junior at the University of Notre Dame. “Suddenly I wasn’t worrying about whether I could get back to campus, but more whether I would even be able to finish my degree in four years.“ The American Council on Education, which represents university presidents, applauded ICE’s pullback of the rule. The group called the policy “wrongheaded” and said it drew unprecedented opposition from colleges. “There has never been a case where so many institutions sued the federal government,” said Terry Hartle, the group’s senior vice-president. “In this case, the government didn’t even try to defend its policymaking.” Many opponents, however, were hesitant to call it a closed case. Massachusetts’ Democratic attorney general, who is leading a separate lawsuit against the policy, warned that the Trump administration may attempt again to impose limits on international students. “This is why we sue. The rule was illegal and the Trump Administration knew they didn’t have a chance,” Maura Healey said on Twitter. “They may try this again. We will be ready.” Harvard and MIT argued that immigration officials violated procedural rules by issuing the guidance without justification and without allowing the public to respond. They also argued that the policy contradicted ICE’s March 13 directive telling schools that existing limits on online education would be suspended “for the duration of the emergency.” The suit noted that Trump’s national emergency declaration has not been rescinded and that virus cases are spiking in some regions. Immigration officials, however, argued that they told colleges all along that any guidance prompted by the pandemic was subject to change. They said the rule was consistent with existing law barring international students from taking classes entirely online. Federal officials said they were providing leniency by allowing students to keep their visas even if they study online from abroad. ___ AP reporters Carolyn Thompson in Buffalo and Sophia Tareen in Chicago contributed to this report.",Trump administration rescinds rule on foreign students,2,0.49262514450720307
1214,"SAN DIEGO - Marking significant progress, firefighters were able to move deeper inside the fire-engulfed USS Bonhomme Richard on Tuesday on their third day of battling the flames. But a top Navy official said it was too soon to say if the 23-year-old ship that is burning on opposite ends will be salvageable. Navy officials were able to inspect four main engineering rooms and found no major damage, and the external structure of the ship appears to be safe, said Rear Adm. Philip Sobeck, the commander of the strike group whose flagship is the USS Bonhomme Richard. But he cautioned at a briefing that there is still “a major fire inside“ being fought by hundreds of sailors who were focusing their efforts on two isolated spots near the stern and the bow of the ship. It was unclear if there were two distinct fires on board or if the area burning near the tail end was simply from the heat of a single large blaze, Sobeck said. It’s also unclear whether the amphibious assault ship that is akin to a mini-aircraft carrier can still be repaired. “We haven’t been inside the ship well enough to be able to get a full picture, and it’s just too early to tell,“ Sobeck said. The fire temperatures had reached up to 1,000 degrees (538 Celsius), causing the mast to collapse and threatening the central control island where the captain operates the vessel. In other good signs of progress, the fire had moved away from the one million gallons (3.8 million litres) of fuel on board, easing the risk of an explosion or spill, though the military was still taking precautions if either worst-case scenario should occur, he said. Helicopters had dumped 1,200 buckets of water on the ship, allowing crews to move further on board to fight the blaze. Tugboats were assisting from the waterline. The 840-foot (255-meter) ship was undergoing maintenance when the fire was first reported Sunday morning in a lower cargo area where seafaring tanks are parked. It appears to have started where cardboard boxes, rags and other maintenance supplies were being stored, Sobeck said. It spread rapidly from the front to the rear of the ship and quickly ballooned into one of the worst Navy shipyard fires in years. It could cost the military an estimated $4 billion to replace the ship. At least 61 people, including 38 sailors and 23 civilians, have been treated for heat exhaustion, smoke inhalation and minor injuries. None were in the hospital Tuesday. Maritime lawyer Rod Sullivan, who served in the Navy, said two separate fires on a ship is highly unusual and could raise questions as to whether arson was involved. “It is very, very difficult for fire to traverse the entire length of ship,“ and then to not cause damage in every compartment, said Sullivan, who has handled fire cases involving everything from large passenger ships to yachts. “Arson has to be considered as a possibility here.” Navy officials said they will conduct a thorough investigation, but they have no indications yet of any foul play. Sobeck said the fire appears to have travelled upward to an open hangar-like area and from there, fueled by oxygen, it raced along the ship’s ventilation and cables, causing it to traverse the ship. Cables and duct work being done as part of the ship’s maintenance fed the fire and later created barriers to sailors trying to fight it, Sobeck said. Also, at least two fire-suppression systems were not able to be used. One was deactivated while the ship was being worked on, and the other was not able to be launched because of an explosion — believed cause by pressure building up when the fire started, Sobeck said. ___ Associated Press writer John Antczak contributed from Los Angeles.","Navy: Progress on warship fire, but ship’s fate uncertain",2,0.19376810216897122
1215,"LONDON -- The ""queen of the skies"" will no longer don the red, white and blue of the Union Jack after British Airways retired its fleet of Boeing 747s on Friday as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.

The airline, which was the world's biggest operator of the 747-400 model, had already planned to ground its fleet of 31 of the iconic wide-bodied jets in 2024.

But the pandemic, which has seen most of the world's planes grounded for the best part of three months, has hastened its journey into retirement, especially as forecasters predict that passenger numbers will remain lower than normal, potentially for years to come.

BA's predecessor, BOAC, first used the 747 in 1971 and as with many airlines, the plane -- affectionately referred to as either the ""jumbo jet"" or the ""queen of the skies"" -- became a symbol of the new age of mass travel to all corners of the planet. Its days have been numbered, though, in light of new, modern, fuel-efficient aircraft such as Airbus' A350 and Boeing's 787.

""It is with great sadness that we can confirm we are proposing to retire our entire 747 fleet with immediate effect,"" BA said in a statement.

""It is unlikely our magnificent `queen of the skies' will ever operate commercial services for British Airways again due to the downturn in travel caused by the COVID-19 global pandemic.""

More than 1,500 jumbos were produced by Boeing, and it has historically been a commercial success for the manufacturer and the airlines. But its heyday is long in the past and any sight of the jet, with its distinctive hump at the top, is now a rarity.

Just 30 of the planes were in service as of Tuesday, with a further 132 in storage, according to aviation data firm Cirium.

British Airways' 747-400s have a capacity of 345 passengers and can reach a top speed of 614 mph (988 kph).

""While the aircraft will always have a special place in our heart, as we head into the future we will be operating more flights on modern, fuel-efficient aircraft,"" BA said.

Airlines around the world have struggled to cope with the collapse in demand caused by the pandemic. In the U.K., British Airways, easyJet and Virgin Atlantic have all announced job cuts and reduced operations.

Unite, a union that represents many workers in the aviation industry, urged the government to use the retirement of the 747 to bring forward an aircraft scrappage scheme to boost investments in greener aircraft as well as aerospace manufacturing.

Earlier this week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he would examine the idea of a scrappage scheme for old and highly polluting aircraft.

1217,"TOKYO -- The 42 venues for next year's delayed Tokyo Olympics have been secured and the competition schedule will remain almost identical to the one that would have been used this year.

The Athletes Village and the main press centre have also been lined up for 2021.

That was the message delivered Friday to IOC members by Tokyo organizing committee President Yoshiro Mori and CEO Toshiro Muto.

They spoke from Japan to a full session of the IOC membership meeting online.

Estimates in Japan say the delay will cost US$2 billion to $6 billion, with Japanese taxpayers picking up the bills. Olympic officials have not given any overall cost estimate.

The opening ceremony for the Olympics will be on July 23, 2021. However, women's softball and soccer will open on July 21, men's soccer on July 22, and archery and rowing on July 23.

On July 24, the first full day after the opening, the first medal event will be the women's 10-meter air rifle.

Unlike the large, public celebration of a year ago, local organizers at the last minute have put together a small, non-public event for Thursday inside the new national stadium to mark one year to go. Organizers have teased a possible appearance of the Olympic flame.

IOC President Thomas Bach said earlier this week that ""multiple scenarios"" are being thought about to pull off the Olympics next year. He said empty stadiums were an option, but not a preference, in the long list of possibilities.

""It includes all different countermeasures: quarantine, you name it,"" he said. ""But, Olympic Games behind closed doors is clearly something we do not want.

1220,"WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump signed legislation and an executive order on Tuesday that he said will hold China accountable for its oppressive actions against the people of Hong Kong, then quickly shifted his policy speech into a political one, hurling broadsides against Democratic rival Joe Biden. The legislation and order are part of the Trump administration’s stepped-up offensive against China for what he calls the rising Asian superpower’s exploitation of America and its effort to conceal details about the human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus from the world. The almost daily administration attacks on Beijing come as Trump defends his own response to the virus, with cases surging in parts of the United States, and as he works ahead of the election to portray Biden as soft on China. “So Joe Biden and President Obama freely allowed China to pillage our factories, plunder our communities and steal our most precious secrets,” Trump said, adding, “I’ve stopped it largely.” Trump said that as vice-president, Biden advocated for the Paris Agreement addressing climate change; Trump withdrew the U.S. from the accord. “It would have crushed American manufacturers while allowing China to pollute the atmosphere with impunity, yet one more gift from Biden to the Chinese Communist Party,” Trump said. Trump talked up his own tough approach to Beijing, though he spent the early weeks of the pandemic praising Chinese President Xi Jinping. The two nations signed phase one of a trade deal, but since then, relations have soured and Trump told reporters in the Rose Garden that he has no interest in talking to Xi. The legislation Trump signed into law targets police units that have cracked down on Hong Kong protesters as well as Chinese Communist Party officials responsible for imposing a new, strict national security law widely seen as chipping away at Hong Kong’s autonomy. The mandatory sanctions are also required to be imposed on banks that conduct business with the officials. While he signed the bill into law, Trump issued a statement saying the administration would not view as binding certain sections of the law that the White House believes limit a president’s powers to conduct foreign policy. Lawmakers from both parties have urged Trump to take strong action in response to China’s new national security law that erodes the “one country, two systems” framework under which Britain handed Hong Kong over to China in 1997. Hong Kong is considered a special administrative region within China and has its own governing and economic systems. “This law gives my administration powerful new tools to hold responsible the individuals and the entities involved in extinguishing Hong Kong’s freedom,” Trump said. “Their freedom has been taken away. Their rights have been taken away, and with it goes Hong Kong in my opinion because it will no longer be able to compete with free markets. A lot of people will be leaving Hong Kong, I suspect.“ The executive order he signed did not appear to go beyond his administration’s previous determinations that Hong Kong is no longer eligible for preferential treatment from the United States. Trump said the order strikes those privileges but, in fact, the administration already has been in the process of eliminating them for nearly two months. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo first made the determination in late May that China’s decision to impose a new national security law in Hong Kong meant the former British territory was no longer a democracy and so was no longer eligible for trade, commercial and other U.S. perks it had enjoyed. Just three days later, when Trump announced the U.S. was withdrawing from the World Health Organization because of Chinese influence, he echoed Pompeo’s determination and instructed his administration to immediately begin eliminating the preferences, which it did. In late June, the administration barred Hong Kong from importing U.S. weapons, saying its purchase of items that have both civilian and military applications would be subject to the same licensing requirements as mainland China. Other actions in the works include suspending an extradition treaty with Hong Kong, something Australia has already done, as well as ending legal co-operation agreements, taxation accords and financial understandings that cover accounting rules for Chinese businesses that work in the U.S. At the same time, the administration has pressed ahead with travel bans for Chinese, Hong Kong and communist party officials the U.S. believes are responsible for curtailing democracy in Hong Kong. The administration also also gone after China by imposing travel bans on officials for repressing minorities in western China and hindering foreigners’ access to Tibet. On Monday, Pompeo announced that the U.S. had decided to reject outright virtually all Chinese maritime claims in the South China Sea, a determination that could lead to increased tensions in disputed, critical international shipping lanes. ___ Associated Press writer Jonathan Lemire contributed to this report.","Trump signs bill, order rebuking China, and slams Biden",2,0.14988123634414607

The court said that the 87-year-old Ginsburg went to a hospital in Washington on Monday evening after experiencing fever and chills. She then underwent a procedure at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore on Tuesday afternoon to clean out a bile duct stent that was placed last August when she was treated for a cancerous tumour on her pancreas. The statement said the justice “is resting comfortably and will stay in the hospital for a few days to receive intravenous antibiotic treatment.” Ginsburg spent a night in the hospital in May with an infection caused by a gallstone.

1222,"ANKARA, Turkey - Turkey’s foreign minister on Tuesday chided the European Union over its condemnation of a Turkish decision to convert Istanbul’s iconic Hagia Sophia from a museum to a mosque, saying the matter is an issue of national sovereignty. Last week, Turkey cancelled the sixth-century former cathedral-turned-mosque’s 86-year status as a museum and said it would open for Muslim worship as of July 24. The decision sparked criticism in the United States, Greece, and other Western countries as well as from Orthodox Christian leaders. Pope Francis expressed sadness over the move. EU foreign ministers, holding their first face-to-face meeting in months on Monday, declared that they “condemned” the decision. EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell said there was “broad support to call on the Turkish authorities to urgently consider and reverse this decision.” Asked to comment on the EU criticism, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told a joint news conference with his visiting Maltese counterpart: “We reject the word ‘condemnation.’“ “This is a matter that concerns Turkey’s sovereign rights,” he said. He argued that there were several mosques in EU-member Spain that had been converted into churches. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, meanwhile, described the 1934 decision by the Turkish Republic’s secular, founding leaders that converted Hagia Sofia from a mosque into a museum as a mistake. “We are rectifying a mistake. It’s as simple as that,” Erdogan said in a televised address, following a weekly Cabinet meeting. Erdogan maintained that the criticisms levelled against Turkey over Hagia Sophia’s return to a mosque were a “pretext” for enmity toward Turkey and Islam. He also said his country was determined to preserve the structure’s qualities as a cultural heritage. On Tuesday, Greece again expressed dismay at Turkey’s decision. “This decision is certainly painful to us as Greek Orthodox Christians but it also hurts us as citizens of the world,” said Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis. “This is not a Greek-Turkish issue, it is not even a Euro-Turkish issue, it is global. It is a universal issue.” Mitsotakis added: “With this setback, Turkey is choosing to sever ties with the Western world and its values. It abandons a cultural direction of many centuries, preferring introversion. And it wraps with an artificial mantle of strength over its weakness.” Meanwhile, officials from Turkey’s religious affairs authority, said the landmark structure can remain open to visitors outside of prayer hours, the state-run Anadolu Agency reported. The Christian depictions inside are no obstacle to Muslim prayers, said the officials who are preparing the site for Muslim worship.

1223,"CAIRO - A round of negotiations between three key Nile basin countries over Ethiopia’s contentious hydroelectric dam ended on Monday with no agreement, according to Egyptian and Sudanese officials. The setback sunk modest hopes that the three countries could resolve their differences and ink an agreement before Ethiopia begins to fill its $4.6 billion hydroelectric dam. Ethiopia had previously pledged to start filling the reservoir, even without a deal over its operation, at the start of the wet season in July, when rains flood the Blue Nile. A declared window of two to three weeks to resolve the dispute is closing fast. To Ethiopia, the colossal dam offers a critical opportunity to pull millions of citizens out of poverty and become a major power exporter. To downstream Egypt, which depends on the Nile River to supply its farmers and booming population of 100 million with fresh water, the dam poses an existential threat. Years of talks with a variety of mediators, including the Trump administration, have failed to produce a solution. Last week’s round, mediated by the African Union and observed by American and European officials, proved no different. Filling the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam without a deal would sharply escalate tensions in the bitter dispute. Experts fear it could push the countries to the brink of military conflict. “All of the efforts exerted to reach a solution didn’t come to any kind of result,” said Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shukry Monday in an interview with Egypt’s DMC TV channel. Shukry warned Egypt may be compelled to appeal again to the U.N. Security Council to intervene in the dispute, a prospect Ethiopia rejects, preferring regional bodies like the A.U. to mediate. “If there is something that threatens the regional security of Egypt and international security, it is the main responsibility of the Security Council to adopt procedures that will prevent this,” he said. Meanwhile the countries agreed they would send their reports to the president of the African Union, and reconvene in a week to determine next steps. There was no immediate comment from Ethiopia on the latest round of talks. Between Egypt and Ethiopia lies Sudan, literally and figuratively. The African country stands to benefit from Ethiopia’s project through access to cheap electricity and reduced flooding, but it has also raised fears over the dam’s operation, which could endanger its own smaller dams, depending on the amount of water discharged daily downstream. In a press conference on Monday, Sudanese Irrigation Minister Yasser Abbas explained a series of sticking points. While the parties were “keen to find a solution,” technical and legal disagreements persist over its filling and operation, he said. Most important, he said, are the unresolved questions of how much water Ethiopia will release downstream if a multi-year drought occurs, and how the countries will resolve any future disputes. Hisham Kahin, a member of Sudan’s legal committee in the dam negotiations, said 70%-80% of negotiations turned on the thorny question of whether an agreement would be legally binding. Ethiopia, he said, fears a binding agreement will hinder its future development projects. Sudan and Egypt consider it critical. “All suggestions are under discussion,” said Kahin. “We have made very little progress.”",Nile states end talks on Africa’s largest dam with no deal,2,0.02622382083834418
1224,"LONDON -- A #MeToo activist said in a court document released Friday that she was ""misquoted and misused"" by a British tabloid newspaper in an article that accused Johnny Depp of physically abusing his ex-wife, Amber Heard.

Depp is suing News Group Newspapers, publisher of The Sun, and the paper's executive editor, Dan Wootton, at the High Court in London over the April 2018 article, which called him a ""wife-beater."" He strongly denies abusing Heard.

The article claimed there was a backlash by #MeToo activists against author J.K. Rowling because she was defending her ""famous pal"" Depp, a star of the movie adaptation of her book ""Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them.""

It quoted Katherine Kendall, an actress and activist who says she was assaulted by jailed film mogul Harvey Weinstein, as saying ""it seems that Amber got hurt"" and condemning violence.

In a written witness statement, Kendall said she spoke in April 2018 to a woman she later learned was a Sun reporter. She said she had been ""completely misquoted and misused by The Sun to accomplish their goal.""

""Although it was true that I was a victim of Harvey Weinstein, the rest was a lie,"" Kendall said. ""I was not `going public' on behalf of #MeToo or myself, to criticize J.K. Rowling's decision to cast Mr. Depp, nor did I accuse Mr. Depp of hurting Amber Heard, about which I have no first-hand knowledge.""

Kendall also said she had heard ""several times"" that Heard was abusive to Depp.

Depp, 57, and Heard, 34, met on the set of the 2011 comedy ""The Rum Diary"" and married in Los Angeles in February 2015. Heard filed for divorce the following year, and the divorce was finalized in 2017.

The Sun's defence relies on 14 allegations made by Heard of violence by Depp between 2013 and 2016, in settings including his private island in the Bahamas, a rented house in Australia and the couple's downtown Los Angeles penthouse.

He denies them all and claims Heard was the aggressor during their volatile relationship, which he has likened to ""a crime scene waiting to happen.""

In nine days of testimony at the High Court in London, judge Andrew Nicol has heard from Depp and from several current or former employees who have backed his version of events.

One of Depp's security guards, Travis McGivern, said Friday that Heard spat at Depp and threw a can of energy drink Red Bull at him during an altercation at the couple's Los Angeles penthouse in March 2015.

Heard claims that Depp hit her and pulled her hair, but McGivern said ""this did not happen and at no point did Mr. Depp hit Ms. Heard.""

Two of Depp's former romantic partners, Winona Ryder and Vanessa Paradis, have submitted witness statements saying they could not reconcile Heard's accusations of violence with the kind and loving man they knew.

Heard is due to give her side of the story when she enters the witness box on Monday.

On Friday Alejandro Romero, a concierge at the Los Angeles building where Depp and Heard lived, testified that tech billionaire Elon Musk visited Heard ""regularly late at night"" from March 2015, while she was married to Depp.

Heard and the Tesla founder had a relationship after she and Depp separated.

The Sun's lawyer suggested Romero had got the date wrong, but he said he remembered well because it was just after Depp had hurt his finger.

Depp's fingertip was cut off while he and Heard were in Australia, where he was filming a ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movie, in March 2015. Depp alleges that Heard severed it by throwing a vodka bottle at him, a claim she denies.

Romero said a friend of his was ""a big fan of Mr Depp and he was concerned about him not being able to play the guitar. That's how I remember, and then the same day I saw Mr. Musk.""",U.S. MeToo activist says Sun misquoted her in Depp abuse story,1,0.0745859588783212
1225,"WELLINGTON, New Zealand - The leader of New Zealand’s opposition National Party quit Tuesday morning just over two months from a general election and 53 days after he took charge of the right-of-centre party that is seeing its support stagnate. The statement Todd Muller released at 7:30 a.m. said he was stepping down “effective immediately” and reportedly shocked his fellow lawmakers. They announced deputy Nikki Kaye would be the acting leader, while a full meeting of the party caucus was due to take place later Tuesday at which a new leader may be chosen but there are few obvious candidates. “It has become clear to me that I am not the best person to be leader of the Opposition and Leader of the New Zealand National Party at this critical time for New Zealand,” Muller said. “It is more important than ever that the New Zealand National Party has a leader who is comfortable in the role. “The role has taken a heavy toll on me personally, and on my family, and this has become untenable from a health perspective.” The National Party has been embroiled for the past week in a scandal after it was revealed a junior lawmaker leaked private health details of New Zealand COVID-19 patients to news media. The information was provided by a former party president who received it confidentially in her capacity as acting chief executive of the Auckland rescue helicopter organization. Muller has been widely criticized for his handling of the scandal and the veracity of some of his statements had been challenged. He was facing questions over when he knew the source of the leak and if he knew one of his most senior MPs had also received the information. The private information was sent to three media organizations but was not published. Muller was a low-profile member of the party when he was chosen to lead the coup that toppled former leader Simon Bridges, whose lack of popularity with voters had begun to worry MPs as the election approached.

1229,"OKLAHOMA CITY -- Rap superstar Kanye West has qualified to appear on Oklahoma's presidential ballot, the first state where he met the requirements before the filing deadline.

But confusion remains over whether he's actually running.

A representative for West filed the necessary paperwork and paid the US$35,000 filing Wednesday afternoon, which was the deadline for a spot on the state's Nov. 3 presidential ballot, said Oklahoma Board of Elections spokeswoman Misha Mohr. He was one of three independent presidential candidates to pay the filing fee prior to the deadline, she added. The others were concert pianist Jade Simmons and cryptocurrency entrepreneur Brock Pierce.

The filing came a day after New York Magazine's ""Intelligencer"" quoted West adviser Steve Kramer saying ""he's out"" and noting that the staff he had hired were disappointed.

However, TMZ reported that the West campaign had filed a ""Statement of Organization"" Wednesday with the Federal Election Commission, stating that a Kanye 2020 committee would serve as principal campaign committee for a West candidacy.

West has already missed the deadline to qualify for the ballot in several states, and it's unclear if he is willing or able to collect enough signatures required to qualify in others.

West, who is married to reality television star Kim Kardashian West, initially announced his candidacy on July 4. Days later, he told Forbes magazine that he, who once praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said the two share ""dragon energy,"" was ""taking the red hat off"" -- a reference to Trump's trademark red ""Make America Great Again"" cap.

1230,"NEW YORK -- U.S. President Donald Trump's efforts to stall the release of his personal and corporate taxes to a New York state grand jury is jeopardizing the criminal probe of other individuals and entities and could ""kill this case,"" an attorney told a judge Thursday in urging fast action.

""It isn't just about the president,"" attorney Carey Dunne said of an investigation by Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. a week after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Vance's favour. ""There are other individuals and entities who ... could end up above the law as a result of this delay.""

Trump's attorney, William S. Consovoy, said the president believed there were strong arguments to be made that the subpoena was not ""properly tailored"" and instead copied verbatim portions of Congressional subpoenas.

""We continue to be deeply skeptical that a subpoena from New York County fortuitously is exactly the same scope and nature as two different Congressional investigations focused on federal issues,"" he said.

And he said Trump can still assert claims that the subpoena reflected ""bad faith and harassment"" a year after U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero rejected those arguments. Consovoy said claims last year related to the initiation of the investigation but now would focus solely on the subpoena.

At the conclusion of Thursday's hearing, Marrero said he would follow a schedule agreed to by both sides that calls for written submissions to be completed by mid-August.

He also expressed interest in resolving Trump's claims quickly, noting that lawyers submitted their arguments last year within six days.

Part of Vance's probe involves payments that Trump's then-personal lawyer arranged during the 2016 presidential race to keep the porn actress Stormy Daniels and model Karen McDougal from airing claims of extramarital affairs with Trump. Trump has denied the affairs.

Vance, a Democrat, has requested eight years of the Republican president's personal and corporate tax records.

Last week, t he Supreme Court rejected arguments by Trump's lawyers and the Justice Department that the president cannot be investigated while he holds office or that a prosecutor must show a greater need than normal to obtain the tax records.

The top court returned the fight over the subpoena to Marrero, saying Trump's lawyers may still challenge it in the same manner as anyone served with a subpoena.

Consovoy suggested that the president believes the new lower-court review cannot be quickly resolved.

He said ""further investigation and review will certainly be necessary"" before Trump decides on exactly what grounds the subpoena should be challenged.

He said, for instance, it must yet be decided whether to challenge the subpoena on grounds that it is retaliatory or that the president was targeted for political reasons.

Dunne, though, said delay was unnecessary because there was nothing new from a year ago.

""What the president's lawyers are seeking here is delay. I think that's the entire strategy here. Every day that goes by the president wins the type of absolute temporary immunity he has been seeking in this case, even though he has lost on that claim before every court that's heard it, including now the Supreme Court,"" he added.

With deadlines for statutes of limitation looming, he asked the judge to ""not let delay kill this case.""

1233,"JOHANNESBURG - New satellite imagery shows the reservoir behind Ethiopia’s disputed hydroelectric dam beginning to fill, but an analyst says it’s likely due to seasonal rains instead of government action. The images emerge as Ethiopia, Egypt and Sudan say the latest talks on the contentious project ended Monday with no agreement. Ethiopia has said it would begin filling the reservoir of the $4.6 billion Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam this month even without a deal, which would further escalate tensions. But the swelling reservoir, captured in imagery on July 9 by the European Space Agency’s Sentinel-1 satellite, is likely a “natural backing-up of water behind the dam” during this rainy season, International Crisis Group analyst William Davison told The Associated Press on Tuesday. “So far, to my understanding, there has been no official announcement from Ethiopia that all of the pieces of construction that are needed to be completed to close off all of the outlets and to begin impoundment of water into the reservoir” have occurred, Davison said. But Ethiopia is on schedule for impoundment to begin in mid-July, he added, when the rainy season floods the Blue Nile. Ethiopian officials did not comment on the images. The latest setback in the three-country talks shrinks hopes that an agreement will be reached before Ethiopia begins filling the reservoir. Ethiopia says the colossal dam offers a critical opportunity to pull millions of its nearly 110 million citizens out of poverty and become a major power exporter. Downstream Egypt, which depends on the Nile to supply its farmers and booming population of 100 million with fresh water, asserts that the dam poses an existential threat. Experts fear that filling the dam without a deal could push the countries to the brink of military conflict. But Kevin Wheeler, a researcher at the Environmental Change Institute, University of Oxford, told The Associated Press that fears of any immediate water shortage “are not justified at this stage at all. If there were a drought over the next several years, that certainly could become a risk.“ He said the escalating rhetoric is more due to changing “power dynamics” in the region. Years of talks with a variety of mediators, including the Trump administration, have failed to produce a solution. Last week’s round, mediated by the African Union and observed by U.S. and European officials, proved no different. “Although there were progresses, no breakthrough deal is made,” Seleshi Bekele, Ethiopia’s minister of water, irrigation and energy, tweeted overnight.

The Russian Defence Ministry said that the manoeuvres will last until Tuesday and involve about 150,000 troops, nearly 27,000 military vehicles, 414 aircraft and 106 navy ships.

It noted that the exercise is intended to train the troops for fending off ""terrorist threats"" in the country's southwest and prepare for the even bigger ""Caucasus-2020"" drills later this year. The ministry said the troops will train at 35 shooting ranges.

The manoeuvrs will mostly involve land forces based in Russia's southwest, but airborne units and some other forces across Russia will also take part.

The navy drills will span the Black Sea and the Caspian and will also involve some marine units from the Far North and the Pacific.

Russia has expanded the scope of its military drills in recent years amid bitter tensions with the West.

Dustin Honken, 52, was sentenced to death for killing government informants and children in his effort to thwart his drug trafficking prosecution in 1993.

Honken is set to die by a lethal injection of the powerful sedative pentobarbital at the federal prison in Terre Haute, Indiana, where he's been on death row since 2005. His lawyers are making last-minute pleas for a reprieve, but their chances of success seem remote after the Supreme Court reversed lower-court orders that sought to block the executions of two other men this week.

Over recent days, prison authorities permitted Honken to make his last calls to family and friends, according to Sister Betty Donoghue, a Catholic nun whom he called Wednesday.

On death row, Honken befriended Daniel Lewis Lee -- the first man executed this week -- and knew Lee's execution was called off one hour, then was back on another hour, Donoghue said.

""He was very upset with the way Danny died,"" said Donoghue, who visited Honken regularly over the past decade.

Yet Donoghue, of the Sisters of Providence just outside Terre Haute, said she was startled at how calm Honken sounded over the phone.

""He was at peace. I was totally amazed,"" she said. ""He believed he would go to heaven. He is ready to meet his maker.""

At his sentencing in 2005, Honken denied killing anybody. Donoghue said all she ever heard him say is that he was innocent.

Honken's mother, brother and college-aged daughter visited him in prison in recent days, she said.

Lee was executed Tuesday morning and Wesley Ira Purkey was put to death two days later, each after hours of legal wrangling that the high court ended with 5-4 votes to allow the executions to take place.

Lee was convicted of murdering an Arkansas family in a 1990s plot to build a whites-only nation in the Pacific Northwest. He maintained his innocence to the end, saying just before he died, ""I've made a lot of mistakes in my life, but I'm not a murderer. You're killing an innocent man.""

Purkey was executed for kidnapping and killing 6-year-old Jennifer Long in Kansas City, Missouri, before dismembering, burning and dumping her body in a septic pond. In his final words, the inmate expressed regret for killing Long and said of his execution: ""This sanitized murder really does not serve no purpose whatsoever. Thank you.""

A federal judge had ordered an 11th-hour delay in both executions, citing the prospect that the inmates would suffer severe pain from the execution drug. The judge also would have allowed Purkey's lawyers to pursue claims that he was suffering from dementia and was unable to understand why he was being executed.

The Supreme Court removed those obstacles, noting Tuesday that Texas and other states have used pentobarbital ""without incident"" in more than 100 executions. The court didn't comment in rejecting the delay relating to claims of Purkey's dementia.

Honken's execution would be the 10th carried out in the U.S. in 2020, including three in Texas, which executes more inmates than any other state. Last year, 22 prisoners were executed, the fifth straight year that fewer than 30 people were put to death in the U.S. -- far lower than the 65 executions that were carried out in 2003, the last time an federal inmate was executed.

Honken grew up in Iowa, but moved with a friend to Arizona to try to get rich by cooking meth, which he learned to do after studying chemistry in college. They distributed their product through two dealers based in Iowa.

One of those dealers was Greg Nicholson, who began co-operating with investigators in 1993 after coming under suspicion. Honken was arrested and indicted for conspiring to manufacture meth after Nicholson secretly recorded Honken and testified before a grand jury.

Honken informed the court that he would plead guilty. But days before his July 1993 plea hearing, he and his girlfriend, Angela Johnson, went searching for Nicholson.

They found him at the home where he lived with his girlfriend, Lori Duncan, and her daughters, 10-year-old Kandi and 6-year-old Amber. The four were kidnapped, shot to death and buried. Their bodies weren't found for seven years. Honken also killed his other dealer, 32-year-old Terry DeGeus, whose body was found a few miles away from Honken's other victims.

Honken was convicted of the Iowa killings in 2004 in a trial that featured extraordinary security measures, including an anonymous jury. Honken was bolted to the floor of the courtroom and wore a stun belt under his clothing to prevent escape attempts.

The jury recommended a death sentence and U.S. District Judge Mark Bennett, who said he generally opposes the death penalty, agreed.

""I am not going to lose any sleep if he is executed,"" said Bennett, who has since retired from the bench. ""Normally I would, but the evidence was so overwhelming.""

1241,"YEREVAN, Armenia - Armenia and Azerbaijan forces fought Tuesday with heavy artillery and drones, leaving at least 16 people killed on both sides, including an Azerbaijani general, in the worst outbreak of hostilities in years. Skirmishes on the volatile border between the two South Caucasus nations began Sunday. Azerbaijan said it has lost 11 servicemen and one civilian in three days of fighting, and Armenia said four of its troops were killed Tuesday. The two neighbours in the South Caucasus have been locked in conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh, a region of Azerbaijan that has been under the control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by Armenia since a war there ended in 1994. International efforts to settle the conflict have stalled. Armenian and Azerbaijani forces have frequently engaged in clashes. The current skirmishes appear to mark the most serious spike in hostilities since 2016 when scores were killed in four days of fighting. The latest incident began Sunday when Armenian and Azerbaijani troops exchanged fire in the northern section of their border. Officials in both countries blamed each other for starting the fighting and said that sporadic shelling has continued. Azerbaijan’s Defence Ministry said two senior officers, Maj. Gen. Polad Hashimov and Col. Ilgar Mirzayev, were killed in fighting Tuesday along with five other servicemen. Armenian officials claimed that Azerbaijani drones launched an attack on the Tuvush province town of Berd, targeting civilian infrastructure. Defence Ministry spokeswoman Shushan Stepanyan said that one of Azerbaijani drones was downed. Stepanyan also charged that the Azerbaijani military used civilians as shields, placing artillery close to the village of Dondar Gushchu in the Tovuz district about 10 kilometres (six miles) from the border. “The Azerbaijani side has surrounded its own population with artillery batteries, making them a target, and then complained that the Armenian forces fired in that direction,” she said on Facebook where she posted images of the Azerbaijani artillery around the village. The Azerbaijani military denied losing a drone and in turn claimed that its forces shot down an Armenian drone and destroyed an Armenian artillery system along with its crew. As hostilities continued, Armenia also accused Azerbaijan of launching cyberattacks on Armenian government websites. Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan on Monday accused Azerbaijan of provoking the clashes and warned that it would “bear responsibility for the unpredictable consequences.” Azerbaijani President Ilhan Aliyev denounced what he described as “another provocation of Armenia” and vowed to protect Azerbaijan’s national territory. Turkey, which has close ethnic and cultural ties with Azerbaijan, has voiced strong support to Baku in the conflict. The United States and Russia, which co-chair the Minsk group of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that has tried to negotiate a settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, have condemned the violence and called for restraint. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov had separate calls with his counterparts in Armenia and Azerbaijan on Monday to call for an immediate ceasefire. Russian President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said Tuesday that Moscow was “deeply worried” about the fighting and stands ready to play mediator. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also expressed worry. His spokesman, Stéphane Dujarric, said in a statement that the U.N. chief “urges an immediate end to the fighting and calls on all involved to take immediate steps to deescalate the situation and refrain from provocative rhetoric.” ___ Vladimir Isachenkov in Moscow, and Edith M.

1246,"TEHRAN, Iran - A misaligned missile battery, miscommunication between troops and their commanders and a decision to fire without authorization all led to Iran’s Revolutionary Guard shooting down a Ukrainian jetliner in January, killing all 176 people on board, a new report says. The report released late Saturday by Iran’s Civil Aviation Organization comes months after the Jan. 8 crash near Tehran killed 55 Canadian citizens, 30 permanent residents and dozens more with ties to Canada. Authorities had initially denied responsibility, only changing course days later after Western nations presented extensive evidence that Iran had shot down the plane. The report may signal a new phase in the investigation into the crash, as the aircraft’s black box flight recorder is due to be sent to Paris, where international investigators will finally be able to examine it. The flight was on the first leg of a trip to Canada via Kyiv, Ukraine at the time. The shootdown happened the same night Iran launched a ballistic missile attack targeting U.S. soldiers in Iraq, its response to the American drone strike that killed Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad on Jan. 3. At the time, Iranian troops were bracing for a U.S. counterstrike and appear to have mistaken the plane for a missile. The civil aviation report does not acknowledge that, only saying a change in the “alertness level of Iran’s air defence” allowed previously scheduled air traffic to resume. The report detailed a series of moments where the shootdown of Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 could have been avoided. The report said the surface-to-air missile battery that targeted the Boeing 737-800 had been relocated and was not properly reoriented. Those manning the missile battery could not communicate with their command centre, they misidentified the civilian flight as a threat and opened fire twice without getting approval from ranking officials, the report said. “If each had not arisen, the aircraft would not have been targeted,” the report said. Western intelligence officials and analysts believe Iran shot down the aircraft with a Russian-made Tor system, known to NATO as the SA-15. In 2007, Iran took the delivery of 29 Tor M1 units from Russia under a contract worth an estimated $700 million. The system is mounted on a tracked vehicle and carries a radar and a pack of eight missiles. The report did not say why the Guard moved the air defence system, though that area near the airport is believed to be home to both regular military and bases of the paramilitary Guard. The report notes that the Ukrainian flight had done nothing out of the ordinary up until the missile launch, with its transponder and other data being broadcast. “At the time of firing the first missile, the aircraft was flying at a normal altitude and trajectory,” the report said. The plane had just taken off from Imam Khomeini International Airport when the first missile exploded, possibly damaging its radio equipment, the report said. The second missile likely directly struck the aircraft, as videos that night show the plane exploding into a ball of fire before crashing into a playground and farmland on the outskirts of Tehran. The report put the blame entirely on the crew of the missile battery. Already, six people believed to be involved in the incident have been arrested, judiciary spokesman Gholamhossein Esmaili reportedly said in June. He said at the time three had been released on bail while the other three remained held. In recent months, Iran has repeatedly delayed releasing the aircraft’s so-called black box, which includes data and communications from the cockpit leading up to the shootdown. The U.S., under international regulations, has a right to be part of the investigation as the plane involved was a Boeing. Iran is to send the black box to France on July 20, where Ukrainian and French experts are expected to examine it, Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency recently reported. Iranian officials did not have the equipment on hand to read data from the box. The plane, en route to the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, was carrying 167 passengers and nine crew members from several countries, including 82 Iranians, 57 Canadians — including many Iranians with dual citizenship — and 11 Ukrainians, according to officials. The route was popular with those travelling onward to Canada. ___ Gambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.","Iran blames bad communication, alignment for jet shootdown",2,0.3424754639148959
1247,"OTTAWA -- Russia has tried to steal information and intellectual property from researchers working on a COVID-19 vaccine, cyber security agencies in Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom are alleging.

The major national security and intelligence threat was identified by the three countries as the result of “Russian cyber threat activity” directed at organizations that are doing research into and development of COVID-19 vaccines and treatment.

“These malicious cyber activities were very likely undertaken to steal information and intellectual property relating to the development and testing of COVID-19 vaccines, and serve to hinder response efforts at a time when healthcare experts and medical researchers need every available resource to help fight the pandemic,” said the Communications Security Establishment (CSE) in a statement.

The top cyber and national security agencies—including the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) and the Department of Homeland Security—jointly allege that APT29, also known as “the Dukes” or “Cozy Bear” which the agency says “almost certainly operates as part of Russian intelligence services,” was responsible for the malicious activity.

In a technical advisory released Thursday, the agencies spell out how the Russian actors used malware known as “WellMess” and “WellMail” to target global organizations by scanning computer IP addresses for potential vulnerabilities to access information like login credentials.

“This broad targeting potentially gives the group access to a large number of systems globally, many of which are unlikely to be of immediate intelligence value. The group may maintain a store of stolen credentials in order to access these systems in the event that they become more relevant to their requirements in the future,” reads the advisory.

“The group uses a variety of tools and techniques to predominantly target governmental, diplomatic, think-tank, healthcare and energy targets for intelligence gain,” according to the U.K.’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC).

As The Canadian Press has reported, a spokesperson for Russian President Vladimir Putin has denied the accusations, saying Russia does not have any information about who may have hacked these organizations, stating plainly “Russia has nothing to do with those attempts.""

In a late afternoon press conference, Public Safety Minister Bill Blair hinted that while Russia has been named in this instance, there are other foreign actors who have their sights set on Canadian COVID-19 intellectual property.

MINISTERS CONDEMN 'RECKLESS ACTIONS'

Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan praised the agencies for calling out the “bad behavior,” and deterring other malicious foreign actors from targeting Canadian intelligence.

NCSC Director of Operations Paul Chichester condemned the “despicable attacks,” against those working to combat the ongoing novel coronavirus pandemic.

British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said that the U.K. stands with Canada and the U.S. “against the reckless actions of Russia’s intelligence services, who we have exposed today for committing cyberattacks against those working on a #Covid19 vaccine.” He said the hackers sought to undermine the international work underway to defeat the pandemic that to date has killed nearly 585,000 people worldwide.

It remains unclear whether the attempts were successful in stealing any information. In a statement to CTV News, CSE said that in regards to these hacking attempts the agency is offering support and mitigation services, “to limit impacts to targeted organizations.”

“On any given day, CSE's dynamic defence capabilities block up to two billion reconnaissance scans on these systems,” CSE spokesperson Evan Koronewski said in the statement, referring to the Government of Canada's systems.

The three countries are now imploring all research facilities and other agencies involved in coronavirus research to take further actions to protect their information and contact CSE’s Cyber Centre if they suspect they have been targeted.

As The Associated Press has reported, “Cozy Bear” was identified by U.S. security officials as one of the two Russian-linked groups responsible for the hack into the Democratic National Committee computer network that resulted in the leak of Hillary Clinton campaign emails ahead of the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

RESEARCHERS WARNED OF RISK

This comes after CSE and the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) issued a warning in May that Canadian intellectual property related to COVID-19 research and testing was at an elevated risk for foreign-backed hacking or other malicious activity.

At the time the agencies said that during the pandemic they had already seen an increased risk of foreign interference and espionage related to the work being done by Canadian researchers, though they would not comment on specific operations, or which foreign actors posed a concern.

The federal government has committed more than $1 billion towards a national medical and research strategy to combat the novel coronavirus that is seeing labs across the country expand their capacity to study the virus, possible treatments or vaccines, and its spread among the population.

The funding includes millions of dollars for developing and producing vaccines and treatments in Canada, supporting similar work in other nations, as well as studying immunity and serology testing.

On Wednesday Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and several other world leaders put out a call to global leaders to “commit to an equitable distribution of an eventual COVID-19 vaccine.”

“We will ensure every step of the way… to protect Canadian intellectual property and to protect the hard work of our researchers and ensure that we're doing everything right. But at the same time, we recognize the need for global collaboration in order to get through this global pandemic and we will get that balance right,” Trudeau told reporters on Thursday.",Russian hackers have tried to steal COVID-19 research,5,0.23915025648517396
1251,"PORT ALBERNI, B.C. — A commercial fisherman knew he was staring at a fish out of place when a barracuda landed in his net on Vancouver Island, far from its typical habitat in southern California.

Tyler Vogrig, 24, said he’d seen the long, silvery body of the muscular fish with giant teeth before, but in Hawaii.

Vogrig said he and his father Brian were catching sockeye at Alberni Inlet as part of their stock-assessment work for Fisheries and Oceans Canada when they hauled in the barracuda.

“We couldn’t believe it,” he said from his home in Vancouver. “The fish was docile because it was being chased by some seals and one of the seals actually nipped it on its tail so it had a little gash on it.”

The duo placed the weak, predatory fish in a tank to recover for about 30 minutes and contacted Fisheries and Oceans.

They snapped some photos of the fish, which he believed weighed about five kilograms, before releasing it.

Now, they have quite a tale to tell about an adventure earlier this month aboard their purse seiner, the Nita Maria.

“It’s just really cool and there’s just no chance I’ll ever forget that,” Vogrig said.

His father has been fishing for 40 years and had never seen a barracuda in British Columbia waters, he said.

Jackie King, a research scientist with the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, said the presence of Pacific barracuda in British Columbia waters is rare.

“But we have had some recorded in our commercial fisheries as far back as 1987 and then huge gaps between when they’re appearing again,” King said, adding a barracuda was spotted in British Columbia in 2016 and 2019.

The fish are normally found in Baja California in Mexico, bordering the state of California, but have also recently been seen as far north as Washington state neighbouring B.C., likely due to warming waters at home, she said.

Sources say Canada and the United States are likely to agree to extend their mutual ban on non-essential travel between the two countries for another 30 days.

The Canada-U.S. border has been closed to so-called “discretionary” travel like vacations and shopping trips since the COVID-19 pandemic took hold of the continent in mid-March, an agreement that’s set to expire July 21.

Officials familiar with the ongoing talks, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss matters not yet public, say another extension until Aug. 21 is all but inevitable.

ALSO READ: B.C. Indigenous groups share impact of border closures

News of the likely extension, initially reported by the Globe and Mail newspaper, comes with COVID-19 resurgent in the U.S., particularly in southern states where businesses reopened early and the wearing of face masks has become a partisan issue.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau hinted at the possibility Monday after a phone call with U.S. President Donald Trump.

Trudeau says Canada is closely monitoring what he calls a “constantly evolving” situation, but won’t say whether officials have discussed extending the border restrictions beyond the standard 30-day window.

Endangered species day was established 15 years ago. It is a day for us to learn about the wildlife, plants, animals and insects that are at risk of disappearing and perhaps most importantly, what we can do about it.

Every nation has a unique role in saving our planet’s endangered species. As Canadians it’s important that we know about the plight and prospects of wildlife from around the world. But it is most critical that Canadians know about the fellow species that share our lands and waters. These are the plants and animals that we steward and can take action to protect. Our decisions alone will determine their future.

We share our country with about 80,000 known wild species. We don’t know the exact number, and more remain to be described and discovered. Many of these plants and animals are common and thriving. Species like raccoon, mallard and Labrador-tea are not endangered, and have a low risk of ever being lost from Canada.

There is an important group in our Canadian collection of known plants and animals that are at risk of disappearing. Canada has about 800 species, sub-species and varieties of wildlife that have been officially assessed as at risk, but this probably represents less than a quarter of all plants and animals that are imperiled in our country. Without conservation actions, these species could join Canada’s “missing” species such as the greater prairie chicken, eastern box turtle and great laurel.

Within this group of nationally imperiled species are about 1,600 plants and animals that are also of global conservation concern. Many of these have very small ranges like the Bicknell’s thrush of Quebec, Atlantic Canada and the northeastern US, or the sand-verbena moth that is limited to a handful of sites of coastal sites in Washington and B.C. including the Nature Conservancy of Canada’s James Island. In most cases, we share the stewardship of these species with other nations, primarily our American neighbors.

Nationally and globally imperiled species are critical to conserve. We can help by protecting key wetlands, forests, coastal areas and grasslands by supporting the work of the Nature Conservancy of Canada and other land trusts. These projects leverage matching funds from the federal Natural Heritage Conservation Program.

There is also a select group of wildlife that are worth learning about. About 310 plants and animals live in Canada and nowhere else in the world. These range from a unique variety of the weasel-like marten that only lives on the island of Newfoundland to a small fish called the Vancouver lamprey that is restricted to Vancouver Island to a delicate wildflower that grows along the arctic coast called hairy braya that was rediscovered based on notes from the Franklin expedition. Most of the species in this select group have always been restricted to this geography we now call Canada. A few like the eastern wolf, have been lost from their former range in the US and their last stronghold against extinction is in Canada.

These are uniquely Canadian species. No other country can protect them. Later this spring, NatureServe Canada and the Nature Conservancy of Canada will be releasing a report and some maps on this select group of all-Canadian wildlife. If we want to pass on the full richness of the world’s wildlife to future generations, we need to protect these species.

We can use this time of social distancing to nudge closer to nature. To learn a little more about even just one of our endangered species in Canada. Learning is the foundation of conservation. Knowing what other species share our community and our country. Learning why they might disappear. Learning what can be done to save them.

1260,"The story of how our current environmental state came to be is over 12,000 years old

By: Joshua Sterlin, Phd Student, NRS, Leadership for the Ecozoic Program, McGill University

Our global civilization may be doubting its mastery of the Earth as we temporarily close the shutters on many of our societies because of COVID-19. Among ecology scholars, one conversation has been about how wildlife and habitat destruction and ecosystem destabilization could be linked to our current pandemic. Some even argue — as ecology scholar Vijay Kolinjivadi recently wrote in Uneven Earth — the coronavirus is a product of capitalism’s own making.

The head of the United Nations environment program and other experts say the current pandemic is a warning sign from nature. They believe this may be the beginning of the spread of more infectious diseases.

This is no new development, however. The story of how our current environmental state came to be is over 12,000 years old.

Are we the virus?

In the wake of our recent retreat indoors, animals have begun to reclaim human-dominated spaces. Our stalled economy has led to improved air quality in major cities. The immediate effects of our societal contraction are stark.

This has brought to the surface a perennial narrative and fear, quickly rejected, that humans are the true virus and that COVID-19 is the Earth’s vaccine. However, people have been right to point out that a small minority of actors — large corporations and governments — are responsible for the vast majority of ecological destruction and carbon emissions.

As we debate the proposals for what the world should look like after the virus, we must discuss the roots of what got us here. Doing this will help us change in a systemic way, rather than merely at the surface.

Origin stories and the Anthropocene

We have changed the planet so much that it can be detected in the very crust of the Earth. This has led some to name our current age after our species, calling it the Anthropocene.

When did the Anthropocene start? An often suggested answer is the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, when some humans began to change the planet at a remarkable clip. This includes pumping out the first significant greenhouse gas emissions.

Not all humans beings have participated in this process, however. This is why some have argued for naming our era after the social and economic arrangements that created it. The development of capitalism is often singled out as the defining feature for our era.

But we have to look further back for the genesis of our current set of crises: environmental, inequality and domination, and epidemic disease affecting both us and domesticated animals, including COVID-19. They all have their roots in the first tilled soils.

Fertile grounds (for disease)

The agricultural revolution began approximately 12,000 years ago and sparked a cascading shift in human-environment relations among certain peoples that has yet to end. The domestication of cereals and livestock, on which this revolution is based, created the population sizes and densities that provide the basis for epidemic disease.

Fanning out from those initial centres, the agricultural revolution arrived in the Americas (though it too had already begun here), carried and enacted by European settlers — with disastrous results.

It continues in the Amazon rainforest as the forest is cleared, mined and planted. Indigenous peoples are again at major risk from introduced disease.

Society, not species

Agriculture began not long after the end of the last major ice age. The stable climate conditions made planting grains viable. Agriculture sprouted in multiple locations across the world at a similar time.

However, of the roughly 300,000 years of the existence of modern humans, our current style of agricultural civilization comprises at most four per cent of humanity’s time on the planet. This is the era that is taught to students in schools. But this is only a single strand of the human story.

This narrative is our culture’s origin story. No wonder it is so hard for us to think there are any viable alternatives. The idea of the Anthropocene fuses the very definition of our entire species with a single way of life that itself has been a relatively recent development.

The vast majority of humanity’s time has been of us living in a quite different manner. Some Indigenous Peoples, from the Amazon to the Bay of Bengal continue to live in some approximation of that different way of life to this day.

Implicit within the idea of the Anthropocene is not only that all these societies are unimportant, but also in a certain way, that they are not even really human. It further lends a sense of inevitability to our present. It seems to say that our trashing of the planet is unfortunately, just an inescapable part of our nature. Sounds like “we are the virus” – doesn’t it?

Civilization and survival

Perhaps we need a new frame and name for our current era instead of the Anthropocene. This might allow us to see alternative futures.

This does not mean we need to dismantle our modern structures to live as hunter-gatherers. Nor does it mean that hunter-gatherers live without hardship, or that the rest of humanity has fallen from grace, although climate destabilization may eventually make current agricultural practices impossible.

There are many aspects and achievements of agricultural civilization such as modern medicine, the internet and scientific advancements, that if we were to lose them, it would diminish us. We are relying on many of the most highly developed medical and logistical ones during this pandemic.

After the pandemic — and if we are to survive this geologic era — we must re-establish mutually enhancing relationships with the Earth and each other. There may be no better way to do this than to turn to the societies that have succeeded, such as the hunter-gatherer societies that have generally discouraged hierarchy and maintained sustainable and flourishing relationships with land.

Responses to the COVID-19 pandemic are being refracted through inequality, private property, class structures and state power — all agricultural inheritances. There is a temptation, for instance, for states to tighten control over human and non-human populations.

These patterns have recurred in crisis for the past 12,000 years, and there are troubling signs of it already happening throughout the world.

We must forcefully resist this inclination. We must instead endeavour to use this moment, and our best civilizational inheritances, in the mitigation of our worst ones, and at the service of just and sustainable cultures. By doing so might we live not in old, but in utterly new ways.

1261,"Facebook Inc. will begin labelling all posts that include information about voting with a link encouraging users to get facts from the company’s new voting hub, and expands its prohibition on advertising for hate speech.

The new policy on voting announced Friday by chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg means Facebook will label future posts from U.S President Donald Trump, and everyone else, about mail-in ballots or other voting-related issues, regardless of whether they contain misleading information. Facebook will funnel users to a voting information hub meant to provide facts from state authorities. Users will also be able to register to vote using this hub. Facebook has set a goal of helping register four million new voters before the 2020 U.S. election in November.

“There are no exceptions for politicians in any of the policies I’m announcing here today,” Zuckerberg said.

The social network has been criticized in recent weeks for allowing false or misleading voting information, including posts from Trump about mail-in ballots that Twitter Inc. flagged as inaccurate. Zuckerberg has said repeatedly that he doesn’t want to remove posts from elected officials, but would rather let users make up their minds about the content.

A number of civil rights groups, including the NAACP and the Anti-Defamation League, are among those unhappy with Facebook’s history of allowing posts they say encourage voter suppression. Those groups have organized a Facebook advertising boycott for the month of July, and a number of well-known consumer brands are participating, including outdoor gear company Patagonia, Verizon Communications Inc. and Unilever.

Facebook will now prohibit ads that paint anyone from a certain race, ethnicity, gender identity or sexual orientation as dangerous. The company will expand those policies to better protect immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers from ads that say these groups of people are inferior.

The company will also label posts that it keeps up even though they violate policies, if they come from a newsworthy source, such as the president. “We’ll allow people to share this content to condemn it, just like we do with other problematic content, because this is an important part of how we discuss what’s acceptable in our society — but we’ll add a prompt to tell people that the content they’re sharing may violate our policies,” Zuckerberg said.

1262,"DC Comics is releasing a new “Watchmen” spin off based on the Rorschach character, but the unveiling of the limited comic series has been met with mixed reactions.

Some critics online questioned whether the masked vigilante should be the primary focus after DC announced the sequel “Rorschach” on Wednesday. Others have slammed the decision to bring on Batman writer Tom King to write the 12-issue series, which will debut in October.

King’s approach to the Dark Knight’s comic book story line he’s written has been divisive. With “Rorschach,” he said the new series will take a compelling look at politics similar to that of HBO’s “Watchmen” and the original comic in 1986. The comic will also be worked on by artist Jorge Fornés, colourist Dave Stewart and letterer Clayton Cowles.

The 1986 comic has become one of the most acclaimed and bestselling graphic novels of all time. The HBO series earned acclaim for delivering a story about race relations in America. But some are concerned about whether the story about the anti-hero Rorschach, who wears a trenchcoat, fedora and white mask with morphing inkblots, will be as relevant today.

King believes it will be.

“This is a very political work.” he said in a statement. “It’s an angry work. We’re so angry all the time now. We have to do something with that anger. It’s called ‘Rorschach’ not because of the character Rorschach, but because what you see in these characters tells you more about yourself than about them.”

The sequel is set 35 years after the “Watchmen” comic series when Dr. Manhattan turned Rorschach into dust.

A plot summary released on DC’s website asks: “So what does it mean when Rorschach reappears as part of a pair of assassins trying to kill the first candidate to oppose President Robert Redford in decades? Follow one determined detective as he walks backward in time, uncovering the identities and motives of the would-be killers, taking him deep into a dark conspiracy of alien invasions, disgraced do-gooders, mystical visions, and yes, comic books.”

Mary Trump book already nearing 1 million sales

Mary L. Trump’s scathing memoir about her uncle, President Donald Trump, is nearly a million-seller on preorders alone.

Simon & Schuster announced Thursday that Mary Trump’s “Too Much and Never Enough” had sold a company record 950,000 copies in combined print, digital and audio editions as of its date of sale, earlier this week.

Another anti-Trump book from Simon & Schuster, former National Security Advisor John Bolton’s “The Room Where It Happened,” sold nearly 800,000 copies in its first week when released last month.

President Trump and his allies had tried to stop both books from coming out, alleging that Bolton had revealed classified information and that Mary Trump had violated a nondisclosure agreement. Judges in each case denied requests for injunctions.

Diversity of LGBTQ characters in film declines, study finds

Last year saw record representation of LGBTQ characters in the 118 films released by major studios, according to a new study by GLAAD. But for the third straight year, the racial diversity of LGBTQ characters has waned and transgender characters again went unseen.

GLAAD called the decrease in non-white LGBTQ characters “concerning.” In 2019, 34 per cent of LGBTQ characters were people of colour. That’s down from 42 per cent in 2018 and 57 per cent in 2017.

“GLAAD is calling on the studios to ensure that within two years at least half of their LGBTQ characters are people of colour,” said the advocacy group that tracks representation of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in the media.

For the third year in a row, transgender characters were also absent from major studio releases.

But overall, GLAAD found higher rates of inclusion than it has in the eight years its been tracking studio films. Of the 118 films studied, 22 (18.6 per cent) included lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or queer characters. That’s a slight increase from 18.2 per cent in 2018.

But none of the studios studied received a “good” or higher grade for LGBTQ representation. Sony and Disney received “poor” grades. STX Films, which released “Hustlers,” “21 Bridges” and “Uglydolls” last year, failed GLAAD’s test since their 2019 movies featured zero LGBTQ representation.

GLAAD has sought that studios reach inclusion of LGBTQ characters in 20 per cent of their films by 2021 and 50 per cent by 2024. Paramount, Lionsgate, Disney and United Artists reached the 20 per cent level last year.

California man sentenced in $6M modern art fraud scheme

A Southern California man who authorities say tried to sell $6 million (US) worth of phoney paintings he claimed were created by Andy Warhol, Jean-Michel Basquiat and other modern masters was sentenced Wednesday to five years in federal prison.

Philip Righter, 43, of West Hollywood was sentenced in a federal court in Miami after pleading guilty to wire fraud, aggravated identity theft and tax fraud, the U.S. Attorney’s Office said.

Righter was given 60 months in prison in a case that was filed in Los Angeles. The judge also handed down a five-year sentence in a Florida case in which Righter acknowledged trying to sell forgeries to the owner of a Miami art gallery.

Both sentences will be served at the same time.

In a plea agreement, Righter acknowledged trying to sell counterfeit art that he claimed was genuine and using some fakes for income tax writeoffs or as collateral for loans he never repaid.

Richter sold the bogus artworks from 2016 through June of 2018, creating phoney documents to back up his claims that they were genuine, prosecutors said.

Some of the documents were stamped with counterfeits of the embossing stamps used by the estates of Basquiat and Keith Haring to authenticate pieces, prosecutors said.

1264,"British Airways is retiring its fleet of Boeing Co. 747s years ahead of schedule, the latest carrier to withdraw a jet that was for decades a mainstay of international travel, as the aviation industry reels from the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic.

The carrier, owned by International Consolidated Airlines Group SA, said Friday it would withdraw from service its 31 remaining 747s with immediate effect—about four years earlier than planned—after operating the aircraft type for close to five decades.

BA’s move follows similar retirements of the jumbo jet at carriers including Qantas Airways Ltd. and Deutsche Lufthansa AG since Covid-19 struck. As the pandemic has rippled through the aviation sector, halting flights and decimating passenger demand, the industry’s biggest and least fuel-efficient aircraft have quickly fallen out of favor.

Boeing has previously hinted at plans to end production of the four-engined behemoth, recognizable for its hump toward the front of the plane that houses business-class passengers. Only a few airlines still operate the aircraft, which is used for Air Force One.

British Airways’ predecessor first flew the plane in April 1971 on a flight from London to New York. The airline took its last delivery of the type in 1989 and later brought the rival Airbus SE A380 double-decker into its fleet in 2007. The 747s being withdrawn currently represent about 11% of BA’s total capacity.

“This is not how we wanted or expected to have to say goodbye to our incredible fleet of 747 aircraft,” BA Chief Executive Alex Cruz said in a statement. “It is sadly another difficult but necessary step as we prepare for a very different future.”

BA has already announced plans to reduce its head count by 12,000 employees as it tries to reshape its operations to manage the long-term fallout from the virus and its impact on the global economy. It is also selling an art collection, and its parent company is renegotiating a deal to buy Spain’s Air Europa.

The Airports Council International in Europe, a trade body, recently said it expects passenger travel to recover to 2019 levels only in 2024, a year later than previously forecast.

Other carriers including Emirates Airline and Air France-KLM Group SA have also outlined plans to cut back use of their biggest aircraft, including the A380. Airbus had already started winding down production of that jet, the world’s biggest, before the pandemic as demand waned in favor of smaller wide-bodies capable of operating more routes with more efficient fuel burn.

1266,"Mo’Nique won a major victory against Netflix in her lawsuit alleging race and gender discrimination after a federal court ruled Thursday that she “plausibly” alleged the streaming giant illegally retaliated when she rejected a “lowball” offer to do a comedy special.

The decision in the Central District court in California means Monique Hicks’ (her real name) lawsuit can go forward and Netflix’s attempt to get it dismissed was denied.

The decision, by U.S District Judge Andre Birotte Jr., notes that Mo’Nique raised a “novel theory,” arguing that Netflix’s alleged failure to negotiate an “opening offer” in good faith, as is customary in the industry, constitutes an “adverse employment action” for purposes of a retaliation claim.

“...Regardless of whether plaintiff will ultimately prevail on (her) claims, dismissing this case under Rule 12(b)(6) is not appropriate,” the judge said in his decision. “Plaintiff’s complaint may raise a novel issue, but that does not justify dismissing it at this stage.”

The comedian and actress, who won an Oscar for her supporting role in drama “Precious,” filed her lawsuit last year claiming Netflix offered her significantly less money for a comedy special in comparison to her fellow male and white comedians.

In 2018, Netflix offered Mo’Nique $500,000 for a comedy special and refused to negotiate further, the lawsuit said, adding that the streaming service offered Amy Schumer “26 times more per show than Mo’Nique.”

“Despite Mo’Nique’s extensive résumé and documented history of comedic success, when Netflix presented her with an offer of employment for an exclusive stand-up comedy special, Netflix made a lowball offer that was only a fraction of what Netflix paid other (non-Black female) comedians,” the lawsuit argued.

When she complained, Netflix allegedly failed to continue negotiations, which would have been the usual practice in Hollywood.

Mo’Nique’s lawyer, David deRubertis, said in a statement that Netflix sought to convince the court that shutting down “good-faith negotiations because she raised concerns about pay discrimination is not retaliation under the law,”

“The court disagreed,” deRubertis said. “Today’s ruling is an important victory for Hollywood talent who, just like all other workers, need protections against retaliation if they raise concerns about pay discrimination during the hiring process.

“Employers in the entertainment industry need to take pay discrimination concerns seriously, fix them if the concerns have merit, and never retaliate against those who have the courage to speak up about equal pay.”

The ruling comes at a point when millions of Americans are protesting racial injustice and persistent discrimination against non-white people in employment, including Hollywood.

Netflix, which on Thursday was celebrating the naming of the company’s chief content officer, Ted Sarandos, as co-CEO, did not immediately comment on the court’s ruling.

In a statement to USA Today last year, Netflix said the company takes accusations of discrimination very seriously and would fight Mo’Nique’s lawsuit, describing their opening offer to her as fair.

NEW YORK - A Canadian fashion mogul is asking a U.S. court to dismiss a class-action lawsuit alleging he sexually assaulted dozens of women.

Peter Nygard's motion filed Wednesday in a New York court argues it does not have jurisdiction to hear the lawsuit.

Fifty-seven women, including 18 Canadians, have joined the lawsuit, which alleges that Nygard used violence, intimidation, bribery and company employees to lure victims and avoid accountability for decades.

The women are asking for a trial by jury and are seeking yet-to-be determined damages.

Nygard, who is 78, has denied all allegations and blames a conspiracy caused by a feud with his billionaire neighbour in the Bahamas.

He stepped down as chairman of his company after the FBI and police in New York City raided his offices in February soon after the lawsuit was filed.

The original lawsuit against Nygard included allegations from 10 women accusing him of enticing them to his estate in the Bahamas. Women continued to add their names to the lawsuit.

Some of the allegations date back 40 years.

In court documents, the women share stories about being brought to Nygard's offices and properties with promises of modelling and other career opportunities. Some of the women allege they were given alcohol spiked with drugs before they were sexually assaulted.

The lawsuit contains allegations that have not been proven in court.

Nygard was once one of the richest people in Canada. The lawsuit said Nygard has an estimated net worth of about $900 million.

He started his company in Winnipeg more than 50 years ago.

Nygard says Manitoba has been his primary residence since the start of 2019. He considered Nassau in the Bahamas, where he has permanent residency, his main home from 1970 until that time.

Court documents say he is not a citizen or permanent resident in the United States and doesn't pay taxes in New York.

Nygard also says that while New York City was described as the Nygard “world” or “corporate” headquarters, it was only done for promotional and marketing purposes.

The motion argues that the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York does not have jurisdiction for those reasons.

The documents also say the women's claims are not eligible for a class-action suit.

1269,"WASHINGTON - Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said Friday she is receiving chemotherapy for a recurrence of cancer, but has no plans to retire from the Supreme Court.

The 87-year-old Ginsburg, who has had four earlier bouts with cancer including pancreatic cancer last year, said her treatment so far has succeeded in reducing lesions on her liver and she will continue chemotherapy sessions every two weeks “to keep my cancer at bay.”

“I have often said I would remain a member of the Court as long as I can do the job full steam. I remain fully able to do that,” Ginsburg said in a statement issued by the court.

Ginsburg, who was appointed by President Bill Clinton in 1993, is the senior liberal justice on a court that leans conservative by a 5-4 margin. Her departure before the election could give President Donald Trump the chance to shift the court further to the right.

Ginsburg’s history with cancer goes back more than 20 years. In addition to being treated without surgery for a tumour on her pancreas last year, she also underwent surgery for colorectal cancer in 1999, pancreatic cancer in 2009 and lung cancer in December 2018.

Dr. Alan Venook, a pancreatic cancer specialist at the University of California, San Francisco, who is not involved in Ginsburg’s care, said that “clearly, she’s got incurable disease now” because of the spread to her liver.

On average, patients with advanced pancreatic cancer live about a year, but the fact that her disease took so long to recur from her initial pancreatic cancer surgery in 2009 and previous treatments “suggests that it’s not been growing rapidly,” he said.

“She’s above average in many ways.“ and has done remarkably well with all her treatments so far, Venook said. “There’s no reason to think she would die imminently.”

Asked earlier this week about a possible opening on the court before the election, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said the president would act quickly if any opening were to arise. Meadows commented after news that Ginsburg had left the hospital after receiving treatment for an infection, which she said Friday was unrelated to the cancer.

“I can’t imagine if he had a vacancy on the Supreme Court that he would not very quickly make the appointment and look for the Senate to take quick action,“ Meadows said, adding that he didn’t want any comment to be seen as wishing Ginsburg “anything but the very best.”

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has said that if there were to be a vacancy on the court during this year’s election cycle, the Republican-controlled Senate would likely confirm a nominee selected by Trump.

Ginsburg said she was disclosing her cancer treatment now because she is satisfied “that my treatment course is now clear.”

Venook said the chemotherapy drug Ginsburg said she is getting, gemcitabine, is one that’s often used. Immunotherapy, which Ginsburg’s statement said she tried unsuccessfully, has not worked well for pancreatic cancer, Venook said.

Ginsburg said a medical scan in February revealed growths on her liver and she began chemotherapy in May.

“My most recent scan on July 7 indicated significant reduction of the liver lesions and no new disease,” she said. “I am tolerating chemotherapy well and am encouraged by the success of my current treatment.”

Ginsburg noted that she is able to “maintain an active daily routine” and that throughout her treatment she has “kept up with opinion writing and all other Court work.”

When the justices heard arguments via telephone in May because of the coronavirus pandemic, Ginsburg participated one day from a hospital room in Baltimore. She was being treated for gall stones, and said Friday that hospitalization also had nothing to do with the cancer.

BEIJING - China has moved a rocket into position to launch a rover to Mars in one of three upcoming missions to the red planet, one from the U.S. and another by the United Arab Emirates.

The Long March-5 carrier rocket is China 's heaviest-lift launch vehicle and has been used experimentally three times, but never with a payload. Dubbed Tianwen-1, China 's mission to Mars aims to land a rover to gather scientific data.

The rocket is due to blast off from the Wenchang Space Launch Center in the southern island province of Hainan in late July or early August, according to state media reports Friday that quoted the China National Space Administration.

The mission is one of the most ambitious yet for China 's space program, which has advanced rapidly since launching its first crewed mission in 2003. Since then, it has sent astronauts to an experimental space station, begun work on a larger, more permanent facility and landed a probe on the less-explored far side of the moon.

This summer's trio of missions in the most sweeping effort yet to seek signs of ancient microscopic life while scouting out Mars for future astronauts.

The timelines for such missions are daunting and the countries involved are striving to take best advantage of a one-month window in which Mars and Earth are in ideal alignment on the same side of the sun, minimizing travel time and fuel use. Such a window opens only once every 26 months.

Preparations have continued amid the coronavirus outbreak, which in part prompted Europe and Russia to drop their plans to send a life-seeking rover to Mars this summer.

Each spacecraft will travel more than 480 million kilometres (300 million miles) before reaching Mars next February. In the process, they will loop out beyond Earth's orbit and sync up with Mars' more distant orbit around the sun.

The U.S. is sending over a car-sized six-wheeled rover named Perseverance to collect rock samples to be returned to Earth for analysis in about a decade. It's launch date has been set for between July 30 and Aug. 15.

The UAE spacecraft, named Amal, or “Hope” in Arabic, is an orbiter built in partnership with the University of Colorado Boulder and is now scheduled to launch from Japan on Monday. It will be the Arab world's first interplanetary mission.

Scientists want to know what Mars was like billions of years ago, back when it had water sources that may have supported tiny life forms before turning into the frozen world it is today.

So far, the U.S. has been the only country to successfully put a spacecraft on Mars, doing it eight times. Two NASA landers are operating there, InSight and Curiosity. Six other spacecraft are exploring the planet from orbit: three U.S., two European and one from India.",China moves rocket into place for upcoming Mars mission,4,0.9780941122656858

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. - The launch of NASA's successor to the Hubble Space Telescope faces seven more months of delay, this time because of the pandemic and technical issues.

Officials announced Thursday that the James Webb Space Telescope - the space agency's top science priority - is now scheduled to launch on Oct. 31, 2021. The previous target date was March 2021.

This next-generation observatory - designed to peer farther into space and further back into time than any other spacecraft - originally was supposed to fly more than a decade ago. The previous two-year-plus delay, announced in 2018, was due to worker error and hardware problems. Until COVID-19 struck, everything was finally going well, officials said.

“Mission success is critical, but team safety is our highest priority,” said NASA Associate Administrator Steve Jurczyk.

NASA stressed that the costs stemming from the latest postponement will not exceed the $8.8 billion spending cap for development set by Congress. Budget reserves set aside two years ago during the last major assessment will cover any additional expenses, said Thomas Zurbuchen, the space agency's science mission chief.

Nearly half the delay, about three months, is attributed to COVID-19. The outbreak has slowed work on the telescope by prime contractor Northrop Grumman in Southern California.

Another four months of padding was needed in the schedule to meet the new launch date, officials said, and lessons learned in spacecraft testing made clear just how much more time was needed. A critical acoustic and vibration test, for instance, is planned on the fully assembled telescope next month. Technicians also want to reopen and refold Webb's massive sun shield - the size of a tennis court - once more. The sun shield is needed to keep the infrared telescope cold once in space.

NASA plans to ship Webb next summer to its European launch site in French Guiana - Europe's contribution to the mission.

“Of course, it's hard to predict a year plus from now how things will be here and there,” said program director Gregory Robinson.

Set to soar on an European Ariane rocket, Webb is destined for a point 1 million miles (1.6 million kilometres) from Earth, well beyond astronauts' reach. The orbiting Hubble, by contrast, was repeatedly serviced by shuttle astronauts following its 1990 launch. It's expected to continue working into the 2030s, officials said Thursday.

NASA wants an overlap in operations between Hubble and Webb. The new telescope, once launched, will look at many of the same things Hubble has - and will.

“For me, it will be seeing old friends with completely new eyes,” said program scientist Eric Smith.

1272,"3M has investigated 4,000 reports globally of fraud, counterfeiting and price gouging in connection with its N95 respirators. As a result, it has filed 18 lawsuits in North America.

The Maplewood, Minn.-based company Thursday issued an update of its battle against scams as COVID-19 has greatly increased demand for N95 masks, the gold standard in protection against pathogens and other particulate matter.

3M is the leading U.S. manufacturer of N95 respirators and among the largest globally.

3M said that so far, courts have issued six temporary restraining orders and four preliminary injunctions to stop N95 sales operations alleged to be unlawful. The company said it has provided referrals to law enforcement agencies that have helped lead to criminal charges in some cases.

“The schemes we shut down were not only unlawful, they also endangered lives and wasted precious time and resources by diverting buyers from legitimate sources of much-needed respirators,” said Denise Rutherford, 3M senior vice president of corporate affairs.

In addition to litigation, 3M said it has removed more than 7,000 e-commerce listings with fraudulent or counterfeit product offerings and more than 10,000 false or deceptive social media posts.

The pace of alleged N95 scams hasn’t slowed. “I attribute much of that constant pace to the fact that supply does not meet demand, and that gives fraudsters an opportunity,” Haley Schaffer, 3M assistant general counsel, said in an interview.

In U.S. District Court in Minnesota, 3M last month sued Legacy Medical Supplies and four people connected with the company, claiming they were “running a scam.”

Legacy Medical was trying to sell 3M brand N95 respirators at a 75 per cent to 267 per cent markup over 3M’s list price, 3M said in a court filing. “That represents price gouging and unconscionable profiteering during a global pandemic,” the filing said.

The lawsuit alleged that two of the defendants, Legacy’s Chief Operating Officer Jeremy Reboulet and consultant Carol Ann Korpi, falsely claimed to a Minnesota attorney that they had a personal relationship with Nick Gangestad, 3M’s chief financial officer.

Korpi, the lawsuit said, also sent the attorney an email indicating that Legacy sources N95 respirators through “3M attorneys.”

“This is not only false, but also nonsensical,” the suit said.

Legacy is not a 3M-authorized distributor as it claimed, the lawsuit said. It also claimed it could access between 250 million and 47 billion respirators at a time — far more than 3M even has the capacity to produce, the suit said.

Reboulet said Thursday that “none of what they are saying is true. ... There is no guilt here.”

A judge this week issued a temporary restraining order against Reboulet and a fourth defendant, which 3M listed as consultant Mark Eckhardt.

According to his LinkedIn page, Reboulet lives in Scottsdale, Ariz., and is CEO of Legacy Trust and Holdings of Carmel, Ind., as well as founder and president of Condor Solution Inc. in Minnetonka. Legacy Medical Supplies, which was formed this year, is registered in Indiana, according to the lawsuit.

Eckhardt is a consultant for Legacy Medical who is believed to live in the Philadelphia area, the lawsuit said. He couldn’t be reached for comment.

Korpi, whose LinkedIn page says she is founder of CA Consults in the San Francisco Bay Area, could not be reached for comment. She settled 3M claims against her earlier this week.

So did Joseph Nelson, another defendant listed in the suit as Legacy’s vice president for operations. “We resolved it,” Nelson said, declining to comment further.

Nelson, according to his LinkedIn page, lives in the Minneapolis area and works as a senior account executive at LinkedIn. He is also the head coach of the women’s lacrosse team at Concordia University in St. Paul.

In the other Minnesota case, 3M sued Matthew Starsiak and AMK Energy Services in federal court, saying they were running a scam.

The lawsuit said that Starsiak in May approached 3M falsely claiming to represent a consortium of wealthy people and charitable foundations, including Bill and Melinda Gates, Richard Branson and Elon Musk.

Starsiak, who is president of AMK, then used the names of senior 3M lawyers he had communicated with “as bait to lure unwitting buyers into placing large amounts of money in escrow to purchase billions of fictitious 3M N95 respirators,” the lawsuit claims.

The company said Starsiak, a former U.S. Marine Corps major, used his service record “to win trust so he could trick people into paying for 3M N95 respirators that he does not have.” Starsiak, who lives in Bountiful, Utah, declined to comment.

A federal judge granted 3M a temporary restraining order against Starsiak and his company in late June.

The Minnesota litigation has the hallmarks of many of 3M’s N95 fraud suits.

Schaffer said common litigation threads include: defendants claiming to be have a relationship with 3M — including as authorized dealers — when they don’t; huge sales pitches that would be difficult or impossible to fill; and the involvement of 3M lawyers in sales transactions.

As if trying to deal with the financial and health ramifications of the novel coronavirus wasn’t enough, we are all now facing the reality of taking a long, hard look at systemic racism in society and in our institutions.

Two giant subjects thrust upon us at the same time.

• READ MORE: Conversation about racism an opportunity to shut up and speak up

• READ MORE: COLUMN: The call for full-scale economic reopening is an argument to cull the herd

It’s easy to feel smug as a Canadian when one puts on a nationalist lens and sees how badly many U.S. states have done to (not) deal with COVID-19 in a culture of misinformation and denial. Then there is the treatment of minorities at the hands of some police in America.

So you think cops in Toronto have a problem with racism? You think Quebec’s pandemic response was bad? Take a look at Minneapolis or New York City on the former. And New York State and Texas on the latter.

But none of this is a competition and relativism is a risky game. We’ve had our own missteps in Canada, and we had a tragic lack of preparedness nationwide for this pandemic, according to some experts.

Sandy Buchman, president of the Canadian Medical Association said the country should have been better prepared and he made it clear recently in a number of media interviews that Canada had “not planned appropriately over time.”

A lack of a timely and co-ordinated response exacerbated the crisis, and continues to do so here in Canada. Yet Canadians can be easily distracted by POTUS Tweets, and clips of him complaining that too much testing was leading to too many cases.

On racism, it’s too easy to look south of the border and put your face in your palm. But every day right here in Canada on the streets and in hospitals and courtrooms and homeless shelters we see the legacy of the genocidal residential school system where the nation attempted, nearly successfully, to culturally erase the Indigenous population of this beautiful land, the land that those of use who are not Indigenous call Canada.

On the topic of COVID-19 in Canada, with a Libertarian lens, every government intervention feels like an attack on deeply held beliefs, even if the reason is to protect the most vulnerable.

On systemic racism in policing, that is a matter hotly up for debate to be sure, but that it is a debate at all is troubling.

Clearly we are doing better in Canada than they are in the U.S. on these subjects. Even the otherwise bombastic Ontario Premier Doug Ford has been almost statesmanlike as he has responded to the crisis in a way that has shocked his critics.

Politicians from opposition parties at the federal and provincial level here in B.C. have been similarly measured and mature, rarely looking to score cheap political points as the Trudeau Liberals in Ottawa and the Horgan New Democrats in Victoria do what they can to implement the recommendations by experts in public health to prevent our communities from serious infection levels as we have seen, and are still seeing, in other parts of the world.

The Conservatives in Ottawa and the BC Liberals may be increasingly critical of government, but that is their mandated role, and they have been uniquely Canadian in their restraint as those in power struggle with a pandemic the world hasn’t seen in 100 years.

It is pretty great to be Canadian and it can be agonizing to see some of the behaviour that goes on south of the border.

But we aren’t perfect, we shouldn’t be smug, we can always strive to be better.

Moving past Canada Day, let’s just say the cup is half full and, hopefully, we’ll see you on Canada Day 2021.

1275,"A group of Fraser Valley defence lawyers are urging the government to quickly reopen provincial courts lest “a growing tsunami of criminal cases” never see the light of day.

In a letter penned by Rob Dhanu and signed by 20 other lawyers, the argument is put forth that if liquor stores and laundromats and Walmart remained in operation amid the COVID-19 pandemic, why couldn’t the courts?

And with phase two in B.C. seeing yet more businesses able to open safely, why not provincial courts?

“Charter scrutiny will require us to ask how it was possible that British Columbians could receive a massage or a haircut but still not access their courts?” the letter states.

(See below for the entire letter, unedited.)

The letter goes so far as to say that: “One of the greatest court systems in the world is in its worst moment of crisis as numerous criminal matters dangle on the precipice of oblivion.”

Why oblivion? Why is delay so serious? Any non-lawyer who has spent any time in courts will know that nothing moves quickly. And time and again, it’s these very defence lawyers asking for adjournment after adjournment.

• READ MORE: COVID-19: B.C. provincial court to reduce operations

• READ MORE: COVID-19: B.C. supreme and provincial courts suspend regular operations

Asked about this perceived hypocrisy – defence lawyers who constantly adjourn files now complaining about delays – Dhanu responded that very few matters ever go to trial as they are resolved before that stage. He said files are often adjourned so that resolution can happen in the background. Many things need to happen outside of court including, for example, discussions with Crown, reference letters being completed, expert assessments made, and counselling or treatment arranged.

What is of great concern to all defence lawyers is delays that violate the Charter rights of the accused, rights that are now further enshrined in the so-called R v. Jordan decision that says all provincial criminal matters need to be resolved in 18 months, from charge to trial (or resolution).

What could prove to be of great concern for the justice system going forward, according to Dhanu and his colleagues, is the definition of “exceptional circumstances” where delay is allowed under Jordan.

The novel coronavirus outbreak that led to a global pandemic is about as exceptional as it gets, so clearly Jordan arguments will be a no-go, right?

Not so fast, say the lawyers. According to the court, in Jordan exceptional circumstances lie outside the Crown’s control in that they are reasonably unforeseen or unavoidable. But Dhanu says the analysis doesn’t end there. He says the Crown must “proactively mitigate the delay” and help prevent “a possibly devastating cascade of delay issues.”

He argues further that if the courts open in several weeks or months with protective measures in place such as plexiglass and hand sanitizer, then the question will be, why couldn’t this have been done sooner since they did it at, for example, the liqour store?

And if the courts open in several weeks without such measures, even more questions around delay will be asked.

An even further argument is being made regarding the BC Supreme Court, which in places like Chilliwack functions side-by-side with provincial court. The BC Supreme Court is re-opening its doors (supposedly) this week, while the much busier (from a criminal perspective) provincial court is limited to two courtrooms in Surrey and one courtroom in four other courthouses in the Lower Mainland as of June 8.

“There will be an obvious inconsistency if one level of court in this province is open for business and the other is not,” Dhanu writes.

All of this is to say that COVID-19 is a terrible yoke on an already over-burdened justice system.

And while I am not a lawyer, I don’t for a second believe any Crown counsel will agree that delays stemming from the pandemic will count towards the Jordan 18-month ceiling. Will any judge buy the argument? We will see, but I don’t know.

But that doesn’t mean these 20 lawyers don’t plan on floating that boat when provincial courts are back up and running in the coming weeks.

QUIS CUSTODIET IPSOS CUSTODES – “WHO WATCHES THE WATCHERS?” ~Juvenal

A growing tsunami of criminal cases may be at risk of never seeing the light of day due to delays arising from the coronavirus pandemic and the response of British Columbia courts. In mid-March of this year, all three levels of our court system effectively shuttered their doors to all but the most “urgent” of cases. Unfortunately, even these most urgent of matters could not proceed due to the woefully inadequate technological infrastructure at the disposal of the court system. Today, we are face to face with an ever-increasing log jam of delayed hearings that add daily to the already clogged corridors of our courts. The continued inability of our court system to stem the tide increasingly raises the spectre of unreasonable delay under section 11(b) of the Charter.

Thus far, the overwhelming assumption among court stakeholders has been that Covid-19 constitutes “exceptional circumstances” when it comes to R. v. Jordan and delay. According to the court in Jordan, exceptional circumstances lie outside the Crown’s control in the sense that they are reasonably unforeseen or unavoidable. But the exceptional circumstances analysis does not end there. Both the justice system and Crown must also proactively mitigate the delay resulting from a discrete exceptional circumstance. This is the sword of Damocles that now hangs over our justice system in terms of a possibly devastating cascade of delay issues arising from continued closure and a seeming inability to efficiently or effectively pivot to deal with them.

Much of the current criticism against our justice system has centred around the failure of technology to pick up where the closure of our courts left off. There can be no doubt that the tradition laden court system has lagged behind advancements in technology that have reshaped our daily world. However, the technology issue is a proverbial red herring. Even if the technology available to our courts were far more advanced, the vast majority of hearings still could not have proceeded. That is because in person hearings are required to tender exhibits, for credibility assessments to be made, to allow juries to sit or myriad other reasons underpinning our system of justice. Thus, the technology issue may factor into the delay analysis but it plays a far lesser role than the real question. That being whether our courts took reasonable steps to mitigate issues of delay using the considerable resources they did have at their disposal.

Charter analysis will begin with the fact that, unlike many other jurisdictions that imposed strict “lockdown” policies, British Columbia’s approach was to require safe operation of a broad range of services designated as essential services, to protect the health care system and maintain access to key services and supplies. Many non-essential businesses remained open, provided they could operate safely. Our court system and related legal professionals were designated an essential service by the government of this province. From hospitals to laundromats and liquor stores to large retailers with numerous locations and employees, essential and non-essential businesses across the province quickly responded to social distancing directives in a timely if painful manner in order to keep their doors open. Thus, the delay analysis begins with the question of why our courts could not pivot in a timely manner to do the same.

Analyzing inconsistencies in the response of our courts will inform the delay analysis. On March 13, 2020, a joint notice was issued by all three levels of our courts that they had developed a coordinated approach to manage impacts of coronavirus on their operations. However, this coordinated approach did not translate to what was actually occurring on the ground for long. Due to the nature of appellate practice, the British Columbia Court of Appeal was able to shift gears to online hearings courtesy of Zoom video conferencing technology in a way trial courts simply could not.

But the real dichotomy in responses will likely lay between British Columbia Supreme and Provincial courts. Supreme courts opened for at least some in person hearings including trial matters in May by simply employing social distancing protocols. Meanwhile, our Provincial courts remained closed. Our Supreme Court announced that they would be reopening their doors on June 8, 2020 (although if this actually occurs remains to be seen). On the other hand, the workhorse for most criminal matters, the Provincial Court, directed a far more limited opening of 2 courtrooms in Surrey and 1 courtroom in 4 other courthouses in the Lower Mainland and Fraser Valley as of June 8th. There will be an obvious inconsistency if one level of court in this province is open for business and the other is not. This inconsistency is perhaps most glaring in courthouses where both Supreme and Provincial courts function side by side within the confines of the same building. For instance, a litigant could seemingly walk into Victoria Supreme Court to have their day in court but it would apparently be too dangerous to do so in the Provincial courtroom next door.

The delay analysis will not only involve exploring inconsistencies between our courts, but also with government. On May 6, 2020, the provincial government announced that Phase 2 of British Columbia’s Restart Plan would commence as of May 19 and include restoration of a wide array of services including elective surgeries, dentistry, physiotherapy, massage, the retail sector, hair salons, restaurants, pubs, libraries, offices, sports, parks, child care and much more. The government further announced that Phase 3 would commence in June and would include reopening of schools, hotels, parks and movie theatres.

Meanwhile, on May 7, 2020, our Supreme Court directed that all criminal matters scheduled for any type of appearance up to and including May 29, 2020 were to be adjourned. One day after this, on May 8, 2020, the Provincial Court announced “Covid-2” or the second phase of yet further rolling adjournments for all criminal law matters scheduled for trial or continuation between May 19 to July 3, 2020. If any in custody trials in the month of May were believed to be urgent, accused, their counsel or Crown counsel were required to arrange for an “Urgency Application”. Otherwise, consent to the adjournment would be deemed to have been provided.

The incongruous and similarly timed announcements of our government’s Phase 2 Restart Plan and the announcement of “Covid-2” by our Provincial Court, as well as its unnamed equivalent from Supreme Court, raises further questions when assessing delay. Dr. Bonnie Henry, British Columbia’s provincial health officer, had declared that citizens of this province were able to safely resume numerous services and activities including those involving close physical contact. By May 15, 2020, health authorities were directing that gyms could reopen. Charter scrutiny will require us to ask how it was possible that British Columbians could receive a massage or a haircut but still not access their courts?

The delay analysis will not only involve scrutinizing inconsistencies but also assessing outcomes. If our courts reopen weeks or months from now with some physical distancing measures in place, a somewhat different courtroom layout with plexiglass and hand sanitizer added for good measure we will have to ask why it took so long for such basic measures to be taken when businesses of all sizes accomplished such changes within days. If they reopen without some of those basic measures in place even more questions will be raised as to delay. In fact, some observers have already noted that courtrooms, where counsel, court clerks, the judge and witnesses typically sit approximately 6 feet apart from one another are better situated than many businesses to respond to the pandemic. Assessing outcomes will involve working backwards to see whether resources were made available by government to our courts on a timely basis, whether proper expertise were engaged and when as well as myriad others questions to determine whether circumstances remained exceptional.

Charter challenges will not be limited to delay alone as the “Urgency Application” process implemented by our courts is also vulnerable. Under section 7 and 11(d) of the Charter, all Canadian citizens have a right to a fair trial. The “Urgency Application” process turns these Charter rights on their head by reversing the burden so an accused person, who is presumed innocent, has to make application to even have an opportunity to access this right. This includes individuals who are in custody awaiting trial and whose very freedom is at stake.

Perhaps even more problematic, the “Urgency Application” process turned out to be a straw man as virtually no such application was successful. This is because our shuttered court system actually did not have the ability to accommodate even so-called urgent trial proceedings. As a result, the potential for constitutional argument exists that the “Urgency Application” process was, in fact, a veneer of due process used to dress up the closure of our court system. A hearing process with no chance of success is not due process and strikes at the core of our constitutional values. Further, failure to bring an “Urgency Application” meant you were deemed to be giving away this right. This is problematic for every single litigant but especially so for self-represented accused whose trial rights were summarily stripped from them by the very courts sworn to uphold them.

Each day that passes while our courts remain closed or operating at greatly reduced capacity creates a devastating domino effect on all currently scheduled matters. Add to this a possible flood of delay applications as litigants argue their right to a timely and fair trial has been violated. One of the greatest court systems in the world is in its worst moment of crisis as numerous criminal matters dangle on the precipice of oblivion. Now is the time for bold action as well as increased innovation and transparency or we risk reaching the point of no return.

BEIJING - China isn't seeking to confront or replace the United States as the world's top technological power, but will fight back against “malicious slander” and attacks from Washington, a foreign ministry spokesperson said Friday, responding to a litany of recent accusations from the Trump administration.

Hua Chunying said China 's chief concern is improving the livelihoods of its citizens and maintaining global peace and stability, despite what critics say is an increasingly aggressive foreign policy that looks to expand Chinese influence in the military, technology, economic and other spheres.

“As an independent sovereign state, China has the right to safeguard its own sovereignty, security and development interests, to defend the achievements made by the Chinese people with hard work, to refuse any bullying and injustice against China , and to fight back against malicious slander and attacks by the U.S. against China ,” Hua said at a daily briefing.

Her comments came in response to a speech Thursday by U.S. Attorney General William Barr in which he cautioned American business leaders against promoting policies favourable to Beijing. He asserted that China at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic had not only dominated the market for protective gear, exposing American dependence on Beijing, but had also hoarded supplies and blocked producers from exporting them to countries in need.

Barr also accused hackers linked to the Chinese government of targeting American universities and businesses to steal research related to coronavirus vaccine development, levelling the allegation against Beijing hours after Western agencies made similar claims against Russia.

“The People's Republic of China is now engaged in an economic blitzkrieg - an aggressive, orchestrated, whole-of-government (indeed, whole-of-society) campaign to seize the commanding heights of the global economy and to surpass the United States as the world's preeminent technological superpower,” Barr said.

Numerous Trump allies have issued strongly worded messages over China in recent days, coming at a time when bilateral relations have fallen to their lowest point in decades over issues from accusations of technology theft to China 's claims in the South China Sea.

Hua dismissed Barr's accusations of cybertheft related to vaccine development as “absurd.”

“Because everyone knows that China is in a leading position in the research and development of new coronavirus vaccines, we have first-class scientific research personnel, and we do not need to gain a leading position with theft,” Hua said.

Chinese companies have moved swiftly to develop a coronavirus vaccine, as countries compete for the prestige and profits that would come with being the first to bring such a product to market.","China says it's not trying to replace US, won't be bullied",2,0.41555904721243764

TORONTO - Alex Trebek says he's “feeling great” and is looking forward to the day he can safely return to the studio to shoot new “Jeopardy!” episodes.

The native of Sudbury, Ont., says his treatment for stage 4 pancreatic cancer “is paying off,” but is tiring.

The game show host provided the health update Thursday in a video posted to the show's website and social media accounts, revealing a new goatee.

Trebek says he's been working from home, where he is recording show openings for vintage “Jeopardy!” episodes that will air later this month.

He's also been working on his memoir, “The Answer Is ... Reflections on My Life.” The book hits shelves Tuesday, the day before Trebek's 80th birthday.

Trebek announced he had stage 4 pancreatic cancer in March of last year.

“I'm doing well,” Trebek said in his latest video.

“I've been continuing my treatment and it is paying off, though it does fatigue me a great deal. My numbers are good. I'm feeling great.”

Trebek said “Jeopardy!” is preparing to air favourite past episodes, including the very first show he ever hosted, “moustache and all.”

Trebek has previously acknowledged a difficult journey in his cancer treatment.

Earlier this year, he admitted to “sudden massive attacks of great depression” that made him “wonder if it really was worth fighting.”

But he credited his wife and “soulmate Jean” with helping him persevere.

In his latest update, Trebek expressed eagerness to get back to work.

“I can't wait to return to the studio and start recording shows for the new season in September,” Trebek said Thursday.

“Meanwhile, my wish for all of you - stay safe.”

Gary Longhi, a four-time Paralympian and Canada’s flag-bearer for the opening ceremonies of the 2000 Sydney Paralympics, has died at the age of 56. THE CANADIAN PRESS/AP, Rob Griffith

Gary Longhi, a four-time Paralympian and Canada’s flag-bearer for the opening ceremonies of the 2000 Sydney Paralympics, has died at the age of 56.

The Canadian Paralympic Committee announced Longhi’s death Friday.

The road cyclist competed in the 1988, 1992, 1996 and 2000 Games, winning gold and bronze in ‘96 in Atlanta and silver in ‘92 in Barcelona.

The Montreal native was the first Paralympic athlete to be inducted into the Canadian Cycling Hall of Fame in 2017.

Ahead of his induction Longhi said that he cherished the camaraderie of cycling for the Canadian team.

“Sometimes in society I feel like an outsider,” he said. “On the bike I’m normal. Everything is smooth, not as harsh as usual. It’s freedom for me.”

Longhi took up elite-level cycling as part of his rehabilitation following a 1983 motorcycle crash that nearly claimed his life and left him in a coma for three months. His brain injury qualified him for Para cerebral palsy category of competition.

The Supreme Court of Canada has upheld a judge’s decision to halt a murder case because of excessive delay, even though the accused man was long ago deported from Canada.

The ruling today is the high court’s latest pronouncement on the pressing issue of timely justice.

In 2017, a Quebec Superior Court judge ruled Sivaloganathan Thanabalasingham should not face trial for the alleged killing of his wife due to the nearly 60-month delay between his 2012 arrest and the start of proceedings.

In its landmark Jordan decision, the Supreme Court set a 30-month limit between the laying of charges and the conclusion of a trial for superior court cases.

Thanabalasingham was deported to his native Sri Lanka following his release, but arguments about halting the case continued to play out in the Canadian courts.

Last October the Quebec Court of Appeal said the Crown had not proven any errors in the trial judge’s decision to stay the murder charge.

1286,"Fox News host Tucker Carlson distanced himself and his program from the incendiary hate speech posted online by a former writer who worked on his top-rated program.

But critics who expected an apology from the conservative cable provocateur for the out-of-office behaviour of Blake Neff, who worked on “Tucker Carlson Tonight” since January 2017, did not get one. He even delivered a parting shot at them.

“What Blake wrote anonymously was wrong,” Carlson said Monday on his program, reading from a statement. “We don’t endorse those words, they have no connection to the show. It is wrong to attack people for qualities they cannot control. In this country we judge people for what they do, not for how they were born. We often say that because we mean it. We’ll continue to defend that principle often alone among national news programs because it is essential ... Blake fell short of that standard and he has paid a very heavy price for it.”

Neff had written racist and sexist comments under a pseudonym on the message board AutoAdmit. He resigned Friday after a CNN report revealed his postings on the site for law school students that bills itself as a forum for “supporters of the marketplace of ideas and freedom of expression.” Neff shared racist and bigoted opinions on Black and Asian people, the Mormon church and immigrants.

Still, Carlson had harsh words for his detractors whom he accused of revelling in Neff’s departure. “We are all human,” he said. “When we pretend we are holy, we are lying. When we pose as blameless in order to hurt other people we are committing the gravest sin of all and we will be punished for it. There is no question.”

A former reporter at the Daily Caller, the conservative news site co-founded by Carlson, Neff also created multiple discussion threads where he mocked women he was friendly with on social media for sharing details about their personal lives, and engaged with posts containing racist vitriol.

Neff was part of a small group of writers who help Carlson craft the commentaries he presents throughout his nightly program, which in recent months has been the most-watched program in cable news, averaging more than 4 million viewers a night. Some nights, in the current fragmented TV landscape, “Tucker Carlson Tonight” is the most watched program in all of television.

Carlson is among the Fox News hosts who is regularly watched by President Donald Trump. There has even been speculation by political columnists that Carlson would be a viable Republican presidential candidate in 2024 who would carry Trump’s message of anti-immigration nationalism and economic populism.

But Carlson, who first joined Fox News in 2016, has been harshly criticized for remarks he has made regarding immigrants and race. He recently scared off advertisers, including T-Mobile, Papa John’s and Walt Disney Co., from his program with a commentary in which he said the Black Lives Matters movement “may be a lot of things, this moment we’re living through, but it is definitely not about Black lives. Remember that when they come for you, and at this rate, they will.” Fox News issued a clarification of the remarks, saying the “they” referred to Democratic politicians and not Black people.

Fox News hosts rarely apologize when faced with a public backlash over their programs.

But the Neff comments prompted a rare rebuke from senior Fox News executives. In a statement to staff Saturday, Fox News Chief Executive Suzanne Scott and Fox News Media President and Executive Editor Jay Wallace condemned Neff’s remarks, calling them “horrendous and deeply offensive.”

“We want to make abundantly clear that Fox News Media strongly condemns this horrific racist, misogynistic and homophobic behaviour,” they said in a statement. “Neff’s abhorrent conduct was never divulged to the show until Friday, at which point we swiftly accepted his resignation. Make no mistake, actions such as his cannot and will not be tolerated at any time in any part of our workforce.”

Media Matters, a liberal media watchdog group that has long pressured advertisers to pull their commercials from Fox News programming, said Neff’s comments were not far from the rhetoric that showed up on “Tucker Carlson Tonight.”

“His day job was writing a somewhat more sophisticated version of his online posts for Carlson’s show,” Media Matters senior fellow Matt Gertz wrote Monday. “His employment provides a clue as to how some particular obsessions of that community ended up on Fox prime time. But ‘Tucker Carlson Tonight’ is drenched in the talking points of white nationalists because that’s the way Carlson wants it.”

But aside from online outrage, Carlson’s critics have little economic leverage to pressure Fox News to take the host off the air.

For most of this year, Carlson’s program has been airing without the support of national brand advertising, as companies have defected over remarks he had made regarding immigrants and race. Nearly all of the commercials on his program are from direct-response advertisers who solicit customers through 1-800 phone numbers or websites, such as MyPillow.com. Such marketers tend to be less particular about the content of the programs where their ads run.

MyPillow had four commercials on Monday’s program, which also included ads for Fungi-Nail, a toe nail fungus remover made by Arcadia Consumer Healthcare, and Pray.com, an app that serves up Bible stories.

“I am not changing my advertising,” MyPillow Chief Executive Mike Lindell said in a statement. “I make my decisions based on what is best for MyPillow customers and employees.”

Lindell is a staunch supporter of President Trump.

Carlson has endured the advertiser exodus because he has the backing of Fox Corp. Executive Chairman Rupert Murdoch, who picked the host to replace Bill O’Reilly in prime time in 2017. O’Reilly was ousted over sexual harassment allegations, for which he and Fox News paid multimillion dollar settlements to keep them from being publicly revealed.",Fox News host Tucker Carlson criticizes racist comments of show writer but offers no apology,2,0.395484065253623

TORONTO - When “Canada's Drag Race” starts its engines Thursday on Crave, it will be just as glittery and entertaining as the American version, say the judges.

But with the camp and “condragulations” comes an added level of resonance, as the series arrives just after Pride month and Canada Day, and amid the Black Lives Matter movement's urgent calls for justice and more representation of marginalized voices, they add.

With that, Brooke Lynn Hytes, Jeffrey Bowyer-Chapman, and Stacey McKenzie hope the series serves as an important “educational experience” that isn't taken for granted.

“It's entertaining, but it tells the stories of queer people and of drag artists in a way that humanizes us,” Bowyer-Chapman, an actor and activist, said in a phone interview.

“It peels back the layers of otherness or misconceptions that the general population - the status quo, heteronormative audiences - may place upon us. They may see us as this other thing, they may see drag queens as these beasts, these monsters. They may see Black, queer people as these very threatening femme queens, or whatever stories they tell themselves.

“And I think that through the beauty of this show and showcasing the artistry of drag, and getting to know who these individuals are on a deeply personal level through their interactions and experiences and them sharing their life stories on the show, it's the perfect equalizer... It shows that we have so much more in common than what separates us.”

Like “RuPaul's Drag Race,” the Canadian version is a competition series in which drag artists compete in a series of challenges for the title of the Next Drag Superstar and a grand prize of $100,000.

Bowyer-Chapman is on the main judging panel alongside McKenzie, who is a supermodel, runway coach and “America's Next Top Model” mentor; and Hytes, who was the first Canadian competitor to be featured on “RuPaul's Drag Race” and placed second on the show.

Singer Deborah Cox and actors Elisha Cuthbert, Tom Green, and Amanda Brugel are among the celebrity guests in the episodes, which roll out weekly.

The core of the show is the same as the American one, minus RuPaul, said the judges. And there are some “Canadian nuggets,” including a giant, glittery maple leaf on set.

“The show is so important for Canadian queens because it gives them something to work towards. It gives them a goal, it gives them a dream,” said Hytes, a classically trained ballet dancer and model who's performed around Canada and the U.S. Hytes is the drag queen persona of Toronto-raised performer Brock Hayhoe.

“That's the reason I left Canada to go to the States, is because I wanted to get on 'RuPaul's Drag Race' and because in Canada, I didn't have any more goals left, I didn't have anything to aspire towards.... And now we're bringing that dream to Canada and bringing it to all these amazing queens who work so hard.”

In trying to inspire the queens, the judges found themselves also learning a thing or two.

“I definitely learned how to do better makeup,” McKenzie said with a laugh, adding that they were also inspired by the queens' bravery, resiliency, and willingness to be vulnerable.

“The way they took the critiques was really refreshing. As a person who has worked on quite a few reality shows, competition shows similar to 'Drag Race' - I have never met a group of competitors who were just so open and so hungry to learn. They put aside all the their egos, all their high and mightiness.”

As Bowyer-Chapman put it, the only way the LGBTQ and Black Lives Matter movements can endure is for people to educate themselves.

And shows like “Canada's Drag Race” can help with that, “so that we don't repeat the same mistakes over and over and over again.”

“At this moment, it's important for 'Canada's Drag Race' audience, the young kids, to enjoy the celebration of our community while also paying respect and homage to the trailblazers who have come before us, who have made it possible for us to have a show like this,” said the former “Unreal” cast member, who's been a guest judge on “RuPaul's Drag Race” and is a vocal advocate for diversity and inclusion, particularly for people of colour and the LGBTQ community.

“And it's important for older generations who watch the show, to be able to acknowledge the importance of having a show like this and to inspire others to consistently and continuously educate themselves and enlighten themselves - and to make it abundantly clear that ... our rights and a show like 'Drag Race' on the air is not something that can be taken for granted. It's a gift and it's a blessing, but it's something that we've worked for and worked towards for generation after generation.”

A South Surrey senior who served in the Korean War nearly 70 years ago was thanked this week for his efforts “in restoring and preserving our freedom and democracy.”

Retired Col. Donald McClellan on Wednesday (July 8) was presented with an Ambassador for Peace Medal during a ceremony at Amica White Rock, where he has lived since last September.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, attendees were masked for the event.

Attended by Sen. Yonah Martin – who is Grand Patron of the Korea Veterans Association of Canada Heritage Unit – as well as Deputy Consul Gen. Yongwook Na (representing the Korean government), Korean War Veterans Association Western Chapter president Woo Seok Lee and McClellan’s daughter Linda, the ceremony was part of a three-year campaign that launched last month to honour the service and sacrifices of Canadians in the Korean War.

This year is the start of the 70th anniversary of the Korean War years, a news release explains. The Korean War Forgotten No More campaign will commemorate various milestones of the war, concluding July 27, 2023 – the 70th anniversary of the signing of the armistice.

The Ambassador for Peace Medal is “an expression of appreciation from the Korean government to veterans who served in the Korean War from June 25, 1950 to July 27, 1953,” the release states. It is also awarded to veterans who participated in UN peacekeeping operations until the end of 1955.

McClellan served in Korea from 1951-52 as a member of the 57th Independent Field Squadron, Royal Canadian Engineers. He was 23 years old at the time.

“We were the first brigade there,” he told Peace Arch News Thursday (July 9).

“We started planning it in 1950, as soon as the North Koreans crossed the line. The first job we had… was to guard the Han River bridge east of Seoul.

“I won’t tell you stories about that,” he continued, adding, “we didn’t have to fight it, but we shot somebody in the wrong place.

“It was a marine unit going along a north bank in the dark, and our sentry challenged and no answer… so he took a pot shot at them and he hit the fellow sitting up right of the driver and it went off his back into the driver, so he got two people with one bullet.

“We didn’t kill anybody, but it stopped them.”

McClellan said he is proud of the role Canadians played in the conflict – the first brigade group alone was 7,500 troops; in all, more than 26,000 served over the three years, and 516 died.

“I lost a couple of men who were not my friend because they were officers, and men don’t make friendships a rule,” McClellan said.

“I wear a pin every day for one of those men. It’s on my sweater, it’s a little poppy. I don’t know his first name, but his last name was Davis and he was 19 years old.”

McClellan’s 32 years of military service also included time in northern Europe after the war – for NATO in Germany and Belgium – and as a liaison officer to the U.S. army research and development laboratories in Virginia.

Martin on Wednesday spoke of how she and all people of Korean descent in Canada owe their lives to McClellan and other Korean veterans.

A proclamation presented with his medal expresses “everlasting gratitude of the Republic of Korea and our people for the service you and your countrymen have performed.”

“We cherish in our hearts the memory of your boundless sacrifices in helping us reestablish our Free Nation.”

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- Several Spirit Airlines employees were injured Tuesday night when they were attacked by three women who were apparently upset that their flight from Fort Lauderdale to Philadelphia had been delayed, sheriff's officials said.

The women hit the employees with “miscellaneous items, such as phones, shoes, full water bottles, metal boarding signs and fast food,” according to Broward Sheriff's Office arrest reports. The incident happened outside the gate of a flight to Philadelphia in the airport's Terminal 4.

The airline said three employees at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport suffered minor injuries when the women “became combative following a delayed flight.”

WPLG posted video of the attack, which shows the women throwing items at the employees and going behind the counter where they physically attacked at least one person.

Deputies arrested the women, who are all from Philadelphia. Tymaya Wright, 20, was charged with battery and petit theft for taking a Spirit employee's phone and putting it in her backpack. Danaysha Dixon, 22, and Keira Ferguson, 21, were both arrested on battery charges.

They were taken to the jail, where they later posted bond. Jail records did not list attorneys for the women.","Spirit Airlines employees beaten with metal signs, shoes, bottled over delayed flight",0,0.3361145774153067
1298,"The daughter of one extremely rich man and the longtime confidante of another, Ghislaine Maxwell has always enjoyed proximity to wealth. But how much money she has herself is a mystery.

Maxwell, who has pleaded not guilty to charges she recruited girls for sexual abuse by Jeffrey Epstein, is spending the next year in jail in part because her “opaque” finances led the judge overseeing the case to conclude she was an extraordinary flight risk.

“At a basic level, the defense argument is that she cannot remember off the top of her head just how many millions of dollars she has,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Alison Moe said at Maxwell’s bail hearing on Tuesday. The prosecutor said Maxwell’s claims to have less than $1 million in the bank and no monthly income was “implausible.”

Evidence of great wealth on Maxwell’s part, especially if the money came from Epstein, could bolster prosecutors’ depiction of her as fully complicit in his crimes. Her lawyers have so far suggested Maxwell, 58, is less wealthy than many believe and sought to distance her from Epstein’s private-jet and private-island lifestyle.

Epstein, who died in jail last August in an apparent suicide after being arrested on sex-trafficking charges, left an estate estimated to be worth around $630 million.

Nicholas Biase, a spokesman for Manhattan U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss, and Mark Cohen, a lawyer for Maxwell, didn’t respond to emails seeking comment about Maxwell’s finances.

At the bail hearing, prosecutors said they’d identified more than 15 different bank accounts associated with Maxwell from 2016 to the present with balances ranging from hundreds of thousands of dollars to more than $20 million. She sold a Manhattan townhouse for $15 million in 2016 and still has one in London that she offered as a bail guarantee.

It’s also unclear whether Maxwell has access to funds from an unidentified spouse mentioned by prosecutors Tuesday. She previously toured the secluded New Hampshire estate where she was arrested July 2 with a man who said he was her husband. According to prosecutors, the property was actually purchased by Maxwell for $1 million in cash using a limited liability company. After she was arrested, she told authorities she didn’t know the name of the company that owned the house and that she merely had permission to stay there.

The government further said it had information that, between 2007 and 2011, more than $20 million was transferred from offshore accounts associated with Jeffrey Epstein to several associated with Maxwell. Millions were later transferred back.

Jordan Waxman, managing partner of New York wealth management firm Nucleus Advisors, said $20 million seemed a low amount for someone using offshore accounts. It was possible that was just the tip of the iceberg, he said.

“I would venture to say 20 is probably what they found so far and that the net worth would be substantially more,” said Waxman. “The other thing is Jeffrey Epstein allegedly was worth $570-or-so million. What was she doing as his No. 2 and only with $20 million?”

Of course, Epstein’s operation was far from a typical money management business. He made a good part of his fortune advising lingerie titan Les Wexner on his money, real estate and other billionaire problems until the two cut ties in 2007. Epstein invested in hedge funds and advised other super-wealthy people, including Leon Black, on tax and philanthropy.

There are no indications that Ghislaine directly helped Epstein with financial matters. Instead, Maxwell, who grew up in British high society and graduated from Oxford University, introduced Epstein to the global elite, including politicians and royalty.

After arriving in New York in the wake of her father’s death and ensuing scandal, she grew tight with Epstein in the 1990s. They were initially romantically involved, but remained close, and Epstein called Maxwell his “best friend” in a 2003 Vanity Fair article. A trained helicopter pilot, she even transported him to his private island.

At the hearing, Maxwell’s lawyer Cohen pushed back at the government’s claims about his client’s wealth, particularly allegations that she was “associated” with 15 accounts.

“No detail, no explanation to the court, just more dirt,” Cohen said. “Well, she has three bank accounts that she disclosed.” He said it was possible there were other accounts related to a now-defunct non-profit that Maxwell formerly ran that they were willing to track down if the court deemed it important.

Cohen also said proceeds from Maxwell’s Manhattan townhouse sale have already been depleted due to various liabilities and expenses, including “extensive, substantial litigation.” Maxwell in 2017 settled for undisclosed terms a defamation suit by Epstein victim Virginia Guiffre and is now paying four lawyers to defend her against criminal charges.

In March, Maxwell sued Epstein’s estate to cover her legal costs, claiming he had always pledged to provide her with financial assistance.

A major question hanging over Maxwell is whether she inherited considerable wealth from her father, British publishing tycoon Robert Maxwell. Once ranked among the world’s richest men, Maxwell died in 1991 as his media empire, which once included the New York Daily News, was crumbling and he began to default on massive loans. After his death, hundreds of millions of pounds were found to have been diverted from his companies’ pension funds.

Though it’s often been assumed that Ghislaine Maxwell was left penniless by the scandals that engulfed her father’s company and led her older brother to declare the largest personal bankruptcy in U.K. history, federal prosecutors in New York raised the possibility that she still had substantial family money at her disposal.

“It is very unclear whether the defendant is receiving proceeds from trust accounts or an inheritance or means of other kinds,” prosecutor Moe said at Tuesday’s hearing. She said the government was aware of a Swiss trust benefiting Maxwell that held over $4 million last month and in which a relative served as trustee.

Cohen countered that Maxwell disclosed her Swiss account in a filing with the Internal Revenue Service and said one of the fund transfers was due to the maturation of a $500,000 bond.

Harvey Bezozi, an accountant and financial adviser in Greenwich, Connecticut, said it would make sense for Robert Maxwell to try to protect some wealth for his family. “I would imagine that the family inheritance or trust was constructed by a highly competent estate tax attorney,” he said.

Much of Ghislaine Maxwell’s offshore wealth may remain elusive to U.S. authorities, said Waxman. “It could be an elaborate shell game — where the peanut’s underneath the shell and it keeps moving around and there are more and more shells.”",Mystery of Ghislaine Maxwell’s wealth hangs over sex-abuse case,2,0.14271145506552207

1300,"TORONTO -- Within the last two weeks -- the 14-day window believed by scientists to be the incubation period of COVID-19 -- at least 26 flights have arrived in Canadian airports with confirmed cases of the virus onboard.

According to the federal government, COVID-19 cases have been reported among passengers on 10 domestic flights and 16 international flights since June 29. It advises the list is not exhaustive and is based on information from “provincial and territorial health authorities, international health authorities and public websites.”

The affected international flights arrived in Canadian airports from Mexico City, Cancun, Zurich, Paris, Addis Ababa, Islamabad, Lahore, Qatar, San Francisco, Washington, D.C., Dallas, Detroit, and three flights from Charlotte, N.C.

Health officials in British Columbia, Manitoba and Saskatchewan are advising those on board 11 flights into those provinces in the last two weeks that fellow passengers have since tested positive for COVID-19.

Manitoba health officials said Tuesday that one of five new positive cases in the province was a passenger on WestJet flight 261 from Winnipeg to Calgary on June 27 and on WestJet flight 526 from Calgary to Winnipeg on July 2.

Officials said those who sat in rows 7 to 22 on the Winnipeg to Calgary flight and rows 4 to 10 on the Calgary to Winnipeg flight are considered close contacts of the infected passenger. They must self-isolate for 14 days following the flight and monitor for symptoms.

Those not sitting in the affected rows should self-isolate if they develop any symptoms of COVID-19: fever/chills, cough, headache, muscle aches, sore or hoarse throat, shortness of breath or breathing difficulties, loss of taste or smell, unusual fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite or lesions or rashes without clear cause.

Saskatchewan has red-flagged five flights since June 11 and two in the last two weeks: WestJet flight 296 from Calgary to Regina on July 6 (no information on affected rows is available) and July 4: Air Canada 7947 from Toronto to Regina, rows 14 to 20.

Health authorities in B.C. say four affected flights have landed in Vancouver in the last two weeks.

They are: Air Canada 8421 from Kelowna on July 6; Air Canada 311 from Montreal on July 8; American Airlines 1270 from Dallas on July 6; and, United Airlines 375 from San Francisco on July 7. Affected rows are not listed for any of these flights.

MONTREAL - Air Canada has quietly changed its refund policy to allow some customers whose flights were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic to recoup their cash - but not passengers whose trips originated in Canada.

Travellers with flights “departing” from the European Union, Switzerland or Iceland but called off due to the pandemic are “entitled to receive a refund,” states a document recently posted to Air Canada's website.

“For customers with itineraries originating out of the EU, Air Canada has...recently added the option of a refund for non-refundable tickets,” the company said in an email Thursday.

The airline is not reimbursing passengers flying one-way or round-trip from Canada to Europe, however.

The change makes Air Canada the second major Canadian carrier to offer refunds rather than credit to some passengers whose flights were cancelled as a result of the coronavirus crisis.

Earlier this month, WestJet Airlines Ltd. spelled out a broader refund offer in a document sent to travel agents that applies to flights with a U.S. or U.K. city as the destination or origin.

The policy shifts follow months of backlash as consumer advocates and thousands of passengers continue to seek refund for services paid for but never rendered.

European Commission regulations state that passengers whose flights are cancelled have a right to reimbursement or re-routing under satisfactory conditions.

The rule refers to all “passengers departing from an airport located in the territory of a member state” of the EU.

Critics say Air Canada's new refund policy does not go far enough to meet the full EU requirements, since it does not cover round-trip tickets that originate in Canada - for example, from Toronto to Turin and back to Toronto.

Travellers departing an EU airport who find their flight cancelled are eligible for a refund regardless of where the itinerary originates, said Jacob Charbonneau, CEO of Quebec-based claims-processing firm Flight Claim.

“European regulations cover all flights departing from a European airport including Switzerland, Norway and Sweden, regardless of the airline, and cover all European airlines for return,” Charbonneau said.

Air Canada said the policy takes into account the circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic.

“This decision follows extensive discussions among EU members of appropriate remedies given this unprecedented, global crisis and our own review of the applicable regulations in an evolving regulatory environment,” the airline said.

The EU regulation in question states that passengers must be offered reimbursement “of the full cost of the ticket...for the part or parts of the journey not made.” Cancelling a flight from Montreal to Paris and back again should trigger a refund offer covering at least half of the trip, said Christian Nielsen, chief legal officer of AirHelp, a Berlin-based passenger-rights company.

“Air Canada is obliged to refund the price of the journey from Paris to Montreal, regardless of whether it's the return flight in the itinerary...or the outgoing flight,” Nielsen said.

The airline's online post refers to flights “departing” from EU airports but its interpretation recognizes only itineraries that originate there, said passenger rights advocate Gabor Lukacs.

“Will Air Canada continue to ignore the regulation, or will Air Canada actually adhere to it?” he asked.

A 2018 ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Union states that the same regulation cited by Air Canada in its online post - made on June 15, according to its metadata - “is applicable to passengers departing from an airport situated in the territory of a member state.”

Instead of refunds, Air Canada has generally offered passengers the option of travel credit with no expiry date or converting their booking into Aeroplan points with 65 per cent more bonus miles.

On Monday, an Air Canada executive told the House of Commons health committee the carrier has returned about $1 billion to customers who bought more expensive refundable tickets, but still has some $2.6 billion in advance ticket sales in its coffers.

The Montreal-based company has laid off more than 20,000 employees since the pandemic struck and continues to bleed roughly $20 million per day following a collapse of the global travel industry.

Border shutdowns and record-low demand mean airlines around the world will lose US$84 billion this year and see a 50 per cent year-over-year revenue decline, according to the International Air Transport Association.

1302,"PARIS, FRANCE -- The number of children worldwide getting life-saving vaccinations has declined this year largely because of the coronavirus pandemic, the World Health Organization and UNICEF warned on Wednesday.

The first four months of 2020 saw a ""substantial drop"" in the completion of the three-dose jab that protects against diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough -- the first decline in 28 years.

""Vaccines are one of the most powerful tools in the history of public health, and more children are now being immunised than every before,"" said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.

But he said the pandemic had put those gains at risk.

""The avoidable suffering and death caused by children missing out on routine immunisations could be far greater than COVID-19 itself,"" he said in a statement.

During the pandemic crisis at least 30 measles vaccination campaigns have been cancelled or are at risk, the two UN agencies said in a joint statement.

As of this May, the pandemic had disrupted immunization programs in three-quarters of more than 80 nations responding to a UN survey conducted with the US Centres for Disease Control.

Reluctance to leave home, transport problems, economic hardship, restrictions on movement or fear of being exposed to the virus were among the reasons given for the slowdown in immunisations.

PROGRESS STALLED

""COVID-19 has made previously routine vaccination a daunting challenge,"" said UNICEF Executive Director Henriette Fore.

""We must prevent a further deterioration in vaccine coverage ... before children's lives are threatened by other diseases.

""We cannot trade one health crisis for another.""

Progress on immunization coverage was already stalling before the new coronavirus hit, the UN agencies said.

Malaria and the diphtheria, tetanus and whopping cough jab -- known as DTP3 -- had reached about 85 per cent of the target age group worldwide.

""The likelihood that a child born today will be fully vaccinated with all the globally recommended vaccines by the time she reaches the age of five is less than 20 per cent,"" they said in the statement.

In 2019, some 14 million children missed out on life-saving vaccines.

Two-thirds of them are in 10 countries: Angola, Brazil, DR Congo, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, and The Philippines.

In Latin America and the Caribbean, historically high rates of vaccination have slipped, the UN reported.

1304,"OTTAWA—The case of a five-year-old Canadian girl stuck in Syria appears to be headed to court as her family escalates efforts to bring her to Canada. The girl known publicly as Amira was found on the side of a road last year after her parents and siblings were killed in an airstrike, and she was taken to a refugee camp. Her uncle, known as Ibrahim, has been trying to get her out of Syria and to Canada but the federal government has refused to help. His lawyers filed a lawsuit in Federal Court on Tuesday saying that in failing to assist the child, the government is violating her rights. “Ibrahim has done everything humanly possible, including travelling to Syria on his own without security or protection, in an effort to bring his niece home to Canada,” the application says. “The respondents, despite their statutory and international law obligations and the rights of the applicant Amira, guaranteed by the charter, have for more than a year been unwilling to take a single step to enable the repatriation of Amira to take place.” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had been asked on June 29 why the federal government wasn’t doing more to get Canadians out of the region. Trudeau said while there are countries that have diplomats on the ground in Syria, Canada is not one of them and it remains a dangerous place. “We will continue to ensure that we’re keeping as a priority the protection of Canadians working abroad, particularly in this COVID context, but in every context,” he said. In the court application, lawyers note that other countries with no consular services in Syria have leaned on other countries or humanitarian groups to help repatriate their citizens. The court documents state that Amira is one of 47 Canadians, 26 of whom are children, stuck in northeastern Syria. The regional government has urged countries to repatriate their citizens. In the court documents, lawyers say Ibrahim met personally with officials to plead Amira’s case. The documents say he was assured that upon Canada’s request, and coupled with the attendance of a delegate or representative of the Canadian government, the local government “would be only too pleased to facilitate the repatriation of Amira to Canada.”",Family of Canadian child stuck in Syria taking government to court,2,0.130261785975196

1306,"Dozens of MPs, community leaders and organizations from across the political spectrum have joined the latest call on Ottawa to sanction Chinese Community Party officials.  Whether the federal government will heed that call is the subject of much debate and speculation, even within the ranks of the 67 members of Parliament who signed Tuesday’s letter urging action. The letter calls for Magnitsky legislation to be brought against China’s officials complicit in human rights “atrocities” in Tibet, Xinjiang and Hong Kong. “As a leader on the international human rights discussion, to invoke Magnitsky sanctions against these officials is a strong and symbolic action that is consistent with how Canada has applied this act in the past,” reads the letter.  So-called Magnitsky legislation allows for Canada to impose sanctions, economic or otherwise, against specific people or organizations known to be responsible for human rights violations or corruption in other countries. Liberal MP John McKay pointed to recent actions Canada has taken by Ottawa over the new national security law in China, which include suspending an extradition treaty with Hong Kong and restrictions on certain “sensitive” exports to the region, as examples of a different attitude in Ottawa. “I think it’s an increasing possibility,” he said of sanctions. “I think the progress has been quite rapid in terms of a changing attitude.”  McKay said he thinks speaking out on the China issue has been welcomed by many in his party.  But a fellow signatory, Conservative MP Kenny Chiu, is much less optimistic, arguing Ottawa’s stance on the issue has been weak. “I have seen to date just a bunch of lip service, posturing and I have not seen much of any action,” he said. While he agrees with actions taken regarding Hong Kong after the national security law was brought in, the measures are “defensive” in nature and don’t go far enough, he said.  Chiu said sanctions on Chinese Communist Party officials could affect those with ties to Canada, and prevent them from freely coming to the country or doing business here could have an impact.  The government’s previous action on the issue doesn’t give him much hope sanctions are coming, Chiu said. Last week, Canada’s minister of global affairs, François-Philippe Champagne, suggested Canada was considering such sanctions against some mainland China officials in response to human rights abuses in the country, particularly in Hong Kong and the Xinjiang Autonomous Region. “Yes, we are considering all the options when it comes to standing up for human rights,” Champagne told the House of Commons in response to questions about whether the government would consider such sanctions. Later in the week, a Reuters story quoted a government source as saying Ottawa was not actually considering the sanctions.  The new calls for human rights sanctions increased recently after paper by academic Adrian Zenz released via the Washington, D.C.-based Jamestown Foundation using Chinese government documents reported forced sterilization was being practised in Xinjiang against its ethnic Uighur population. Such acts are considered genocide according to the United Nations convention addressing such crimes. Meanwhile, critics also say Canada hasn’t taken enough action to support pro-democracy efforts in Hong Kong, which was recently brought further under Beijing’s control with the imposition of a new national security law that opponents say breaches the British-Chinese joint declaration. The declaration is the document laying out the conditions of Hong Kong’s takeover by China, which occurred in 1997; part of it stipulated Hong Kong would enjoy relative autonomy until 2047.  Cherie Wong of the pro-democracy group Alliance Canada Hong Kong, which is a signatory to the letter, said the “inaction” by Ottawa amounts to flip-flopping. “We at Alliance Canada Hong Kong (ACHK) are frustrated with the deliberate inaction,” Wong said in an email. International human rights lawyer David Matas told the Star such sanctions pressure those involved personally in human rights abuses rather than just make a widespread condemnation of a government. “What Magnitsky legislation does is it puts a name and a face to violations,” Matas said. “It’s an attribution of responsibility.”  Such sanctions could include freezing assets, barring those sanctioned from coming to Canada or even opening them up to prosecution should they arrive here, he said.  Last week, the United States named several people and one organization related to human rights abuses in China for sanctions.  Meanwhile, regardless of the likelihood of Canada imposing such sanctions, Chiu and McKay both want to see them introduced. “The question after that is what’s the reaction of the government of China to the naming of individual human rights abusers,” he McKay said. “We’ll see.” ","Canada accused of ‘flip-flopping’ on sanctioning Chinese officials as MPs, others demand action",2,0.19650369190022143

MONTREAL - The country's two largest airlines are ending their on-board seat distancing policies starting July 1, raising health concerns amid a pandemic that has devastated the travel industry.

Air Canada has blocked the sale of adjacent seats in economy class, and WestJet has done the same throughout the entire plane, to help prevent the spread of COVID-19.

The carriers said Friday they will revert to health recommendations from the United Nation's aviation agency and the International International Air Transport Association (IATA) trade group.

American Airlines also announced Friday that it will start booking flights to full capacity starting next Wednesday.

IATA called last month for an end to in-flight physical distancing rules, proposing a range of measures including some that run counter to federal government policies.

Transport Canada listed physical distancing among the “key points” in preventing the spread of the virus as part of a guide issued to the aviation industry in April.

“Operators should develop guidance for spacing passengers aboard aircraft when possible to optimize social distancing,” the document states.

Some health experts have highlighted the risks of spreading COVID in crowded airports and packed cabins.

“Once it's in the cabin, it's difficult to stop air moving around,” said Tim Sly, an epidemiologist and professor emeritus at Ryerson University's School of Public Health.

However Joseph Allen, director of the Harvard public health school's Healthy Buildings program, said the HEPA air filters used on most planes effectively control airborne bacteria and viruses.

In line with federal directives, Air Canada and WestJet conduct pre-boarding temperature checks and require masks on board. They have also implemented enhanced aircraft cleaning and scaled back their in-flight service in late March, cutting out hot drinks, hot meals and fresh food.

“The new measures will continue to build on the recommendations of ICAO (the UN's International Civil Aviation Organization) and others that a multi-layered strategy to COVID-19 safety is most effective,” Air Canada spokesman Peter Fitzpatrick said in an email.

WestJet said its online booking will return to normal on Wednesday.

“Moving forward, our cabin crew are able to assist should there be space to accommodate and we encourage guests to discuss seating arrangements with them once onboard,” said spokeswoman Morgan Bell.

Canadians are beginning to brave air travel again as confinement measures lift, though Manitoba and the Maritimes still have strong restrictions on interprovincial travel in place while other provinces discourage it.

Swoop, a budget airline owned by WestJet , added eight weekly flights in June with 12 more coming in July after the carrier cut capacity to a single line of flight per day - Halifax-Hamilton-Edmonton-Abbotsford and back.

“We're in this minus 95 per cent mode right now,” Swoop president Charles Duncan said in an interview. “It doesn't get much worse than this.”

Hope is on the horizon, however.

“At the height of it, it was common to have under 20 people on a plane. But from Vancouver just now I brought in 65. Earlier in the day from Edmonton to Vancouver we had over 100,” said WestJet flight attendant Chris Rauenbusch, president of CUPE Local 4070.

CALGARY -- WestJet plans to restart non-stop flights from Calgary to London and Paris next month as it slowly increases the number of flights it offers this summer.

The airline says it will resume the flights to London and Paris starting Aug. 20.

The airline industry has been devastated by the COVID-19 due to travel restrictions put in place to slow the pandemic.

WestJet's August schedule includes more than 200 daily flights.

It says the plan is about a 10 per cent increase in flying compared with July, but a decrease of 75 per cent compared with August last year.

WestJet will offer flights to 39 cities in Canada, five in the U.S., two in Europe, one in the Caribbean and one in Mexico.

HONG KONG -- A breach in Twitter's security that allowed hackers to break into the accounts of leaders and technology moguls is one of the worst attacks in recent years and may shake trust in a platform politicians and CEOs use to communicate with the public, experts said Thursday.

The FBI is investigating the hack, according to a person familiar with the probe who was not authorized to discuss an ongoing probe and spoke on the condition of anonymity Thursday.

The ruse discovered Wednesday included bogus tweets from Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Mike Bloomberg and a number of tech billionaires including Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Celebrities Kanye West and his wife, Kim Kardashian West, were also hacked.

Hackers used social engineering to target some of Twitter's employees and then gained access to the high-profile accounts. The attackers sent out tweets from the accounts of the public figures, offering to send $2,000 for every $1,000 sent to an anonymous Bitcoin address.

Cybersecurity experts say such a breach could have dire consequences since the attackers were tweeting from verified, globally influential accounts with millions of followers.

“If you receive a tweet from a verified account, belonging to a well-known and therefore trusted person, you can no longer assume it's really from them,” said Michael Gazeley, managing director of cybersecurity firm Network Box.

Reacting to the breach, Twitter swiftly deleted the tweets and locked down the accounts to investigate. In the process it prevented verified users from sending out tweets for several hours.

The company said Thursday it has taken “significant steps to limit access to internal systems and tools.”

Many celebrities, politicians and business leaders often use Twitter as a public platform to make statements. U.S. President Donald Trump, for example, regularly uses Twitter to post about national and geopolitical matters, and his account is closely followed by media, analysts and governments around the world.

Twitter faces an uphill battle in regaining people's confidence, Gazeley said. For a start, it needs to figure out exactly the accounts were hacked and show the vulnerabilities have been fixed, he said.

“If key employees at Twitter were tricked, that's actually a serious cybersecurity problem in itself,” he said. “How can one of the world's most used social media platforms have such weak security, from a human perspective?”

Rachel Tobac, CEO of Socialproof Security, said that the breach appeared to be largely financially motivated. But such an attack could cause more serious consequences.

“Can you imagine if they had taken over a world leader's account, and tweeted out a threat of violence to another country's leader?” asked Tobac, a social engineering hacker who specializes in providing training for companies to protect themselves from such breaches.

Social engineering attacks typically target human weaknesses to exploit networks and online platforms. Companies can guard themselves against such attacks by beefing up multi-factor authentication -- where users have to present multiple pieces of evidence as authentication before being allowed to log into a system, Tobac said.

Such a process could include having a physical token that an employee must have with them, on top of a password, before they can log into a corporate or other private system. Other methods include installing technical tools to monitor for suspicious insider activities and reducing the number of people who have access to an administrative panel, Tobac said.

Several U.S. lawmakers called on Twitter to co-operate with authorities including the Department of Justice and the FBI to secure the site.

“I am concerned that this event may represent not merely a co-ordinated set of separate hacking incidents but rather a successful attack on the security of Twitter itself,” said Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican.

He added that millions of users relied on Twitter not just to send tweets but also communicate privately via direct messaging. Twitter hasn't said if hackers were able to access the private messages of their high-profile targets.

Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden said Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey told him in a private conversation in 2018 that the company was working on protecting direct messages, known as DMs, with end-to-end encryption.

But that promise never materialized, Wyden said Thursday, leaving everyone's private messages “vulnerable to employees who abuse their internal access to the company's systems, and hackers who gain unauthorized access.”

“This is a vulnerability that has lasted for far too long, and one that is not present in other, competing platforms,” Wyden said in an emailed statement. “If hackers gained access to users' DMs, this breach could have a breathtaking impact, for years to come.”","Experts say Twitter breach troubling, undermines trust",0,0.5539142523743498
1314,"Democracy Watch is seeking the muscle of the courts to throw out a new provincial appointment process for tribunals that it argues is unconstitutional.

The process was brought in by the Doug Ford government in November following a series of appointments it was forced to rescind after strong public backlash and charges of cronyism.

Democracy Watch alleges while the previous appointment process was not perfect, its replacement gives government cabinet far too much power over members of quasi-judicial boards, potentially threatening their independence.

“This means tribunal members have little job security and are essentially serving at the pleasure of the cabinet, which violates legal requirements of independence and impartiality,” says a statement released by Democracy Watch on Thursday.

It is asking the Ontario Superior Court to find that the Ford government’s tribunal appointment process violates the requirement for a merit-based and competitive undertaking.

Democracy Watch is seeking the cancellation of all appointments under this new system as illegal and unconstitutional, the statement says.

“The Ford government’s changes put 32 tribunals that handle more than 150,000 important human rights, citizen, community and environmental protection cases each year much more under the control of cabinet ministers which politicizes and weakens the enforcement of several key laws across Ontario,” Democracy Watch Co-founder Duff Conacher said in the statement.

Jenessa Crognali, a spokesperson for Ontario Attorney General Doug Downey, said the Ministry received the notice of application for judicial review Tuesday and is reviewing it.

“As this matter is subject to litigation, it would be inappropriate to comment further,” she said in an email.

1315,"KITCHENER — A judge has cancelled a Waterloo woman’s plan to take her daughter to Texas for nine days. The woman announced to her estranged husband in late June that she and their five-year-old daughter were flying to San Antonio on July 6. The woman’s boyfriend lives in Texas. The girl resides primarily with her mother but spends alternate weekends with her father. Neither parent has sole decision-making powers over their child. The father opposed the U.S. trip and the case went to court. “The COVID-19 situation causes significant concern for father vis-à-vis the possibility of (the child) being exposed to the virus,” Superior Court Justice Jennifer Breithaupt Smith wrote in a ruling on July 2, four days before the proposed trip. The judge also noted that after returning to Canada, the child would have to self-isolate for two weeks. “This will result in further periods of missed parenting time between father and (the child),” the judge wrote, adding the girl will “effectively be denied parenting time with her father for the full month of July.” Breithaupt Smith said she would deny the Texas trip even without a pandemic. “This is in fact simply a case of inappropriate unilateral decision-making by one parent to the detriment of the other, and by extension of the child,” she said “COVID-19 adds a layer of desperation to the matter, but ... mother must receive the clear message that her actions would not be tolerated even if COVID-19 were not a factor.” The parents separated in 2018. The man had told his estranged wife he wanted to spend more time with their daughter. Text messages in late June had a “nasty” tone after the woman told him about the Texas trip, the judge said. Father: “You have put (our child) in a very bad situation because of your personal needs.” Mother: “Lol. Well since it’s a pandemic I guess she’ll have to isolate with me until it’s over. Thank you goodbye.” She went on to say: “We’ll be issuing a court order for permission to travel. You won’t have a say in this anymore.” The judge said the woman has previously travelled to the U.S. with her daughter without the father’s advance consent. When the trip took place was not specified. “International travel during a period of closed or uncertain border controls between a child’s habitual residence and the country being visited requires unequivocal agreement of both parents based upon a clear and collaborative plan,” Breithaupt Smith said. “It is not a decision that can be unilaterally made by one parent over the other’s objections, particularly where all parenting issues are the subject of active litigation.” Breithaupt Smith ruled neither parent can take the child out of Canada without the written consent of the other or a court order. The judge ordered the girl’s passport be deposited with the office of the father’s lawyer and said it “shall be retained there until it is released upon the written consent of the parties or further order of the court.”",Judge nixes Waterloo woman’s plan to take young daughter to Texas,2,0.19583743872172898
1317,"In the wake of the United Kingdom’s move to ban Huawei from the country’s 5G infrastructure, pressure is mounting on Canada to take a decision that observers say will either distance it from longtime allies or risk further eroding its relationship with China.

Ottawa is expected to make a call on the Chinese telecom giant’s involvement in 5G this year.

The decision has been further framed this week by the U.K. ban, which leaves Canada as one of last two nations in the Five Eyes security alliance — also comprised of the United States, the U.K., Australia— not to have banned Huawei from 5G projects over security concerns. New Zealand has previously rejected the company’s involvement in 5G in a move many say is effectively banning them, but said Wednesday it will not impose blanket bans and instead decide on a case-by-case basis.

“The Five Eyes is taking a pretty united decision on Huawei and the security risks and the implications of any Huawei decision,” says Sam Armstrong, spokesperson for the newly formed Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China.

IPAC is an international consortium of parliamentarians concerned about Beijing’s actions globally.

Armstrong said Canada’s silence on Huawei is likely being welcomed by China as it seeks to divide the Five Eyes alliance.

“I have no doubt that on telecommunications, like every other issue, China is rubbing its mitts at the very prospect that the Five Eyes might not be united,” he said.

“A united allied free world is China’s worst nightmare. A divided Five Eyes is its dream come true.”

Last fall, at a security conference in Halifax the national security adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump warned Canada not to approve the company because its technology would be used as a “Trojan horse” against democracy.

Robert C. O’Brien warned China’s government could even use the technology to undermine Canadian elections. China’s ambassador to Canada has denied those allegations.

In May, the U.S. banned Huawei from sourcing microchips that use U.S. technology, a move that forced British officials to reassess their view of the security and sustainability of using the company’s equipment in 5G networks.

The U.K.’s National Cyber Security Centre led a review that concluded the new U.S. sanctions meant Huawei would have to use potentially insecure technology, making 5G security risks impossible to control.

If Canada goes a different route and accepts Huawei, the country risks alienating itself from allies in the Five Eyes, says retired Brig.-Gen. Robert Spalding, a China analyst and author of the book Stealth War, which examines China’s attempts to influence and control the world.

“Their access to intelligence sharing and other things with the Five Eyes will be restricted,” Spalding said of Canada. “A more expansive relationship is going to be out of the question.”

Spalding said cross-border communications between Canada and the U.S. could also be affected due to integration concerns around Huawei and U.S. networks.

If Ottawa approved Huawei, Spalding said, one of the biggest gains for Canada would simply be the “admiration” of the Chinese Communist Party.

It would also open up Canada to intelligence gathering of its citizens and risks the country’s independence and sovereignty, he said.

Last month, two of Canada’s major telecommunications companies, Bell and Telus, which at one time were intending to use Huawei for their 5G equipment, announced contracts with other companies.

Compounded, this means Ottawa now has a stronger case to similarly ban Huawei’s involvement in 5G on security grounds, Christopher Parsons, a senior research associate at Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto, told the Star.

Complicating Canada’s situation is the state of its relationship with Beijing and a set of circumstances that differentiates this country from the U.K.

“The U.K is concerned Huawei may have to rely on less technologically advanced and secure products. Canada can say the same, but this doesn’t change the fact China is holding Canadians hostage and is also one of our largest trading partners,” Parsons said.

“Whether the Canadian government thinks it can afford to articulate its concerns about Huawei’s security as loudly as the U.K is the difference,” he said.

The detentions of Canadians Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig in China have been widely described as direct retaliation for this country’s arrest in December 2018 of Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou.

Meng was arrested in Vancouver at the request of U.S. authorities seeking her extradition to face fraud charges, starting a downward spiral of China-Canada relations.

China has hinted it would release the men if Meng is released.

Since Canadian authorities arrested Wanzhou, Huawei has pursued a public relations strategy of distancing itself from Beijing and providing more transparency about its business.

But, experts say Huawei’s noticeably greater transparency hasn’t done much for its international image, since in many countries, the company has become emblematic of anxieties about China’s rise as an authoritarian superpower.

In a statement to the Star on Wednesday, Huawei Canada’s vice-president of corporate affairs said the U.K. decision will not change the company’s goals in Canada.

“We support and respect the Canadian government’s review of 5G suppliers — and we look forward to the government reaching an independent, evident-based conclusion regarding Huawei’s potential role in 5G in Canada,” Alykhan Velshi wrote in an email.

He noted Huawei has a diversified business model in the country.

“It’s not just selling network equipment. We also sell consumer devices such as smartphones, sell fixed wireless equipment to rural telecom carriers and fund world-class research and development,” he said.

In recent months, Huawei has been shifting its research and development centre from the United States to Canada. This means the company will hire hundreds of local staff and invest hundreds of millions on research funding — on top of its existing collaborations with Canadian universities.

“Ultimately, Huawei has established research and development operations here in Canada because of the tremendous expertise and knowledge that exists here,” Velshi said.

The company spent nearly $200 million in Canada in 2019, and this year, that amount will be higher, he said. And compared to 540 R&D employees Huawei Canada employed in 2018, it now employs approximately 800.

Parsons said this greater influx of jobs and money into Canada could give Beijing more leverage on Ottawa by threatening they could force Huawei to pull out of the country.

Parsons also cautioned that Canada’s cybersecurity strategy should not stop at finally making a decision on whether to ban Huawei’s involvement in 5G development.

“Hacking isn’t going to stop if Huawei stops making our network equipment. That’s why it’s so important to develop a robust cybersecurity strategy to protect Canadians, and not just an anti-Huawei system,” he said.

Correction – July 16, 2020: This article was edited from a previous version that mistakenly said Canada is the last nation in the Five Eyes security alliance to ban Huawei’s involvement in 5G infrastructure development. In fact, New Zealand has said it will not impose blanket bans and instead decide on a case-by-case basis.

1319,"A surgical oncologist at The Ottawa Hospital will lead a $2.8 million Canada-wide clinical trial that seeks to protect cancer patients from COVID-19 by strengthening their depleted immune systems.

If it proves successful, the approach could help not only cancer patients, but anyone vulnerable to COVID-19 because of immune systems weakened by age or disease.

“We think harnessing innate immunity could be one of our best weapons for fighting COVID-19 — and could easily be adapted to tackle future pandemics,” said Dr. Rebecca Auer, director of cancer research at The Ottawa Hospital, and the study lead.

The clinical trial involves IMM-101, an immune-boosting biotherapeutic made with a heat-killed bacterium, Mycobacterium obuense, found in soil and water.

Developed as an immunotherapy cancer treatment, IMM-101 has demonstrated the ability to

activate the body’s first line of defence, including the natural killer (NK) cells responsible for guarding against viral and bacterial infections. It h

as been safely used in other clinical trials with cancer patients.

“An effective vaccine against COVID-19 could take another year or more to develop, test, and implement,” said Auer, an associate professor at the University of Ottawa. “In the meantime, there is an urgent need to protect people with cancer from severe COVID-19 infection, and we think this immune stimulator, IMM-101, may be able to do this.”

The researchers hope that boosting cancer patients’ immune systems with IMM-101 will protect them from developing COVID-19 or other respiratory illnesses, such as the flu, that can force delays in their treatment.

Cancer patients are often vulnerable to infection because chemotherapy indiscriminately targets fast-dividing cells, whether cancer cells or immune cells. The cancer itself can also attack a patient’s bone marrow, where most immune cells are made.

More than 90,000 people in Ontario received chemotherapy or radiation treatments last year alone, and COVID-19 has greatly complicated their care.

The clinical trial, approved by Health Canada, is expected to launch later this summer. It will enrol 1,500 patients — including about 250 in Ottawa — at nine cancer centres across the country.

Patients in the study will be randomly assigned to two groups: One that receives regular care, and one that has IMM-101 added to it.

Those in the latter group will be given three doses of IMM-101 over the course of 45 days then carefully observed for COVID-19, other flu-like illnesses, and respiratory infections.

Researchers want to understand if patients who receive IMM-101 are less likely to develop such illnesses.

There’s considerable evidence to support the scientific theory on which the trial is built.

Immune boosters have been successfully used for years in veterinary medicineto prevent the transmission of respiratory viruses in cattle, horses and other animals.

What’s more, clinical trials in Europe are now testing the ability of the BCG vaccine — a tuberculosis vaccine that contains a live, weakened strain of Mycobacterium bovis — to prime the immune system against COVID-19. Research has shown BCG can train the immune system to better fight all kinds of respiratory infections.

“It’s like sending your innate immune system to the gym for a while,” Auer explained. “So when it comes back to attack the next pathogen, it’s much stronger and better.”

Researchers believe that an individual’s innate immune system response helps to explain why some people get severely ill with COVID-19 while others have only mild symptoms.

Innate immune cells, such as NK cells, recognize and attack a broad spectrum of infectious agents based on their general characteristics. (Our second line of defence, known as the adaptive immune system, recognizes specific features of a bacterium or virus, and those that it has previously encountered.)

But BCG and other live vaccines can’t be given to cancer patients, so Auer and her colleagues looked for an alternative and found IMM-101. Even though it’s not a live vaccine, IMM-101 creates a response because the innate immune system recognizes it as a foreign invader.

Researchers from The Ottawa Hospital worked with the Canadian Cancer Trials Group at Queen’s University to design the clinical trial.

Funding and support has also come from the Canadian Cancer Society, BioCanRx, the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, The Ottawa Hospital Foundation, The Ottawa Hospital Academic Medical Organization, ATGen Canada/NKMax, a biotechnology company, and Immodulon Therapeutics, the manufacturer of IMM-101.

The clinical trial is expected to completed by the end of the year.

Auer warned that COVID-19 will not be the last pandemic.

“I imagine that if this trial was positive, this would be something you could have in your back pocket when the next pandemic came,” she said. “You’d be able to say, ‘We have something that works and can protect high risk people.’”",Ottawa-led clinical trial seeks to protect cancer patients from COVID-19,8,0.05752485268012175

LONDON - Britain on Tuesday backtracked on plans to give Chinese telecommunications company Huawei a role in the U.K.'s new high-speed mobile phone network amid security concerns fueled by rising tensions between Beijing and Western powers.

Britain said it decided to prohibit Huawei from working on the so-called 5G system after U.S. sanctions made it impossible to ensure the security of equipment made by the Chinese company.

The U.S. had also threatened to sever an intelligence-sharing arrangement with Britain because of concerns that Huawei's involvement could allow the Chinese government to infiltrate U.K. networks.

Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden told Parliament the decision would delay the rollout of 5G technology and increase costs by up to 2 billion pounds ($2.5 billion), but that it had to be done.

“This has not been an easy decision, but it is the right one,” he said.

The decision forces British telecoms operators to stop buying 5G equipment from Huawei by the end of this year but gives them until 2027 to remove Huawei gear that has already been used in the network, which is currently under construction.

Fifth generation, or 5G, networks are expected to usher in a new wave of wireless innovation, with super-fast speeds and low signal delay that will help the development of self-driving cars, remote surgery and factory robots.

Critically for telecoms operators, the government opted not to order them to rip out equipment manufactured by Huawei and used in earlier systems, such as the existing 4G network. Such a decision might have caused havoc in U.K. telecoms systems.

Still, the decision marks a major retreat for Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who in January sought to balance economic and security pressures by agreeing to give Huawei a limited role in the 5G network. Under the earlier ruling, Huawei would have been limited to providing 35% of equipment such as radios and antennas, with the company barred from supplying core components of the system.

But the move set up a diplomatic clash with the U.S., which is involved in a wide-ranging trade dispute with China and threatened to cut off security co-operation unless Britain dumped Huawei. Amid continued pressure to remove Huawei from communication networks entirely, the U.S. in May imposed new sanctions that will bar companies around the world from using American-made machinery or software to produce chips for the Chinese company.

U.S. officials claim that under Chinese law the government could force Huawei to give it access to foreign networks it has helped build. Huawei denies this, saying that countries such as Britain have already developed oversight procedures to ensure there are no security breaches.

President Donald Trump 's national security adviser applauded Britain's decision.

“The reported U.K. action reflects a growing international consensus that Huawei and other untrusted vendors pose a threat to national security, as they remain beholden to the Chinese Communist Party,” said Robert O'Brien, who is in Europe this week. “We look forward to working with the U.K., as well as our many other partners and allies, to spur innovation, promote vendor diversity in the 5G supply chain, and ensure 5G security free from dangerous manipulations.”

Johnson also came under pressure from rebels in his own Conservative Party who criticized China's new Hong Kong security law and its treatment of ethnic Uighurs, as well as Huawei's links to the Chinese government. Ten Conservative lawmakers this week sent a letter to Johnson demanding that he remove Huawei from “the U.K.'s critical national infrastructure.”

The Labour Party's spokeswoman on communications issues, Chi Omwurah, decried the government's flip-flop approach and said it would have a dire impact on the future.

“It has been clear for some time that there are serious questions over whether Huawei should be allowed to control large sections of our country's telecoms networks, yet the government refused to face reality,” she said. “Their approach to our 5G capability, Huawei and our national security has been incomprehensibly negligent.”

Huawei expressed disappointment, saying that the decision threatens to move “Britain into the digital slow lane, push up bills and deepen the digital divide.”

“The American motive for these activities is one of protecting American jobs,? Huawei UK Vice-President Jeremy Thompson told The Associated Press, arguing that the United States., despite its global might, is behind the curve when it comes to wireless technology.

“The U.S. have under-invested in wireless consistently since the second generation. Here we are in the fifth,? he said. “They've under-invested. And as a result, they're behind the rest of the world.”

The controversy has put Huawei at the vortex of tensions between China and Britain.

Last fall, the U.K. called on China to give the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights free access to the Xinjiang region, where most of the country's Uighur people live.

More recently, Johnson's government has criticized China's decision to impose a sweeping new national security law on Hong Kong. Britain accused the Beijing government of a serious breach of the Sino-British Joint Declaration under which the U.K. returned control of Hong Kong to China in 1997, and announced it would open a special route to citizenship for up to 3 million eligible residents of the city.

China's ambassador to Britain, Liu Xiaoming, last week decried what he described as “gross interference” in Chinese affairs.

“Britain can only be great,” he said, when it has an independent foreign policy, adding that it sets a bad precedent to “make your policy in the morning and change it in evening.”

“It also sends out a very bad message to the China business community,” Liu said, suggesting Chinese companies might think twice about investing in Britain. “They are all watching how you handle Huawei.”

Rana Mitter, an Oxford University history professor specializing in China, said that the security law - combined with broader resentment about the way China handled information about the coronavirus - created increased wariness among Britain's politicians and the public.

But for China, it's the way Britain has handled the Huawei issue that is the major problem. Even if Britain decides that buying Huawei isn't a good idea, this could have been done more discreetly, Mitter said.

“I think the immediate reaction from China is going to be pretty incandescent,” he said. “They're going to be very, very angry about the reversal of the decision, not just because of the decision itself, but because in a sense, it has made them lose face.

“Having said yes, back in January, the British government has now done a pretty exact U-turn and said absolutely no. But I think that China will maybe made to feel as if it's been made essentially to suffer the consequences of that U-turn in public.”

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- Mars is about to be invaded by planet Earth - big time.

Three countries - the United States, China and the United Arab Emirates - are sending unmanned spacecraft to the red planet in quick succession beginning this week, in the most sweeping effort yet to seek signs of ancient microscopic life while scouting out the place for future astronauts.

The U.S., for its part, is dispatching a six-wheeled rover the size of a car, named Perseverance, to collect rock samples that will be brought back to Earth for analysis in about a decade.

“Right now, more than ever, that name is so important,” NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said as preparations went on amid the coronavirus outbreak, which will keep the launch guest list to a minimum.

Each spacecraft will travel more than 300 million miles (483 million kilometres) before reaching Mars next February. It takes six to seven months, at the minimum, for a spacecraft to loop out beyond Earth's orbit and sync up with Mars' more distant orbit around the sun.

Scientists want to know what Mars was like billions of years ago when it had rivers, lakes and oceans that may have allowed simple, tiny organisms to flourish before the planet morphed into the barren, wintry desert world it is today.

“Trying to confirm that life existed on another planet, it's a tall order. It has a very high burden of proof,” said Perseverance's project scientist, Ken Farley of Caltech in Pasadena, California.

The three nearly simultaneous launches are no coincidence: The timing is dictated by the opening of a one-month window in which Mars and Earth are in ideal alignment on the same side of the sun, which minimizes travel time and fuel use. Such a window opens only once every 26 months.

Mars has long exerted a powerful hold on the imagination but has proved to be the graveyard for numerous missions. Spacecraft have blown up, burned up or crash-landed, with the casualty rate over the decades exceeding 50%. China's last attempt, in collaboration with Russia in 2011, ended in failure.

Only the U.S. has successfully put a spacecraft on Mars, doing it eight times, beginning with the twin Vikings in 1976. Two NASA landers are now operating there, InSight and Curiosity. Six other spacecraft are exploring the planet from orbit: three U.S., two European and one from India.

The United Arab Emirates and China are looking to join the elite club.

The UAE spacecraft, named Amal, which is Arabic for Hope, is an orbiter scheduled to rocket away from Japan on Wednesday, local time, on what will be the Arab world's first interplanetary mission. The spacecraft, built in partnership with the University of Colorado Boulder, will arrive at Mars in the year the UAE marks the 50th anniversary of its founding.

“The UAE wanted to send a very strong message to the Arab youth,” project manager Omran Sharaf said. “The message here is that if the UAE can reach Mars in less than 50 years, then you can do much more. ... The nice thing about space, it sets the standards really high.”

Controlled from Dubai, the celestial weather station will strive for an exceptionally high Martian orbit of 13,670 miles by 27,340 miles (22,000 kilometres by 44,000 kilometres) to study the upper atmosphere and monitor climate change.

China will be up next, with the flight of a rover and an orbiter sometime around July 23; Chinese officials aren't divulging much. The mission is named Tianwen, or Questions for Heaven.

NASA, meanwhile, is shooting for a launch on July 30 from Cape Canaveral.

Perseverance is set to touch down in an ancient river delta and lake known as Jezero Crater, not quite as big as Florida's Lake Okeechobee. China's much smaller rover will aim for an easier, flatter target.

To reach the surface, both spacecraft will have to plunge through Mars' hazy red skies in what has been dubbed “seven minutes of terror” - the most difficult and riskiest part of putting spacecraft on the planet.

Jezero Crater is full of boulders, cliffs, sand dunes and depressions, any one of which could end Perseverance's mission. Brand-new guidance and parachute-triggering technology will help steer the craft away from hazards. Ground controllers will be helpless, given the 10 minutes it takes radio transmissions to travel one-way between Earth and Mars.

Jezero Crater is worth the risks, according to scientists who chose it over 60 other potential sites.

Where there was water - and Jezero was apparently flush with it 3.5 billion years ago - there may have been life, though it was probably only simple microbial life, existing perhaps in a slimy film at the bottom of the crater. But those microbes may have left telltale marks in the sediment layers.

Perseverance will hunt for rocks containing such biological signatures, if they exist.

It will drill into the most promising rocks and store a half-kilogram (about 1 pound) of samples in dozens of titanium tubes that will eventually be fetched by another rover. To prevent Earth microbes from contaminating the samples, the tubes are super-sterilized, guaranteed germ-free by Adam Stelzner, chief engineer for the mission at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena.

“Yep, I'm staking my reputation on it,” he said.

While prowling the surface, Perseverance as well as China's rover will peek below, using radar to locate any underground pools of water that might exist. Perseverance will also release a spindly, 4-pound (1.8-kilogram) helicopter that will be the first rotorcraft ever to fly on another planet.

Perseverance's cameras will shoot colour video of the rover's descent, providing humanity's first look at a parachute billowing open at Mars, while microphones capture the sounds.

The rover will also attempt to produce oxygen from the carbon dioxide in the thin Martian atmosphere. Extracted oxygen could someday be used by astronauts on Mars for breathing as well as for making rocket propellant.

NASA wants to return astronauts to the moon by 2024 and send them from there to Mars in the 2030s. To that end, the space agency is sending samples of spacesuit material with Perseverance to see how they stand up against the harsh Martian environment.

The tab for Perseverance's mission, including the flight and a minimum two years of Mars operations, is close to $3 billion. The UAE's project costs $200 million, including the launch but not mission operations. China has not disclosed its costs. Europe and Russia dropped plans to send a life-seeking rover to Mars this summer after falling behind in testing and then getting slammed by COVID-19.

Perseverance's mission is seen by NASA as a comparatively low-risk way of testing out some of the technology that will be needed to send humans to the red planet and bring them home safely.

“Sort of crazy for me to call it low risk because there's a lot of hard work in it and there are billions of dollars in it,” Farley said. “But compared to humans, if something goes wrong, you will be very glad you tested it out on a half-kilogram of rock instead of on the astronauts.”",Three different spacecraft bound for Mars this month,4,0.5910054042704707
1324,"What happens when Trump Derangement Syndrome meets bad math?

The President Donald Trump-hating comedian Bill Maher, in 2018, openly rooted for a recession, if its price meant the defeat of Trump in 2020. Maher said: “By the way, I’m hoping for it because one way you get rid of Trump is a crashing economy. So please, bring on the recession… Sorry if that hurts people but it’s either root for a recession or you lose your democracy… I feel like the bottom has to fall out at some point.”

Similarly, only days ago, a cable host touted the coronavirus’ “silver lining,” that the crisis, or, more specifically, Trump’s alleged poor handling of it, politically damages the president. MSNBC’s Nicolle Wallace said: “There is something both tragic, and pathetic, and ironic about the fact that it took a, you know, colour-blind, gender-blind, you know, state-line-blind virus to sort of have all of the president’s sins from his first three years catch up with him. You can’t stand there and lie… And I wonder what you think about whether or not there’s some silver lining there, that some of the things that, that we’ve been talking about for three years may be finally catching up with him?”

“Silver lining”?

The anti-Trump narrative, of course, is that he botched the handling of this crisis, and that but for his inattentiveness, America would not have over 1 million coronavirus cases. This means the worse things get, the greater the chance of Trump’s defeat in November.

This perhaps explains the math of Wallace’s MSNBC colleague, Rachel Maddow. Maddow, on April 21, said: “These are the top five largest outbreaks on Earth. Number five is Germany, with just under 150,000 cases as of today. Number four is France, just under 160,000 cases. Number three is Italy. Number two is Spain with just over 200,000 cases. And then there’s us — USA. USA, biggest outbreak in the world, with over 800,000 cases now. We have more coronavirus cases than all of the other top five countries combined.”

First, does anyone really believe the number is coming out of China, a nation of nearly 1.5 billion and where the outbreak started? The Chinese government lied repeatedly about the origin of the virus, about its transmissibility and, no doubt, about its number of cases.

Second, as of April 21, 2020, the total of the next five countries exceeded our number. The number of confirmed cases, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, was as follows: Spain 200,210; Italy 181,228; France 155,383; Germany 146,653; and the United Kingdom 124,743. That comes to 808,217, versus the USA at 786,566.

Third, how about a little perspective? Spain had 207,634 cases, versus our 931,698 cases. But its population is 47 million. Ours is 330 million, or seven times bigger. Multiply Spain’s number times seven, and that would be over 1.4 million, making Spain’s numbers, when adjusted for population, far worse than America’s. Likewise, Italy’s population is 60 million, making the U.S. population 5.5 times bigger. Multiply Italy’s 181,228 coronavirus cases by 5.5, and that comes to almost 1 million cases, making Italy worse than we were.

What about deaths? As of that date, the total deaths of the five most stricken countries outside the U.S. comes to 86,446, versus our 42,201.

What is it with Democrats, the left-wing media and arithmetic? Joe Biden once talked about President Barack Obama’s “three-letter” program, “Jobs. J.O.B.S.” During one of the Democratic debates, Biden said: “150 million people have been killed since 2007, when Bernie voted to exempt the gun manufacturers from liability. More than all wars, including Vietnam, from that point on.”

“150 million”? That’s nearly half the population of America.

And consider MSNBC’s Brian Williams’ analysis of Mike Bloomberg giving every American $1 million, rather than spending $500 million to get elected president. Williams, with a New York Times reporter nodding at his side, said: “When I read (this tweet) tonight on social media, it kind of all became clear. ‘Bloomberg spent $500 million on ads. U.S. population, 327 million.’ Don’t tell us if you’re ahead of us on the math. ‘He could have given each American $1 million and have had lunch money left over.’ It’s an incredible way of putting it.” Actually, Bloomberg’s $500 million, at $1 million per American, would have gifted exactly 500 of us.

The country is facing a pandemic that has, so far, killed about 60,000 Americans, with many experts expecting a vaccine a year to 18 months from now, if then. But rest assured, say the Trump-haters, the sacrifice the sick and the dead have made were not in vain. There is a “silver lining.” Trump may go down in November.

So, raise a glass.

OAKLAND, Calif. - Friday's widespread crashes of popular apps running on the iPhone's iOS operating system - including Tinder, Spotify and Pinterest - serve as a reminder that Facebook is still tracking you through your phone using sophisticated software, even if you're not browsing the social network.

Early Friday, users of the apps reported crashes when they tried to open them up. Facebook attributed the problem, which was quickly fixed, to a bug in its software development kit, or SDK, a tool developers use to integrate their apps with Facebook.

The integration allows people to use their Facebook credentials to log in to apps for dating, music or anything else. Google, Apple and other companies also offer SDKs to developers.

It also allows the app developers to send data from their app to Facebook, which tracks and measures what people do on the apps. The data is useful both for the app developers and Facebook, which uses sophisticated systems to measure how people respond to ads, how they use its service and how much time they spend on it.

In March, the video calling service Zoom was sued in California for sharing user data with Facebook using its SDK, a practice it now says it has stopped.

Facebook's SDK caused similar crashes in May. The company said in a statement Friday that a “code change triggered crashes for some iOS apps using the Facebook SDK.”

MONTREAL - A Paris-based game developer is cutting ties with the managing director of its Canadian studios as the company continues to grapple with allegations of misconduct.

Ubisoft says Yannis Mallat is “stepping down from his role and will leave the company, effective immediately.”

It says he cannot continue in the role, given recent allegations that have come to light against multiple employees in Canada.

The company previously announced that Maxime Beland, its Toronto-based vice-president of editorial, has resigned and another unidentified employee in Toronto has been fired.

Ubisoft chief executive Yves Guillemot has said he will “revise the composition” of the company's editorial department and transform its human resource processes.

He says the company fell short of its “obligation to guarantee a safe and inclusive environment” for employees.

Flight-certification testing for Boeing's 737 Max, which has been grounded since March 2019 because of two deadly crashes, could begin as early as Monday, according to an Federal Aviation Administration email sent Sunday to congressional oversight committees.

The company needs clearance from the FAA before the planes can fly again, and the test flights, with FAA test pilots, are a key step. They would take several days and would evaluate Boeing's proposed changes to the automated flight control system on the Max.

The flight control system, triggered by faulty readings from sensors, pushed the planes into nosedives that led to crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia, killing 346 people.

Even if no new problems are discovered during the test flights, it's likely to take at least a month to get pilots trained and get mothballed planes upgraded, inspected and serviced. The FAA has to sign off on Boeing's pilot-training program, and a panel of international regulators will comment on minimum pilot training too.

Boeing said it deferred to the FAA and global regulators on the Max certification process.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates - Police dispersed protesters in southwestern Iran angry over the Islamic Republic's anemic economy amid a U.S. sanctions campaign, a news report said on Friday, and internet access to the wider region was disrupted as demonstrators shared videos of the rally.

Internet-access advocacy group NetBlocks.org reported the disruption affecting Iran's oil-rich Khuzestan province late Thursday.

The outage coincided with videos being published online of protesters gathering in the city of Behbahan, some 570 kilometres (355 miles) southwest of the capital, Tehran.

Those videos showed demonstrators chanting slogans heard at other protests in Iran over the last year, including: “Don't be afraid, we are all together.” Others targeted Iran's foreign policy, shouting: “No Gaza, no Lebanon, I will die for Iran.”

One video verified by The Associated Press shows a crowd of dozens of people in a square in Behbahan, shouting: “An Iranian will die, but will never accept humiliation.”

Behbahan's police chief, Col. Mohammad Azizi, later was quoted by Iranian website jamaran.news as confirming a protest took place beginning at 9 p.m. Thursday. He said police “firmly dispersed” the demonstrators, who rallied over the economy. He said there were no injuries.

Iran shut down the country's internet for days in November to halt protests that swept across the country, fueled by anger over the country's anemic economy. Amnesty International reported at least 300 people were killed in the unrest, many shot dead by security forces.

The November demonstrations showed the widespread economic discontent gripping Iran since May 2018, when President Donald Trump imposed crushing sanctions after unilaterally withdrawing the United States from the nuclear deal that Tehran struck with world powers. That decision has seen Iran begin to break limits of the deal, as well as a series of attacks across the Mideast that America has blamed on Tehran.",Internet disrupted in Iran province as police disperse rally,2,0.22509934230030493
1336,"OTTAWA -- It’s the second day the WE Charity controversy will take centre stage at a House of Commons committee meeting, this time with members of the Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics.

An emergency meeting was called early this week by four MPs to vote on whether to review ""safeguards which are in place to avoid and prevent conflicts of interest in federal government procurement, contracting, granting, contribution and other expenditure policies.""

The Conservatives will bring forward the motion and have also requested that Speakers’ Spotlight – the agency that paid out the prime minister’s mother and brother for WE speaking engagements – provide all records of speaking appearances, and the associated fees or reimbursements, by Justin Trudeau, his wife Sophie, his mother Margaret, and his brother Alexandre.

The committee’s partisan make-up is a shift from the last time the prime minister’s inner circle was embroiled in an ethics debacle. While Liberals dominated the roster during the SNC-Lavalin affair, ultimately changing the trajectory of the investigation, opposition members make up the majority of the committee today.

On Thursday, the WE deal was hotly debated at the finance committee as Youth Minister Bardish Chagger fielded questions about the lead-up to the now-halted student grant program, how WE Charity’s proposal to administer the program was reviewed and processed, and whether cabinet members knew about the prime minister and Finance Minister Bill Morneau’s close family ties to the organization.",House ethics committee to address WE Charity contract,2,0.3477203659126339
1337,"In the political ethics course I teach at university, I tell students that politicians and other public office holders could spare themselves a heap of trouble if they asked themselves a simple question: “Do I want to read about this on the front page of the Globe and Mail?” And perhaps a second caveat: “If I do it, will I be able to defend my action on the television news?” These simple questions can be applied in situations involving risky personal behaviour or conflicts of interest.  For example, they might have made Ontario Premier Doug Ford stop before trying to install one of his pals as the head of the provincial police. They surely would have kept Prime Minister Justin Trudeau from stumbling stupidly into a conflict of interest over the sole source contract that his government awarded to WE Charity, an organization with which the Trudeau family has been involved for several years. Under the contract, now abruptly terminated, the charity was to receive roughly $14.5 million to administer a program that would distribute $900 million in federal grants to support summer jobs for students during the COVID-19 crisis. There was something “off” about the WE deal from the outset. The government did not need an outside contractor to set up or manage the array of programs it created to pump out billions of assistance dollars during the pandemic – programs like the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB), Canada Emergency Student Benefit (CESB) and Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS). The government proved it is remarkably efficient at giving away money. Why then did it need WE to help it give away money through the Canada Student Service Grant (CSSG)? That question alone should have set alarm bells ringing in the corridors of power. And if – through careless indifference or some inexcusable failure of due diligence – it did not set off alarms, the Trudeau family connection with WE certainly should have. Justin is close to his mother. It is inconceivable that he was unaware that she was collecting speaking fees from WE – $250,000 for 28 speeches between 2016 and 2020 – and unlikely that he did not know his filmmaker brother Alexandre (“Sacha”) was drinking from the same well ($32,000 for four WE speeches).  He should not have touched the WE contract with a barge pole. He should not have brought it before cabinet and, if another minister proposed it, he was ethically obligated to recuse himself from the discussion and vote. Now, the Commons ethics commissioner is investigating the prime minister for breaching the Conflict of Interest Act. It is Trudeau’s third trip down that road, and it will produce his third slap on the wrist (following his Aga Khan vacation and SNC-Lavalin controversy). The WE Charity is the most blatant conflict of the three. There is something missing in the Liberal DNA. They are great at preaching transparency and accountability. They campaign on these twin principles. The prime minister advocates them at every opportunity. Yet the Liberals keep acting as though transparency and accountability are guiding principles for everyone except themselves. The Liberals are missing something else. It is the political equivalent of a drug-sniffing dog in the Prime Minister’s Office – an official or (to be on the safe side) officials whose job it is to sniff every proposal that comes into the office for the telltale odour of conflict of interest or other variety of ethical spoilage. We will call this person(s) the Principal Sniffer. If the Principal Sniffer were on the job, she/he/they would have thrown up a stop sign until Trudeau addressed the two questions at the top of this column.  As it is, he had to read it on the front page of the Globe and Mail, and he has been savaged on the TV news. Worse, he has put his minority government in jeopardy.

1338,"A bail hearing for the man accused of threatening Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has been delayed until the end of July while his lawyer waits to see the evidence against him.

Corey Hurren, 46, made a brief court appearance by phone Friday.

Hurren’s lawyer, Michael Davies, said he had not yet received disclosure of the evidence against his client and asked to have the bail hearing postponed until July 31.

Assistant Crown attorney Sabrina Goldfarb said the RCMP only sent their disclosure documents Thursday and it was not in a usable format, and that it would take until early next week for the evidence to be passed on to the defence.

Justice of the Peace Andrew Seymour granted the adjournment.

Hurren has been in custody in Ottawa since July 2, when police say they arrested him on the grounds of Rideau Hall after he allegedly crashed his truck through a security gate on the property where Trudeau and Gov. Gen. Julie Payette normally live.

Then he allegedly ran, carrying at least one gun with him, across the grounds towards the two residences.

Neither the Trudeau family nor Payette were on the grounds at the time.

Police say they caught up to him more than 10 minutes after the security breach, in the greenhouses behind Rideau Hall. Police then spoke to him for more than 90 minutes before arresting him.

Hurren, a Manitoba reservist and sausage-maker, faces 21 charges related to four guns he allegedly had with him and one of uttering threats against Trudeau.

Before the incident, he had posted online about the financial and other stresses he was under because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Court",Bail hearing postponed two weeks for accused in Rideau Hall gate crashing – Maple Ridge News,2,0.08858336146387946
1340,"OTTAWA -- Youth Minister Bardish Chagger says that the Prime Minister’s Office did not direct her to suggest that WE Charity run the now-halted summer student volunteer grant program, which MPs learned on Thursday evolved from a WE Charity proposal made to the government in April.

Chagger doubled down on the federal government’s assertion that it was the public service that suggested WE Charity run the summer student volunteer grant program, naming the senior assistant deputy minister in the Employment and Social Development department Rachel Wernick as the official who advanced the suggestion.

“I was not directed by the Prime Minister's Office,” Chagger said. “It’s something we turned over to the public service as to how can we deliver this program… They made it a recommendation that WE Charity would be the organization able to deliver this program within the timeline needed, with the scope and scale and magnitude that we were desiring,” Chagger said.

Chagger was the first to testify on the controversial sole-sourced contract—which she disputes it was a contract at all, calling it instead a “contribution agreement”—during the first meeting of the House Finance Committee study into the Liberal government’s connections to the charitable organization.

In the first round of questioning the minister told MPs she personally did not have conversations with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau or Finance Minister Bill Morneau’s offices about the plans to outsource the administration of the program to WE Charity, which both Trudeau and Morneau have close personal connections to.

“I was given a recommendation by the public service, I accepted the recommendation… and I brought it forward to cabinet,” Chagger said.

She also emphasized that the COVID-19 pandemic played a role in shaping the way federal programs were being developed and executed.

Trudeau unveiled the program as part of a $9-billion student-focused COVID-19 aid package on April 22. It took two months for the details of the grant aspect of the package to be articulated.

Chagger told MPs that of the $912-million program, $19.5 million was the operating budget for the program—all of which has been returned to the government after WE Charity backed away from running the volunteer program.

She also said that the program was intended to be enhanced, meaning an additional $13.5 million could have been given to WE Charity for an additional 20,000 placements if the demand was there.

“The maximum amount WE Charity could have received was $43.53 million out of the total budget… The vast majority of the money was for grants that would have been issued by one-time payments for students to pay for their post-secondary education costs,” Chagger said.

PROGRAM EVOLVED FROM WE PROPOSAL

On Thursday MPs began hearing from the first group of witnesses on the program rollout, how it came about, and who was involved.

A slate of senior public servants from the Canadian Heritage and Employment and Social Development departments—who the Liberals say were the ones to suggest WE Charity take on administering the $912-million Canada Student Service Grant—testified, including Wernick.

During her testimony the senior public servant said that when her team was asked in mid-April to provide options for some form of a student service program, other charity groups were considered early on, but there was no formal open bid for pitches, and other than WE Charity none of the options met all the criteria needed to take on the program.

She cited experience delivering similar programs and a direct connection to Canadian youth as two benefits of going with WE Charity.

Wernick called WE Charity an “obvious option,” noting that WE Charity—which is co-founded by Craig Kielburger and Marc Kielburger—had already reached out to unspecified members of cabinet and government officials proposing they work with the government on a program “related to social entrepreneurship for youth.”

According to Wernick, WE Charity indicated their program proposal could be adapted as needed.

She said she called WE Charity on April 19 to discuss their prospective involvement, and then on April 22, the day Trudeau announced the program Wernick said that the organization sent her “a detailed proposal to quickly develop tens of thousands of volunteer placements for youth within a few weeks.”

“Given the need for speed and scale, I determined with my team and colleagues that their draft proposal was the best available option in the time we had to work,"" she said, noting that after April 22 no other groups reached out to indicate they’d be interested in delivering the Canada Student Service Grant.

WE Charity and the government then entered into talks about the ""contribution agreement"" in mid-May and Wernick said that any activity the organization did to recruit or set up volunteer placements prior to the late June launch of the program were taken ""completely"" at the charity's risk.

The aid program, meant to offer students $1,000 for every 100 hours of volunteer time they spent helping out on COVID-19-related efforts, was put on pause after WE Charity backed out after coming under fire for its own internal issues as well as what critics say is a clear conflict of interest within the Liberal government.

Both Morneau and Trudeau have apologized for their part in the controversy and vowed to recuse themselves from any WE Charity discussions in the future, though federal Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion is now conducting separate probes into both Trudeau and Morneau’s dealings in relation to the WE Charity contract.

While the government has vowed to rework the program as quickly as possible, and is looking internally to government departments and agencies as possible venues for running the program, thousands of students have been left in limbo midway through the summer.

One of the key intentions with this committee study, according to the opposition parties who used their majority on House of Commons committees to launch the investigation, is to dig up as much detail on who knew what and when, in relation to how the WE Charity student grant deal came about. It’s also likely officials will be questioned about other past contracts with WE and the extent of the Liberals’ connections to the organization.

“Federal government proactive disclosures show that the Canada Student Service Grant is not the beginning of WE Charity’s dealings with the federal government. Government records confirm that, since 2017, WE Charity has received seven grants or contributions totalling about $5.2 million, plus another five contracts,” wrote Conservative MP and ethics critic Michael Barrett in a letter sent to the RCMP suggesting a criminal probe into the matter.

TRUDEAU TO TESTIFY?

Another key intent of the opposition parties is to have Trudeau testify before the committee. While MPs have invited him to appear, he is not compelled to do so. When asked if he would appear at the request of MPs, Trudeau has said he’d consider it.

Facing new questions about the affair on Thursday during an unexpected press conference just minutes before the committee got underway, Trudeau said his government would be “transparent” about the deal, but wouldn’t commit to testifying.

The purpose of bringing the prime minister before the panel of MPs would be to extract more details around his family’s connections to the charity group.

Trudeau's mother, Margaret Trudeau, spoke at approximately 28 WE events and was paid $250,000 in speaking honorariums between 2016 and 2020. His brother, Alexandre Trudeau, also spoke at eight events from 2017 to 2018 and was paid a total of approximately $32,000.

Over $60,000 of that money, which is typically doled out by corporate sponsors, was paid directly to Margaret Trudeau by the charity as the result of what WE Charity referred to as an ""error"" in billing and payment.

In addition to this, Trudeau's wife, Sophie Gregoire Trudeau, received a ""one-time speaking honorarium"" of $1,400 for participating in a youth event in 2012 before Trudeau became leader of the Liberal Party. She is an ambassador with the organization and continues to host a mental health podcast under its name.

In making his apology earlier this week, Trudeau said he was aware his family members worked with WE but he didn’t know the details of how much they were getting paid.

“I should have and I deeply regret that,” Trudeau said on Monday.

Late Wednesday We Charity announced its plans to undertake ""governance and structural changes"" and a ""formal organizational review.”

Asked Thursday about how much she knew about the prime minister’s connections, Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said everyone in cabinet “bears responsibility for the situation.”

“I'd like to say, speaking for myself, that I accept that responsibility, and I very much regret what has happened. And I want to say to Canadians: I'm really sorry. We have so many huge issues facing our country, clearly, our government made a mistake, and I want to say to people: we're going to learn from it.”

1341,"It’s truly mind-boggling that after leading the race to carry Canada through the COVID-19 crisis, Justin Trudeau has fallen on his face just metres from the finish line. But that’s what the bizarre decision by the prime minister and his Liberal government to award a fat, untendered contract to WE Charity has accomplished in the blink of an eye. From pandemic hero to — in the minds of some Canadians at least — a zero: That’s been the latest downward trajectory of Trudeau’s reputation. It seemed strange from the start that the Liberals handed WE Charity the formidable job of administering a pandemic-related program worth $912 million. The federal bureaucracy had already been deemed fit to run the two main COVID-19 economic aid programs — the Canada Emergency Relief Benefit and the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy — with their combined cost of over $160 billion. Why federal civil servants were considered incapable of handling a fraction of that money to encourage young Canadians to provide volunteer services remains a mystery. Questioned about the WE Charity deal, Trudeau initially insisted no one else in Canada could possibly manage the program. So no one else was asked. WE Charity’s modus operandi fuelled more questions and astonishment. It was to receive at least $19.5 million for administering the volunteer program with $5 million of that going to other organizations. Camps would benefit to the tune of $25,000 for hiring volunteers. School teachers would be eligible for up to $12,000 if they enlisted as many as 75 student volunteers. WE Charity itself was on track to employ 450 of those volunteers — which seemed like having its federally-funded cake and eating it too. Such oddities — along with the criticism that it’s oxymoronic to be paying volunteers in the first place — resulted in the government and WE Charity ending their partnership on July 3 and the job of hiring volunteers being handed to the very public servants who had earlier been denied the job. But the steady drip of new embarrassments and new irregularities continues. Late last week, the public learned that far from being properly distanced from the WE Charity deal as he had previously stated, Trudeau sat at the table when cabinet approved the arrangement. Nor did he recuse himself from the decision even though his strong personal connections to WE Charity — he’s friends with the organization’s head honchos Craig and Marc Kielburger — should have raised alarms about a potential conflict of interest. Finance Minister Bill Morneau made the same serious mistake and failed to recuse himself from cabinet’s decision, despite the fact that his daughter, Grace Acan, works for WE Charity. Myopia must be catching. Like a package of fish left out on summer’s day, the longer this fiasco drags on, the worse it smells. Now it turns out three members of Trudeau’s family have received money from WE Charity for their services.  The prime minister’s mother, Margaret Trudeau, was paid about $250,000 to speak at 28 WE Charity events while brother Alexandre Trudeau got $32,000 for appearing at eight. All this happened when Trudeau was in government. Before he was PM, his wife Sophie Gregoire Trudeau received $1,400 for headlining a 2012 WE Charity event. The prime minister has already been found to have violated conflict-of-interest laws on two occasions. Why he didn’t learn from that, and as a result is being investigated again by the federal ethics commissioner, is as baffling as everything else in his latest scandal. Is it hubris, sloppiness or blindness that explains the latest stumble? Or something more serious? We wait just as we wonder about WE.",Me to WE to them: follow the money,2,0.4634527491174777

1347,"OTTAWA—Like charitable organizations across Canada, WE Charity was hit hard by COVID-19. Morale within the organization had been low for weeks, with long-time staff members being shown the door as the global health crisis deepened. Then news started circulating within the organization of a significant federal government contract. The Liberal government’s $19.5-million deal for WE to operate a $900 million student volunteering grant program turned the mood around, a source within the organization told the Star. “It was a really demoralized space for quite a while, and then we started hearing whispers internally about a government contract, a government project,” the source said. The Star agreed not to name the source, who was not authorized to speak publicly. A second source corroborated their account. “They started presenting it internally before the documents were ever signed, the contract was ever finalized, because that’s the way WE works. So we started drawing up the program before it was assured, before it was guaranteed. We started hiring people back based on that.” The mood within the organization is markedly different today, the source said, now that the international charity finds itself at the centre of a political scandal. Over the past week, it has been revealed WE paid members of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s family to speak at WE-hosted events. Margaret Trudeau, the prime minister’s mother, received $250,000 in honorariums for speaking at 28 WE-hosted events between 2016 and 2020. Alexandre Trudeau, the prime minister’s brother, received $32,000 in speaking fees between 2017 and 2018. Then it was revealed that Finance Minister Bill Morneau’s daughter works with the organization. On Monday, Trudeau and Morneau apologized for taking part in the cabinet discussions around the awarding of the contract. The federal ethics commissioner has launched an investigation. WE laid off 450 contract workers after the federal deal was nixed. Those workers were let go after the scandal broke and the charity and the government “mutually” agreed to let the public service administer the $900-million program to pay students to volunteer during the COVID-19 pandemic. The source said WE Charity and its co-founders, brothers Marc and Craig Kielburger, are now in damage-control mode.  The charity took out full-page ads in the Star and the Globe and Mail Monday, in which the Kielburgers apologized for the scandal. The same advertisement ran in Postmedia papers Tuesday. “The charity’s integrity and purpose has been called into question,” the advertisement read. “It has had direct impacts on our staff, supporters and beneficiaries. We have made mistakes that we sincerely regret. It has led us to more closely examine our own internal structures, governance and organization.” The charity issued a statement to the Star in response to questions about the organization. “With respect to our staff’s morale, WE Charity has welcomed 2,500 current and former staff over 25 years, and we respect the voice of each individual,” the statement said.  “We strive to create an environment for all employees where they can enjoy coming to work each day.” WE is by no means alone; charitable organizations across Canada have seen a decrease in donations and revenues since the pandemic hit. According to Imagine Canada, an advocacy group for the charitable sector, 73 per cent of Canadian charities reported donations were down in May 2020. “The size and scope of (COVID-19-related) shifts is beyond anything that we have seen before, far exceeding what we saw in the 2008/2009 financial downturn,” wrote David Lasby, the organization’s director of research, in a May report. “(It’s had) broad effects (so that) even the most diversified revenue bases are seriously affected.” The Star’s source said that the Kielburgers began regular town hall meetings within the organization after the news website Canadaland in late 2018 began to investigate the charity, in an effort to increase transparency for its employees.  A frequent aspect of those internal pep talks was a financial update from Marc Kielburger. The source said that last fall, Kielburger started talking about a coming recession and the “smart moves” the charity was taking to make sure it wasn’t overextended. And then COVID happened. “It is true that the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted the Canadian charitable sector as a whole, and WE Charity was no exception — but to be clear, WE Charity had no risk of ceasing operations,” the emailed statement said. “Prior to WE receiving its contact, the government had recognized the challenging times for the sector, and allocated $350 million through partners including the United Way, the Red Cross and Community Foundations Canada. The contract with WE was a further step in working with charities who were co-ordinating placements for students, while also engaging post-secondary students in meaningful service. That is the sole reason we participated.” There is considerable anger within the organization’s 174-person workforce, and especially among those contract workers laid off after the scandal hit, according to people who spoke to the Star on the condition they not be named. The government contract allowed WE to rehire a number of employees the organization had laid off since the pandemic hit. One source described it as “keeping the lights on” for WE’s programming.  The Prime Minister’s Office did not immediately answer a request for comment Tuesday. ",WE Charity saw donations dry up during pandemic. Then Ottawa offered hope,2,0.25489656342834177

federal government",Tories to seek Trudeau family’s speaking records as second WE probe begins – Maple Ridge News,2,0.31560514986441923
1354,"OTTAWA — A second House of Commons committee is debating whether to probe the aborted deal between the federal government and WE Charity to run a massive student-volunteering program.

WE gave up running the $912-million program amid controversy over hundreds of thousands of dollars in fees the WE organization paid to members of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s family for appearances at WE events.

Trudeau has said he should have recused himself from the decision but didn’t.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau, one of whose daughters works for an arm of the WE organization, has said the same.

Conservatives on the Commons ethics committee say they want copies of all records related to any speaking appearances involving Trudeau, his wife, his mother or his brother.

The Tories say the committee needs to understand how well the government’s conflict-of-interest regime works and the WE Charity deal presents a case study.

“Let’s put some sunlight on this,” said Ontario Conservative MP Michael Barrett, his party’s ethics critic, as the meeting began.

According to WE, most of the fees went to Trudeau’s mother Margaret, a mental-health advocate, for events between 2016 and 2020, and Justin Trudeau has never been paid anything.

Quebec Liberal MP Brenda Shanahan argued the ethics committee is not an investigative body. It broadly oversees the work of people such as federal ethics commissioner Mario Dion, she said, but doesn’t do probes itself.

Dion is investigating Trudeau and Morneau in the affair, to determine whether they violated the Conflict of Interest Act.

Shanahan said that’s the way the probe should be carried out.

“Is that really the way we want to go? Investigate everyone publicly? When there are other tools available?” she asked.

Thursday, the Commons finance committee heard from Youth Minister Bardish Chagger and senior public servants about how the arrangement with WE came together after Trudeau announced plans in April for a volunteering program for students who couldn’t find work this summer because of COVID-19.

1357,"Almost every criticism of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for violating the federal Conflict of Interest Act can be made of Finance Minister Bill Morneau.

We say “almost” because, while Trudeau has broken the conflict law twice — in the Aga Khan and SNC-Lavalin controversies — and is now under investigation a third time, Moreau has broken it once, although he is also now under investigation for a third time.

Morneau was previously found to have broken the law by failing to report he was a director in a corporation that owns his villa in France, along with an estimate of its value. He was fined $200.

He was cleared in a second investigation involving his introduction of a pension bill as finance minister while having a financial interest in a family-owned pension services company.

Now, Morneau is under investigation, like Trudeau, for not recusing himself from cabinet’s decision to grant a now-cancelled $912-million, sole-sourced contract to hire student volunteers awarded to the WE organization.

This despite having two daughters linked to the charity, one an employee.

Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion announced his investigation of Morneau Thursday in response to letters to his office from Conservative MPs Michael Cooper and Pierre Poilievre.

Dion will investigate Morneau under two provisions of the Conflict of Interest Act that prohibit public office holders from making decisions improperly furthering the interests of another person, and for failing to recuse themselves from discussions, decisions or debates in which they have a conflict of interest.

Trudeau is already under investigation by the ethics commissioner under those two sections of the law, plus a third prohibiting public office holders from giving preferential treatment to any person or organization based on their identity.

Trudeau also participated in the cabinet decision awarding the contract to WE, despite his close family ties to the organization and its founders, Craig and Marc Kielburger, including over $300,000 paid to his mother and brother in speaking fees, while his wife is a WE ambassador who is paid travel expenses.

Trudeau and Morneau have apologized for their actions in the WE controversy, but it’s particularly irresponsible that both took an active role in approving the WE contract, given their familiarity with the conflict law due to previous transgressions.",EDITORIAL: Morneau almost as conflicted as Trudeau,2,0.24589920598766768
1358,"When it comes to both Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump and the political hot water each is currently flailing about in, there are garbage barges full of family dysfunction on display.

In the high heat of the summer of our disease and discontent, they stink.

Reminds one of British poet Philip Larkin’s blunt immortal words:

“They f--k you up, your mum and dad.

They may not mean to, but they do.

They fill you with the faults they had

And add some extra, just for you.”

After exhibiting admirably tough, competent and compassionate leadership through the worst public-health crisis of our time, Trudeau’s current conflict-of-interest difficulties in the WE charity mess are so ridiculous and unnecessary that even one of his elderly and most ardent fans in my family exploded over the phone as if she were admonishing her own children. “That is just plain STUPID,” she said of the leader she had faithfully watched on television every single day during lockdown to approvingly receive his “how we’re going to help you” briefings during the height of the COVID-19 crisis.

Trudeau, now caught in an apparently blatant not to mention boundlessly inane conflict-of-interest imbroglio when his Liberal government awarded a juicy, multimillion, sole-source contract to the WE charity to administer volunteer student grants, was forced to publicly apologize when it was revealed that his mother Margaret Trudeau had in the recent past earned $250,000 from the organization and its affiliates in more than 20 speaking appearances and his brother Alexandre (Sacha) Trudeau more than $30,000.

And while the PM said he “knew” his whole family, including his wife Sophie Grégoire Trudeau (she was paid before he became PM) were very close to WE, he neither asked them just how much they had made from the organization nor, more puzzlingly, step away from the cabinet table when the deal was decided.

Bill Morneau, finance minister, also wearing ethical short pants, did not step away from the decision though his own daughter worked for the charity. (Note: politicians of many stripes, including Justin Trudeau himself, have appeared at WE events.)

Come on. Even though the charity withdrew from the contract and is now undergoing a “restructuring,” there better be a much more thorough explanation as to why on earth Trudeau thought participating in the decision to award this contract was OK.

More to come, I’m sure, from a PM who prefers to bend the rules and apologize later. I don’t believe at this crucial point in our pandemic recovery, with no entirely competent, present or persuasive political opponents, that this breach is criminal or even career-ending. It’s maddening, though.

Simple question sir: Why not, in light of two previously confirmed ethical violations for which the voters forgave you, follow the rules even more strictly and find other worthy organizations to help students through a disastrous economic time that will impact their future for years to come? As the kids would say, “Man, that is messed up.”

What Trudeau said during his apology rang the dysfunctional bell. “I deeply regret that I have brought my mother into this situation. It’s unfair to her, and I should have been thoughtful enough to recuse myself,” Trudeau said.

Yes, you owed her more than that. Now his mother, the fabled Margaret Trudeau, who has been in succession the daughter and wife and mother of three powerful male politicians (there oughta be a gold medal for that arduous trifecta), who arguably has done more for ordinary Canadians than most blowhard politicians by opening up a necessary national conversation about her own mental illness, is being both slammed and supported on social media.

What good has she ever done, yells the Twitter pyjama brigade, no doubt jealous of the big bucks she’s received. I heard a CBC host shorthand the scandal as “Mum got paid.”

Nope. It is not wrong for Margaret Trudeau to be paid for her high-profile speaking and advocacy work. It is wrong for her firstborn son as PM to ignore conflict-of-interest klaxons blaring and let his cabinet choose the charity in the first place.

Margaret Trudeau has earned admiration in the mental-health community. I’ve seen her talk powerfully and gracefully about how her illness derailed her private and very public life. I’ve also seen her in the last decade at least once painfully fumble a promotional appearance during a difficult time.

Everyone gets paid far too much for these appearances, but it’s rationalized as how you subsidize social change.

When it comes to the Trudeau family dysfunction, there’s always been a relatively harmless streak of narcissism running through this complex and fascinating political family. Pierre, Margaret and their son Justin have always been a bit too ready for their close-ups.

But I will say this: the self-regard they have each displayed is not malignant, it’s not destructive, and it’s not close to being as savage and dangerously dysfunctional as the virulent and brutish and amoral family narcissism that produced Donald Trump, the worst American president in modern history.

As an explosive new book this summer, “Too Much and Never Enough,” by one of Trump’s own family members, niece Mary L. Trump, a clinical psychologist confirms, Donald Trump grew up in an emotional wasteland, raised to be a winner or “killer” by his brutish, racist father and ignored by his needy and unwell mother.

All the wealth and advantages in the world, however misbegotten, could not help Trump become a decent leader, ready to contribute to the good of society — which used to be, in a galaxy far away and long ago, one of the acceptable goals of privileged people entering public service.

Trump — savagely incompetent and clinically narcissistic, according to his niece — was raised in a dysfunctional family to become “the world’s most dangerous man.”

When Mary Trump was asked during an interview what she would say to her uncle Donald right now, she succinctly responded: “Resign.”

How dare I compare these two leaders, Justin Trudeau, shining moral beacon to the world — at least those who didn’t vote against him at the UN — who stands on his own, seeks to do good and normally does it, even if he arrogantly bends a few rules along the way; and Donald Trump, ugly Goliath of the White House, whose racism, ignorance, corruption and deceits in dismissing the pandemic have helped kill tens of thousands of Americans with more to come?

Family dysfunction affects us all. It makes us or breaks us. But only up to a point. After that point, and with all due diligence about our own weak spots, we sink or swim. Which leader will survive this summer of disease and discontent? I hope it’s ours.

1359,"When Justin Trudeau apologized Monday for his lapse in judgment about WE Charity, he delivered it with a giant bouquet of flowers — a promise to extend the 75 per cent wage subsidy for troubled companies until the end of the year. That may or may not be enough to persuade the public to forgive him for not recusing himself from the controversial file. But even if it’s not, the $50-billion commitment could go a long way toward giving companies a lifeline as they emerge from the pandemic – as long as it’s designed strategically as well as quickly. The move was foreshadowed last week in Finance Minister Bill Morneau’s fiscal update and has been weeks in negotiation, so let’s not be too cynical about the motivation behind the multi-billion-dollar announcement that Trudeau blurted out within seconds of apologizing for his involvement in the WE fiasco. But there are no details available yet for how the subsidy will work, and for that, we can be plenty cynical. Trudeau had just one sentence about it in his morning news conference, and Morneau’s office would only say — with a smiley face attached — that details were not ready yet, It’s that kind of vague policy announcement that got the prime minister in trouble with the WE file to begin with — a headline designed to fill a political need, with the fine print to come sometime “soon,” once the officials can catch up with the politics of the day. The fine print is important here, for economics and politics alike. Morneau and Trudeau have pinned their hopes for an economic restart on the wage subsidy. In theory, when provincial governments relax their COVID-19 rules, as Ontario’s Doug Ford did on Monday, the wage subsidy will kick in and help companies stay above water when they reopen just half way. Ford said some regions of the province can now open up restaurants, bars and daycares, but not necessarily at full capacity because physical distancing rules remain in place. The hope is that the federal wage subsidy will shoulder a large part of the payroll of any company that is still losing a big chunk of its revenue compared to last year, allowing firms to reopen and bring back their workers even if they’re still constrained due to pandemic rules. But how much of their payrolls will be covered by this extension? How much money does a company have to be losing in order to qualify? And what about companies that are hoping to hire back minimum-wage workers, but can’t find any because they’re collecting the more lucrative Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB)? Without those answers, companies won’t know if it’s worth their time and effort to reopen on Friday as the premier hopes, says Perrin Beatty, the president of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce. “We need to get that information as soon as possible,” Beatty said. “It’s critical for tens of thousands of businesses, particularly in some sectors” such as tourism, travel, accommodation, retail and restaurants. When it was first introduced, the wage subsidy was available to companies that could show a 30 per cent drop in revenues compared to last year. But that agreement expired at the end of June, and now, government officials and business leaders alike say the 30 per cent cut-off is too harsh — there’s no incentive for a company hovering near the threshold to make an extra dollar if it might lose its payroll support as a result. Similarly, there’s a growing understanding within government that the CERB had its place in sustaining family finances during the dark days of the lockdown, but now it needs to be wound down and replaced as employers reopen so people will be encouraged to go back to work. These are complex policy questions that officials and experts have been hammering away at with increasing urgency, but that the prime minister — in his haste to have some good news in the face of scandal — rolled out before his civil service had the required paperwork in hand. That’s partly why he ended up in hot water with WE Charity. In late April, as the opposition NDP roared about the lack of financial help for students and threatened to withhold its support for COVID-19 aid without measures, Trudeau unveiled a generous $9-billion student aid package.  Along with commitments to create more summer jobs and extend emergency benefits to students was the creation of the Canada Student Service Grant — the program now swirling at the centre of the WE controversy. It’s now clear that the plan to pay students up to $5,000 for volunteer work was not nearly ready for prime time. After winding its way through cabinet approvals, it finally saw the light of day more than two months later, only to spark an immediate controversy. While the Liberals are paying a political price for that backwards process, students continue to go without their promised support. The wage subsidy talks are well advanced, but the economic stakes of getting the design just right are high.

1360,"OTTAWA - The federal minister responsible for a $912-million student volunteering program said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s office didn’t order her to make the agreement with WE Charity that has become mired in ethical questions for the government.

Youth Minister Bardish Chagger told the House of Commons finance committee Thursday she didn’t personally have conversations with Trudeau’s office, or that of Finance Minister Bill Morneau, or WE itself prior to cabinet approval of the deal.

Days after the prime minister announced WE Charity would run the program, the organization quit amid a controversy about Trudeau’s family links to the charity.

During a long and at times testy committee meeting Thursday, MPs heard those family ties were raised during cabinet discussions. MPs also got a timeline about how the agreement came to be, including that the charity first pitched the government on a youth program days before Trudeau publicly announced plans for one.

Trudeau, and now his finance minister, are facing ethics probes for their roles in the affair and the fate of the Canada Student Service Grant is uncertain.

The timeline of events began in early April when WE sent an unsolicited proposal for a youth program to Chagger and Small Business Minister Mary Ng.

Late Thursday, the charity released the proposal dated April 9.

The proposed program aimed to help up 8,000 students become entrepreneurs, and provide each with $500 and “access to additional incentive funds and long-term mentorship opportunities,” the proposal reads.

The one-year cost ranged between $6 million and $14 million.

Federal officials had already talked about ways to help students unable to work this summer due to the COVID-19 pandemic, intending to roll out something by mid-May.

It was in that context that Finance Department officials mentioned WE during conversations with counterparts at Employment and Social Development Canada, which oversees student-related programs.

Rachel Wernick, a senior ESDC official, said she offered to call WE and explore potential options for a student service program because of the organization’s previous involvement with the department.

She told the committee she called WE co-founder Craig Kielburger on April 19 at which time she learned of the original proposal. WE called the proposal “distinct and clearly unrelated” to the one the Liberals unveiled in its statement.

Three days later, on April 22, Trudeau announced a $9-billion package of student aid, including the outline of a volunteer program paying students up to $5,000 toward education costs, based on the number of hours they volunteer.

WE said the government “reached out” to craft a new proposal “along the lines of its proposed” volunteer program, without specifying who reached out or when. Wernick told the committee Kielburger emailed her an updated proposal on April 22.

In a June 12 video chat with youth leaders, a copy of which was obtained by The Canadian Press, brother and WE co-founder Marc Kielburger said he heard from Trudeau’s office on April 23 about the volunteer program.

In a statement last month, Marc Kielburger said the contact came the week of April 26 from an ESDC official (he cited Wernick’s title but not her name), and not the PMO.

Chagger’s deputy minister, Gina Wilson, told the committee that officials determined early on that going with a wide, or even limited, tender process to run the program would have taken two months or more, which was too long.

Chagger said the recommendation, made in writing by Wernick, was that WE was the only organization that could run and scale up the grant program.

“I asked the same question as to why the public service could not offer this program,” Chagger told the committee. “It was recommended that WE Charity be used because they had the capacity as well as the network to deliver this program.”

In mid-May, negotiations on a funding agreement began, the committee heard. The final deal had WE Charity eligible to receive up to $43.53 million to administer the program if it landed 40,000 placements.

Paula Speevak, chief executive of Volunteer Canada, a charity that promotes volunteering and helps organizations use volunteers well, said WE suggested in meetings between May 25 and June 3 that the target for placements had gone from 20,000 to 100,000.

Before that, her group raised concerns about paying hourly rates below minimum wage and calling it “volunteering,” telling Chagger that could undermine future engagement.

Chagger didn’t say how many positions the program was supposed to create for students or who in her office spoke with the Prime Minister’s Office about the deal prior to its being finalized on June 23.

NDP ethics critic Charlie Angus pressed Chagger about whether Trudeau’s family links were raised when she brought the recommendation to cabinet.

“We have tough conversations around the cabinet table, we have tough conversations around our team,” Chagger said. “Yes, these questions were posed.”

On July 3, WE gave up the contract amid the controversy about its connections to Trudeau and speaking fees paid to his brother and mother.

Trudeau has admitted he should have recused himself from the decision to award the contract, as has Morneau, whose daughter works for the WE organization.

The prime minister didn’t say Thursday whether he would testify at committee as opposition MPs want.

“I’m looking forward to speaking next week at Parliament,” Trudeau said, referring to a scheduled July sitting. “I know there will be a range of questions from opposition parties.”

Ethics commissioner Mario Dion has already said he’ll investigate Trudeau’s role in the affair. Dion’s office said Thursday that Morneau would be scrutinized as well to see if he violated sections of conflict of interest rules.

The average time to complete an ethics investigation is seven months.

1364,"HALIFAX -- Nova Scotia’s back-to-school plan is coming next week and it appears students will likely be heading back to the classroom full time in September.

Education Minister Zach Churchill announced Thursday that his department will release its full plan next Wednesday.

“Our priority is to have students in school. We know that’s where they’re going to do their best. We know that’s best for families for a teaching and learning environment, so our priority is to have them in school,” said Churchill.

“But, of course, we do have to be responsive to the evolving situation with COVID-19, so, as I mentioned previously, we do have some fallback positions, either at 50 per cent capacity or all the way down to zero if the situation necessitates that.”

Nova Scotia schools have remained closed since March break in an effort to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Students continued their education at home during the pandemic, either online or with workbooks. The school year for students ended on June 5.

If students do head back to the classroom full time, it is expected physical distancing and enhanced sanitation protocols will be in place.

Teachers, parents and opposition MLAs have been calling on the Nova Scotia government to release a plan for the upcoming school year for weeks.

The Department of Education released a statement to CTV News on Wednesday, saying it has been evaluating the feedback it received from parents, students and teachers, as well as advice and direction from public health officials and the IWK Health Centre.",Our priority is to have students in school': N.S. to release back-to-school plan next week,2,0.38382052377502096

Opposition parties were notified Thursday of the new legislation and the potential for the Commons to deal with it early next week.

Among the items hanging on the government's agenda is a promise to provide one-time payments to some Canadians with disabilities to help cover additional costs incurred during the pandemic.

The Liberals tried to pass a bill last month that would set up the payment but the opposition refused to support the legislation as it contained other measures they found objectionable.

1368,"OTTAWA -- The four Conservative leadership candidates are kicking off the final stretch of COVID-19-style campaigning, with just over a month to go before all ballots are cast, after breaking a party record for membership signups.

After going head-to-head in two debates on June 17 and 18 the leadership hopefuls are continuning to try to separate themselves from the rest of the pack.

Erin O’Toole, Peter MacKay, Leslyn Lewis, and Derek Sloan battled it out in French on June 17, doing their best to deliver their platform pitches despite not one being fully bilingual. On June 18, Toronto played host to the first and only English-language debate.

Co-chairs of the Conservative Party leadership election organizing committee Dan Nowlan and Lisa Raitt were chosen to moderate.

Under the original leadership race timeline, the party was set to hold its debates in April, but those were cancelled when the entire race was put on pause due to the pandemic.

Given the public health concerns at play, there was no live audience, and physical distancing measures were in place.

Another pandemic-prompted workaround, the voting process will be conducted through mail-in ballots, which party members need to send back to the party by August 21.

On July 14 the party revealed that it had set an internal record for the total number of memberships in a leadership race, with 269,469 members eligible to vote.

“With nearly 270,000 paid Conservative Party members as of cut-off on May 15, 2020, that also means it’s the largest membership eligible to vote in a leadership in Canadian history,” said the party in a statement. According to the Conservatives, the biggest growth in new support came from voters in Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador, Quebec, and Alberta.

The race resumed on April 29 “with adjustments to accommodate current circumstances,” a month after it was initially suspended, with LEOC saying at the time that it wouldn’t be possible to meet all deadlines necessary in time for the originally-planned June 27 announcement of a winner.

While all ballots need to be submitted by August 21, it’s yet to be determined how quickly they will be scrutinized and a winner declared.

The ballots have begun to be mailed out and should soon be in eligible voters’ inboxes, the party said in mid-July.

The date and format of how the party will announce its new leader once the results are tallied will also depend on the health guidelines and government orders in place at the time.

VERIFIED CANDIDATES

To reach this phase, each contender had to raise $200,000, put forward an additional $100,000 as a compliance fee, and gather 3,000 signatures from members. This secures their name on the ballot.

Erin O’Toole:

A three-time Conservative MP from Ontario and former cabinet minister. Prior to entering politics O'Toole was in the Royal Canadian Air Force for a decade and later worked as a lawyer. O'Toole placed third in the 2017 leadership race, and since re-entering has taken policy positions that appear to be appealing to the base of the party. He's described himself as the ""true blue"" candidate.

O'Toole says he's running because ""the country needs a strong Conservative party."" He's taking the position of uniting Conservatives.

Peter MacKay:

A former federal cabinet minister from Nova Scotia and the last leader of the Progressive Conservatives pre-merger with Stephen Harper’s Canadian Alliance in 2003. After deciding not to run in 2015, MacKay was working at a Toronto law firm and was a frequent political commentator. Since throwing his hat in the ring he's faced questions over some conflicting positions.

MacKay says he is running ""to keep the Conservative movement united and to defeat Justin Trudeau in the next general election.""

Leslyn Lewis:

An Ontario lawyer who was an unsuccessful 2015 federal election candidate. Lewis lost after being put into a race at the last moment when the previous candidate quit once a video of him urinating in a cup while working in someone's home surfaced. She came to Canada as a child from Jamaica and has received the backing of Campaign Life Coalition, as well as the support of a prominent Christian activist, who called her a ""breath of fresh air"" as a woman who is against same-sex marriage and abortion.

Lewis says she is running because ""Canadians can and should expect much more from their leaders,"" and because she is seeing ""opportunities for future generations falling away.""

Derek Sloan:

A rookie Ontario Conservative MP elected for the first time in 2019. Prior to entering politics he worked as a lawyer and small business owner. Since entering the House of Commons he's stated that he believes the ""cause of sexual orientation"" is ""scientifically unclear,"" and has also received the backing of social conservative organization Campaign Life Coalition.

Sloan says he believes the country is ""under siege by a tide of political correctness that seeks to destroy Canada,"" and vows to ""take a stand for Canada against radical progressivism.""

NO LONGER IN THE RUNNING

Marilyn Gladu:

A two-time Conservative MP from Ontario, who was first elected in 2015. Prior to entering politics she worked as a chemical engineer. As a parliamentarian she's advocated for palliative care and, during her time as the health critic, she voiced concerns about the Liberals’ rollout of marijuana legalization.

Gladu said her vision included: ""Canadian policy rooted in a better balance of fiscal common sense and social compassion.""

Rudy Husny:

A longtime Conservative party member and former staffer. Husny worked for PricewaterhouseCoopers in Montreal before trying his luck twice at running as the Conservative candidate in the riding of Outremont in 2011 and 2015. Husny worked as a senior adviser to the Minister of International Trade in between his two unsuccessful bids. After 2015, he spent time both in the private sector in the Gulf region and in outgoing Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer's office. Husny was the only Quebec candidate, and he had already established that he would tell MPs looking to bring forward anti-abortion bills that it's ""not the priority.""

Husny said he was running ""to bring generational change to our party, to our politics, and to our country.""

Rick Peterson:

A businessman from Alberta and past leadership candidate. He came 12th in the 2017 leadership race and touted his bilingualism and openness to diversity as assets. He proposed a 15 per cent flat personal income tax and a roll back of Liberal gun laws.

Peterson said he was running to ""help restore and reinvigorate the investment climate and job creation."" He billed himself as the candidate with a ""bold vision"" that included tax reform and a climate plan.

Jim Karahalios:

An Ontario lawyer who has advocated for the elimination of carbon taxes. He's also married to Ontario Progressive Conservative MPP Belinda Karahalios and is suing the provincial PC party over allegations that the 2018 race for party president was “rigged” to keep him out. He received the backing of social conservative group Campaign Life Coalition.

Karahalios said he was running to fight against what he called a ""top-down coronation"" for ""the well-connected establishment candidates.""

PROMPTED BY SCHEER RESIGNATION

The leadership race got underway on January 13, giving hopefuls 45 days to declare. The hunt for a new head of the party was prompted by Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer announcing on Dec. 12 that he was stepping down as leader but would be staying on until a replacement is named.

Under Scheer, the Conservatives increased their seat count to 121 seats in the 2019 federal election, but in the weeks following the election, Scheer faced a steady stream of criticism for his performance and personal stance on same-sex marriage and other social issues. He was also questioned about his expenses and use of party funds in the lead-up to the federal campaign.",Conservative leadership race enters final push,2,0.25460402462682086
1369,"OTTAWA -- The federal government has passed billions of dollars in spending measures during a special House of Commons sitting, with the backing of enough opposition MPs to not prompt formal standing votes.

The conclusion of the special sitting marks the end of more routine gatherings of MPs, with the next time the House convenes set for early July.

Through a series of oral approvals, MPs signed off on approximately $87 billion in funds to tie over federal departments and, in this case, COVID-19 aid programs until the fall. The agreement to pass the funding was given “on division,” meaning no recorded vote was required.

The two spending bills were the first chance since the pandemic shut down the regular sittings for MPs to indicate whether or not they still have confidence in the Liberal minority, though the sitting came and went without that opportunity being taken.

The Liberals’ commitment to an extension of a key COVID-19 aid program, the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, was what secured them the support needed to pass the supplementary estimates -- otherwise known as supply or the next cycle of scheduled and new federal spending.

Because of the Liberals’ minority standing, they needed to have the backing of at least one of the other parties in order to pass the spending measures, and the stakes were considerably higher in this instance because any votes that have to do with money, such as the federal budget or the estimates, are traditionally considered confidence votes.

In any parliament, a government lives so long as it maintains the confidence of the House of Commons. This confidence is demonstrated each time a key vote passes.

Approving the funding comes after both the Bloc Quebecois and NDP signalled they were not interested in seeing MPs line up to cast ballots amid a pandemic -- which could have happened if the Liberals lost Wednesday’s confidence votes and a snap election was called.

JUST 40 SITTING DAYS IN LAST YEAR

Wednesday’s sitting marked the 40th day there has been some form of an actual of House of Commons sitting in the last year, which did include the usual suspension over the summer of 2019 and then the fall federal election campaign.

Though after that October vote, the Liberals waited until December to reconvene the House.

CTVNews.ca asked Government House Leader Pablo Rodriguez last week about the limited number of sitting days and, as a result, the limited number of government mandate items that have been able to progress. He said the time taken pre-pandemic to adjust to the minority reality was necessary and no one could have anticipated a global health crisis would hit.

“We suggested a very ambitious agenda, a very complete throne speech, with everything that comes with it, and then we had COVID,” Rodriguez said. “But even with COVID, we adapted.”

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said once again Wednesday that the agreement to sit under the current structure was reached with the backing of the NDP and Greens, and defended the Liberals’ approach to Parliament.

“Three different parties came together to make a determination of what Parliament would do,” Trudeau said.

“Every time something doesn't go their way an opposition party cries, ‘oh no’ and it's a dictatorship all of a sudden. It's sort of irresponsible and it undermines I think the strength of our democracy that we've been able to show through this crisis,” said the prime minister during his Rideau Cottage press conference.

SPECIAL COMMITTEE COMING TO AN END

Before the special sitting got underway, MPs held their second last meeting of the special all-party COVID-19 committee of MPs. The committee is the first real experiment with a hybrid parliamentary sitting in the House chamber, but that experiment is nearly over.

As has been the case in the 23 of these meetings so far, MPs offered up statements and riding-specific petitions, before going through a question period-style session where the Liberals were grilled on the shortcomings in their COVID-19 plans and on other key policy matters.

In the motion passed on May 16, which put in place the structure of the summer sittings, MPs voted to cease the special committee after Thursday’s meeting. Its end will also mark the end of some form of MPs meeting four days a week, with them not all together until the first of four special sitting days in July.

As of June 18, the special committee will cease to exist, leaving just the four gatherings— July 8, July 22, Aug. 12, and Aug. 26— before the prospect of a more ‘normal’ House of Commons could convene come Sept. 21.

And as Trudeau announced on Wednesday morning, the July 8 sitting will also be where Finance Minister Bill Morneau will present “an economic and fiscal snapshot.”

STUDYING REMOTE VOTING, RULE CHANGES

One of the major limitations that has yet to be worked out is how to allow MPs to vote remotely.

This question is one that the Procedure and House Affairs (PROC) committee has been diving deeper into and evaluating how a formal hybrid House of Commons session could occur, the rule changes required to allow that, and what it would take to implement a remote voting system. The committee has been given a June 23 deadline to report back to its colleagues.

The government—with the support of the NDP—has argued that Parliament has continued to function through the pandemic, noting that under the new structure, the government has faced more questions from the opposition than it would have under normal House sitting parameters.

However, the Conservatives, and to a certain degree the Bloc Quebecois, have characterized the special committee as essentially a knock-off of Parliament and called for a more robust resumption of sittings that would have allowed for more accountability on the massive government policies being rolled out, while respecting the health and safety of all on Parliament Hill.

So, it remains to be seen whether the recommendations out of PROC could result in a change of plans when it comes to the summer and fall sitting schedule.",Inside the COVID-19 Commons: Liberals pass key spending before summer sittings,2,0.003631626946558053

If that major and unprecedented moment in Canadian politics occurs, Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland would become Canada’s acting prime minister.

The prime minister remains in self-isolation but on Monday Trudeau said he and his children remain symptom-free, while his wife’s symptoms are mild.

Trudeau has been working from home, chairing cabinet meetings, holding regular public addresses, and participating in international calls with world leaders from his home office.

“In the event that the Prime Minister is unable to perform the functions of his office,” a threshold left undefined, Freeland would take charge, reads the order issued by the Privy Council Office.

In line with public health advice, Trudeau has not been tested for COVID-19 as he is not symptomatic, but given the rapid and concerning spread, the federal cabinet has been given instructions on the roles they’d play if the situation evolved.

Following Freeland, the next five ministers in line are based on seniority: Veterans Affairs Minister Lawrence MacAulay; Indigenous Services Minister Carolyn Bennett; President of the Privy Council Dominic LeBlanc; Industry Minister Navdeep Bains; and Finance Minister Bill Morneau.

The order also goes on to outline how ministerial roles would shift to see all portfolios covered should Freeland become Canada’s acting prime minister, or if other ministers are no longer able to do their jobs.

Legion president Doug Hadley handed over a $1,000 cheque to Parkside elementary principal Lynn Fairley on school grounds the morning of Tuesday, July 7. (Special to the Aldergrove Star)

Aldergrove legion is helping Parkside elementary school expand its literacy program so that students in all grades, not just primary, can receive books to take home come September.

Legion president Doug Hadley handed over a $1,000 cheque to Parkside principal, Lynn Fairley, on school grounds Tuesday morning.

“If a child can read, they can do anything,” emphasized Fairley, who spoke of the program which aims to tackle illiteracy and empower students at home.

“When I arrived almost four years ago as vice-principal for Parkside, I began to collect data on reading levels for students,” Fairley retold.

“The data was a little alarming with 70 per cent of students yet to meet grade-level expectations by Grade 3.”

In years since, Parkside has ramped up its Home Reading program, which sees free books go home with students and read with parents as homework.

The school’s goal is to see Parkside’s Grade 5 students graduate while meeting grade-level reading expectations.

Illiteracy in Aldergrove might come as a surprise for many, Fairley acknowledged.

“We have a fair number of illiterate families. In fact it’s generational in some of our student groups,” she said.

“But we want parents to start to read too with their child, and feel successful.”

Money donated by the legion will be used to kickstart the creation of book bins for intermediate students – in Grades 4 and 5 – to grab good reads from.

“We have some home reading books for our primary students (approximately 300 children) which are quite old,” continued Fairley.

Unfortunately, some books do not get returned back to the school.

“But we do not have any home reading books for intermediate students to take home,” the principal said, in regards to approximately 200 students at Parkside.

The intermediate book bins were slated to get built during spring break but the COVID-19 pandemic halted the program’s expansion.

Books exchanging hands was a potential carrier of the virus, Fairley said.

Now the goal for Grades 4 and 5 to be taking home books is September, when a new school year begins.

Home reading sees families spend 20 to 30 of quality reading time together each night, Fairley said.

In addition to the program, during the regular school year, Parkside parents come into their child’s class and volunteer to read with students.

“Our goal for our students is to be literate so that they feel empowered to achieve anything they set their minds to,” Fairley committed.

1373,"TORONTO -- The Blue Jays have been given provincial clearance to play games at the Rogers Centre in Toronto, Ontario Premier Doug Ford confirmed Thursday afternoon.

The premier said the decision was made after discussions with medical officers of health.

Ford’s comments came shortly after the Minister of Heritage, Sport, Tourism and Culture Lisa MacLeod told TSN Radio 1200 in Ottawa that the MLB team had been given the go ahead.

“Our first priority is the health and well-being of all Ontarians,” MacLeod said in a statement. “Ontario’s Chief Medical Officer of Health has approved professional sports plans submitted by the NHL and MLB to facilitate a safe return to play.”

According to MacLeod, these plans require players and staff to follow “strict quarantine and isolation protocols from the general public,” as well as provide public health authorities the ability to rescind the approval if protocols are not followed.

“We’ll continue to work with our federal counterparts and sports organizations to facilitate a safe return to play if athletes are permitted to cross the border.”

On Thursday afternoon, the Blue Jays said they are not confirming MacLeod’s statements at this time and noted that the club has not yet received the necessary written approvals from government and public health.

According to the Public Health Agency of Canada, the government issued a national interest exemption to the league's players and staff for pre-season training. The government is still reviewing the plan for regular season games.

Speaking on Thursday afternoon, Mayor John Tory said he was pushing the federal and provincial governments to make this decision and noted that they were receptive because the protocols are “extensive” and will keep residents in the city, especially those surrounding the Rogers Centre, safe.

“If that is the case then I don’t know why we wouldn’t be happy to see our Blue Jays, Canada’s team, Toronto’s team, playing in their own home stadium,” he said.

The team returned to Toronto last week to start training camp at the Rogers Centre.

The Blue Jays’ season opener is scheduled to take place on July 24 in Tampa Bay. Their home opener is scheduled for July 29 against Washington.

On Thursday, Premier Doug Ford said the province has given the green light to a plan that would see the Blue Jays play home games at the Rogers Centre this summer.

Tory said the plan, which still needs federal approval, includes 150 pages of rules that teams must follow to keep members of the public safe.

""I can't say that I've read all 150 pages but I do know our medical officer of health and the provincial medical officer and the federal people have all looked at it and met about it extensively, including meetings with players,"" Tory told CP24 on Friday.

Tory said ""extensive efforts"" will be made to make sure the players are not in contact with the public at large and there will be ""extensive disinfection efforts.""

""The basic routine for players will be you get off the plane at the airport, you get testing much more rigorous than is applied to any private citizen or anyone else crossing the border... you transport yourself in a private bus to the hotel, you stay in the hotel, you play the game, you get back on the bus, and you leave,"" Tory said.

""Baseball is taking it very seriously. The visiting teams will take it very seriously. Do they want to get sick themselves? Do they want to make other people sick? Do they want to have the entire season end up getting shut down because somebody didn't follow the rules?""

Some opponents of the plan have been critical about the fact that travel exemptions are being made for baseball players at a time when COVID-19 cases continue to surge in parts of the United States.

Tory said the city's own medical officer of health has identified the risk posed by players as ""very, very low.""

""These are mature adults who I think understand that there is a lot at stake here. I just think this is a bit of a manufactured controversy,"" the mayor said.

""There are 200,000 people coming back and forth across the border every day and they have way less in the way of rules.""

Tory noted that if it comes to light that players aren't following the rules, he will take action.

""People do not need to think that somehow this was a decision that was made in a cavalier manner and for myself, I wouldn't have said yes to it if our medical officer of health hadn't been comfortable,"" he said.

""If she comes to me and says it is not safe anymore because people are not following the rules, I will have no hesitation for my part to phone the Blue Jays and say this is over.""

'These are the most conspicuous people in town'

Infectious disease expert Dr. Isaac Bogoch told CP24 on Friday that he is ""optimistic"" this type of plan can be successful.

""It may very well be an opposing player comes in and they may very well have COVID-19. Is this going to trigger an outbreak in the general community? I think the probability of that is extraordinarily low,"" he said.

""If you come in via private plane, take your private transport to your hotel, which is right attached to the field and you don't go outside of those areas... you are not going to give this infection to anyone else except those who may be in that quarantine with you.""

Bogoch noted that the players will be ""under a microscope"" while they are in the city.

""If someone leaves the hotel and is walking around and having a beverage on a patio somewhere, it is going to be all over the press, it is going to be all over social media. These are the most conspicuous people in town,"" he added.

"" I really think that if it is approved, I'm pretty confident that people will adhere to the quarantine and if they don't they are going to face a significant penalty.""",This is a bit of a manufactured controversy:' Tory says he's confident MLB players will follow the rules,3,0.26766037224015604

1382,"SUDBURY -- Test results from samples taken from Ramsey Lake in Greater Sudbury have confirmed the presence of blue-green algae, Public Health Sudbury & Districts announced Friday.

The samples, taken July 14, were tested by the Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks, who advised the health unit of the presence cyanobacteria, the technical term for the bloom.

""The samples contained a species of cyanobacteria that can produce toxins,"" Public Health said in a news release.

Blue-green algal blooms could also appear in other parts of the lake because blooms are not anchored. That means they can move from one location to another through wind and water action.

""New blooms can also form,"" the release said. ""All residents on lakes should look for blooms in their area.""

Pea soup appearance

Blue-green algal blooms have an unsightly pea soup appearance and foul smell, and can produce toxins. Residents should avoid using or drinking water from areas where blooms are visible.

The highest concentrations of toxins are usually found in blooms and scum on the shoreline. These dense accumulations pose the greatest potential risks to people and pets. The algae toxins can irritate a person’s skin and, if ingested, cause diarrhea and vomiting. If a person ingests high levels of toxin, they could suffer liver and nervous system damage.

If you see a bloom near your property or water intake line:

- Avoid using the water for drinking, bathing, or showering, and do not allow children, pets, or livestock to drink or swim in the bloom.

- Be aware that shallow drinking water intake pipes can pump in blue-green algae.

- Do not boil the water or treat it with a disinfectant, like bleach, because it breaks open the algae cells, which releases more toxins into the water.

- Do not rely on water jug filtration systems as they may not protect against the toxins.

- Avoid cooking with the water because food may absorb toxins from the water during cooking.

- Follow the Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Park Guide to Eating Ontario Fish. Exercise caution with respect to eating fish caught in water where blue-green algal blooms occur. Residents should not eat the liver, kidneys, and other organs of fish.

""On lakes and rivers where blue-green algal blooms are confirmed, people who use the surface water for their private drinking water supply may wish to consider an alternate, protected source of water,"" the release said.

A well-placed source with the club told the Toronto Sun that team officials continue to meet daily with all three levels of government, an optimistic development in the pursuit of clearance.

But as of Thursday afternoon, there was still work to be done with the feds to clear the path for games to be played at the Rogers Centre.

The team does appear to be inching closer to approval, however, as several reports Thursday said the Ontario government had given its blessing on the Jays bid.

The team had received approval to hold training camp at the dome under the condition that a strict quarantine be maintained. To that end, the team has been housed in the Marriott hotel attached to the Rogers Centre with players and coaches agreeing not to leave the building.

OTTAWA - A top Canadian government health official says the Toronto Blue Jays' revised plan for home games is improved, but that there are still concerns about the proposal.

Dr. Howard Njoo, Canada's deputy chief public health officer, says the consequences of the Blue Jays' and visiting teams' travelling across the border regularly during the 60-game season remains an issue.

Njoo says the Blue Jays have made adjustments to their original proposal, which didn't call for a modified quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Under the current plan, the Blue Jays and visiting teams will stay in a hotel connected to Rogers Centre, as the Toronto club is doing currently during training camp.

Still, Njoo says the federal government is more comfortable with the NHL model.

The NHL's plan sees 24 teams arrive in Toronto and Edmonton later this month, with all players and staff being isolated from the general public. The teams won't leave Canada until they finish play.

Njoo says talks with the Blue Jays are ongoing.

The Blue Jays' season opener is July 24 at Tampa Bay. The home opener is July 29 against the Washington Nationals.

Toronto Blue Jays manager Charlie Montoyo says he is not going to rush pitcher Chase Anderson back to action.

The Blue Jays announced Sunday that Anderson was day-to-day with an oblique injury he suffered while warming up prior to a recent batting practice.

Anderson was projected to be on Toronto's opening five-man rotation, but Montoyo said Wednesday that now seems unlikely.

“You know how that goes with side stuff. You've got to be careful not rushing somebody,” Montoyo said. “So right now at this moment I don't see him starting the season, but he's progressing very well.

The Blue Jays acquired Anderson in a Nov. 4 trade with Milwaukee in one of several off-season moves to shore up their pitching. Anderson went 8-4 with a 4.21 earned-run average in 32 appearances last season, including 27 starts. He had 124 strikeouts and allowed 50 walks.

It remains to be seen who will fill in to join ace Hyun-Jin Ryu in the Blue Jays starting rotation, with Matt Shoemaker, Tanner Roark and Trent Thornton considered the front-runners for three of the spots when the 60-game season begins July 24 at Tampa Bay.

Pitching coach Pete Walker has said top prospect Nate Pearson is in a battle to break camp in the rotation, but Montoyo said other options are in play.

“That's the good thing about building so many guys is we've got options. We've still got a week to decide that. They've all have a chance. They're all competing and they're going to have a couple more starts before we start the season.

“Openers are always on the table. But we're building enough guys that I'm not worried about that right now.”

While there is some fluidity in the Jays potential starting rotation, the closer role is locked down by the reliable Ken Giles. The six-foot-three right-hander is coming off a solid 2019 season that saw him put up 23 saves in 24 opportunities while carrying a 1.34 earned-run average through 53 innings of work.

“It's great. As a manager having a closer, that when you have the lead you have a pretty good chance to win, that makes any manager's life better,” Montoyo said. “I'm really happy to have Giles at the end of the games.

Montoyo said unlike last season, the Jays have the arms to take on closing duties when Giles is not available. He listed recent signings Anthony Bass and Rafael Dolis, as well as Canadian Jordan Romano, as candidates for spot closing duty.

Montoyo also said 21-year-old shortstop Austin Martin is adjusting well to life in a major-league training camp, but preached patience with the fifth-overall pick in the 2020 Major League Baseball draft.

“He hasn't done anything since the college baseball season ended, so we're not going to rush this kid,” Montoyo said.

OTTAWA -- Canada's deputy public health officer says the federal government would be having “a different conversation” with the Toronto Blue Jays about playing regular-season games at Rogers Centre if the United States and Canada were at similar stages in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic.

Dr. Howard Njoo said Tuesday that discussions are ongoing between the Canadian government and the Major League Baseball team, but he said the issue of having American-based teams continually crossing the U.S.-Canada border makes talks about hosting regular-season games “a totally different ball game” than the approved plan to allow the Jays to hold training camp at their home facility.

Njoo said the federal, Ontario and Toronto governments were comfortable with the measures the Blue Jays put in place to safely train as a team at Rogers Centre.

However, on the issue of crossing the border, he said Canada is in a different place than the U.S. with regards to COVID-19 “from a pure epidemiological point of view.”

Njoo said while Canada typically records around 300 new COVID-19 cases daily, the United States records over 60,000 cases per day.

The Jays have stated their preference is to play at Rogers Centre and their alternatives are either TD Ballpark in Dunedin Fla., in the middle of a coronavirus hot spot, or Sahlen Field in Buffalo, which is not considered up to major-league standards.

Toronto Blue Jays infielder Travis Shaw has apologized for a series of tweets where he criticized COVID-19 rules and the team's plan to enforce a closed environment at Rogers Centre and adjoining hotel should their Major League Baseball season be played in Toronto.

Shaw told reporters on a Zoom conference call that he was “a little tone deaf” with the tweets last Friday that were “out of frustration” and that he took responsibility for them and didn't want them to become a distraction.

“I apologize for that, at no point was I saying I was going to break the rules or we're going to break the rules,” Shaw said. “We know as a team that's not an option and to get through this season, everybody is going to have to buy in and everybody is going to have to adhere to whatever protocols we're set under.”

He noted if other teams don't follow public-health guidelines, the season may be derailed in any case.

Shaw had raised concerns about the length of time players may need to stay in their current environment. He replied to a tweet from TSN reporter Scott Mitchell, who reported that multiple sources told him players could face a $750,000 fine and potential jail time if seen outside the ballpark - which also are the same maximum punishments in the Quarantine Act.

“We were told two weeks... not all summer... all summer is a bit much,” Shaw tweeted.

In an email reply, the club said arriving in Toronto, players understood the maximum penalties for leaving the Rogers Centre footprint during camp.

“The rules have kind of changed a little bit from when we first got up here, it was the first I was hearing about that we could be possibly be in here all summer,” Shaw said, adding he should've chosen his words differently.

He explained he'd rented a place one block from the Rogers Centre and had looked forward to taking walks by the water to get away from the game. Living in a hotel was not an ideal situation, he said.

Shaw said Blue Jays management - president Mark Shapiro and general manager Ross Atkins - spoke to players on Saturday about the situation.

“I was a little bit tone-deaf to the situation, I should have said what I said, should have worded it a little bit differently,” Shaw said. “I apologize for that, take full responsibility.”

The Blue Jays are training in Toronto while figuring out where to play this coming season as the shortened 60-game schedule starts in less than two weeks.

Ottawa has given the ball club the green light to hold training camp in Toronto, but hasn't made a call on games. No fans will be in the stands.

The Buffalo News reported over the weekend the club had checked in with that city about playing in that city, usually the home of the their triple-A club. Blue Jays officials have said Dunedin, Fla., the club's spring-training facility, is the most likely venue for home games if the team can't play in Toronto.

For his part, Shaw said he and his teammates are hopeful Toronto is the club's home this season.

He noted that weather and the COVID situation in Florida means that Dunedin would put the Blue Jays at a competitive disadvantage.

The Blue Jays are slated to open the season July 24 at Tampa Bay. The home opener is July 29 against the Washington Nationals.

Shaw said he doesn't foresee opting out of the 2020 season, given he was looking to this year as a bounce-back season on a one-year contract after an admittedly poor 2019.

Meanwhile, Blue Jays manager Charlie Montoyo said right-hander Chase Anderson is day-to-day with an oblique strain.

Anderson was projected to be a member of the Blue Jays' five-man starting rotation.

TORONTO - Blue Jays manager Charlie Montoyo knows where he'd like the team to play its home games this season: the friendly confines of Toronto's Rogers Centre.

Montoyo was asked on Saturday about reports that the Blue Jays are investigating playing their home games in Buffalo, N.Y., normally the home of their triple-A affiliate, as a way of navigating ongoing border and quarantine restrictions put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The reports came after two players tweeted that spending all season in quarantine when in Toronto would present significant challenges.

“They're focused on getting ready to play, wherever that is,” said Montoyo. “Of course, we're all hoping it's here. We love this city, we love Toronto, and we're hoping it's going to be here.”

Spring training is being held at Rogers Centre in downtown Toronto, with players having to undergo regular tests for the novel coronavirus. The players are staying at the hotel inside the stadium.

Major League Baseball has released a shortened 60-game schedule that is set to begin in less than two weeks and the Blue Jays are the only team that does not yet have a firm home field. The federal government gave the green light for the Blue Jays to hold training camp in Toronto, but has not made a decision on games.

The Blue Jays open the season July 24 at Tampa Bay. The home opener is July 29 against Washington.

“We're going to have spring training (in Toronto) which is great news for all of us because this is the safest place you can be right now, that's why I'm so happy we're here right now,” said Montoyo.

Several media outlets reported on Friday that Blue Jays players and staff had been warned that if they were caught outside of their bubble on the streets of Toronto during camp that they could face a potential $750,000 fine and potential jail time, which are listed as penalties under the federal government's Quarantine Act.

Infielder Travis Shaw, who signed with the Blue Jays as a free agent in December, tweeted his displeasure at potentially spending an entire summer inside the stadium.

“We were told two weeks ... not all summer ... all summer is a bit much,” he said. “All summer isn't going to happen. Not an option.”

Outfielder Randal Grichuk replied to Shaw's tweet.

“I wanna make it clear, we're not asking for special treatment,” said Grichuk. “We understand that we need to stay in a 'quarantine bubble.' We wanna make sure everyone is safe. The toughest part is them not allowing our family to come with us. That's what makes it tough for a lot of guys.”

In an email reply, the club confirmed that before arriving in Toronto, players understood the maximum penalties for leaving the Rogers Centre footprint during camp.

Montoyo said he spoke with Shaw earlier Saturday and that the infielder claimed that what he said came out wrong.

First baseman/designated hitter Rowdy Tellez also addressed media on Saturday and he said that where the team plays its home games is not top of mind as the Blue Jays rush to prepare for the season.

“I don't think anybody's really focused on that right now,” said Tellez. “I just think we're focused on being the best team we can be.

“I don't think that's in anybody's mind right now. We're just trying to play some ball.”

In a press briefing this afternoon in Chatham, Ont., Ford said that after discussions with federal, provincial and municipal health officers, the province is giving the team approval to play “even if it's in an empty stadium.""

The remarks come after Ontario's Minister of Heritage, Sport, Tourism and Culture Lisa MacLeod told TSN Radio 1200 in Ottawa on Thursday that the plan had been given a nod.

In the interview, Macleod did acknowledge that there are some concerns with U.S. teams crossing the border during the pandemic.

“There will be significant testing and there will be obviously, just as we've done with the other professional sports, high-grade sanitation level of cleanliness that's required,” Macleod told TSN Radio 1200.

Some critics have questioned whether it’s appropriate to make travel and other exceptions for professional sports teams, especially in light of the fact that the U.S. is still far from bringing the pandemic under control.

Toronto Mayor John Tory commented on the announcement this afternoon at a press briefing and said there are strict rules in place to ensure everyone remains safe.

“There is one of the most extensive protocols I’ve ever seen to provide for keeping people safe in the City of Toronto, and all around the Rogers Centre, and to keeping players safe and keeping residents safe as well,” Tory said. “...And if that is the case then I don’t know why we wouldn’t be happy to see our Blue Jays, Canada’s team, Toronto’s team playing in their own home stadium.”

Although the provincial government has given the plan the green light, the federal government still has to approve it, as well as the Blue Jays and Major League Baseball.

The Public Health Agency of Canada says in a statement that the federal government is still reviewing the Blue Jays' and Major League Baseball's plan for regular season games.

I’ve known her for years. She’s sweet and helpful as one girlfriend to another. But with men, she’s weak and a magnet for those who just use her.

She’s caught several sexually transmitted infections because she never protects herself and doesn’t ask any questions of her sex partners.

Her parents, living out-of-town, don’t have a clue about her behaviour. She confides in me like a big sister because I’m a few years older.

Dear Readers: The impact of overindulging in high-sugar and fattening foods when young, to the point of becoming obese, can cause years of a poor self-image while growing up, and health problems that can last a lifetime. The following are readers’ commentaries about a mother’s deep and personal concerns over her teenagers’ love of sweets (June 23):

Reader No. 1: Being overweight myself for many years I know the toll on one’s self-esteem, and how it undermines self-confidence.

Yet, I was extremely active and mostly ate a well-balanced diet all my life.

Although my feelings of low esteem were almost always brought on by weight-related comments, I indulged in sweet comfort foods.

Unfortunately, I was genetically programmed to be short and dumpy. I didn’t choose to be short and dumpy.

During my teens and early 20s, I felt the weight on my shoulders all the while friends, relatives and, to a degree later, my husband and also the culture that said I must be weak-willed.

I now know that I’m a smart, intelligent woman who could’ve achieved much if I hadn’t lived with the weight disapproval of others, both personal and professional.

Today, I finally accept myself as I am. I eat a very healthy diet, try to exercise and don’t waste a minute thinking I cannot do something because I’m overweight.

I’d definitely encourage a healthy diet for everyone, just not at the expense of the overweight person.

I’d also encourage an active lifestyle but again not at the expense of the overweight.

I’d encourage people to learn/understand what is actually in their food and also how the big money-making food corporations have added to the problem.

Reader No. 2: In today’s world we are very aware of racism of any kind, as indeed we should be.

However, this doesn’t necessarily include all discrimination against others whom we believe to be different from ourselves. This is the discrimination against being overweight!

People feel perfectly free to discuss someone’s weight in the most derogatory manner. Even medical doctors can be offenders.

I realize that they’re concerned about the physical health of the patient but it doesn’t give them the right to imply weakness of character, or low intelligence of the patient, or any other comment that’s degrading to the person.

Crafts like knitting keep our hands and minds busy and can be therapeutic, says Amelia Lyon, who owns Yarns Untangled, a knitting shop in Kensington Market.

It’s not uncommon for customers to come into the shop looking for ways to relax and de-stress, says Lyon, who has had customers stop in because a therapist or friend prescribed it. “It can help relax you, the repetitive action of your hands, the same one or two stitches over and over. Some days I get wound up and I realize it’s because I haven’t knit in a little while. I pick up my needles and calm right down.”

From knitting to folding origami or updating old furniture with paint, here are some crafts to help you pass the time and feel a little more relaxed — using stuff you probably have at home or can easily get at a local shop with curbside pickup.

Keep little hands occupied with origami

All you need is paper and a little patience to make simple origami creations. There are countless shapes to fold paper into; the paper crane may be the most well-known design of the age-old Japanese art. It’s a great craft to keep kids entertained and, as an added bonus, it requires minimal materials and makes very little mess.

Any type of paper can be cut into a square and used to fold origami, says Jocelyn Tamura, a student at the University of Toronto and member of UTFold, an origami club whose community projects include an origami program at the Hospital for Sick Children. Origami is a way for patients to relax, says Tamura, who hosts workshops that patients and their families can attend before or after appointments.

“It requires focus and distracts from any other thoughts or worries related to their hospital visit; it’s similar in some ways to meditation,” says Tamura. “Instead of focusing on the breath, we focus on the folds of the paper. It’s surprised me how much it can help young children, who may start off in a bad mood and leave far happier and calmer.”

If you don’t have origami paper on hand, it’s easy to make your own squares. A typical A4 size sheet of paper works perfectly. Help younger children get started by cutting paper into squares and try models beforehand to make sure the difficulty level is appropriate. Tamura recommends choosing simple models like animals and paper airplanes to start.

There are lots of how-to videos online but, for inspiration, look to Oriland, an online paper fantasyland of origami creations run by internationally recognized artists Katrin and Yuri Shumakov from Toronto. Learn origami, find 70-plus free design diagrams and instructions on basic folds. The couple have written over 30 books about origami and created more than 800 unique designs.

Jump on the dried flower trend

It’s no secret that flowers are a great pick-me-up, but fresh flowers don’t last forever, which could be one of the reasons dried flowers are making a comeback.

“Dried flower arrangements now make up about one-third of our business” says Shannon Whelan, a floral designer and owner of Euclid Farms in Toronto. “The idea of buying something that you can enjoy, and will also dry and last, definitely makes sense,” says Whelan. “If a bouquet doesn’t sell I can hang them upside down and dry them.”

It’s easy to do yourself. All you need are fresh flowers and string. After you’ve enjoyed the flowers, tie string around the stems and hang them upside down so they are spaced apart. Keep them out of direct sunlight and humidity, and leave them to dry until the base of the flower head is strong and brittle, about two to four weeks.

A good rule of thumb is to choose blooms with a woody stem and avoid flowers that hold a lot of water, like tulips, which have thick, watery stems that won’t dry well and end up mouldy, says Whelan. Opt for heartier stems like roses, hydrangea varieties like Annabelle, or eucalyptus.

Get creative arranging dried blooms in vases, jars or other containers that you have around the house. A quick search online will yield project ideas and video tutorials, from making a wreath to something as simple as filling a cloche with leftover dried flower heads. “People are buying gold hoops to use as wreath frames and only decorating one small portion of it, and it becomes this really interesting hanging element,” says Whelan.

Learn how to knit

Anyone can learn to knit, says Lyon of Yarns Untangled, which offers small-run, hand-dyed yarn suited to Toronto’s knitting and crochet community. “I have yet to find somebody that I can’t teach to knit, if they want to learn. It just takes the right combination of tools and the right teacher, video or instruction,” says Lyon, who learned to knit as a child.

Beginners should learn the basics by focusing on smaller projects like a mug cosy or coaster, before moving on to bigger projects like a sweater or blanket, says Lyon. “A lot of people start with a scarf, but these days we’ve been gently steering people away from that, because they take a really long time. The beginning of your project is going to look like you were learning, but by the end it will look smooth.”

Stick to an acrylic blend yarn when starting out; it’s inexpensive and a basic approachable material, says Lyon. She also steers beginners away from traditional straight needles to circular needles, which are more versatile and just as easy to use.

While the shop’s classes have been cancelled and weekly stitch nights have moved online due to COVID-19, Lyon recommends online for how-to videos or books. “Once you know the basic stitch, you can make a scarf, a hat, all kinds of different things.”

Use paint to transform old furniture

Spring is a good time to get outside and start a paint project. Whether it’s an old chair or table in need of sprucing up, or painting terracotta pots — perfect for the kids — painting can be a relaxing and satisfying DIY.

“It’s wonderfully soothing to pick up a paintbrush,” says Annie Sloan, an artist and inventor of Chalk Paint by Annie Sloan. Her first flagship shop opened its doors in Toronto last spring.

“Finding a creative outlet can make a huge difference to one’s well-being during these worrying times. If you are able to get your hands on a tin, then now’s the time to start painting those walls or transforming a piece of furniture,” says Sloan.

If you’ve got a little leftover paint from a past project, try adding a stripe or two to jugs and vases, or stencil trays and tables: the simplest splashes of colour and pattern can breathe fresh life into your home and can also be a great way to keep children occupied.

Get creative with some fruit and vegetable printing. “It’s not just for potatoes,” says Sloan. “Try using some lemons, limes, peppers, okra or whatever you have available in the kitchen, to add some fun prints to napkins or an old tablecloth.”

1404,"SUMMERLAND, B.C.—The three Lekhi siblings drove from the crack of dawn Tuesday from Vancouver over a mountain pass to reach their family home in Summerland, where they were born and raised.

But when they reached the driveway, it didn’t feel like home anymore. The night before, their parents who live in the house alone heard the smash of rocks coming through their windows and called the police.

When Ramesh and Kiran Lekhi surveyed the damage, it was worse than they could’ve imagined. There was a red swastika, curse words and lewd images of penises all along the front and side of their home.

Overnight, swastikas were also spray painted on a bandshell in nearby Memorial Park, but no other private homes were reportedly targeted.

“The saddest part is that my mom didn’t even know what the swastika was and what it meant,” said 32-year-old Shivali Lekhi, who works as a respiratory therapist at BC Children’s Hospital.

“To explain what it means and for her to comprehend it means they hate the colour of our skin. It made her so scared. I don’t know how we can protect our parents since we don’t live here,” she told the Star.

That was when Marty Van Alphen, a longtime family friend and city councillor, interrupted to say, “Your parents can call me anytime. I’ll be here in a flash,” putting his arm around Shivali.

Over at the front of the house, her mother was sitting in a circle of friends and famly members, wiping tears from her face. Someone had brought a carafe of coffee and was pouring out cups for people to drink.

Her oldest son declined an interview, saying he was too angry to speak.

But the youngest sibling, Abhishek Lekhi, who had just graduated from the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, stood defiantly in front of the swastika graffiti.

“There’s vandalism that happens and then there is hate crime. What they drew here represents a lot of hate and racism and made us fearful. For someone to come to our home while our parents were inside shows that hate is real,” the 23-year-old told the Star.

His parents had immigrated to Canada from east India in the 1970s, working various jobs in the Okanagan Valley before buying a piece of farmland to grow apples and cherries. For decades since, Ramesh has managed the farm, while Kiran works as a fruit packing house supervisor.

Ramesh appeared calm, as he studied the swastika on the house where he had raised his children, and pointed out the hole a rock made in a bedroom window and where a rock was still lodged in a living room window frame. Luckily, he and his wife weren’t in either room at the time.

“What can you do, about these kind of people? Whatever comes … I will stay in this house. We’re not going to go,” he said.

Summerland mayor Toni Boot, who is the first Black mayor in the town’s history, spent the morning at the home and said she will convene an urgent meeting of the city council to discuss how they will respond.

“This is not just targeting one family. It is targeting our East Indian community and our town as a whole. Regardless of our backgrounds, we all have to band together to tell people this is not okay,” she told the Star.

Sgt. Dave Preston, of the Summerland RCMP detachment, said police are investigating the two vandalism incidents as suspected hate crimes.

“Because this is not something we’ve seen here before in Summerland, that makes it much more concerning,” he said. “We are asking if anyone who has information to give us a call.”

Abhishek and his brother plan to stay in the house to support their parents for as long as they can.

“We will repair the broken windows and get down this spraypaint as soon as possible. I can’t even look at it for very long. It just brings so much heartache.”

With the support of their neighbours and friends, Abhishek thinks the home will be a safe place for them again.

“There are people who hate people like us, and think people of different colours and religions don’t belong … but we have to come together. Who we are should enrich us and not split us apart.”

1407,"Dear Amy: When I was growing up, I never saw my parents or their friends socialize along with their children.

My parents always had friends their own age, and so did the children.

In the last 30 to 40 years, I have watched my siblings, nieces and nephews, and even my friends socializing with their children.

They have even brought their young children to parties where there would be a lot of bad behaviour going on.

I don’t understand this phenomenon. Is it because it makes these parents feel younger, or was there some kind of loneliness in their youth?

What could they possibly talk about with these kids, having such an age difference?

Beyond Curious

Dear Curious: It is safe to say that parents did a lot of things when you were growing up that they don’t do now (my father used to send me to the store on my bike to buy his cigarettes).

When you were growing up, the majority of households had one parent who was more or less a full-time parent. This parent spent a lot of time with the children, and so when there was an opportunity to spend time with adults, the parents hired a babysitter.

A recent (pre-pandemic) finding from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics states that in American households with married parents, 64% of these families have both parents who are employed.

Parents now seem to have integrated their children more into their adult lives, and are also much more engaged in the lives of their children than were parents in previous generations. (Did your folks attend your school events?)

A higher proportion of parents are in single-parent working households now. These parents include their children in adult activities sometimes out of guilt, and sometimes necessity.

Many parents don’t feel comfortable leaving the children with a babysitter, unless the person is a family member.

Childcare is expensive, and hard to come by. Fewer teenagers babysit (perhaps because they are all at cocktail parties with their parents).

Dear Amy: My spouse and I socialize with a group of about 12 people, several times a year.

One person in the group, “Jon,” is quite outspoken on all issues.

We purposely avoid discussing politics, but Jon can overreact regarding many different social issues and current events.

Jon will assert his opinion, but when someone else brings up an opposing view, Jon gets vocal, sometimes shouting, calling people sophomoric names, gesticulating, and often – and repeatedly — telling others that if they don’t like the way things are right now, they are welcome to leave the country.

He drowns out any opposing conversation. The host and hostess are silent during these episodes.

This situation is extremely unpleasant and ruins the evening because everyone feels extremely uncomfortable.

How do you suggest we handle these events and/or this person? We are considering declining future invitations, even though we enjoy the rest of the group.

Frustrated

Dear Frustrated: I’m not sure why none of the other 11 adults at the table don’t step in to ask “Jon” to display courteous and adult behaviour.

We parents are forever telling our children to stand tall against bullies, and yet here you are saying you would stay home rather than ask someone you are dining with to change his tone and convey even minimal manners.

One or both of the hosts should step in when this is happening to say, “Jon, you’re a guest here. Please lower your voice, and I’d appreciate it if you didn’t insult people at our table.”

Furthermore, if you are at a group event in the future and Jon behaves this way (and you genuinely believe he has ruined the evening), you should tell him so, either in the moment or afterward, when you can choose your words carefully: “Jon, last night you shouted at your friends and insulted several of us. Your behaviour ruined the evening for me. This is not the first time. You don’t seem to enjoy these get-togethers, and I know I don’t enjoy them when you behave that way.”

Dear Amy: I vehemently disagree with your terrible advice to “Teacher,” who ignored her parent’s “bigotry” at family gatherings.

I could not believe that you told this woman to openly disrespect her 80-year-old parents – at their own home!

1408,"This is the second in a week-long series on dieting and weight loss for 2020. Next up: How to eat like you’re in the Mediterranean, in Toronto

Diets are so last year.

That’s the message a lot of registered dietitians are hoping to get out there, in hopes of convincing people not to embark on a new diet — any new diet — as a New Year’s resolution. Why not? Because nutrition experts are trying to encourage people to give “lifestyle management” a shot instead.

“The idea of following a diet is something we’ve been walking away from for a very long time,” explains Joanne Lewis, director of healthcare provider education and engagement at Diabetes Canada. “In fact, we try very hard not to use the word ‘diet’ anymore, because changing behaviour is not something that comes easily to people in general, since humans adopt their eating habits over time. It’s not something we can just flip a switch and easily change.”

That’s one reason most diets tend to fail the vast majority of people. One registered dietitian recently told me the average time people stick to a diet is about 30 days — and three months is a real success story. It might be thrilling to radically change-up your diet and feel like you’re really making a difference — at first. However, big changes don’t tend to survive the first high-stress period at work, or the first family vacation.

Worse, perhaps, is the fact that diets are a one-size-fits-all solution, as opposed to a plan for change based on an individual’s tastes, needs and limitations (be they time or money). At its best, lifestyle management begins with a solid assessment of your actual lived life to see what can be changed and what cannot. When done in a clinical setting to help a person dealing with, say, an obesity-related illness, it’s called a “lifestyle intervention,” meaning the patient has outside help, like a coach or nutritionist. Lewis says it’s not impossible to do on our own, although she strongly suggests people enlist friends or family to support lifestyle changes.

“To start off, before you change anything, just write down everything that you consume every day for a few days, making sure to include a weekend in there,” she advises. “People are much more successful when they start keeping a food diary and really look at it. The reality is most people know what they should be doing but don’t know where to start. They can start to see where they can make changes when it’s all laid out in front of them.”

From there, a lifestyle coach would suggest starting with one small change that can be made relatively easily. Lewis uses the example of starting to eat breakfast, if, say, you’re the sort of person who skips it, then becomes so hungry later that you overeat. Once eating breakfast is old hat, it’s time to introduce a new habit, like, for instance, taking a walk after lunch. Once you’ve mastered that, cut out that afternoon frappuccino and drink hot tea instead. The key here is to think about what needs to be done, then wade in slowly, getting used to the temperature.

That’s not nearly as sexy as plunging right into, say, the grapefruit diet, which dangles the promise of nine pounds lost over seven short days. We seem to fall for these diets time and again, mainly because we’re not satisfied with gradual weight loss.

“I think you don’t notice gaining two or three or four pounds in one year, but then, you know, cumulatively, after say five years, you start to notice it,” says Lewis. “And then one day it hits you. Nothing fits and then you want to go back to where you were five years ago right away, not realizing that it took you five years to put the weight on in the first place.”

In a 2006 book, Mindless Eating, Dr. Brian Wansink suggested we’d all be better off if we could get used to the idea of taking weight off slowly (the way we put it on in the first place) instead of being determined to take it all off at once. He says gradual weight loss is much easier, since our bodies fight against low-calorie deprivation diets by going into “conservation mode” — making it harder to burn fat. Add to that Wansink thinks there’s a limit to the amount of self-denial we can handle, especially in an environment where our willpower is constantly tested by an abundance of readily available snacks and a constant barrage of food porn. And he was writing before everyone Instagrammed their breakfasts.

For Wansink, the key is to skip the deprivation and, instead, focus on cutting out the mindless eating — finishing off the last slice of pizza just because it’s there, grabbing a donut to break up the day, or grazing on post-dinner snacks while binge-watching a TV series. That’s how we put the weight on — 100 or 200 calories per day that we never even realized we were eating — so, Wansink reasons that’s also the best way to take it off.

That fits in perfectly with lifestyle management — a diet you don’t even know you’re on. It starts with paying attention, then becomes a lifestyle when you reform most of the bad, mindless habits, and swap in good ones instead. This includes not just diet, but also physical activity, which could be something as small as getting up from your desk every once in a while. And not for a snack.

Best of all, unlike the grapefruit diet, it’s sustainable. And the new mantra in nutritional advice is quickly becoming: “If you can’t do it for the rest of your life, don’t do it at all.”

1412,"Editor’s note: This week features a special Gen Z edition of #MillennialMoney.

At 19, third-year nursing student Priya faces a lot of uncertainties about her future. In the back of her mind, she’s thinking about how she’ll pay off her accumulating student loans, which are especially high because of her field.

Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, she’s been studying from her home near Milton and not from the student residences where she usually lives and pays rent.

Priya has kept her job working at a cafe throughout the pandemic, making around $1,000 a month working just weekends.

The cafe is near her family home, so before COVID-19 she took transit to and from school Friday afternoons and Monday mornings.

“When it’s good traffic, it’s about an hour one-way,” she says. Other days the commute could take an hour and a half to two hours, twice a week. “That’s around three hours of my time that I could be studying or having some time to myself between constant studying, school, classes and work,” she says.

That’s why she’s hoping to purchase a car — once she gets her licence. “Once I get my G2, I want to eventually get a car, which would cut those commute times. But that also comes with insurance and gas expenses too,” she says.

On a typical school day, she’ll pack a lunch of leftovers from the dinner she cooked the night before. “I will do all my groceries for the week with my parents when I go home on the weekend and then cook for myself all week,” she says.

Now that it’s a summer, Priya is working weekdays and weekends, but she very rarely packs a lunch for her work shifts. “I usually eat food from work, for free.”

With lockdown restrictions loosened, after work she’ll hang out with friends at home, go for food, bubble tea or coffee, or watch a movie at a friend’s house to keep costs low.

Priya wants to start saving to be better prepared to tackle her OSAP when she graduates in two years, but with the hurdles of maintaining her grades, keeping a job and commuting, she needs some direction.

We asked Priya to share her daily spending to get a better idea of her financials.

The expert: Jason Heath, managing director at Objective Financial Partners Inc., shares some advice for Priya.

Priya is living pretty lean as a student with a part-time income of about $12,000 per year. She is doing all the right things now from a spending perspective by keeping discretionary spending low, packing lunch during the school year and cooking so she has leftovers. She’s lucky to be able to eat for free at work. Credit cards can be pretty enticing to other young people in her position as a means to supplement spending. She has done well to live below her means.

I note she comes home from school in order to work on the weekends. One way for her to boost her cash flow could be to find work closer to where she rents and goes to school so she can pick up a few hours of work during the week more easily without having to commute to work. Rent eats up 60 per cent of her income, so she doesn’t have much left to spare.

She has lots of OSAP student debt to pay back, but as long as she has at least 60 per cent of a full course load her loan should be interest-free. Any extra cash she can save in the interim should be deposited to a Tax Free Savings Account so whatever interest she earns is not subject to tax. An RRSP account would not be appropriate for her, as her income is so low that it is tax-free, making RRSP tax deductions useless for her right now. I would keep her savings in a TFSA or very conservative investment with little to no exposure to stocks. She could need her savings on short notice, so that does not lend itself well to riskier long-term investment options, despite the potential temptation.

When Priya completes school, OSAP repayment becomes a more enticing option for extra cash flow. This is because the potential return she can earn on saving and investing may not be as high as the interest rate on her OSAP loan, especially for conservative or even moderate risk investment options.

Once she gets her G2 licence and can drive on her own, she wants to get a car. I remember that dream myself. G2 licences were introduced partway through the year I turned 16, so my friends with early calendar year birthdays got full G licences and could drive on their own without a parent. But the reality is that cars can be a luxury for even those working and earning a good living, let alone a young person with student debt. These days, ride-sharing services make it easier to get around and avoid the monthly payments to have a car at your disposal.

Result: She spent less! Spending in Week 1: $156. Spending in Week 2: $30

How she thinks she did: “This was pretty light!” Priya says. A big part of why? Ever since she started this exercise of recording her spending it’s made her much more conscious. “I am really trying to be mindful of the money I spend now that I can see it right in front of me.”

Also, living at home since pandemic restrictions has shown her that eating meals at home and working more — as it’s summer and she’s closer to work — helps save a lot of unnecessary costs.

She does note, however, that outside of COVID-19 times she’d be spending at least $100 more a week. “I’d probably be going out a lot more, which means more on food and drinks with friends,” she says.

Take-aways: After reading Heath’s advice on finding a job closer to school Priya has decided to live at home and commute to school daily instead of paying rent for student residence. “Rent was getting expensive,” she says. After doing the math, spending more on commuting made more sense especially if she can live and eat at home. “It’ll also give me more time to slow down and do things I want to do.”

Another realization? “A car is such a luxury.” Priya admits that even though she’ll have to take public transit more, she probably can’t afford a car for at least a year.

Finally, it’s time that she opens up a savings account. “I was never taught this during school and it is important because I know I’ll have a lot to pay back,” she says. She’ll be asking her older siblings for advice on a TFSA and how she can start preparing to pay off OSAP sooner rather than later.

1416,"Oh, studying: A tedious rite of passage for all college and university students, and one that conjures up images of late nights, deep yawns and endless procrastination. Between the distractions and inevitable boredom, effective studying can feel like something you wing rather than something you master.

But – like any activity – learning to study well just requires a little practice, and some useful tips from the experts.

Chris McGrath, vice president of student success at George Brown College, says it comes down to understanding your study style, and the setting you need to optimize self-learning,

Many people have an expectation “that there’s only one way to study, or one magic approach,” says McGrath. “The reality is that everyone’s brain works differently, and we are all very diverse learners.”

“Students who are struggling to get into a pattern of effective study … should reach out to one of the academic support centres on their campus. They can provide resources to help a student orient their thinking into the type of learner they are, and they can then cascade down and contemplate some really effective behaviours that will help make study time more practical.”

That might mean adjusting the way you revise depending on the topic you’re studying, and the tools you’re using.

“If I’m reading content, I can sit on my sofa (to study),” says McGrath. “If I have to write, it has to be at a desk … and I need background noise, because it stimulates my brain activity.”

There are also other variables to consider, says McGrath, including where a student tends to study: At home, in a dorm, or – for commuter students – shared spaces like libraries or cafes.

“Campuses have abundant spaces where students can really hunker down and focus with minimal distraction,” he says. “On commuter campuses I encourage (students) to think about finding a good spot on campus and accessing that space part of their regular schedule, and I encourage them to leverage their commute time (to study).”

For these students, accessing study materials in audio format may be an ideal way to review lectures or readings on the go.

Scheduling dedicated, uninterrupted study time is also an ideal strategy for those who are looking to become more efficient with reviewing course material and preparing for exams.

“The phone gets turned off, (you’re) free from distraction, in a physical environment where (you) feel comfortable and not overstimulated, and where (you) can maintain focus,” he says. “And don’t schedule anything for longer stretches than 30-minute chunks.”

That’s because our brains tend to wander after 30 minutes of intense focus, and we need to take a minute break to re-set.

“Make studying a regular habit,” adds McGrath. “Many students assume the only time they need to study is when they have a deadline but engaging in on-going review will help optimize their learning, so when deadlines approach, they don’t have to cram.”

“It’s really a test of give-and-take, and trying different techniques, but it starts with having an honest awareness of what someone’s particular approach to learning is.”",How to improve your study habits,6,0.17677987285910168
1417,"Relentless heat, ruthless squirrels, weeks without rain: the challenges of gardening have hit a surge of novice growers full force. But keen greenhorns are now gleefully reaping the fruits of their sweat-soaked, dirt-streaked labours in yards, balconies and patios.

Lorraine Johnson has never seen anything like it in three decades of growing food and native plants.

“It’s been massive,” the self-described Toronto “cultivation activist” said of the burgeoning crop of urban farmers propelled by the pandemic to take up spade and hose.

It’s all about trowel and error, as Johnson knows from the 2,200-member Facebook support group, Grow Food Toronto, she co-administers with Cheyenne Sundance and Rhonda Teitel-Payne.

The month of July brought these gardeners’ concerns to the site:

“I found these little buggers on my kale. Ewww. What are they? Aphids?”

“I have Jurassic size cauliflower leaves but no cauliflower. Is this normal?”

“If they come after my babies, any suggestions to deter raccoons??”

First-timers cover the spectrum of communities, Johnson said, citing a need for at-home activities with kids and nature, and growing awareness of food insecurity.

She hopes home-growers gain new respect for those who help feed us. That includes pollinators, the star of her latest book, “A Flower Patch for the Rusty-Patched Bumblebee,” co-written with Sheila Colla and available free as a downloadable PDF.

Here’s a sampling of fledgling food growers in the GTA:

FRONT-YARD MAGIC: No disrespect to front-lawn lovers, but Lily Cheng finds grass a waste of space. That’s why a large vegetable garden dominates the Willowdale resident’s front yard.

Now her family of four eats fresh greens every day, along with kale chips and lemon mint tea.

“The kids love mint — they just pick a piece and chew on it,” Cheng said of daughter Freesia, 5, and son Carter, 7, who pitched in from the start, helping to loosen the packed-clay soil and with irrigation.

Growing things, Cheng admits, “is a bit addictive.” But, “I like to eat. I love food.”

So her dream of a small raised bed beside the driveway “suddenly expanded” to an 18-by-12-foot space that’s home to more than two dozen kinds and colours of vegetables, plus herbs and strawberries.

Every night Cheng, who’s running a volunteer network during the coronavirus outbreak, watches videos and Googles how-tos about things like pruning and pollinating. Neighbours and Facebook connections have also offered up tools, seeds and advice.

“I feel like gardening is magical … tiny seeds become something to eat. It’s a sense of wonder for all of us,” said Cheng, who enjoys her self-care time amid the “peas” and quiet of her evening watering hour.

“They taste like tomato chips, sweet and tart,” said Vidula Monga, who came up with the novel idea to harness solar energy.

Tomatoes will be in abundance this season after her husband Deepak — making his horticultural debut — expanded the growing space in their North York backyard to 600 square feet, plus containers. Now he puts in three to four hours a day, nurturing organic hot chili peppers, basil, lettuce, kale, spinach, chives, onions, garlic. And tomatoes.

“He has literally taken over,” Vidula complained good-naturedly. “He wants to do everything by himself but I’m his wife so I have to find fault.”

Deepak, an insurance broker, said he was “just sitting around at home” after his office closed due to COVID-19. “Somehow the (gardening) bug bit me.”

He’s even extended the growing season with a small greenhouse built from a dismantled bunk bed their son had left in the garage.

The vegetarian couple is experimenting with golden berries and peanuts because “we like to eat a lot of nuts,” explained Vidula, a supply school teacher. “Back home in India, raw fresh peanuts were really good.”

They have high hopes for their purple corn — a nutritional powerhouse — planted from a cob they were given by Black Creek Community Farm where they have volunteered for three years.

“The best thing is that we eat healthy,” said Deepak. “And seeing everything growing in the backyard without chemicals from a very tiny seed — it’s very satisfying.”

IT’S EASY EATING GREEN: Lisa Quirke’s kids don’t eat vegetables. Except that they do ... now.

“I steamed and pureed zucchini then stealthily put it in their waffles. They had no idea,” confides Quirke, mom to Alex, 8, and Ben, 4.

Two recently-harvested summer squash are the “stars of the garden,” she added. “I got so excited, they’re massive, a beautiful colour.”

Their backyard was “overgrown with weeds taller than my children” when the family of four moved in a year ago, recalled Quirke, a work-from-home business analyst who always wanted a big garden.

When the lockdown happened, they sprouted seeds indoors to the delight of the boys whose zeal followed them outside for tilling, watering and unearthing worms.

Now they’re tending a thriving 200-square-foot rectangle of herbs, tomatoes, rhubarb, potatoes, peppers, carrots, radishes, onions —and one leek, said Quirke, who described herself as a “worried parent” when tiny white bugs started feasting on the serviceberry tree she planted last fall.

Growing your own food “is a wonderful thing for the kids, for the climate,” she said, adding social media groups have been generous with help and advice.

The new green thumb, who’d eventually like to share her produce with a food bank, said gardening brings other benefits, like the stress release she gets from weeding and “surprises from all the flowers” that precede the fruit.

1420,"Is this a front row anyone really wants to join?

After three days seated at my dining room table, watching what was effectively Quibi for fashion — which is to say, the first streamed digital couture “shows,” forced online by the coronavirus pandemic and transformed into bite-size nuggets that ranged from ersatz music videos to schmaltzy short films and previews for collections to come — I’m starting to wonder.

Yes, everyone gets to watch what was formerly an entirely exclusive, just-for-insiders, demonstration of fabulousness. That’s a good thing.

But honestly, give me the runway.

I never thought I would write those words. Like many, I have complained about the waste involved in fashion weeks: all those people flying around the world to sit twiddling their thumbs waiting for a show to start while ogling the celebrities across the catwalk, most of whom are dressed in full-blown evening clothes at 10 a.m., surrounded by elaborate sets made to be demolished after 20 minutes, all in the service of (in the case of the July shows) a parade of insanely expensive handmade clothes for the very few. Nero, meet your fiddle and all that.

But what this whole digital experiment ultimately revealed is that, though music and movies have been using fashion to their own ends for decades now, reversing the equation doesn’t really work.

Not even when you rope in a famous film director, as Dior did with Matteo Garrone, the Italian auteur behind “Pinocchio” and “Dogman.” And give him carte blanche to make … a mash-up of myths involving mermaids, Narcissus, satyrs, bellboys and nymphs who really, really, want to wear lamé goddess gowns and wafting, feathered coats instead of barely there bits of chiffon. Not even when you team up with a cult-y musician, like Olivier Theyskens did with Sylvie Kreusch of Warhaus, for his debut at Azzaro couture, all rhinestone siren slinkiness balanced on a knife-edge just this side of kitsch.

Not even when you get a famous actress, as Iris van Herpen did with Carice van Houten, formerly the Red Priestess on “Game of Thrones,” and have her animate a single look that plays with your sense of perception in odd angles and cuts, so it seems to grow around her body like a nimbus of rebirth.

Not even when you dress up well-known models and convince them to do awkward dancing, as if they were punk princesses at the famous Parisian disco Le Palace, while wearing bejeweled bouclé and lavishly flounced taffeta, as Chanel did.

It feels inauthentic: a copy of an idea from another creative discipline. And the problems of couture are not so much financial (most of the brands that can afford couture have enough of a cash cushion to survive the current situation and someone, somewhere, is still buying it) as existential. With the dire state of the world, what’s the point?

There’s an electricity to a live event, with its sense of shared experience and risk, that answers that question and cannot be replicated in the vacuum of the internet. There’s a specificity to a fashion show, a rhythm in the entrances and exits and struts, a duet between body and cloth, that has its own cadence and offers its own implicit thesis about the costumes IRL, which loses its force when it gets moved to an URL. It’s too easy to look away. To roll your eyes. And giggle.

Well, now we know. And it’s not actually a judgment on the clothes themselves, anyway. It’s a judgment on the context.

When is a show not really a show?

In any case, thinking of these digital shows as shows is probably wrong in the first place. They were more like a joint declaration of belief: We’re still here!

(That’s why, even though it didn’t have an actual show, Maison Margiela offered up a 48-second lava lamp of a show trailer, starring the vamping model Leon Dame suggesting the form of a longer … something … to be a revealed July 16. Ditto Valentino, which clocked in at just over a minute with its hypnotically morphing single piece of fabric/promo for a July 21 show. They wanted to show their faith in the official couture organization, even though their main events are later.)

After all, fashion, like so many industries, is in crisis as a result of the coronavirus pandemic: stores shuttered, fabric mills closed, brands declaring bankruptcy. To dare, in the face of a lockdown that separated designers from their ateliers, to create any form of a collection for public consumption is a kind of triumph: an aria of optimism into the void, a testament to imagination and ingenuity.

And in fact, the videos that revealed just that — bringing the viewer inside the creation process — were the ones that hinted at couture’s true magic. Ironically, it’s the documentaries that may actually best convey the “dream” that is couture: the handwork and humanity woven into its seams.

So while Dior’s movie was misguided escapism (verging on the objectionable, thanks to an entirely white cast, which is the dream of exactly who these days?), its opening scenes, which took place in the ateliers, were irresistible. They showcased the fact that the collection — the gold Aphrodite dress with its flowing cape, the sunburst-shirred high-collar white shirt and a pale-pink halter-neck ball gown covered in beaded branches — had actually been created in miniature, scaled down to 40 per cent of a traditional toile to create a treasure chest of a collection that will later travel the world for clients to ogle and order (full-size, of course).

Designer Maria Grazia Chiuri had been inspired by Le Théâtre de la Mode, a travelling exhibition of 150 dolls created in 1945 by designers of the day such as Lucien Lelong, Schiaparelli and Jeanne Lanvin as a way to revive couture in a post-Second World War world and rescue the fashion industry from economic ruin and emotional despair. You can understand it: what worked once, might well work again.

Especially when close-ups of the 2020 versions revealed the careful artistry of the petites mains (little hands) that made them, the camera watching an artisan painstakingly using a tiny needle to create the fringing on the hemline of the moonlit gown.

Just as it was charming, if not entirely satisfying, to look over the shoulder of Daniel Roseberry of Schiaparelli as he sat sketching away on his “imaginary collection” in Washington Square Park, near the New York apartment where he was sheltering in place, drawing tape measure straps, power shoulders and zeppelin-size balloon sleeves (for looks that will be made later this year). And to have sneak peeks from Ulyana Sergeenko and Elie Saab at the hands transforming basic materials into extraordinary embroidery for their somewhat overblown creations. Even if all the soft focus nature that followed mostly called to mind a perfume commercial.

Up close and at home

They all made me long for more such intimate experiences: not just to goggle at the flotillas of tulle and cloqué of Giambattista Valli, with their exclamation points of bows both large and small (look: a swan! and look: a white taffeta bow as big as a torso atop a white chiffon dress as tiny as Joan Smalls’ waist!) but to understand how they are constructed. Though to be fair, at least with his video, you could see the clothes instead of just the mood.

To really understand the Chanel collection, for example, which ultimately looked a whole lot better than designer Virginie Viard’s recent stabs at half-hearted casual couture, you had to eschew the live action for the static lookbook: 30 styles versus the short’s five, including some lavishly restrained midnight blue gowns and not-quite-understated armorial tweed jackets.

In any case, only Viktor & Rolf managed to capture the absurdity of the whole exercise: us, sitting in our rooms around the world, staring into small screens by ourselves, mesmerized (or not) by well-intentioned efforts to elicit asynchronous rapture.

They did it with a five-minute play in three acts titled “change” (small c, all in gold balloons) that spliced the classic department store show with today’s working-from-home ethos, with a stentorian voice-over by the singer Mika and a heavy dose of levity.

See, for example, an empire-waist sapphire satin negligee spotted with lace storm clouds to reflect “a feeling of sadness and anger familiar to many these days.” Or the pale pink chemises adorned with “contradictory emoji,” the “frantically entangled” sashes swirling around enormous bathrobe coats, and the enveloping A-line silhouettes to guarantee “you will remain in your own safe zone while venturing out into the world.”

There was a lot more like that. “If only we could change ourselves as easily as we do our outfits,” said Mika. That is, of course, the promise of all this; the beauty is that we all keep hoping.

It just seems so much more convincing from the ballroom chairs.",Were Digital Dior and Chanel any good?,6,0.043055426950175724
1424,"Roughly 150 years old, the Manhattan is easily one of the most popular and enduring cocktails of all time.

That said, its popularity has been subject to the usual ups and downs associated with drink trends and, from about 1970 to 2010, it was a little less common, since many people had turned to vodka, rum and tequila cocktails like the Margarita, Piña Colada and Cosmopolitan. And, as often happens with drinks that aren’t in regular circulation, the quality of the Manhattans started to decline as a lot of bartenders simply forgot how to make one properly.

It’s an easy drink to make—whisky, sweet vermouth, bitters, stirred over ice and served in a cold glass with or without a cherry—but a lot of things can go wrong if you don’t understand a few basics.

First, like all drinks that are made with straight spirits, it needs to be stirred, so that it doesn’t wind up watery. Second, the bitters are essential. Third, splurge on a good Amarena cherry. Fourth, vermouth goes bad relatively quickly if it isn’t stored in the refrigerator. Finally, don’t be stingy with the vermouth.

Unless, that is, you’ve left your vermouth on a counter for a month, which was exactly what happened at a lot of bars in the vodka/tequila era. On top of that, a lot of people forgot the bitters since, even though a bottle of Angostura bitters sat on the back bar of many venues like a talisman or something, few of us understood how to use them. Bitters are often called the “salt and pepper” of the cocktail world and bartenders say that, quite often, if something is just a little off on a drink and they can’t figure out what, a dash of bitters will fix it.

These problems have largely been fixed in the past 10 to 15 years, thanks to the revival of traditional methods amongst bartenders who have been bringing back the classics.

Speaking of tradition, the first Manhattans would almost universally have been made with American rye whiskey but, since we’re doing 100-mile cocktails here and supporting local distilleries, we’re using a Canadian alternative, Stalk and Barrel’s Three Barrel Whisky ($34.95; LCBO 13323). Since it’s made just north of Toronto, we named it after the distillery’s location—in Concord.

The Concord

2 oz Stalk and Barrel whisky

¾ oz Haberdasher sweet vermouth (made in Prince Edward County)

2 dashes Angostura bitters

1 Amarena cherry (for garnish)

Method: Stir all ingredients (except the cherry) together over ice in a mixing glass for 45 seconds. Strain into a chilled coupe or martini glass. Add cherry.

NOTE: If you have trouble tracking down Haberdasher, Dillon’s Vermouth (also made in Ontario) is an alternative that’s available at the LCBO. And there are plenty of Ontario craft whisky options, but we wanted to shine a light on Stalk and Barrel, the province’s oldest micro-distillery, because it’s celebrating its 10th anniversary this year.

1429,"REGINA -- COVID-19 has thrown a wrench into most of our Summer vacation plans but that doesn’t mean there aren’t some great things to enjoy right in our own backyard.

Maybe you’ve lived in Regina for years, or you have family coming into town and want to show them around. Remember that many of these places will still have restrictions in place, so it’s always best to check with the site before going to know what their rules are.

With that said, here are ten places (in no particular order) for your Summer stay-cation consideration.

WASCANA CENTRE

The obvious choice is Wascana Park. It’s often described as the jewel of the city. You can walk, run or bike the path around the lake (one way right now, due to COVID-19). Check out the wildlife. Feed the Canada Geese (just not bread, it’s bad for them! Try lettuce!)

Maybe visit the canoe and kayak club, rent a vessel, and head out on the water. There is no swimming allowed. It's a great place for exercise and relaxation!

LEGISLATIVE BUILDING

If you’re already at Wascana Park, don’t overlook the Saskatchewan Legislative Building. It was designed by Edward and William Sutherland Maxwell from Montreal and built between 1908 and 1912 in the Beaux Arts style.

The building and grounds were designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 2005. It’s also a Heritage property. In front, are the Queen Elizabeth II gardens. Redesigned each and every year, take a stroll through and look at the intricate design, painstakingly cared for by the horticultural team who spend hours designing and executing their vision. You’ll see the statue of the Queen on her favorite horse overlooking the gardens.

Inside the building, when it reopens, take a tour and see the incredible design inside the legislative building and paintings of all of Saskatchewan’s former leaders. Best part? It’s free.

RCMP Heritage Centre

RCMP officers may be from all corners of the country but they have one thing in common…They all train right here, in Regina, at the RCMP Training Academy, known as ‘Depot’ Division.

It’s the only one of it’s kind in the nation and has been training Mounties since 1885. There’s a lot of history here! Exhibits show the evolution of their uniform, guns, cars and more.

GOVERNMENT HOUSE

Built in 1891, Government House was the official residence and office fo the Lieutenant Governor until 1945. Lt. Gov. Russ Mirasty is currently the Queen’s representative in Saskatchewan.

Take a trip back in time inside the Amédée Forget Museum where you can get a glimpse of life at the turn of the 20th century or take a stroll through the Edwardian Gardens or the Sylvia Fedoruk Conservatory. Due to COVID-19, you must book your visit ahead of time.

COME FACE-TO-FACE WITH A T-REX AT THE ROYAL SASKATCHEWAN MUSEUM!

If you love history, this is the place for you! It was built in 1906 (called the Provincial Museum back then) and aimed to showcase some of the artifacts from the area.

Today, they continue that tradition, hoping to educate you about the province’s natural history and Indigenous cultures (past and present). Make sure you say 'hi' to the RSM’s famous mascot Megamunch. He was the first of it’s kind half-sized robotic T-Rex. The real draw here? Scotty the T-Rex. He was discovered here in Saskatchewan and is the world’s largest and oldest T-Rex. It’s truly captivating.

SASKATCHEWAN SCIENCE CENTRE

Love science? This is the place for you! Find a wide variety of hands on science projects for you to explore! Hockey fans test your shooting and running skills! Check out some of their explosive programs. The Sask. Science Centre is also home to the Kramer Imax Theatre, so you can see a movie on the REAL big screen, too!

FARMERS' MARKET

How about an open air experience complete with social distancing measures in place? The Regina Farmers' Market is back and operating every Wednesday and Saturday from 9:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. until October 10, offering you an array of fresh vegetables and locally produced merchandise. They’ve been doing it since 1975.

STONE HALL CASTLE

Yup. A real castle. It’s in the city. It was originally built by Francis Nicholson Darke as a fortress for his wife. There’s a lot of intrigue behind this medieval European building. Check out the solid stone compound complete with it’s basement bomb shelter…

FLORAL CONSERVATORY

Ever been told to take a second to smell the roses? You can do that here. An array of other flowers, too!

Its operated and maintained by volunteers from the Regina Garden Associates in partnership with the City.

CRAFT BEER

Here’s the thing. Regina has a tremendous craft beer scene.

No, really! At one point, Expedia said the Queen City was the fourth best beer town in Canada.

Not hard to see why once you’ve toured around the warehouse district and sampled it for yourself! Malty National, Rebellion, Warehouse Brewing, Pile o’ Bones, they’re all within biking (or walking) distance.

Enjoy, responsibly of course.",Stuck on how to spend your stay-cation? Here's some Regina activities to break the boredom,6,0.3943813314133705
1438,"Harley Sitner was in  Brooklyn for a wedding in March, feeling as if he’d just been sprayed by a skunk. Sitner’s hometown, Seattle, where he owns a camper-van restoration, repair and rental business called Peace Vans, was the site of one of one of the first huge coronavirus outbreaks. “People were like, ‘Stay away,’” he recalled. Back home, with peak road-trip season approaching, his employees reported a rush of cancellations on rental vans. Sitner had just hired a “super-awesome” marketing manager and began thinking he might have to lay her off. School was cancelled, and all but the most essential businesses were ordered to shut down. Sitner was compelled to give his employees a month off, save for a skeletal crew that stuck around to perform essential services like repairs. “We were looking at some pretty significant revenue black holes,” he said. Then, in mid-April, the phone started ringing in the repair shop. “People started thinking they’d have a summer and wanted their classic Volkswagens looked at,” Sitner said. But it wasn’t just that. There was also a run on a new line of modern camper vans his company had announced with Mercedes-Benz at the Chicago Auto Show in February: produced by a third-party manufacturer called Driverge, sleeping four apiece, and starting at $93,000 without kitchen and cabinetry, $120,000 with. “We sold like 28 of them in 30 days,” Sitner said. “Some people are saying they’re not getting on a plane for two years or never going to Europe again.” Sitner is 52, with a 10-year-old daughter named Eden Peach. In person, he projects a tender, Michael Stipe-ish vibe, wistfully remembering that “until recently, we hugged so many of our customers” and brewed espresso in the shop’s front office. He became acquainted with Peace Vans as a customer, running his Vanagon (a.k.a. the Volkswagen T3) in and out of the shop, in Seattle’s industrial SoDo neighbourhood, between jaunts to Burning Man. In 2013 he learned from the shop owner that he planned to close the business, and Sitner persuaded him to hand it over instead. Over the years, Sitner has served clientele from aging hippies to Instagramming millennials, and all political persuasions. (In the lot of Peace Vans there was an old VW bus from Iowa awaiting restoration with a National Rifle Association sticker on the driver’s-side window and a painting of the word “Peace” on the side panel.) But the venture with Mercedes, which began casually after he began buying the chassis of the brand’s Metris van from a dealership down the street, has brought a new kind of buyer, Sitner said. Ed Stevens, a 51-year-old tech entrepreneur in Dallas, had planned to take his wife, Robin, and two adult children scuba diving in the Caribbean when the pandemic took hold. The virus’s spread, he said, was the reason he started looking to buy a camper van. “We cancelled the reservation and hunkered down, and then I started thinking, ‘I can work from anywhere, Robin’s taking a class online, and we thought we’d just cruise the whole country,” he said. “As soon as I saw the official partnership between Mercedes and Harley, that was the motivating factor.” (“The idea of building on a Nissan or a Ford light van did not meet the quality bar we wanted,” Sitner said, explaining his choice of chassis.) Mark and Linda Kimlin had just spent the winter in Spain before returning to New York City in mid-March, feeling “very lucky to escape unscathed,” said Mark Kimlin, 63. But New York was itself about to get scathed, and with the lease up on their Upper East Side apartment, the Kimlins hightailed it to a home they owned in New Paltz, north of the city. (They expect to return to the city when things “settle down,” Linda Kimlin, 65, said.) Their daughter had planned to get married in California in July (the celebration has been postponed, although not the ceremony) and, Mark Kimlin said, “it seemed like a good time for wide-open spaces and not getting on an airplane.” His son-in-law-to-be had driven a simpler version of the Metris camper van and shared his positive experience with Kimlin, who bought one from Peace Vans on the strength of that recommendation and the fact that his wife “likes camping, but with a comfy bed.” Talk to any camper-van owner and they’ll tout the relatively small size of their vehicles compared to traditional RVs and the taller Mercedes Sprinter vans that many Amazon delivery drivers whiz around in, explaining that the more compact Mercedes Metris and VW Vanagons are easily usable as second cars in dense neighbourhoods in major metropolitan areas. But they’re also great for when a wildfire jumps the highway and bears down on your house — the precise scenario Naomi Neilson stared down in mid-June at her house in Shell Beach, California. “Everyone was like, ‘Where are you going to go?’ And I was like, ‘I don’t know, I’m going to take my van and go,” said Neilson, 46, who owns a Metris camper van and runs a bathroom-fixture company called Native Trails. “I just threw some food and drinks in the fridge and was ready to go. It took me 10 minutes. I went down the coast a little way and just relaxed. I didn’t end up needing to evacuate for the whole night, but it was nice to be able to just throw a couple things in there and know I had a place to sleep and cook for as long as I needed.” Of course, this is something owners of Volkswagen Vanagons have taken comfort in for decades. While Metris owners like Ed Stevens never considered buying such a lovable relic of hippie culture because he “didn’t want to be spending two days somewhere while my transmission gets shipped in from God knows where,” VW owners like Brian Kolonick of Cleveland think the hassle’s worth it because, he said, “my kids think I’m cool for a minute.” “It’s the way it smells, the way it drives, the way people look at you — you’re bringing them some level of joy,” said Kolonick, 42, who works in digital health for a company called Conversa in Portland, Oregon. He rented a Vanagon from Sitner before he bought one and said some VW scenesters turn their nose up at him because he “can’t repair things” and has to call a mechanic. He’ll often visit Vanagon forums online, where he occasionally finds diehards dissing the Subaru engines in some custom conversions, arguing that they’re “taking away from the slow-running intensity” of the stock motor. And it’s fair to surmise that some VW devotees think Metris owners are a tad soft. “We have friends who have them, and I’ve got to admit, we joke about their vans,” said Jim Samuel, 58, a real estate agent and University of Oregon grad in Seattle who named his 1991 Vanagon “Bertha,” after the Grateful Dead song. “But it comes down to people, ultimately.” Joayne Andrews agrees. A 72-year-old retiree, she lives in Cathedral City, California, just east of Palm Springs, and has owned 26 Volkswagens in her lifetime, four of them vans. A Jetta is her daily ride, but when she really wants to get away, she’s got a 2000 Eurovan at home and an ’82 Westfalia stashed in Seattle that Sitner’s crew has been restoring for the past two years. When she visits friends up and down the West Coast, she thinks her vans make her a better houseguest. “It’s nice to be able to pull into their driveway and not take up space in their house,” she said. “We’ve got our own little studio apartment.” As for the Metris campers, her neighbour has one, and Andrews thinks “they’re lovely.” She then added, “They’re superexpensive, but probably with what I had to have my van restored, I could have bought one.”","Pandemic has travellers rediscovering the open road, and camper vans",6,0.3173104658366761
1439,"""Injichaag — My Soul in Story,"" Rene Meshake with Kim Anderson, University of Manitoba Press (281 pages, $24.95 paperback) Rene Meshake is an Anishinaabek visual artist, poet and musician, and a survivor of the Indian residential schools, alcoholism and homelessness.  He collaborated with University of Guelph professor, Kim Anderson, on ""Injichaag,"" a collection of his poetry, paintings and autobiography, released last December. The two of them shared the stage Dec. 3 in a series on Indigeneity for Third Age Learning in Waterloo. He played a native flute, read a few of his poems and told stories from his life. That he was well-received is an understatement: more than 60 copies of his book were sold that day! I contacted him after the Waterloo event and we met in the art-filled living room of his Guelph home on Jan. 22, which turned out to be his 73rd birthday. There are many books now exploring the cultural genocide dealt by the Residential Schools in Canada. ""Injichaag"" is one in which the nuns in Meshake's Longlac Indian Day School failed ""to take the Indian out of the child,"" as Sir John A. Macdonald had demanded in establishing the mission of the residential schools and the Indian Act.  Meshake was blessed by having lived on the land with his grandmother (Nookomis) for his first 10 years, before entering the infamous school. And then by having a Mother Superior who was more interested in helping him discover his talents (via penmanship and art) than in eradicating his background. But he was sexually abused by a Catholic lay brother and could not rise above the shame to report his abuser. Nevertheless his twin matriarchs — grandmother and nun — were key to his survival, and a spirituality today that blends native and Catholic elements. The facts of Meshake's life are recorded in Anderson's introduction, a more linear version of the anecdotes and word reclamations that make up the rest of the book. He was born in 1948 in Nakina. His mother took him home the next day to Aroland, part of the Longlac reserve settlement near Geraldton in northern Ontario. His grandmother provided his ""bush education"" in between periods at the native schools in Aroland and Longlac. From 1955-66 he was sent to the McIntosh residential school in northwestern Ontario. This period was the peak of residential school enrolment: in all, 150,000 children were interned between the late 1800s and 1996.  Very little of his school life there is included in ""Injichaag."" Anderson explains that Meshake's feelings of shame and inferiority were consistent with the body of literature about residential school life. His poor self-esteem was worsened by the deaths of his mother in 1960 and grandmother the following year. He did manage to finish high school in Thunder Bay and, at age 18 in 1966, enrolled in graphic design at Sheridan College in Toronto. What followed graduation were years of wandering, including work as a firefighter and tree planter with his father in Geraldton, and as a graphic designer. But he was medicating his rage and depression with alcohol. He married in 1978 but left his wife and stepchildren in '83, ending up on the streets in Winnipeg for three years and then six years of homelessness and alcoholism in Toronto. The turning point, as he tells it in the story ""Eshpinadaa,"" came in 1991. He waited for a store in Chinatown to open so he could buy a jug of Chines cooking wine to share with his buddies. He looked up at the street sign for Spadina Avenue and realized it was an Anishinaabe word Shba'-dinnaa, meaning rising hills or mountaintop. ""I cried out to the Creator, Give me life or death, no matter how! Do whatever it takes! I don't give a s---!"" It was at the burial of his best friend, who had died in an alcoholic coma, where Meshake buried his past. From there he found an Anishinaabe health clinic and a social worker named Alex who mentored him into sobriety via three native healing lodges. ""So that word Eshpadinaa has been very significant on my journey. Because you worship the Creator on a high hill, on a high place. And I've been climbing the hill ever since."" He also had a dream around that time in which his ancestors told him not to be afraid of his words. This book ends with a five-page glossary, a reminder of all the Anishinaabek words he teaches the reader and reclaims for himself. It was during his recovery that Rene met Joan, a social worker, who would become his second wife. He credits her with helping him maintain his ""fast"" from alcohol and build a home together in Guelph. The recent Truth and Reconciliation payment to residential school survivors went to paying off his mortgage and investing in computers, art supplies and musical instruments.

1442,"A subway station in Singapore was transformed into a squared circle as two rats went toe to toe with a curious cat observing from ring side, a scene of mayhem that went viral online.

“I saw those two rats running and chasing each other,” said videographer Cheez Goh, who stumbled upon the bizarre bedlam while she was returning home from work in Bedok, Singapore.

Goh’s Facebook page has generated 145,000 views, depicting a scene where the rambunctious rodents, looking more like mini kangaroos because they were standing on their hind legs, adroitly exchanging blows as if they were two grapplers duking it out inside a ring.

No foreign object could be seen, but the footage takes on an even stranger dimension when a black-and-white cat enters the frame.

The feline stops to take a glimpse at the rukus.

The clip ends with the combatants scurrying their separate ways, ostensibly frightened off by the furry spectator.

However, the brouhaha reportedly continued off-screen.

“One ran away from the camera, one came toward the camera where I was standing,” added Goh, who says she “freaked out,” causing the critter to flee.

“That’s when the cat saw that the rat was running and charged toward it,” the camerawoman explains. “However, the cat missed because the rat went under the drain.”

1446,"TORONTO -- A woman who survived the novel coronavirus was met with a special surprise outside a long-term care home in Mississauga in celebration of her 102nd birthday.

Family and friends, all together for the first time in months, gathered outside Erin Mills Lodge Nursing Home on Thursday to cheer and express their love to Jovita Lee, who smiled and waved at her physically distant visitors.

“It was bitter sweet because, of course, we couldn’t get too close, we couldn’t hug her or touch her but it was just a relief to be able to see her,” Lee’s granddaughter Sarah Barnett told CTV News Toronto on Thursday.

“To see all of us together at once and to see us singing happy birthday to her, I think that really lifted her spirts and for the first time she was able to lift her head up higher and just waive to everyone.”

Lee’s fight against COVID-19 was not easy. Her family says that she and her roommate were the first two people in their long-term care home to get the disease.

Lee, who had been moved into the home only two weeks before the pandemic hit, had trouble eating and was fighting a high fever.

Despite the outbreak at the facility being over, her family says it still took a significant toll on her. Her granddaughter said Lee now needs to use a wheelchair, has trouble lifting her head and is very low energy.

Barnett describes her grandmother, who came from the Philippines to Canada in the 80s, as a fun-loving person who loves the Toronto Blue Jays, parties, dancing and being in the spotlight, and so Thursday’s surprise was the perfect one.

“She loved to dance, loved having parties. Every year, she wants a party so she could invite everyone and feed everyone,” Barnett said.

Barnett said her grandmother, who loves to be around family, had a tough few months and lost some friends at the long-term care home due to COVID-19 after 17 people died at the home.

Now, Barnett said she’s glad things are starting to look better.

“She was already in an unfamiliar place and then shortly after to not see her family at all for three months [was hard],” she said. “[Thursday] was the first time she had seen us all together since moving to the home and overcoming the virus.”",Family celebrates COVID-19 survivor’s 102nd birthday outside Mississauga nursing home,6,0.41513018601399276
1450,"Looking for an easy plant to care for? Try a succulent.

Any plant with fleshy stems or leaves is called a succulent. Aside from cacti, only a few other plant families have succulent members. All these succulents, cactus or not, are low-maintenance.

SOME NON-CACTUS SUCCULENTS

One family of non-cactus succulents is Crassulaceae, which counts among its members the familiar jade plant, which has thick stems and shiny green, fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves. After years of selective stem cutting, my jade plant has developed two thick trunks that give it the appearance of a venerable tree in miniature.

Kalanchoe is another family member, notable for the small plantlets that grow along the edges of its leaves and periodically drop off to give rise to new plants. Hence its other name: mother-of-thousands. Shortening daylight hours in fall coax out this plant's salmon-red or apricot-orange flowers, which contrast nicely with the bluish cast of the green leaves.

Sedums are yet another Crassulaceae. My burro's tail (Sedum morganianum) has braids of thick, fleshy leaves that hide its stems as they cascade over the edges of its hanging, coconut planter.

Moving on to another family of succulents brings us to the Euphorbiaceae. Milk-striped euphorbia is named for the milky line down its stem, but I think the Latin name, Euphorbia pseudocactus, is more descriptive. With thorns and upright stems off which branch ""arms,"" the plant could easily be mistaken for a cactus.

Crown-of-thorns, aside from its beautiful pink flowers, is another Euphorbia species, this one armed with spines as fierce as those of any cactus.

Not all Euphorbiaceae are succulent; poinsettia is one that's not.

The lily family, Liliaceae, is a third plant family with many succulent members. Aloe is most famous as an ingredient of hand lotions and shampoos, but the plant itself is attractive and care-free -- mine has gone whole winters without watering! Over time, it has filled its pot with whorls of thick, fleshy, lance-shaped leaves.

Sansevieria is a succulent lily with an unflattering common name: mother-in-law's tongue. Unflattering to mothers-in-law, that is, because the plant is a cluster of long, sharp leaves speckled like snakeskin.

WATERING: LESS IS MORE

An advantage and a disadvantage of succulents as houseplants is their adaptation to survive without water. If you remember to water your plants only when you're driving in your car, or if you want a living plant that needs water only slightly more often than a plastic plant, then grow succulents.

On the other hand, if you tip a glass of water on your plants every time you walk past them, you'll soon transform any succulent houseplant into a mass of brown rot. The key to caring for succulents is to hardly ever water them. Once every couple of months in winter, and a couple of times a month in summer, is sufficient. More generally, let the soil dry out between waterings.

When repotting is needed for any succulent plant, use a potting soil that drains water quickly, made so by adding equal volumes of sand or perlite to any mix used for other types of plants.

Besides their ease of care, succulents are easy to propagate. Use the leaves, stems or offshoots, letting any of these plant parts dry and heal for a few day before potting them up. Leaves that occasionally drop off my jade plant often take root just sitting on the soil.",Low-maintenance succulents make watering a breeze,6,0.11350996819836934
1452,"CHARLESTON, W.VA. -- Dig. Plant. Breathe.

As spring's arrival in the Northern Hemisphere coincides with government stay-at-home orders, the itch to get outside has turned backyard gardens into a getaway for the mind in chaotic times.

Gardeners who already know that working with soil is a way to connect with nature say it helps take away their worries, at least temporarily.

""I love to see things grow,"" Lindsay Waldrop said. ""It's incredibly therapeutic.""

Now more than ever.

Waldrop, a resident of Anaheim, California, has an anxiety disorder. Exercise is supposed to help, but her new job as a college biology professor had prevented her from getting into a routine.

Her grandfather, who introduced her to gardening by showing her how to plant seeds, died about a year ago.

Add the global coronavirus pandemic to all that, and it's easy to see where her focus is these days.

""Sometimes I just like to sit and dig holes in the quiet with my own thoughts,"" she said. ""Outside, it takes my mind off. It gives something for my hands to do. It gives you a separate problem to think about than whatever else is going on. It gets you off of social media.""

Waldrop and her husband moved last summer from New Mexico, where she didn't have much luck gardening in a scorching climate. At her new home, she got rid of the lawn, installed an irrigation system, and recently planted dozens of tomatoes, eggplant, peppers and other vegetables.

Over the years, Waldrop converted her skeptical husband, who initially wondered why digging in the dirt and moving things around was considered fun.

After tasting his first home-grown tomatoes, he was converted.

Families, too, are discovering that gardening gives cooped-up kids something to do, builds their self-esteem and brings variety to what has suddenly become a lot of time spent together.

In Miami, Annika Bolanos isn't a fan of the south Florida heat and mosquitoes. But going outdoors lately has been a lifeline.

Bolanos works at home making cakes and doing bookkeeping with her husband's golf cart business. Her three young children add an extra layer of busy, and together they've seeded a variety of vegetables and herbs.

""We have always loved the idea of growing our own food,"" Bolanos said. ""It feels good to eat something that you grew yourself too. It also helps my kids eat more fruits and veggies since they find it cool to eat what they have grown.""

Her children water the plants daily and concentrate on what's growing.

""You're feeling the sun and the breeze and don't have to worry about anything in the moment,"" Bolanos said.

In Britain and Germany, there's a premium on allotments -- popular parcels of land rented for growing food crops.

""Those with a garden are the lucky ones,"" said Heidi Schaletzky, standing on the lawn beneath a cherry tree in the north of Berlin.

Schaletzky and her husband have been cultivating a plot in the ""Free Country"" community garden for the past eight years, growing strawberries, salad greens and kohlrabi. So far, access to garden plots remains exempt from restrictions intended to stop the spread of the virus in Germany.

""We'll be able to see other people, too,"" she said. ""As long as they stay on their side of the fence.""

As the weather warms, garden shops are bustling as other businesses shut during the outbreak.

At the Almaden Valley Nursery in San Jose, California, rose expert John Harp has seen a mix of new gardeners and regulars. Customers can't come into the shop, so their online orders are brought to their vehicles in the parking lot.

""Around town everyone is gardening right now,"" Harp said. ""They're looking to be a little bit more self-sufficient.""

This home-grown attitude goes back to World War II, when millions of people cultivated victory gardens to protect against potential food shortages while boosting patriotism and morale.

Hollie Niblett, who lives near Kansas City, Kansas, hopes the victory gardens come back. Niblett, who has a degree in horticultural therapy, tends to a kitchen garden near her backdoor, perennial flowers, flowering trees and shrubs, and upper and lower grassy yards connected by a path through an area left in its natural condition.

""There are so many things about it that feed my soul,"" she said. ""Right now, more than anything, my garden gives me hope, gives me purpose and provides a sense of connection to something bigger than myself.""

For beginners, wonderment awaits. Just south of Atlanta, 10-year-old Ezra Gandy's love for playing baseball has been paused. He and his grandmother, Melanie Nunnally, recently started an outdoor garden, planting strawberries, cabbage, broccoli, kale and asparagus.

""I like digging in the dirt because I like to see all the bugs and stuff that's in the ground,"" he said.

The non-profit group KidsGardening.org suggests that children grow their own salads or do other activities.

The virus scare could even usher in a new crop of gardeners who start from seed rather than risk the crowds buying starter plants.

Kendra Schilling of Scott Depot, West Virginia, doesn't have space for a sprawling garden, so she's planting potatoes in a bucket and trying to figure out with her teenage daughter what to do with other vegetable seeds.

""I usually go buy the plants and stick them in the dirt. But this year we're going to try to do the seeds,"" she says. ""Thank God for YouTube.""

1454,"TORONTO -- Competitive eaters are nearing the human limit for the number of hot dogs that can be consumed in 10 minutes, according to a new study.

Using sports science theory and mathematical modelling to project trends in performance, the new U.S. study found that the eating threshold for humans is around 83 hot dogs.

North Carolina sports medicine professor James Smoliga and a team of researchers analyzed 39 years of data from the annual Nathan's Famous Coney Island Hot Dog Eating Contest to calculate the maximum number of hot dogs one person could possibly eat during its 10-minute duration.

The study, published Tuesday in the journal Biology Letters, concluded that 832 grams or 83 hot dogs is the maximum amount for a professional eater to consume while the average person is only able to eat about 10 hot dogs in 10 minutes.

The study reported that it is unlikely anyone would be able to eat more than 83.

The current world record is 75, a bar set by competitive eating champion Joey Chestnut at this year's Coney Island event. Miki Sudo ate 48.5 hot dogs to win the women's division and set a female record.

""Though often perceived as an entertaining spectacle of gluttony, nearly four decades of data from the event provide insight into the limits of human gut capacity,"" the study said.

While the average human would run into a stomach capacity issue after consuming so many hot dogs, the study reported that competitive eaters specifically train to expand their stomachs.

Eating so many hot dogs – the current record of 75 hot dogs is roughly equivalent to 21,000 calories -- would ""likely alter normal, healthy gastrointestinal function,"" the study said.

While some may think of competitive eaters as the personification of gluttony, the study found that their physiology and digestive systems are unique.

According to the study, the early winners of the Nathan's contest engaged in ""binge-eating"" and topped out at between 10 and 15 hot dogs in the 10-minute period.

However, the participation of Japanese extreme eaters such as Takeru Kobayashi in the 1990s started a slow and steady rise in how much elite contestants could eat. According to the study, competitive eating was no longer just about appetite, but instead, competitors were training to eat a lot in a short time.

The study found that competitive eaters are able to eat such large amounts of food because they train their bodies to do so by ingesting a large amount of liquids or gels to expand the stomach without processing the calories.

Chestnut, for example, told ESPN in a documentary last year that his training regime lasts for the three months leading up to the annual competition and includes weekly practice competitions, a controlled diet and yoga and breathing exercises to help with his mental focus.

The study noted that the hot dog composition and size has remained unchanged at Nathan’s Famous throughout its 104-year history, allowing for sustainable comparisons between competitors over the years.

The study also compared how much humans and carnivores who live on land can eat, finding that that the achievements of human speed eaters are impressive even by comparison with other species.

According to the study’s findings, humans are able to eat faster than bears or coyotes, but slower than grey wolves.

""In summary, data from hot dog eating competitions suggest that there is stunning plasticity in gut capacity,"" the study said.

While the human limit for hot dog consumption is 83, the study warns amateur eaters not to try to test it for themselves.

The study said the average person could suffer serious health consequences while trying to ingest such a large amount of food including choking or rupturing their stomach.","Competitive eaters nearing human limit of hot dog consumption, study says",6,0.3366972575551538
1455,"TORONTO -- What started out as a way to make some money during the COVID-19 pandemic has quickly turned into a pizza making business for one Toronto family.

Luke Pollard -- who regularly makes pizza for his friends and family -- told CTV's Your Morning that the enterprise started in March, when the novel coronavirus put a stop to his construction business, resulting in both he and his wife Brianna being out of work.

Towards the end of March, Pollard said his wife asked him how big his pizzas were. An hour later, she told him that custom-made boxes were coming the next day and that they were going to sell pizzas from their backyard the following weekend, to make some extra cash.

""It started off just with some friends, family, and then I started posting online on Instagram, and people started to reach out and then eventually we got a little profile in Toronto Life, and since then it's just been hundreds and hundreds of requests so it's been a lot of fun,"" Pollard said in an interview on Wednesday.

Pollard makes around 10 pizzas that people can order through Instagram to pick up from his backyard every Saturday night -- aptly calling the new business venture 'One Night Only.'

Customers can choose from four different pies -- cheese, pepperoni, spicy pepperoni with pickled jalapenos, and mushroom special. Each pizza costs $20 and comes with a homemade creamy garlic-and-dill dipping sauce.

Pollard said Torontonians from all over the city have been flocking to his Riverdale home for a taste.

""It's been a real fun experiment and journey, and it's just really a good time,"" he said.

Before COVID-19, the couple entertained almost every weekend, and as Pollard's pizzas got better and better, the dinner parties turned into weekly pizza nights.

However, Pollard's love for pizza began when he was a kid.

Growing up, Pollard said his mom loved to cook and instead of ordering pizza on Friday nights, she would make it herself.

""We started off ordering from chains, things like that, and then my mom, she started making her own dough and it kind of really opened my eyes to how delicious pizza can be once you get past the store-bought stuff,"" Pollard said, explaining that he set his sights on creating his own perfect pizza recipe.

""It's something I've worked on for a lot of years and finally developed this recipe that I can do out of my home oven that the final product is something that you might find at a pizzeria,"" Polland said.

Polland said pizza making is a process and he has to start readying the pies days before they’re sold.

""I typically start making the dough for Saturday on a Wednesday morning and that's a couple hour process. I let it do its thing for a few hours out, then it goes in the fridge for a long, cold, slow ferment, and then Saturday morning we start to prep and get ready for the afternoon,"" Polland said.

Despite COVID-19 restrictions lifting and his construction business having resumed work, Pollard said he enjoys making pizza so much that he hopes to keep the new business venture going.

""As soon as the restrictions lifted we've been slammed between [construction] and doing the pizza and it's been very busy,"" Pollard explained.

""But it's one of those things where the response has been phenomenal, and it's definitely something we want to pursue. So… we're just going let it sort of organically evolve.""

With only selling 10 pizzas one night a week, Pollard admits that it's difficult for Torontonians to get their hands on a pie but said he's looking to expand the business.

""Right now, even just with friends and family, it's pretty hard to get one to everybody so we're looking to scale up and we're going to be doing a pop up in the near future so we can just get more pizza out to more people,"" Pollard said.

""Because there's nothing better than handing somebody a fresh pizza and seeing the smile on their face.""",Pandemic porch pies: Trendy Toronto pizza joint is actually in this man's backyard,6,0.36834486387883225

Despite being on my first home tour in a long time, stepping into this Sayward Hill condo feels like slipping on a favourite pair of shoes.

I take in the compass rose laid out in the bricked pathway outside and the oversize nature photos in the tidy lobby. I make a note of the territorial hummingbird that buzzes past and the light feel of ocean in the wind. And when Ingrid, the homeowner, meets me at the front door to lead me down to her unit, I’m thrilled that she’s as warm and lovely as I’d expected by her emails.

We walk into the condo, past a home office and a den with a spectacular ‘70s-era couch, both lulling me into a “condo” mentality, and then, I stop in my socked feet, utterly surprised.

The kitchen, beautifully balanced with white and oak cabinetry and stainless steel appliances, is large and open enough to accommodate a tightly turned Viennese waltz, if the dancers are sure-footed.

The unit is just over 2,000 square feet, she tells me, a perfect middle ground between downsizing from house living and not sacrificing space and storage for something easier to manage.

But this kitchen. Oh, this kitchen. It’s bright and airy, with oodles of natural light. The quartz countertops are smooth while still adding texture, and the marble honeycomb tile lining the wall beneath the cupboards is warm with gorgeous colour variations. It all comes together in a very chateau feel, and it’s just wonderful.

For Ingrid’s “foodie” daughter and son-in-law, there’s a six-burner gas range and double wall oven, as well as the double-door fridge and walk-in pantry. There’s also an extra built-in beverage centre with a bar fridge and a built-in coffee machine, an upgrade that Ingrid and her husband took immediate advantage of.

“We’re coffee snobs!” she admits with a laugh. “Waking up to the sunrise and turning on the coffee machine — it’s my favourite thing!”

On the other side of the counter sits a fantastic dining table with black accents and clawed feet in the open dining area, ready to expand in the event of company, and the living room sets up a surprisingly expansive view of Cordova Bay, given that the development borders the thick trees of Sayward Hill Park.

The master bedroom comfortably fits a king bed and dresser and comes with its own larger-than-life view, where Mount Baker is currently peeking up above a thin line of clouds. Ingrid disappears behind me as I take in the view, and after a moment I follow, thinking we’ll have a quick look at the closet and pocket en suite before returning to the tour.

What I’m not expecting is to come around the corner into a long, luxurious master en suite complete with double sinks, beautiful soaker tub, roomy glassed-in shower, heated tile floors and so much cupboard and drawer space I think I actually go a little green with envy.

“There’s so much storage. I haven’t even filled up all the space yet,” she says, opening a few of the cupboard doors.

Just on the other side of the bathroom door is a walk-in closet that could rival most of the other Hot Properties closets I’ve seen over the years. I’m so surprised by the size that I don’t notice it’s also a walk-through until Ingrid points out the laundry room at the other end.

“It’s a really efficient design,” she says, and adds that the connection from the walk-in closet to the laundry room was an element that was brought in after talking to residents of other buildings in the development.

The entire Sayward Hill project spanned almost 20 years, Ingrid tells me, with the first development finished in 2001. Amazingly, the entire development team stayed consistent from the first ground breaking to the completion of the last condo building. The same builders, the same architects, the same plumbing contractors, the same designer, everyone stayed involved, making for an almost unheard-of level of synergy throughout the build.

And not only that, but after each phase was complete, the team made a dedicated effort to get feedback from the people actually living in the spaces, and then sat down and round-tabled ideas to implement in the next stages.

“We would all sit together, including the architects, and we would design the light switches,” says Ingrid, smiling. It allowed for a natural evolution of the project, and a number of details that make this particular condo stand out.

As well as the double access to the laundry room, the guest bedroom is situated on the opposite side of the condo to add a sense of privacy for visitors, and there’s a pocket door that can close off the bedroom and bathroom for added separation. A barn door can separate the small home office tucked between the den and the kitchen. And one of my favourite features is at the front entrance: the hallway wall curves gently wide and away the further you come in, leading you into the rest of the house and creating an immediate and welcoming sense of space. The design is subtle and natural enough that I didn’t actually notice it at first, which makes sense the more time I spend here.

Compared to some of the houses featured in Boulevard, Ingrid’s condo is relatively compact, but it never feels cramped, or that anything was sacrificed in the name of efficiency. More than that, the design as a whole feels effortless. I’m instantly so comfortable, so at home, that I have to remember to look for the details.

“Kimberly has an elegance about her,” says Ingrid, quick to praise interior designer Kimberly Williams, also involved with the project since day one. “Her design is timeless.”

“All the projects on Sayward Hill were definitely designed with longevity in mind,” says Kimberly. “Durability and flexibility are extremely important in executing good design. We try to stay true to classic elements, which equates to timeless designs. I am so very proud of this project!”

“This is a development that’s near and dear to my heart,” adds Ingrid.

Having worked selling the units for the past 20 years, she’s seen their evolution and their unmatched quality.

“It felt like my second home. This is the last piece of the puzzle, and it feels right to be here now. This feels like the pinnacle of Sayward.”

When long-time chef Nicholas Waters first started Toque Catering in 2013, he never expected it to take off.

“To be honest, I thought I’d be doing one function a weekend,” he says with a laugh. “I didn’t think anything of it. Then all of a sudden, it turned into an animal.”

Toque grew from just five full-timers three years ago to a staff almost 30 strong today, and the wealth of talent in Nick’s kitchen is enviable.

“We run with 10 to 12 executive chefs full time in the kitchen,” he says. “It’s one of the best teams I’ve ever worked with.”

About the same time Toque took off, Nick relocated to Metchosin, and the locale has been ideal both personally and professionally.

“The bigger we’ve gotten, the more local we’ve become,” he says.

Toque is booked at least a year in advance, so Nick and his team have been able to approach local farmers well ahead of season to plan out orders, translating to reliable income for the small agriculture sector, as well as premium ingredients.

And though Nick says he doesn’t want to grow too big too fast, there are definitely some new and exciting directions coming down the pipe.

“Stay tuned!”

The 7 Sins

Envy:

Whose shoes would you like to walk in?

I am on my own journey in life and wouldn’t change a thing, good or bad, but I would love to be Michel Bras in Normandy, France for a day. He has been my favourite chef in the world since I was 18! His book is still better than most out there and it’s almost 20 years old.

Gluttony:

What is the food you could eat over and over again?

That is definitely a hard one, but I would say gyoza. No matter whether I’m at a pub, home or a high-end restaurant, 10 out of 10 times I will order it if it’s on the menu.

Greed:

You’re given $1 million that you have to spend selfishly. What would you spend it on?

I would travel all through Europe and eat and drink and just eat and drink until it was gone. Spain, Portugal, France, Italy — let’s face it, the money would be gone by then!

wrath:

Pet Peeves?

Everything, almost … but the freezers and coolers being a mess has to be the one that makes me think I’m going to have a heart attack.

sloth:

Where would you spend a long time doing nothing?

Spain.

Pride:

What is the one thing you’re secretly proud of?

It won’t be a secret anymore if I say this, but it would be the team — chefs, dishwashers, operations, planners, on-site service staff, rentals and anyone else I’m missing — and the culture we’ve been able to create at Toque. I am grateful every day that I get to work alongside a very, very talented group. I actually like working with them all and don’t have a bad thing to say. They’ve all become my family.

Lust:

What makes your heart beat faster?

Being on-site when shit hits the fan — like a barbecue falls off the top and an oven doesn’t work, etc. That shit turns me on when you come out of it unscathed and everything went perfectly, except your soul becomes a little darker!

I love the unknown and being able to make something out of nothing. The best was four or five years ago when the guys got me an Easy-Bake Oven for Christmas. They said, “Well, it’s on. Let’s see what you can do with this!’”

A hiker pauses on Chairback Mountain overlooking Long Pond on the 100-Mile Wilderness section of the Appalachian Trail north of Monson, Maine, in this September 2004 file photo. COVID-19 restrictions on camping site reservation and other forms of travel have led to increased demand and system bottlenecking, so when reservations opened across British Columbia on June 1, they went quickly. THE CANADIAN PRESS/AP/Robert F. Bukaty

On her first camping trip of the summer, hiker and adventure blogger Taryn Eyton was surrounded by more company than usual.

The Vancouverite, who works as a volunteer trainer with Leave No Trace Canada, normally spends large chunks of each summer outdoors. But COVID-19 restrictions on site reservation and other forms of travel led to increased demand and system bottlenecking, so when reservations opened across B.C. on June 1, they went quickly. She and her sister were lucky to snag a few June days in a provincial park just outside of Whistler.

As an experienced camper, the packing list is something she has down pat. But for many first-timers, knowing what to bring can be a challenge — one that quickly becomes expensive if you’re not careful when shopping for gear.

“A lot of people get intimidated by the idea of camping being all this gear that you need, all this special stuff,” she says. “If you go to a popular provincial park on a long weekend you’ll see people with just incredible camp setups. All power to them … [but] you really don’t need all that stuff.”

Eyton says campers on a budget should prioritize covering the necessities: Warmth and shelter.

If there’s anything to spend money on, she says, it’s a well-made tent. “The bare bones tent is probably going to leak or fall apart,” Eyton notes. While a high-quality tent may set you back a few hundred dollars, it’s likely to last two to three times as long as one that costs closer to 50 (but if the former is outside your price range, a tarp can serve as a suitable backup to cover holes in the event of a leak.)

The same rule applies to sleeping bags, with slightly more flexibility, Eyton says. A warm, well-made sleeping bag (at a few hundred dollars) is a plus if you’re planning to camp into the colder seasons, but for summer camping alone, a lighter, less expensive bag should suffice. If you’re worried about getting cold, pack a few fleece or wool blankets from home as an addition.

And air mattresses, while comfortable, are not always worth it, Eyton says: Foam sleeping pads typically offer more insulation from the ground and run at a similar price point. If any piece of gear is too expensive to justify buying at all, check your local gear outfitter or MEC branch for rentals, a short-term alternative to purchasing equipment you may never use again.

Shane Devenish, executive director of the Burlington, Ontario-based Canadian Camping and RV Council, says demand for both tent and RV camping has been at an all-time high since the start of June.

“It’s being perceived as one of the safest ways to go on vacation and take a road trip,” Devenish says.

Devenish notes that the budget-conscious should also take mileage into account when calculating the cost of a trip, especially in an RV or larger rental vehicle. “It’s better to have the expectations before you go,” he says, “rather than disappointment, or you’re pretty upset when you’ve got to go to the gas station so much.”

Beyond these upfront costs, camping remains one of the most affordable ways to spend a summer, Devenish adds. Eyton echoes the sentiment, and notes that an open-minded attitude and respect for nature are the only other essentials to take with you.

“It might rain, it might be cold, there might be bugs,” she says. “[Have] a plan for those things and how you’re going to deal with it and still have fun.”

1470,"Kittens! Who doesn’t love adorable fluffy kittens?

Their playful and firey like charm makes them irresistible, and let’s not get started on their giant like eyes and paws they have yet to grow into.

With that said, July 10, of every year marks National Kitten Day, a day intended to remind us that while kittens are well equipped to find their way into our hearts, many don’t find homes. Often kittens are either abandoned on the road, left wild and feral, or forgotten at a shelter.

National Kitten Day was founded by Colleen Paige, pet and family lifestyle expert, author and animal advocate. Paige wanted a day to highlight the fight kittens face in shelters and to encourage safe adoption. In light of the recent restrictions the pandemic has sprung on the world, more people are spending longer hours at home making it the perfect or should we say ‘purr-fect’ time to gain a companion which would make a difference in a kitten’s life.

Instead of purchasing a kitten from the pet store this year, adopt from a shelter.

How to get started:

Call your local shelter or animal welfare organization and complete necessary forms and background checks. Some organizations may provide financial support for foster parents, while others may not be offering support at this time due to COVID-19.

Before:

Involve the whole family in the fostering conversation. Will kids be responsible for feeding the new ‘roommate’? How will your family tolerate future adoption? Do your current pets tolerate other animals OK? The new pet is a big change for everyone, so allow everyone to weigh in, and suggest how they would like to help care for the pet. Adjusting to a new environment can be a daunting task for new pets. Many animals can jump onto high surfaces or squeeze into the smallest of spaces. To protect foster pets in a new environment and to safeguard your belongings, it’s recommended to animal-proof your entire house. Pay attention to any small or dangerous objects, such as pins, needles, paper clips, nails, staples, thread, string, rubber bands, caustic/toxic chemicals, mothballs, plants, and any other potentialy dangerous items.

After:

Make sure your pet is up-to-date on vaccinations. Many infectious diseases for pets are preventable through vaccinations, including Canine Influenza, Leptospirosis (which can be transmitted to people) and Lyme. Pets at varying ages have different nutrient requirements, so consider assessing your pet’s food and adjust accordingly. It is recommended to professionally groom your pet every four to six weeks. While that may not be possible at the moment, between salon appointments, use at-home grooming tools such as a cat or dog-specific toothbrush and specially formulated toothpaste, a nice rubber brush to help de-shed and invigorate the skin and coat, ear cleaner and cotton balls to gently cleanse the ears, and wipes for cleaning around the face, mouth and eyes.

1471,"In the June 29 edition of The Star — front page, “above the fold,” headline story — fellow scribe Joseph Hall identified James McKellar as a “real estate and infrastructure expert at York University’s Schulich School of Business.”

Hall wrote that McKellar and “other city planning experts” say we need a “more accommodating city, attuned to pedestrians and cyclists, and less dependent on hurtling trains and beeping traffic.”

Nice turn of phrase.

I would like to invite Messrs Hall, McKellar, and any “other city planning experts” to join me exactly six months from the date that story appeared — that would be Jan. 29, 2021 — on Yonge Street at York Mills Road, so I can watch them ride their bicycles north to Sheppard Avenue.

That’s only a 40-metre climb.

No problem.

If that’s too much, let’s move a bit further south, to the Summerhill subway station, so they can pedal up to St. Clair Avenue.

That’s a mere 23 metres of altitude adjustment.

Piece of cake.

Hope they can fight their way through the hordes of other cyclists who will be enjoying the ride in temperatures which historically have been between a balmy 3 C,to a more cycling-friendly minus-4.

Wouldn’t want to get too overheated, now would we?

Oh yeah, watch out for the snowplows and snow drifts.

Or how about Pottery Road, running between Broadview and the Bayview Extension?

There’s a separate lane for cyclists on the south side, heading uphill, with a concrete wall for protection.

Cool.

Heading west?

Bike silhouettes painted on the single downhill lane, which is shared with cars, trucks and SUVs.

Summer and winter.

Nice.

We did a shoot a couple of years ago for TSN’s “Motoring TV.”

It was a perfect midsummer Saturday afternoon.

Myself and the cameraman did the entire bit walking in the bike lane on Bay Street, just south of Bloor.

The bit took about two minutes.

During which, we encountered a grand total of — wait for it — zero bicycles.

None.

Lots of pedestrians on the sidewalk.

Lots of vehicles in the street.

Not a single bicycle in the bike lane.

They weren’t just being “Toronto-polite” and giving us room to do our shoot.

They simply weren’t there.

If they aren’t going to be there on a perfect summer weekend day, when are they going to be there?

Sure, you’ll see cyclists on the Martin Goodman trail, named in honour of the Star’s former president and editor-in-chief. During its 56-kilometre run along the waterfront, it has an elevation change of approximately zero metres.

Where do those people live? And where do they work? How can they commute by bicycle?

Maybe they’re lucky, like I used to be.

Back in the day, I was a professor at Ryerson. We lived in Leaside. When I taught summer school classes, I sometimes rode my Raleigh to work, cutting through Rosedale on Glen Road, which bypassed many of the area’s hills.

But like many people with young families, we couldn’t afford a house big enough for our growing brood in Leaside. So we moved to the boonies, north of Milton.

Fortunately, I was an “early-adopter” of the “work where you live” mantra. My job means I can write in my home, and electronically send my stories to the Star.

Yep. I pretty much invented the concept of “telecommuter.”

Most of us aren’t so lucky.

Most of us live “here,” and work “there.”

So it’s either transit, commuter train, or the private automobile.

The 401 is the city’s “main street” any way you look at it. It carries hundreds of thousands of vehicles every single work day.

At times it’s the busiest highway in all of North America.

Riding a bicycle is illegal on the 401.

And riding a bicycle to work is simply not an option for the vast majority of Torontonians.

In July, never mind January.

I have heard city planners praise Copenhagen, Denmark, for its bike-friendly infrastructure.

I’ve been there.

It is beautiful.

It is compact.

It is also flat.

My niece is sheltering at home during the COVID-19 pandemic. She’s making sourdough starter for the first time because she couldn’t find any dry yeast. It’s like having a newborn for the first three days — keep warm, stir three or four times a day, watch for bubbles, feed regularly after use. On cold winter nights, old-timers used to take their sourdough starter to bed with them.

Meanwhile flour is also scarce. A well-known flour company has run out of its usual bright yellow bags and has to use white ones instead. It seems everyone is baking these days.

Questions come to mind. Are people re-enacting the traditional household activities of their mothers and grandmothers? Does this signal a massive change in society?

We don’t really know. Soren Kierkegaard, the father of existentialism, once wrote that we live life forwards and understand it backwards. People may simply be stocking up on baking supplies while they’re in quarantine. It may or may not be largely limited to women who are baking.

Caring for one’s sourdough starter will not alleviate the fear of loss of control, but, as psychologists suggest, it offers the physical and emotional comfort of working with one’s hands. It makes me wonder if people are trying to remember what their home economics teachers taught them, or wishing they had taken home economics electives.

Integrated systems

Many people assume that home economics only deals with teaching women how to cook and sew, as it did in the early years: the old stereotypes of women’s work, including cooking and sewing, are forever present. This definition was appropriate then, but isn’t now.

The unifying theme of home economics is ecology, where all living beings are parts of an integrated system and where a change in one part affects all other parts of the system. The truth of this theme has become painfully obvious in the COVID-19 pandemic.

When the International Federation for Home Economics turned 100 years old in 2008, it reaffirmed the mission of home economics to improve the quality of life and well-being for all people and families.

Home economics has always been more than passing on technical skills. It also includes communicating about everyday life and developing relationships. Critical thinking is important to ask which relationships matter, which people and what area of life will benefit from choices and how these choices affect the broader world. If people only learn skills, they have not learned how to be flexible in all circumstances, such as during shortages or extreme conditions.

Founder was a chemist

The home economics movement began in the 1800s for economic and societal reasons in England, northern Europe and North America.

Agriculture gave way to industry and commerce; countries needed strong, healthy workers for wars and factories. An opening came for women to further their educations under the guise of scientific housekeeping, later referred to as domestic science, and then home economics.

Ellen Swallow Richards, the founder of home economics in North America, wanted to use the word “ecology” in the name. As the first woman to obtain a chemistry degree at MIT, and an outstanding scientist, she finally agreed to home economics in 1908.

Women’s advocacy

In Canada, Adelaide Hunter Hoodless founded home economics education beginning with the Women’s Institute in 1897 and later post-secondary institutions such as the Macdonald Institute in Guelph, Ont.

Hoodless had taken up health as a worthy cause when her young son died from drinking tainted milk. She vowed that no other mother would have to go through such despair.

Up to the 1960s, home economics as a profession spread across the world and provided exceptional job opportunities for women in government, education, business, commerce and universities. Its basis was practical hands-on learning with a focus on women’s education.

Societal shifts

My experience in home economics mirrors many young women of the 1960s. When I was 12, I joined 4-H, a rural youth organization that promoted “learn to do by doing” through practical projects and by offering leadership possibilities.

For me it was a window to the world. The district home economist in charge of the program was respected, independent and drove a government car. She was my first professional female role model, and she encouraged me to go into a bachelor of science program in household economics.

I became a district home economist and later a home economics teacher when the world was changing rapidly. Along came the “race for space,” John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King, Pierre Elliot Trudeau and Australian feminist Germaine Greer.

The second wave of feminism opened up many new areas of study to women and men. Home economics was no longer only for women, and consumerism and the market economy took over to a large extent.

The discipline of home economics has persisted in its focus on everyday life and the well-being of individuals and families. Over the years much discussion has swirled around the relevance of the name home economics. It sometimes goes incognito as human ecology, family and consumer sciences, family studies, home sciences, home arts, and career and technical studies.

‘I’m so happy about those buns’

Mother’s Day, the second Sunday in May, has become the time for North Americans to commemorate motherhood. The day dates back to about 100 years ago, around the same time that home economics was becoming recognized as a body of study. Many women, including myself, avoid Mother’s Day because it’s become so commercialized.

However, I cannot discount the connections between baking and mothering. My own mother used to visit my young family in the early 1980s and bake bread, including air buns. Once, when the buns were almost ready, my then-five-year-old son started dancing at the bottom of the stairs. She asked him, “Why are you dancing?” He said, “I’m so happy about those buns.”

Time passes, circumstances change and my memory of my mother baking is still very strong. Pandemic baking may also give indelible and sustaining outcomes to those who went through it. (And for the record, the bread my niece made with her first ever sourdough starter was pretty good!)

The links between home skills, home economics and love (not necessarily Mother’s Day) acknowledge all people’s desires for connection, activity and being part of a system. Home economics is not dead. It’s needed more than ever. Look for it.

Danielle Ramos is very artistic and good with her hands. With those skills in mind, what would you guess is her ideal career?

The answer, believe it or not, is denturist!

“I love working with my hands, and when I make dentures I have to consider every detail,” Ramos says. “I’m rebuilding someone’s smile.”

Every person’s smile is different, and Ramos hand crafts dentures to custom fit each client. Square teeth, tapering, each facet is important to get all the details just right, and that takes an artistic touch.

“I love that I can combine the craft of building the dentures with being able to interact and care for my patients.” Ramos calls herself a “teeth geek” and is happy to chat about dental health.

“People are welcome to stop by my new office just for a chat or some guidance. If I can’t help them I will make sure to direct them to someone who can,” she says.

From Brazil to Pitt Meadows

Ramos was born and raised in Brazil, and moved to Canada in 2004. After a few years working as a live-nanny she was accepted to a very competitive denturist program.

“I felt really privileged to be chosen,” she says.

Soon after graduating in 2011 she started her mobile clinic, bringing dentures to patients around the Lower Mainland with house calls and hospital visits. Ramos is also a Board Member at the Denturist Association of BC and has been a pre-clinical instructor at CDI College since 2016. While she’s committed to continuing the mobile clinic, she’s also excited to be opening the Lower Mainland Denture Centre in Pitt Meadows to better serve that community.

“I’m happy to be in Pitt Meadows, I love the little community here. It’s also quite under-served as before I opened, people had to travel over 30 minutes to get dentures from a denture specialist,” she says.

Dentures make you smile

Through her work at the Lower Mainland Denture Centre Ramos has experienced firsthand how crucial dentures are to a person’s health and wellbeing.

“When you’re sick, a big part of getting better is being able to eat — being able to enjoy your favourite foods,” Ramos says, and a comfortable set of dentures can help. “People think that just older people get dentures, but my youngest client is 20 years old. People might lose their teeth from medication they took, injuries, or accidents.”

You rely on your teeth your whole life, and that means your need for dentures could happen at any age. But dentures help with more than just nutrition.

“A good pair of dentures gives you confidence. The ability to speak and the ability to smile. In your everyday life how would it be if you weren’t able to smile? Getting a job, public speaking, dating and finding a partner. We use our smiles for everything.”

Although men have been assigned the stereotype of working the backyard BBQ, it is a joy that is shared by most home culinary enthusiasts. It’s a summertime passion. The smoky essence of smoldering charcoal starts my mouth watering as my mind conjures up recollections of flame-licked meats, and fire roasted vegetables. With a few basic tips, you can overcome any barbequing intimidation you may have.

Overcooking lean meats is one of the most common mistakes made. Although it is imperative for poultry to be fully cooked, this does not give you the right to transform it into dry charred remains.

Brining can help protect light-meat poultry and lean pork. This is a technique that involves soaking in a salt-water solution for a period of time prior to cooking. Not only does this add moisture to the center of the meat, but also seasoning, as the salt saturated water is drawn in. A simple brining formula would be: one quarter cup table salt dissolved in 4 cups of water for pieces of poultry or lean pork. Let the meat sit in the brine for at least 1 hour in the refrigerator. Remove from the brine, pat them dry, and cook as you normally would. This brining process will provide a moisture protection shield to help keep fully cooked meats juicy. However, this is only a safeguard – overcooking is still possible, but this lessens the chance. The only other consideration you may need to give your recipe is the amount of seasoning. The meat will already be seasoned somewhat from the salt in the brine, so back off on the saltshaker.

Try this technique the next time you are barbequing chicken breasts, pork chops, pork tenderloins or pork loins. You will be impressed with the results.

The salt used can be any salt: Kosher, Sea, etc. – the important aspect is to ensure that the granules are the same size as table salt. A coarser grind will result in less salt per equal measure as more air trapped between the larger particles.

It is important to mention that this is the simplest form of brine: water and salt. There are many more complex recipes available on the internet that will bring flavor and moisture, but this easy brine is a straightforward starting point. Another essential pointer to bring up is that red meats are typically not brined; marinating is better for red meats, but that’s slated for another column topic.

Dear Chef Dez,

I love barbequed chicken with the skin on, however it always seems to get burned on the outside well before the center gets cooked. I know many people cook skinless chicken pieces and they have no problem, but I enjoy having the skin on. However, the fat from the skin promotes flare-ups, and thus gets burned. How can I avoid this without losing my enjoyment of having the skin?

Tracey S., Abbotsford

Dear Tracey,

Indirect heat is the way to go to conquer this problem. When using direct heat (with the flames directly below the meat) the skin will drip fat onto the flames and cause flare-ups, and thus create excessive burning. Depending on what type of barbeque you have, setting it up for indirect cooking will be different. Many ceramic charcoal BBQs will have a ceramic plate for heat diffusion, while gas grills will mostly rely on having a burner turned off under the meat and closing the lid. This will utilize the heat from the other burners to do the job.

For many BC families, staying close to home is a big part of their summer vacation plans.

Good thing we live in the most beautiful part of the world to do just that!

So, what if you had your own easily reached vacation destination, away from the crowds, in one of the most sought-after parts of the province.

Welcome to Sugar Lake!

All the fun, without the crowds

Located just an hour east of Vernon and less than two hours from Kelowna, the pristine Sugar Lake setting offers all the benefits of the larger north Okanagan lakes – swimming, paddling, water sports, or simply doing nothing at all – with one big difference: the crowds.

No busy beaches. No vying for space on the water. And, if you have your own RV site or cabin right on the lake, no phoning in and competing with everyone else to try to reserve a spot.

When you’re ready to head to the lake, your hand-picked site will be waiting.

Better yet, when summer turns first to fall, then winter, you can be right back here, enjoying your four-season family getaway.

Sugar Lake Recreational Properties is a 66-lot shared interest lakefront development that boasts 45 fully serviced RV lots and 20 cabin sites.

At the new dock, just steps from your site, boat slips are available for lease. Through summer, guests are welcome to join you at the on-site lodge, where a licensed, full-service bistro is popular with both locals and guests.

Your Sugar Lake home-away-from-home

When life away from the lake beckons, explore the world on your doorstep: forests for hiking, freshwater lakes, rivers and streams for fishing, and the hills of Silver Star, just a 90-minute drive away, for summer mountain biking and winter skiing.

Take your adventures on the road to take in the hot springs at Nakusp, and all manner of arts, activities and community activities in the village of Cherryville just 14km north.

Peace of mind, now and tomorrow

To truly enjoy your recreational property, it must provide peace-of-mind – when you’re there, but also when you’re not.

In addition to year-round security and snow removal, the Sugar Lake management team also oversees property rentals if you choose to include your site in the rental pool – a great way to maximize your investment when you’re not using it yourself. And if you ever change your mind, you can withdraw your property from the rental pool just as easily.

Understanding that bank financing can be challenging for recreational properties, the development group – all local to the Okanagan – offer vendor financing for both the RV sites and cabins, meaning you can start making those sweet family memories as soon as this summer!

Measure! Before you leave the house, break out that measuring tape. “Measurements are very important, not only for the space it’s going into, but also your doorways, hallways, stairwells and elevator,” Dansie points out. The last thing you want is to LOVE that 90-inch couch but find your elevator is only 86” tall.

Consider your colours. Are you trying to match a particular paint sample or floor colour? “I find a lot of people will bring in a piece of flooring with them. One person even brought a piece of drywall painted with their wall colour,” Dansie says. “And remember, lighting is so important, but it can be difficult to get a clear reflection of that under showroom lights. We’ll often suggest people take a pillow cushion outside to the natural light to get a better idea of the true colour.”

1488,"One of the oldest cocktails in the canon, the Old Fashioned, needs little introduction. Especially lately, since the drink has gone from a dusty old curiosity to a “call drink” — cocktails that aren’t necessarily on the menu, but get ordered by customers anyway. A couple of years ago, bartenders reported that the Old Fashioned was overtaking the vodka soda as the top call drink on King West.  So, if the Old Fashioned is so great, why did it need to stage a comeback? Well, for decades, the original cocktail lost its way as the Fruit Old Fashioned gained popularity. An Old Fashioned is basically just sweetened, slightly bittered, diluted whisky served over ice and garnished with an orange peel, but at some point people decided to take it up a notch by muddling fruit into the drink. That, in itself, wasn’t such a terrible idea. Unfortunately, one of the “fruits” involved was the maraschino cherry. I once saw a bartender take a scoop of bright red Day-Glo cherries and toss them in the bottom of a glass, along with a few slices of orange, smash them up, then add ice, simple syrup and whisky. It was … not good. Fortunately, as more and more bartenders started researching bygone recipes, a more minimalist Old Fashioned was revived. It became especially popular once people realized that it was more than a recipe, but rather a method that could be applied to just about any spirit. Once you master the basics, you can make it with rum, brandy, tequila or even gin. Here, though, we are making it with Canadian whisky, since that’s a delicious spirit — and barrels of it are being made within 100 miles, right here in southern Ontario. Old Fashioned 2 oz Canadian whisky 1 sugar cube 5 dashes Angostura bitters 1 oz soda water Orange peel (1 inch by 2 inches) Method: Place the sugar cube in an Old Fashioned lowball glass. Douse the sugar in bitters, add soda and start muddling until the sugar is dissolved. Add whisky and a couple of large ice cubes and stir for 30 seconds. Express the oils from the orange peel and serve. Or drink.  Tip: Bartenders pay a lot of attention to ice for a simple reason — rate of dilution. Spirit-forward drinks are generally served on one or two large cubes that don’t melt as quickly, since oversized ice keeps the drink from becoming watered down. Jumbo ice-cube trays can be bought at cocktail supply shops like Toronto’s Cocktail Emporium. ",The Old Fashioned cocktail knows some new tricks,6,0.17038813907205697
1490,"During COVID-19 pandemic, the concept of time has often become irrelevant

In the first season of HBO’s True Detective, Matthew McConaughey’s character, Rust Cohle, tells detectives – who are working to solve a decades-old murder case – that “time is a flat circle.”

“Everything we’ve ever done or will do, we’re gonna do over and over and over again,” he says.

It’s arguably McConaughey’s most memorable line from the dark, police drama, and has been oft-repeated, meme’d on the internet time and again, perhaps more as a result of the actor’s self-assured delivery than because it provides any real wisdom.

Nevertheless, I’ve found logic in it lately, as we all begin to stumble out of the darkness that is COVID-19 quarantine and emerge from hibernation to re-enter the world, throwing open the shades triumphantly even if we’re still not quite sure what day it is.

Perhaps it’s because I have found myself with free time on my hands, but the days have somehow felt like they’re moving both fast and slow at once, in the same way that a microwaved convenience-store burrito can be cold but somehow still burn your tongue.

Maybe time is even going backwards. Who knows?

Someone mentioned to me earlier this week that, by the end of this month – it’s June now, for those scoring at home – we’ll be halfway through 2020, meaning we have just six months to go before we can turn a page on this hellish year.

It took me by surprise. We’re halfway through? How? It feels like only a few weeks ago that I was using up my remaining 2019 vacation days to go on a vacation with my wife. We went on a plane and everything.

But that was February.

Who knows.

The truth is, these last months have all melted together into one long Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day.

In the before times, I’d wake up just before 7 a.m., get ready for work and be out the door by quarter to eight, arriving at the office a few minutes early to ensure I could snag a much coveted parking spot.

But working from home, I rolled out of bed later and later each day, yet still made it with minutes to spare. When your office is 30 feet from your bedroom, time becomes irrelevant.

Once on the clock, my routine was upended, too. Pre-pandemic, I would never eat cereal at my desk at 2 p.m. or spend my coffee break debating which pair of pyjama pants was best for casual Friday. One day, I showered on my lunch break.

My days off would get a little murky, too, as my early-quarantine goals – which ranged from a pledge to exercise daily or to use my off-time to learn a new skill – were eventually replaced by video games and sitcom binging, for hours on end.

I once stayed up until 4:30 a.m. to watch a Korean League Baseball game. I don’t know why.

The clock has struck midnight on such slothfulness, however, and in the long run, maybe it’s for the best. I leave the house for work now. I have reason again to wear pants.

And at some point, I really am going to get into a daily exercise routine.

Maybe tomorrow. Or by October, at the latest. It’s just a few days away.

Want to get back the cabinets you love? Gleam Guard offers a quick, dust-free and cost-effective solution.

We love the idea of a kitchen that looks as good as it works, but thinking about the dust, disruption and cost of a full-on renovation? That’s another story.

The good news is that it IS possible to get back to the cabinets and millwork you love quickly, and at a fraction of the cost of a new kitchen.

And even better news: the only prep you’ll need to do is clearing off your countertops!

“Many homeowners love the cabinets and millwork in their home, but over time, the finish has become worn or dull. They don’t want – or need – all-new cabinets, so the refinishing solution is perfect,” says Tracy Booth, owner of Gleam Guard Cabinet Refinishing, serving Chilliwack and the Lower Mainland region.

The key is to choose a professional with the experience to create a beautiful, lasting finish, using techniques that won’t fill the air with aggravating dust particles, says Booth, who’s been professionally refinishing cabinets for more than 30 years.

Here’s why it works:

Choosing qualified refinishing professionals means you’ll get your kitchen back to the way you want it, without the cost of new cabinets – as little as $2,000 instead of $20,000 to $30,000, for example.

You don’t need to remove old cabinets or replace door and drawer fronts – in fact, you don’t even need to empty your cupboards and drawers! “Our average prep time for customers is 10 minutes,” Booth says. (And if you don’t have much to clear off your countertops, it’s even less!)

The dust-free process starts with your Gleam Guard professional prepping the surface with a vigorous clean, then matching and applying the new finish. A wood floor finish provides a long-wearing result, protecting your cabinets from hazards such as water damage, grease and dust.

There’s no lengthy planning, demolition and construction period. “Our trained cabinet refinishing professionals will have your cabinets looking great and ready to go within one to two days,” Booth says.

All interior millwork can be refinished, so think beyond the kitchen to your built-in bookshelves, doors, windowsills, furniture and more.

1492,"Writers shed light on the times we’re in. So in the time of COVID-19, the Star wanted to hear what some of the best in Canada had to say. This is the first in a series of essays that share ideas, emotions, ways to cope — and bring us together.

A friend of mine, when he begins a novel, always reads the last page first. Perhaps he wants no surprises, perhaps he wants to read for voice rather than plot, or, perhaps he doesn’t want to read in the dark. He claims that any novel that can be spoiled by knowing the ending isn’t worth reading. This is the same friend who reads in large gulps, like a dog bolting down food. He is fast, he is efficient — he read “The Idiot” in one day. Is this impatience? Rapacious desire? A need to dominate the narrative?

I have been thinking of my friend these days as we experience the virus that has affected billions of people. What do you do if the ending of this story has not yet been written and you cannot skip to the last page, if the narrative is constantly changing? We would like to believe that we are the authors of this story, not the virus. If it were otherwise, we would all throw up our hands and hug each other.

As a writer of fiction, I live under the illusion that stories can be shaped, that I have control of my characters and their actions, and that I can determine the various voices, and the structure of the novel. Of course, every story has a structure, even ones with dire endings, and just because we don’t like dire endings doesn’t mean that the story can be ignored. In our story, right now, it is difficult to trust the narrator, or the many narrators. And this makes it difficult to keep reading. I mean that literally. Many people I speak with are having a hard time concentrating on reading. Oh, news works. Facts. And more news. And more facts. But at some point, the news bleeds together and so we have a reappearance of the same story. Eternal repetition. Eternal return. But why this difficulty with fiction?

Some say they have found it easier to go back to Shakespeare, Tolstoy, Virginia Woolf. Well-worn stories, where the endings are known. The familiar. Read what is safe. Others, those who can parcel up the world, are devouring fiction. My father reads Revelations and calls to tell me about the pale horse. I am reading “Threshold” by Rob Doyle, a young Irish writer. It is drug and sex addled — a quest for dead writers, a search for meaning. Which is what all novels worth their salt do: they deal in death. They trigger our imaginations, and our memories.

I am also reading “Decameron,” a plague novel by Bocaccio, a story of seven women and three men who go up to a deserted villa in Italy during the Black Death — this is the 14th Century. Each night, for ten days, they gather and tell stories to each other as a distraction or as a reminder of better times. The stories are not about the plague and death, but about life. The tales are often sexual, and full of trickery. Freed from the morality of the city their stories grow wild and wanton. Even the nuns of the villa have their wily ways, seducing a deaf mute who cannot out them.

Another book: “The Plague,” by Camus. Like many a reader, I recently went back and reread the novel, and discovered that Camus had captured, in 1947, the intricate details and emotions and dread that we experience today — the failing economy, the rich going short of practically nothing, letting the weak die, herd immunity, fear of the other, the efficacy/inefficacy of wearing a mask, flattening the curve, ‘doubtful cases’, finger-pointing, the bravery of the doctor, the nurse, the undertaker. Camus of course is dealing with more than a plague foreshadowed by dead rats. He is looking at how the plague is both outside of us and inside of us. He is saying that Yes, our bodies may survive, but if we don’t recognize the interior pestilence, we will be diminished metaphysically. At the end of the novel, as the fear of the plague fades, the rodents return. Beware the rats. What is astounding about Camus’ novel is the use of facts, the counting of the dead, and the utter banality of the pestilence. “The truth is that nothing is less sensational than pestilence, and by reason of their very duration great misfortunes are monotonous.” First goes imagination, then goes memory.

I watched a YouTube video recently, in which a psychoanalyst said that during this time humans are regressing. He said that the virus has normalized paranoia and has literally scared the s--t out of us — hence our need to hoard toilet paper. We have lost our sense of control, our sense of the future, and therefore we have lost our sense of time. We are in isolation, stuck here forever, never ending, eternal. Usually, time passes from the past to the present to the future. And that future includes death, for all of us. No one wants to live forever. We just don’t want to die quite yet, not in this manner.

My daughter, who is in isolation in Montreal with her husband and their four-month-old daughter, sent me a Sylvia Plath poem called “Nick and the Candlestick.” It is about a pregnant mother who wanders like a miner through her cave-like house, carrying a candle, talking to her unborn child. It is perfect for our times, in that it recognizes the child to come, the future. Plath ends the poem by pushing away dread and praising the unborn child.

You are the baby in the barn.

The baby in the barn. The book as barn. Do we build fictions like barns, to protect ourselves from the unknown? In literature, in art, in photographs, film, in any art form that succeeds, there has to be a sense of movement, of life beyond the frame, of the story continuing after we close the book.

Also, art requires work. It isn’t a Twitter feed, or Instagram — rather than being fed, we must learn to feed ourselves. As we read the narrative of our own plague, in real time, we keep looking for what is to come. We want hope. We need it. We want to sustain a sense of time. We must protect the baby in the barn.","David Bergen on pandemic reading: ‘The stories are not about the plague and death, but about life’",6,0.282428939274216
1494,"So far 2020 has been a bit of a disaster between a global pandemic and racial tensions leading to an existential threat to police forces across North America.

But throughout all of this is something even more insidious, I suggest, namely, an epistemological crisis in our world.

Epistemology is the area of philosophy that deals with the origin and the source and the nature of knowledge. What does it mean to “know” something? Where do you get your knowledge from? How do you know this or that?

These are questions that some of us are asking one another more and more every day as misinformation and, more insidious, disinformation, permeates the public discourse.

Have you ever noticed how the smartest people you know, either in person or through public networks such as the media, often express uncertainty, doubt, and even change their minds?

And have you ever noticed how the most ignorant people you know are steadfast and seem to know everything?

• RELATED: COLUMN: Fighting an ‘infodemic’ amid a pandemic

• RELATED: COLUMN: The call for full-scale economic reopening is an argument to cull the herd

The epistemological Catch-22 we find ourselves in is that the more chaotic our world becomes with pandemic fears, racial tension on the rise, and economic uncertainty underlying it all, the more people seek answers. But those answers are hard to find, and bad answers are worse than more questions.

Remember that episode of Seinfeld where the topic of abortion came up? The gag from the 1990s sit-com was that while the main characters constantly had different people they were dating, they were all quite superficial about the relationships so there was never anything serious discussed. But on the obviously controversial topic of abortion, and with Elaine dating a perfectly handsome man, Jerry asked her what her new beau’s thoughts might be on the subject? “I’m sure he’s pro-choice,” she awkwardly stuttered, soon to be proven wrong.

What does this have to do with anything these days? Well so many of us have social media relationships, in my case a pretty large network of local people on my Facebook account with whom I share Progress news stories, sometimes anecdotes about what I see around town, and many people interact with me. And while there are a great many controversial day-to-day subjects that come across my desk or my social media feed, the unintentional misinformation and blatant disinformation regarding this COVID-19 pandemic of late has been staggering, to the point where I have had to start “unfriending” people who share nonsensical memes and outright lies.

But I can’t keep up.

I’m used to kooks and conspiracy theorists and far right or far left trolls sending me messages or commenting persistently on matters they know nothing about.

But sometimes lately, with some otherwise rational and reasonable individuals with whom I’ve dealt with on news stories or community events, I feel like Elaine in Seinfeld not wanting to ask, but wondering: “You aren’t a conspiracy theorist, right? Oh no, you are!?”

With a desire for answers about why things are happening, in the face of terrifying doubt and uncertainty, far too many people are falling prey to the unintentional misinformation of the ignorant but worse, the intentional disinformation of the malevolent.

Public health officials and politicians are not getting this perfect, but they aren’t lying. The guy sharing memes mocking Trudeau is probably unintentionally spreading misinformation, and the gal sharing a link to something that you’ve seen over and over that contradicts what public health officials are saying is also probably unintentionally spreading lies.

As an optimist I think, sure, maybe we can’t get the malevolent social media users to change their ways, but I think if we all put our mind to it, we can help shift the narrative of the ignorant toward the truth or at least the pursuit of it.

The truth matters, right?

1495,"TORONTO -- It is time to have the conversation with your children -- about money.

For many families the thought of discussing money can make them uneasy and is often a taboo subject. In fact, this conversation doesn't discriminate -- wealthy, poor, young or old no one likes to open themselves up and share their financial situation, especially if it is challenging.

Money is deeply personal and can influence our lives in so many ways.

Families are finding this out first-hand as the pandemic has hit the bottom line and parents are struggling. One or both parents may find themselves laid off permanently or temporarily and while the government aid can help pay the bills and keep a roof over their head today these same parents who may have in the past been able to afford to say ""yes"" to their children are now finding themselves having to say ""no"" financially. And that is ok.

There are going to be opportunities during this pandemic that are going to force us to change and this may be one of them.

Here are a few ideas that may help.

Begin a honest conversation with your children about how you are feeling and where you stand financially. They may not appreciate the numbers but I have found the more you respect their ability to grasp a situation the quicker they embrace it. Include your children in big purchases. I recall having a conversation with our children about a family vacation. With four teenagers in high school and one computer they responded,""we don't really need a vacation but we do need a second computer."" The vacation didn't happen. It is ok to say no to your children even if you can afford to say yes financially. To the extent you can replicate real life the better your children will be when they embark on their own journey. We clearly don't always get want we when we want all the time and neither should they. I know this sounds a little like tough love but it is a great lesson in living below your means that will stick with them. Encourage your children to set financial goals that excite them. They absolutely will not save money for something that excites you. I learned this first-hand when when our daughter got her first part-time job and I thought great you can tuck a little money away for university. Trust me that wasn't on her agenda. Also try to resist the temptation of telling them how to spend their money. It is their money. Yes they will make mistakes but that is ok it is all part of the process. Talk about the difference between investing in your children - helping to fund their education and bailing them out when they run up a credit card bill they can't afford to pay. I'm not suggesting you don't help them out. I would however, ensure they pay you back. Owning the problem can be a game changer. Our son received a notification from CRA highlighting a tax bill he wasn't expecting. He said to me, ""How did you let this happen?"" My response,"" I didn't get you into this situation - you did."" He paid the bill and has never been in that position again. These are difficult times and families are coming together. Just like your salary maybe a moratorium on allowances has to be put into place. That's ok. It can be a temporary situation. However, this doesn't mean everyone should still pitch in. It means maybe we all have to do a little more for less.

When children contribute something to the household regardless of your financial situation it can be a great accomplishment for them as well as you. Now more than ever we need to pull together.",Pattie Lovett-Reid: The pandemic is forcing families to have the money chat with their children,6,0.2105816684575813

LONDON - In the end, Sir Tom didn't need to rise.

On a day infused with emotion, Queen Elizabeth II tapped the blade of a sword once owned by her father on the slender shoulders of 100-year-old Tom Moore, making a hero of a nation a knight of the realm Friday.

Moore captivated the British public by walking 100 laps of his garden in England and raising some 33 million pounds ($40 million) for the National Health Service in April. The queen knighted him with the traditional sword tap, but the World War II was not required to take a knee before the monarch.

Instead, Moore steadied himself against his now-famous walker and wheeled himself across the grass to stand in front of Elizabeth.

“I have been overwhelmed by the many honours I have received over the past weeks, but there is simply nothing that can compare to this,” he tweeted after the ceremony. “I am overwhelmed with pride and joy.“

The ceremony was staged outside of Windsor Castle west of London, where the 94-year old queen has been sheltering during the COVID-19 pandemic alongside her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh.

Moore, who rose to the rank of captain while serving in India and Burma during the war, revealed that he and Elizabeth spoke about ages - slightly breaking the protocol of not revealing a private conversation with the queen.

“She did mention I'm 100, and I said to her, `Well, you've a long way to go yet,' so she's alright,” he said.

Moore walked into the nation's hearts by setting a goal of marking his 100th birthday with a garden lap for each year of his life.

His family elevated the challenge by using social media and the motto #TomorrowWillBeAGoodDay to seek donations to support health care workers during the pandemic, in part a show of gratitude for the doctors and nurses who took care of Moore when he broke his hip last year.

He dreamed of raising 1,000 pounds. Instead, he raised so much more.","Queen makes veteran a knight at 100, no kneeling required",6,0.301322965230045

SEOUL, Korea, Republic Of - South Koreans have waited 16 long years for a savory, crispy bite that would satisfy their taste buds and right an infamous wrong. This week, they finally could fill a bowl with the cereal they wanted all along: green onion-flavoured Chex.

Kellogg's Korea's limited-edition flavour released this week, complete with a catchy ad and an apology for the wait, has taken on surprising cultural significance for an odd culinary experiment.

In 2004, the company advertised a public vote for a new product: chocolate-flavoured Cheki or green onion-flavoured Chaka.

Chaka led by an overwhelming margin, but duplicates were said to mar the online vote and Cheki was declared the winner.

Many South Koreans saw the outcome as more than a marketing mishap.

“It's kind of representative of bigger issues in South Korean society,” said Raphael Rashid, a Seoul-based freelance journalist who writes about South Korean politics and culture. “South Koreans are used to or have experienced, you know, like years, if not decades, of dictatorship.”

The chocolate victory was “kind of reminiscent” of that, he said.

It brought to the surface long-buried memories for Yoon Gunhee, who voted in the infamous election.

She said she was around 13 or 14 when she discovered an advertisement for the flavour election on the back of a cereal box.

“At the time, I was young so I voted for chocolate,” said Yoon, a freelance game graphic designer. “Green onion really didn't sound appetizing.”

She remembered people around her voted for the green onion flavour because they found it funny.

Yoon said she was amused this week by the light-hearted commercial for green onion Chex - featuring a popular South Korean singer declaring, “I'm sorry, I'm sorry that the green onion flavour arrived so late” and “the promise must be kept,” with scientists in white gowns in a laboratory labouring to develop the perfect flavour. The video has racked up over 900,000 views on YouTube.

Yoon said she would like to buy it “at least once.”

“The rigged voting at the time was such an unpleasant experience,” she recalled. While the memory was a small one, she was reminded of it whenever she saw a box of Chex.

“I think I will be able to sort out my feelings after eating green onion flavoured Chex,” Yoon said.

South Korean Twitter has been rejoicing by uploading photos of their Chex. Some, feeling adventurous, sprinkled green onion cereal pieces as garnish on South Korean signature dishes including kimchi and spicy ramen noodles.

Like Americans, South Koreans typically eat their cereal with milk, but some say green onion Chex tastes better alone or with a drink like beer or soju.

Rashid positioned himself to be among the first to try it and acquired a box online. On Thursday his face turned sour when he got his first taste.

It has an “artificial onion background taste,” he said, reminiscent of onion ring snacks that are popular in Korea.

“It doesn't taste great,” Rashid said, rinsing his mouth between bites. “And I think Kellogg knows that it probably doesn't taste great either.”","After 16-year wait, South Koreans finally get new Chex flavour",6,0.07512543760771095
1504,"I have pretty much stayed in my house since the first week of March. We got back from 10 days in Florida on March 4 and I turned on the TV to hear Boris Johnson, the British prime minister, suggest that anyone over 70 (check) with an underlying medical condition (check) should plan to stay inside and out of the line of COVID-19 fire for a minimum of four months.

Uh-oh, I thought.

The following Monday, I had to go to the Trillium Health Centre in Mississauga for a followup on my wrist that I’d managed to break in California last December (“How’s it feeling?” Fine. “You’re good to go.”) and the next day I had to meet my good friend Tim Miller of the Hamilton Spectator at a Denny’s in Oakville for breakfast.

That was the last time I ate out. By March 12, two days later, Canada had started to catch on. The prime minister went on television to tell people to “go home and stay home.” Friday, the country was hitting its stride with the health minister and the medical officer of health adding their voices and suddenly we were in lockdown.

So what do you do when you can’t go anywhere? How do you pass the time? I do a lot of writing for the Star and my own website, but there is still down time. I like to read and I have eclectic tastes: autobiographies of Brian Mulroney, Pierre Trudeau, John Turner, George W. Bush and Punch Imlach, for instance, and videos/DVDs on everything from the Second World War to the third season of Hill Street Blues.

But my primary focus is on all things automotive, with an emphasis on motorsport.

To start, there are DVDs: fact (“Indianapolis 500: the Sixties — a Decade of Change”) and fiction (“To Please A Lady,” starring Clark Gable and Barbara Stanwyck, about an Indianapolis driver who loses the big race on purpose to prove to his sweetheart that he’s learned there are more important things in life than winning).

There are several F1 documentaries (“Grand Prix: The Killer Years” is one; there are others) that you might watch once but are so grisly that once is enough. And then there is the acclaimed Netflix series “Formula 1: Drive to Survive,” and it really is stupendous. But I’ll tell you this: if I hear the Hass F1 team principal, Guenther Steiner, use the F-word one more time, I am going to scream. He is equivalent to the CEO of a multibillion-dollar corporation and he should show more discipline. I was going to use the word “class,” but I’m afraid he’s incapable of that. Prediction: as long as he’s around, that team is going nowhere.

Anyway, while I watch the occasional DVD, I prefer to crack a book. Here are eight that I’ve been reading since my self-imposed exile began. I’ve read them all previously, of course, so these are rereads. But they are so good I am enjoying every word.

WHEELS, by Arthur Hailey. Hailey was a prolific Canadian novelist whose shtick was researching a subject to death and then writing a story around it. His three most famous books were Hotel, Airport and Wheels. I must admit that of the three, Hotel was the most shocking because Hailey had no problem unveiling some rather unsavoury practices that were commonplace (at the time) in an industry that just about all of us, at one time or another, have utilized.

For Wheels, he spent months at a Detroit auto factory (thought to be the Ford Motor Co.) and while the story is pedestrian, the “reporting” was wonderful. This all took place before automation and the industry has been turned upside down since, but it was hot stuff at the time. He wrote that the worst cars to buy were the ones manufactured on Mondays and Fridays (because of assembly line absenteeism), and for several years afterward, every dealer in North America swore the cars in their showrooms were all built on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. Fun stuff.

MON AMI MATE (the friendship of 1950s British racers Mike Hawthorne and Peter Collins), by Chris Nixon. In some circles (I emphasize: some circles), Formula One Grand Prix drivers are seen as being more cultured and sophisticated than their American counterparts. Stirling Moss vis-à-vis A.J. Foyt, for example. Read this incredible book by Nixon, though, and you quickly come to the conclusion that regardless of nationality or social standing, boys will be boys.

Collins, who married a Broadway actress, once exploded with rage when he learned that a South American woman with whom he’d had a brief affair (a.k.a. one-night stand) was pregnant, suggesting she should have taken precautions. (The #MeToo movement would have loved this guy.) Hawthorne was world champion (think about that: world champion) when he was killed in a street race with Rob Walker, an F1 team owner and a one-time columnist for Road and Track magazine.

Boyhood chums, both drove for Ferrari and then died violently within five months of each other, Collins in a Grand Prix at the Nurburgring and Hawthorne on a four-lane highway in England. An impressive read.

BLACK NOON, by Art Garner. May 30, 1964, was one of the worst days in the history of the Indianapolis 500. A California sports car champion named Dave MacDonald, who was a rookie at Indy, was driving an experimental car entered by off-road racer Mickey Thompson, when he lost control during the second lap and the ensuing carnage killed him, veteran Eddie Sachs and injured three other drivers, Johnny Rutherford, Ronnie Duman and Bobby Unser. Everything — and I mean everything — you would want to know about that day and those men is in this book.

WINNERS ARE DRIVEN, by Bobby Unser. Talking about Unser and “boys-will-be-boys,” he was one of the great practical jokers of all time. To this day, Foyt starts giggling when recalling some of Unser’s stunts. Lloyd Ruby tells this story.

“Bobby loved playing with M80s (a firecracker with the oomph of about a fifth of a stick of dynamite). Once we were at a Boy Scout banquet and he put one in a giant bowl of salad. The salad went everywhere. One time we checked into a motel and he was dropping M80s in the toilets, which didn’t help the plumbing. Then he’d start playing with the fire extinguishers out in the hall. Needless to say, we didn’t get invited back.”

At some point, Unser matured and wrote a great book on how to succeed in business and in life by applying the principles and strategies he used on the speedway. Globe and Mail columnist Harvey Schachter gave it a positive review. It’s worth reading because at some point we’ll all be able to leave the house and there might have to be a reset. This book could help.

IACOCCA: AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY, by Lee Iacocca. Never mind the pandemic. The worst thing that has happened to business, government and publishing has been the “executive committee,” or “inner cabinet.” Why? Because everybody insists on having their say and, as a result, it takes forever to get anything done.

Iacocca, either through force of personality or physical intimidation (yes, that existed in his time and, to an extent, still does) got things done.

EVEL, by Leigh Montville. A great read about the rags-to-riches-to-rags-again daredevil Evel Knievel, who, over the course of his career, really did break every bone in his body — at least once. I was at Snake River Canyon for the Star in 1974, when Evel went into the river instead of over/across it and will never forget going to the airport in Twin Falls, Idaho (only the late Christie Blatchford and I thought to go out there), where he boarded his Learjet to fly over the jump site and vowed to “dip his wings in salute” to the canyon that had beaten him.

Little-known fact: the last jump before Snake River was over 15 Mack trucks in front of the Grandstand at that year’s 1974 Canadian National Exhibition. Great stuff.",Passing the time during the pandemic,6,0.315458568481098
1507,"For months since the COVID-19 restrictions were put on visits to long-term care homes, the toll isolation has taken on elderly residents was either ignored or swept under the rug by government officials.

Since the March shutdown, the provincial government has also failed to recognize the role essential family caregivers play helping to feed and care for their loved ones, a role that, in fact, helps free up harried and overworked PSWs to perform other duties.

To say the government has been tone deaf about this issue is an understatement.

In some cases, like that of Anil Reddi and his 93-year-old mom Vimal Kotak, the LTC home — Toronto’s True Davidson Acres — finally let him in to feed and be with her two weeks ago because she had stopped eating.

It shouldn’t have come to that.

Nevertheless, in the latest provincial update concerning relaxing restrictions on visits to LTC homes, essential family caregivers and regular visitors continue to be lumped together as if there’s no difference.

Nathan Stall, a geriatrician at Sinai Health, said they’ve been calling “tirelessly” on the long-term care ministry to acknowledge that not all visitors are the same.

“There are family caregivers who want to get in and provide that direct care and support,” he said.

He refers to countless stories of people declining without their family caregivers, or who aren’t getting “culturally sensitive” care or have language barriers that aren’t being addressed because family caregivers have been shut out.

“There’s no substitute for family,” he said. “Tragically, because people have been shut out for four months, some residents no longer recognize their family anymore.

“We’re causing huge trauma for family on the outside who are quite literally losing relationships … unless family caregivers can get the access they need to the homes to provide that direct care and support on an often daily basis, residents will continue to decline.”

Stall said he feels provincial officials do not want to get it, especially since guidance has been shared repeatedly with them.

“I think this is something they just don’t want to deal with even though we keep telling them blanket policies are just not appropriate here,” he said. “They continue to implement blanket policies at the convenience of the home.”

In fact, Stall — in conjunction with three other doctors and Ryerson’s National Institute of Ageing — issued a document this week with carefully crafted guidance on how to re-open Canadian LTC homes to family caregivers and visitors during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In the statement accompanying the document, they say that the risks associated with restricted access to family caregivers and visitors have started to outweigh the potential benefits of preventing COVID-19 — as has occurred in the case of Reddi’s mom.

The document says, first and foremost, that homes, public health authorities and the government must not be permitted to define who might be a family caregiver.

The document proposes that LTC homes should permit at least two family caregivers to come in — one at a time — and with proper caregiver ID, PPE and screening requirements be permitted to access key areas of the home.

They should also be permitted to stay for as long as they wish during a day “as long as it does not negatively impact the care of other residents” or other family caregivers.

These guidelines all make perfect sense but they’ve been ignored and homes continue to call the shots.

I asked Stall why homes and the province would want to have the deaths of residents from starvation and neglect on their hands.

“Those are silent, quiet deaths compared to COVID deaths which are publicly reported,” he said. “They’d say there was dementia and their appetite was poor to start with … it’s easier to hide.”

1515,"There is an old expression that truth is the first casualty of war.

I was thinking about that expression and how it applies to the COVID-19 crisis, as rumours have been flying about police stopping and ticketing people just for driving.

As our understanding of COVID-19 to evolves, the internet has been a great source of information and connecting with others, but it is also a breeding ground for misinformation.

To help set the record straight, I asked Sgt. Kerry Schmidt of the highway safety division of the Ontario Provincial Police to provide clarity on these rumours.

Schmidt says that although road traffic volume has been greatly reduced in the past month, far too many drivers are taking advantage of the open roads to drive recklessly, which puts themselves, other motorists and the police at risk.

Reckless driving leads to more collisions and injuries and puts additional strain on hospitals that are already managing an influx of patients related to COVID-19.

Last weekend alone, 30 drivers in the GTA were stopped and their vehicles impounded and licences suspended for street racing and/or stunt driving. On average, 10 vehicles per day in Ontario are taken off the roads for speeding or stunt driving.

In Toronto, from March 15 to 30, police issued 35 per cent more speeding tickets than during the same two-week period last year. In York Region, tickets issued for stunt driving were up 60 per cent in March, compared to March 2019.

The message that Schmidt wants to share with the public is that drivers need to obey all traffic laws and public health guidelines. That means “slowing down and driving responsibly.” Schmidt stressed that the OPP will not take a break from enforcing public safety and traffic laws.

During this COVID-19 crisis, police (like everyone else) are trying to limit close contact with the public, which explains why police stations in Ontario are closed indefinitely (stations are accessible through phone and website). Police do not want to be a source of transmission of this disease or to be in contact with someone who may have COVID-19.

One of the most persistent rumours is that police are stopping drivers randomly and asking them where they live and to explain where they are going, and why, and ticketing vehicles that are carrying too many people.

According to Schmidt, that’s not true. At this time, there are no travel restrictions in place anywhere in the province, and no checkpoints. Nor are police ticketing cars with multiple passengers under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act.

However, Schmidt suggests that drivers listen to the recommendations of Public Health. but ignoring their recommendations is not an offence. He reiterated that Public Health has specific recommendations to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Drivers should understand that not only speeding and stunt driving are dangerous on the roads, but all types of reckless driving, including driving while under the influence of drugs or alcohol, and distracted driving.

If there is a central message that Schmidt needs the public to understand, it is this: please slow down and use common sense. He says Ontario is still under a state of emergency and all citizens need to do their part to help flatten the curve.

“The job of the highway traffic division is to ensure the safety, security and protection of all Ontario citizens who are using the roadways,” Schmidt says. “It’s everyone’s job to obey the rules of the road and to follow the guidelines of health officials.”",Staying safe also means driving safe,6,0.04062634488104666
1519,"TORONTO — Mask-wearing protesters spilled onto the street outside Toronto police headquarters on Thursday as the body that oversees the force held its fourth and final town hall on police reform.

The crowd demanded that the police force be defunded, disarmed or abolished, saying the proposals made by politicians — such as the implementation of body-worn cameras — don’t go far enough and arguing the public consultations were unlikely to result in meaningful change.

“We are not here to be consulted. We’ve been consulted to death,” said Kike Roach, the Unifor Chair in Social Justice and Democracy at Ryerson University and a speaker at the rally.

“Our voices were loud and clear. Defund the police by 50 per cent — a demand that has been echoing across the continent,” she said.

“Stop the tinkering. Stop reforming. Stop the round tables and regressive thinking.”

Previous consultations have resulted in numerous reports, but little change, she said.

The Toronto Police Services Board was initially going to vote on a report about combating racism within the police service without consultations, but decided to postpone hearing that report until the public could weigh in.

Police Chief Mark Saunders has said he does not support arbitrary cuts to the force’s budget, but does support overhauling how the force deals with those in crisis.

Some at Thursday’s protest argued that this current round of public consultations from the police board is little more than lip service, because city council has already voted against a cut to the force’s budget.

Instead, councillors proposed a series of changes to policing including anti-racism measures and the implementation of body cameras.

Roach said body cams are unlikely to prevent brutality, pointing to numerous police killings that were caught on camera, including that of George Floyd, a Black man in Minneapolis who died while a white police officer pressed a knee against his neck for nearly eight minutes.

Floyd’s death has been a catalyst for worldwide protests demanding an end to police violence and anti-Black racism.

Another speaker, Ravyn Wngz of Black Lives Matter Toronto, rejected arguments used to defend the role of police.

“Police don’t actually help in a crisis. Police don’t help resolve harm once it’s done, and don’t help de-escalate conflict,” Wngz said. “And isn’t it a shame that the people who kill us and the people who purport to protect us are wearing the same uniforms?”

Mary Ann Scott, one of the protesters, said she felt she had little choice but to take to the streets.

“We have a global crisis, a Canadian crisis and a Toronto crisis,” she said. “We have a lot of things that need to be done and we have a lot of community that needs to be helped.”

Scott said she’s been trying to start up a football team in the Regent Park neighbourhood of Toronto, which Statistics Canada says is one of the poorest communities in Canada.

But she said she’s received almost no support for that initiative, while the police service’s budget continues to grow.

“They’re not serving and protecting Black people, and especially not young Black boys,” Scott said.

1522,"NEW YORK — The personal assistant to Fahim Saleh, founder of the Nigerian ride-sharing app Gokada, was arrested on Friday in the grisly murder of the 33-year-old tech entrepreneur in his Manhattan apartment, New York news media reported.

Saleh’s body was found dismembered and decapitated in his luxury condo on Tuesday, New York police said.

The suspect, identified as Tyrese Devon Haspil, 21, is expected to be charged in the murder, several media outlets reported, including the New York Times, NBC’s New York TV station, the New York Daily News and the New York Post.

A spokesman for the New York Police Department disputed the report.

“Last I was told, we don’t have anyone in custody,” police spokesman Sergeant Vincent Marchese said by phone. “There is no arrest. I don’t know where they’re getting the information from.”

Saleh earlier this week died of multiple stab wounds to the neck and torso, the New York City medical examiner said. His body was discovered in his apartment on Tuesday afternoon.

His body had been decapitated and dismembered, the parts placed into separate plastic garbage bags. A power saw and cleaning supplies were found plugged in nearby.

Security camera video showed Saleh in his apartment building’s elevator with a man in a dark suit, mask and gloves, the media reports said. Video footage showed the suspect following Saleh into the seventh-story apartment, where a struggle began.

Saleh, who was born in Saudi Arabia to Bangladeshi parents and grew up in New York, founded the Pathao ride company in 2015 and in 2018 the Gokada motorbike hailing app.

1523,"TORONTO -- Ontario's police watchdog says it's looking to speak to another witness in its investigation into the death of a Toronto woman who fell from her balcony while police were in her apartment.

The Special Investigations Unit says it has spoken to three of Regis Korchinski-Paquet's family members about the incident and received a statement from a fourth.

Its investigators have also interviewed 14 additional witnesses, including seven police officers.

However, the agency says it's been made aware of another witness who was at the apartment at the time of Korchinski-Paquet's death, and is trying to speak to that person.

Images from the site at Simcoe and Wellington streets Thursday showed the crumpled crane collapsed on top of the building Thursday morning.

The crane operator managed to climb down safely and nobody was injured. However three buildings were evacuated as a precaution and the damaged crane remained atop the office building into Friday morning.

Toronto fire said Thursday that they were concerned about the possibility that the structure could further collapse and established a “collapse perimeter” around the bottom of the crane.

In a statement to CP24 on Friday, PCL Constructors Canada said that they are working to dismantle the crane “with safety at top of mind.”

“We can confirm that the crane was secured and that the site and neighbouring building were deemed safe by an independent engineer,” the statement read.

The company said an engineered dismantle plan was approved Thursday, but a decision was made to wait until daylight because of inclement weather.

“Crews have returned to site this morning to conduct the dismantle operation, and the incident is currently under investigation by the Ministry of Labour,” PCL said.

“We are thankful that no injuries were sustained during yesterday’s incident and would like to recognize the swift response efforts of all on-site personnel and Toronto emergency services and thank the local community for their patience.”

The company said that they expect the dismantling of the crane to last into Friday evening.

Regis Korchinski-Paquet fell to her death from her apartment balcony on May 27. The young woman was suffering a mental health episode and her mother had asked officers to take her to CAMH.

While in police custody, she went back into her apartment to use the bathroom and was followed in by a number of officers, according to her family. A short time later, she fell to her death.

Critics of both police and the SIU have said that the investigation should be both swift and transparent.

The Special Investigations Unit has acknowledged that and on Friday released a timeline of their investigation so far.

Seven civilian witnesses, six witness officers and one subject officer have been interviewed as part of the investigation.

The SIU said it has interviewed three family members who made themselves available on various dates between June 18 and July 10. A fourth family member declined to be interviewed but provided a written statement to SIU investigators on July 7.

“While the SIU was ready to interview family members as soon as possible, it respects the time the family needed to mourn their loss prior to feeling ready to provide interviews,” the SIU said in its statement Friday.

The organization also said that it received the results of an autopsy on June 17, but learned on July 14 that the family plans to have a second autopsy conducted out of province.

The SIU said the results of that autopsy are not expected until sometime in August although the family previously suggested that the results could be available by as soon as next week.

“Out of an abundance of caution, SIU Director Joseph Martino has decided to wait for the results of this second post-mortem before concluding the investigation and arriving at a decision,” the statement read.

1528,"Police observers and those on the front lines of the overdose epidemic that has hit the GTA in recent years are welcoming a policy change toward illicit drug use by Canada’s police chiefs.

In a statement earlier this week, the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police (CACP) said that they are now calling for all police agencies in Canada to recognize substance abuse and addiction as a public health issue. The agency also said that it is endorsing the decriminalization of personal possession of small quantities of illicit drugs.

The move marks the first time that the organization has formally adopted such a stance.

“I cannot overstate the significance of the statement from the chiefs of police,” Coun. Joe Cressy told CP24.com.

Cressy serves as chair of the Toronto Board of Health, which renewed a call in June for the federal government to decriminalize all drugs.

“For too long the criminal justice approach, ‘just say no’ approach, the arrest your way to a solution has frankly done more harm than good when it comes to protecting the health and the lives of people who use drugs,” Cressy said.

Former Ontario Provincial Police commissioner Chris Lewis, who once sat on the board of directors for the CACP, told CP24.com that he’s watched the thinking around drug use evolve over the years.

He said there was a time about a decade ago when nearly every police chief in Ontario opposed any form of drug legalization.

“Back then we looked at the model in B.C. with safe injection sites as a direction we did not want to go,” Lewis said, explaining that the thinking then was that it would turn neighbourhoods into slums.

“The current head of the Canadian Association is from Vancouver and so he’s lived through all that in his career and he’s confident and people are agreeing with him that it’s time to do that. It needs to be done carefully based on what they’ve learned in B.C. and that is a better approach than what we’ve been trying to do traditionally – arrest our way out of all this mess – because that’s not working.”

Lewis said there has been a gradual recognition that you don’t want to “ruin people’s lives over a line of coke.”

He applauded the idea that police should help direct people to treatment and recovery programs as opposed to treating them like criminals.

“Just arresting someone who doesn’t have five cents to their name and they’re addicted to meth and they don’t have any teeth – what’s putting them in jail going to do?” he said.

However he noted that decriminalization is not the same as legalization and said that police should continue to go after sellers and distributors of illicit drugs.

Cressy acknowledged that the idea of decriminalizing drug use may alarm some people.

“When you’re dealing with an issue that has historically had such controversy and stigma surrounding it like drug use, a lot of people are uncomfortable at an emotional level with the notion of decriminalization of drugs,” he said. “But sometimes the best policy is complex and that’s the case with drug use.

“We’re not seeking to decriminalize drug use because we want people to use drugs. Just the opposite; we know there are harms associated with drugs and by decriminalizing it, you can reduce those harms.”

He noted that in both Toronto and Ontario, overdose deaths have spiked to a three-year high in recent months, owing to both reduced harm reduction services because of the COVID-19 pandemic and “an extremely tainted illicit supply.”

“At the end of the day, these deaths are preventable. It requires a safe regulated supply and a new legal approach but there is a better way,” Cressy said.

Shift comes at the same time as calls for changes in policing

The shifting attitude toward drugs by Canada’s police chiefs comes at a time when there are wider calls for police to change how they do things.

Peel Regional Police Chief Nishan Duraiappah, who has been on the job since October, has said he sees his role as coming with a mandate for change in policing.

In a recent video posted online, he said the Peel police service is in the process of “significant systemic organizational change” that is “cantered on human rights.”

“We recognize we have to rethink our roles and adjust,” Duraiappah said in the video. He added that the force is looking to reduce the demand for crisis response when it comes to mental health and addictions.

In a further statement to CP24.com, he said that addictions, substance abuse, and mental health are complex social issues which require “collaboration between service providers.”

“This approach is in keeping with the Community Safety and Well-being (CSWB) model which is being adopted by our police service. CSWB has evolved through the realization that many social issues, such as the use of illicit drugs, are more effectively addressed through coordinated upstream interventions, delivered by other providers such as health, addictions counselling services, etc.

“While police have a clear role responding to emergencies and situations of elevated risk, there are other options towards prevention and social development which can create better outcomes for our community. We need to ensure we are delivering the right service at the right time.”

A spokesperson for outgoing Toronto police Chief Mark Saunders declined to provide a comment on the CACP statement.

While the policy shift around policing and drugs comes at the same time as a discussion around defunding police forces, Lewis said he doesn’t see the one as flowing from the other.

“I don’t think it’s as a result of what’s been going on with the defunding discussion but it certainly is timely, just totally coincidentally, with that whole discussion,” he said.

He said the chiefs’ new position “does fall in line with the recent discussion around what the police do versus other agencies and how do they work together to have a real impact.”

He pointed to defunding of social services over the years as one of the reasons that police have been left to deal with many issues that they might not be best equipped for – including drug use.

Cressy said the next step is for the federal government to change the legal framework around drug use.

“For years now public health experts have called for a new approach to drug use. We now have law enforcement joining that call. The next step is for politicians to join,” Cressy said.

He noted that “as much as we may want to do it alone in Toronto, just as they may wish to do it alone in Vancouver, legislatively we don’t have that authority. This requires federal changes.”

Still he called the CACP statement a “significant and important shift coming from law-enforcement” that “reflects is the need fundamentally for a new legal approach to drug use in our country.”",Change in police attitude toward drugs welcomed by local observers,8,0.05529366702814731

Following a 31-year career with the RCMP, Hudson is now suing the force for alleged systemic racism she experienced on the job, including unequal pay, lack of opportunities compared to her white colleagues and years of discrimination that culminated in lasting psychological trauma.

When she finally quit the force in 2009, Hudson threw her police badge in the trash.

“I’ve talked for 31 years and they weren’t listening,” she said. “So I said, ‘You know what, I quit.’ And I threw the badge out and I walked out.”

Her complaints are detailed in a 16-page statement of claim filed last week in Federal Court. Hudson is the lead plaintiff in the proposed class-action lawsuit.

Hudson alleges that once, while investigating the case of a missing body in a river with two white officers, she overheard her one of her colleagues say, “Oh my God, it smells like a rotten Indian.”

“And I said, ‘Hey guys, I’m here,’” Hudson said.

On another occasion, she said she saw a corporal throw a large, metal flashlight at an Indigenous man. The flashlight was so heavy that Hudson feared the man would die, but fortunately the corporal missed.

“And then he said, ‘Oh I missed that f***ing Indian,’” she recalled.

She also alleges that a corporal once told her that she was “fat because all Indians are fat.”

The lawsuit also alleges that Hudson was sent to do ""countless dangerous jobs by herself with no back up, in situations where non-racialized RCMP members were not sent alone.""

In just two days, 80 other men and women have come forward with similar allegations.

Sometimes other officers were present and witnessed what happened but said nothing, Hudson said. She alleges that numerous complaints voiced to RCMP management were never investigated or were completely ignored.

“I can’t say it was everybody, but you can obviously all notice and see the racism happening and how we were treated different,” she said.

In a statement, the RCMP said it cannot speak directly to allegations that are now before the courts. The force also said there is no room for racism or any other kind of discrimination in the RCMP.

Eventually, Hudson began to speak out at work about the alleged racism she saw around her.

“I was labelled as a troublemaker because I would speak out. I thought, you know what, I’m not going to just stand by. This is wrong. This is totally wrong. The way they’re treating me and the way I saw other members being treated of different ethnic groups.”

But speaking out began to take a toll on her mental health. She says the RCMP disregarded her complaints, as well as the stress and other consequences to her physical and mental health.

“I was so stressed out I couldn’t even hold a pen. I couldn’t talk, I couldn’t do anything. I went to work and I could not work. I was so worn out from the fight.”

Lawyer David Klein, who represents Hudson, said his firm has been contacted by dozens of current and former members of the RCMP who’ve expressed similar instances of discrimination.

“We have a lot of people who have suicidal ideation, who suffer from PTSD,” he said.

Eleven years since she quit the force, Hudson said she has never stopped talking about her experiences with the RCMP. But now, as conversations about systemic racism in Canada reach the forefront, she says she’s speaking out for those who can’t.

“I know of a member that was forced out of the RCMP, he’s Indigenous, and ended up in a mental hospital. So those kind of people, I will fight for them.”

1537,"NEW YORK -- A personal assistant arrested Friday in the slaying of a 33-year-old tech entrepreneur who was found dismembered inside his luxury Manhattan condo was believed to have owed his boss a ""significant amount of money,"" police said.

Tyrese Haspil, 21, of Brooklyn, faces a murder charge in the death of Fahim Saleh, whose beheaded body was found Tuesday afternoon by a cousin who had gone to his apartment to check on him. Haspil had handled finances and personal matters for Saleh, whose ventures included a ride-hailing service in Africa.

Information on Haspil's arraignment or a lawyer who could speak on his behalf were not immediately available.

Police said officers responding to the cousin's 911 call discovered Saleh's clothed torso, bags containing a head and arms and an electric saw in the living room of his luxury seventh-floor apartment on the Lower East Side.

Investigators recovered security video showing Saleh exiting an elevator that leads directly into the full-floor, two-bedroom apartment, closely followed by a masked person dressed entirely in black, according to a law enforcement official who was briefed on the case.

The video also showed a struggle between the two that ensued at the entrance to the apartment, said the official, who wasn't authorized to discuss the investigation and spoke on the condition of anonymity.

NYPD Chief of Detectives Rodney Harrison said investigators determined that Haspil assaulted Saleh in the elevator with a stun gun a day before his body was found. Speaking to reporters about the arrest, Harrison would not say when police believe Saleh was killed, nor would he discuss other details about the case or take questions.

Investigators initially believed that the relative who went to check on Saleh may have interrupted the assailant before that person fled out a back exit. The medical examiner ruled the death a homicide after an autopsy found the cause of death was multiple stab wounds to the body.

Saleh was the chief executive officer of a ride-hailing motorcycle startup called Gokada that began operating in Nigeria in 2018.

Saleh's LinkedIn biography described him as a self-taught businessman who founded Gokada, building on his experience of first ""seeing an opportunity in his parent's native country of Bangladesh"" and starting that country's largest ride-sharing company. It said he also invested in a similar venture in Colombia.

""The headlines talk about a crime we still cannot fathom,"" Saleh's family said in a statement after his death. ""Fahim is more than what you are reading. He is so much more. His brilliant and innovative mind took everyone who was a part of his world on a journey and he made sure never to leave anyone behind.""

Investigators had been exploring whether the killing could have been related to Saleh's business dealings.

Apartments in the 10-story building where Saleh's remains were found sell for more than $2 million. The building was completed in 2017 as part of a wave of gentrification in the neighbourhood.

1538,"SASKATOON -- A representative from the family of Ashley Morin said they do not want the man who made an offensive Facebook post to lose his job or be charged.

Instead, they are pushing for him to receive education about racism, and missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls.

On Friday, Alex Johannesson posted a photo on Facebook of a lineup of vehicles on the Highway 16 overpass in Saskatoon during a walk to honour Ashley Morin, a missing North Battleford woman.

In the post, Johannesson said the walk was holding up traffic and for someone to “run through these jokers.”

On Friday, the Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations called the post “highly offensive and disturbing,” and urged the man’s employer and the Saskatchewan Hockey Association to cut ties with Johannesson, who is a minor hockey president in Waldheim.

Redhead Equipment, the company he works at, and the association both told CTV News they are looking into the incident.

Saskatoon police also confirmed they are investigating the post, but are respecting the Morin family’s wishes to focus on compassion and education.

Manuela Valle-Castro, coordinator of the Saskatoon Anti-Racism Network, said it’s important to address the root of the problem by educating people about systemic racism.

“It’s not about shaming individuals. It’s not about particular individuals, it’s really about how normalized anti-Indigenous racism is on the Prairies and how comfortable people feel making these kinds of dehumanizing comments just in passing,” she said.

Russell McAuley, a team member with the Saskatoon Anti-Racism Network, agrees and said education is a life-long process.

“It’s important to acknowledge that just because these incidents are being publicized doesn’t mean they didn’t happen before because historically this is how we’ve always been treated as Indigenous people but I think it’s important that now we’re able to share our stories,” he said.

McAuley adds that it shouldn’t only be on black, Indigenous and people of colour (BIPOC) to educate the public but for people of all backgrounds to come together and be allies, and stand up to racism.

1540,"Carly Beath has finally finished designing her dream music room. The decor was inspired by one of her favourite TV shows, Twin Peaks. Its floors are decked out in a dizzying black-and-white chevron pattern. Lush red curtains hang from ceiling to floor.

Now that the design is complete, Beath can equip her music room with some eclectic instruments — a harp, a marimba. To acquire these unwieldy instruments, all she needs to do is fork over a few thousand bells to two raccoon-like shopkeepers named Timmy and Tommy and the items are hers.

Beath’s music room, the raccoon pair and bells as currency don’t exist in real life. They’re all creations within the newest release of Animal Crossing, a Nintendo Switch video game. Its latest edition, entitled New Horizons, came out on March 20 and coincided with the beginning of the lockdown, becoming the fastest-selling Nintendo Switch game ever in Japan. 1.88 million physical copies were sold there in its first weekend.

At its core, Animal Crossing is a town-building game where players set up their home base on an island and embark on activities like fishing, mining, chopping trees and catching insects to earn bells to purchase items like Beath’s treasured harp and marimba.

“It was nice to be able to do stuff in the game when you couldn’t do it outside,” Beath says. “When everything was stressful in the world, it was nice to relax and play the game for a while.”

Beath could travel to friends’ islands on Animal Crossing. “It was a good way to connect with people when we couldn’t be together in person,” she says.

Beath is one of millions of players now hooked on Animal Crossing as gamers took to their consoles in the early days of the lockdown. Verizon reported that U.S. video game usage was up 75 per cent during the first week of isolation while 57 to 71 per cent of people surveyed in the U.S., France, Germany and the U.K. said the time they spent playing video games increased, according to Nielsen data.

Kristopher Alexander is an assistant professor at Ryerson’s School of Media specializing in video games and esports. He plays the game at home with his wife and two children, aged seven and four.

“My kids are obsessed with it right now,” says Alexander, who describes his children’s preferred activities as “pole vaulting around the backyard” and designing lamps and shell necklaces.

Alexander believes that Animal Crossing’s popularity is due in part to the game’s flexible nature that adapts to a spectrum of ages and interests. “The goals are kind of what you make of it,” he says. “Some people are just interested in collecting butterflies. Others spend their days looking around for gold to dig.”

But Animal Crossing isn’t just about catching butterflies. After a few months of playing the game. Alexander is aware of the capitalist principles that drive it. “At first I had a tent,” he recalls. “Then I was offered a loan of 98,000 bells to build a house. You don’t have to get out of debt, but there’s pressure to pay it off.”

Other functions, like the aptly-named “stalk market,” mirror its homophone financial product. “You can buy turnips once a week,” Beath explains. “Throughout the week, the price fluctuates and you can sell them to get bells back, but the price might go up or down. The price is different in everybody’s town at different times so you can visit other islands, sell turnips and make more money that way.”

Many in the game are saddled with debt, so the fluctuating price of root vegetables has some players resorting to greed and trickery. When visiting someone’s island to sell turnips, a player typically gives a courtesy gift or pays a fee to the host, but there are reports of users skirting these agreements to evade payment.

“Some people are plundering and breaking the rules in order to make bells more quickly,” Alexander says, pointing to a subReddit called Animal Crossing Turnip Exchange where players invite others to their islands for turnip exchange and report on the wrongdoings of dishonest players.

But the game also makes room for those seeking to do good. Another subReddit, NoFeeAC, gathers players to exchange goods for free and, in rare cases, give away high-value items. “The donation aspect of it is kind of heartwarming,” Alexander says. “Some people are willing to just be nice. And to be honest, I think that’s the true nature of Animal Crossing.”

At a time when Lysol wipes were being resold at extortionate costs and volunteer groups were buying groceries for vulnerable seniors, the greed and charity found within Animal Crossing isn’t unlike real life.

The game’s approximations of reality could be what makes it so satisfying to play when the world as we know it has gone awry. For Alexander and his daughters, who rely on their father’s hard-earned bells and e-labour to procure the shells and other items they desire, the game imitates real life a little too closely.

“I do the mundane tasks in the game like chopping trees, which to me, mirror a lot of the mundane tasks that I do in my regular life,” says Alexander with a laugh. “I would love to chop trees in order to pay down the real-life debt that I have, but that’s not possible in this world.”",Why Animal Crossing has become a pandemic hit,6,0.009177761004041995
1542,"Pain fades. But trauma stays.

It follows us down roadways and sidewalks, into our schools and neighbourhoods — it changes the very infrastructure of our lives.

The legacy of social trauma left by COVID-19 will do this quite literally, experts say, shaping the way we plan and build Toronto and its surrounding regions over the coming decade.

“Overall what we have to do is get our minds around the fact that it’s not the ‘things’ that matter anymore, it’s the people,” says James McKellar, a real estate and infrastructure expert at York University’s Schulich School of Business.

“And we have to begin to understand that cities are for people and that we have done a terrible job in accommodating certain people,” McKellar says.

A more comforting, accommodating city, attuned to pedestrians and cyclists and less dependent on hurtling trains and beeping traffic, would be the best therapy for COVID-19’s trauma, McKellar and other city planning experts say.

It won’t be new-subway sexy.

Rather it means wider sidewalks, safer street signals and crossings, neighbourhoods filled in with “gentle development,” better parks and hundreds of additional kilometres of bike paths and lanes.

It will also mean the eradication or fundamental alteration of the shameful long-term-care facilities we offer our elderly — places whose human warehouse horrors and pitiful staffing strategies the virus so vividly exposed.

And all together — due to the need for closer, safer communities and the overcoming of crushing government debt that COVID-19 survival required — that means a scaling down of infrastructure projects and ideas as we move toward Toronto 2030.

“I’m not saying don’t build the transit and so forth, but let’s not assume that the big problems are going to be solved by big infrastructure,” McKellar says.

“In many ways, the problems are going to be solved by a lot of small things that just make the city more livable.”

This might mean something as simple as building more playgrounds, McKellar says.

Or, says Ryerson University’s Cherise Burda, it might mean something as radical as replacing a planned subway expansion with a far cheaper dedicated bus-route strategy; so-called bus rapid transit (BRT).

BRT provides buses with their own laneways, separate from those bearing automobile traffic.

“If we’re looking at limited resources (because of COVID-19 expenditures), there’s never been a better time to look at the business case for building transit infrastructure,” says Burda, head of Ryerson’s City Building Institute.

“And I think a really good example of that is the Scarborough subway. I know people don’t want to talk about that again, but that’s a $5-billion project,” she says.

Burda says that money would be better spent on building a vastly cheaper and longer bus rapid transit network — like the one that criss-crosses Ottawa — in Scarborough and other underserved areas of the city.

The three-stop Scarborough line could take 15 years to build; bus rapid transit routes could be moving before the decade is through, and provide faster transit along poorly served corridors like Jane St., Dufferin St., Steeles Ave. W. and Finch Ave E.

“And you could do all of that for less than the cost to build six kilometres of Scarborough subway,” Burda says.

She also says the city should more seriously pursue its existing cycling plan, updated last year, which would place every Toronto resident within one kilometre of a designated cycling path.

The University of Toronto’s Eric Miller, a planning and transportation expert, says many of the things on his list of infrastructure priorities would have been there pre-COVID-19, and that the virus has only highlighted their importance.

Like Burda, he would include far more buses, with underserved neighbourhoods in the city’s outskirts at the top of the list.

“We’ve always been so fixated on, ‘Let’s build the big subway, let’s talk about spending tens of billions of dollars,’ ” says Miller, director of U of T’s Transportation Research Institute.

“But the really big impact we could have on improving travel in this region ... is much better surface transit,” he says.

This would include in particular a far greater number of buses along existing roadways in the city’s suburban regions, running with traffic-signal priority to make them move more quickly, Miller says.

For people living some distance from bus stops, which tend to be on arterial roads in the suburbs, scheduled ride-sharing programs could take passengers the “first and last mile” of their daily commute, he says.

“The importance of transit has been highlighted by COVID-19, and we have this huge question of, ‘How do we move people if we can’t crowd them onto buses?’ ” Miller says.

He says expanded and faster bus service would allow people to more easily physically distance on the vehicles, and bring more equitable transit to areas where many of the essential workers who are bringing us through the pandemic live.

“And surface transit is something you can do ... in very short times,” Miller says.

“So over the next 10 years, we could dramatically improve how we deliver surface transit, particularly to places like Scarborough and Etobicoke, not to mention Mississauga and so forth.”

Miller’s infrastructure list for the next decade would also place decent, affordable housing near the top.

“We know we have a housing problem, certainly in the city of Toronto, more generally in the region,” he says. “And we talk about it, but we don’t do anything about it.”

The virus has only highlighted the perils of this inaction.

“In these COVID-19 days, where is the disease spreading? The disease spreads first of all where too many people have to ride buses (together), but also where too many people are overcrowded,” Miller says.

Packing large or multiple families into small apartments or houses is a key disease vector, Miller says.

And these tightly housed people are often among the essential workers who are lifting us through the current crisis.

“Hopefully we’ve come to appreciate how important, how essential these sorts of workers are — who we pay minimum wage and who we don’t orient our policies toward, whether it’s housing or transportation,” Miller says.

“COVID-19 is highlighting how important these things are and how inequitable in particular these things are.”

The inequities revealed by COVID-19 have been most stark and frightening in the region’s long-term-care homes, several of which have been decimated by illness and understaffing.

“It’s been a shambles clearly. The devastation that has occurred with COVID-19 in these homes is just heartbreaking, to say the least,” Miller says.

“Clearly that system is completely broken and needs complete reinvention,” he says.

The first order of business, Miller says, would be to shift the entire long-term-care system to the public sector, where much better oversight and wage and working conditions can be enforced.

On the infrastructure side, however, Burda says the homes must also shrink in size and be enfolded within local communities.

“Rather than warehousing seniors in big facilities in remote areas, we need to think about making them part of the neighbourhood,” she says.

“More facilities, better rooted in the neighbourhood, rather than bigger facilities far away.”

However it’s done, Miller says, better long-term care is a moral imperative.

“If nothing else changes five years from now, if we don’t have a vastly superior long-term-care system for the province, then shame on all of us, we have failed miserably,” he says.

Among other infrastructure considerations, McKellar says COVID-19 trauma has almost certainly ensured people will be more comfortable gathering outside rather than indoors for the foreseeable future.

And that means Toronto should launch European-style projects to reclaim roadways from cars — either permanently or periodically — in many parts or the city.

“What you find in Europe is that on a nice day a whole area of the road gets taken over by seating,” he says.

“We’ve already said the car gets about 50 per cent of the city and we get the rest. Well, we might not be able to give the car 50 per cent any more.”

A fluid transition from cars to patio seats on the roadways might also require getting rid of sidewalk curbs, as some European cities have done, McKellar says.

“We’ve chopped the city up and said, ‘Well, even if there are no cars on the road you can’t go on the road, it’s called jaywalking,’ ” he says.

“So we’re going to have to change our attitude toward the public environment and small things. Like, on every street, do we really want those big curbs is something we’ll have to decide.”

McKellar also sees the potential to bring amenities closer to the mental comfort of our homes through a better, more intense use of the city’s school sites.

“Another example I would use is the stupidity of school sites ... we have huge assets in the school systems,” he says, noting that many of these sites could accommodate far more city services.

“We’re still in silos, where we build a library, we build a school, we build a health centre. Why can’t we start to put those things together and make it convenient for people?”

Indeed, McKellar sees such integration as a partial solution to the long-term-care crisis — especially for facilities that offer retirement-home levels of care.

“Right now, the models that we use is old people go to old folks homes, children go to daycare centres,” he says.

“Well, my mother was at a home in Calgary where the daycare centre was in the seniors home, and it brought such life and joy to those seniors.”

Burda says neighbourhoods could also become more self-sufficient and livable by supporting locally focused infrastructure like cycling lanes and “gentle” lowrise development to fill in the city’s existing residential neighbourhoods.

She says Toronto should pursue sidewalk, bike route and development projects that would place everyday needs like groceries, medical care and schools within 15 minutes of every resident.

Small-bore infrastructure projects such as intersection and crosswalk improvements that make it easier and safer to travel on foot — as laid out in the city’s Vision Zero plan — would help in this quarter-hour goal, Burda says.

McKellar says a reluctance to build things like integrated school and library nodes or smaller-scale infrastructure was often based on a desire to maximize the economic stimulus that public works could provide.

“But let’s not use (that) excuse, let’s go back and use the infrastructure we have and make it more people friendly,” he says.

“And all the new infrastructure should exemplify new ways of thinking that put people back in the equation.”

Such smaller-scale infrastructure building would also be easier on a hugely depleted public purse, as governments climb out of the fiscal canyon that COVID-19 continues to dredge.

There is a huge reserve of private capital, especially within big pension funds and the like, that is eager to fund new for-profit infrastructure, McKellar says.

“For example, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board is heavily investing in charging stations for electric vehicles,” he says.

“There is something that is going to have a huge environmental benefit if we can entice more and more people into it. Electric buses would be another one.”

Miller says the promotion of electric vehicles and the infrastructure needed to support them across the city and beyond would be a major step in the fight against climate change — an even more existential threat than COVID-19.

“We have to keep our eyes on what’s coming down the pike, and what’s coming down the pike is climate change,” he says of our infrastructure planning.

“We’ll be able to get our buses, but the buses may be underwater because the roads keep flooding.”

Private institutional capital could also flow into new and better data delivery if — as some expect — governments choose to regulate such systems, McKellar says.

“I think we’re coming to the point where we’re saying, ‘Shouldn’t this be a regulated utility?’ ” he says.

“And if it is a regulated utility, a pension fund would say, ‘That’s perfect for us, we’ll build a system and the government will set the rate.’ ”

Of course any infrastructure planning for the city and beyond depends on getting the virus under control.

And though people are optimistic that a vaccine or effective therapy will be found in the near future, COVID-19 could linger for years.

“Sometimes you just need a little help getting back on track, and that’s where a payday loan from MyCanadaPayday.com can help,” says Sundeep Thind, manager of MyCanadaPayday’s Surrey office.

When that tax refund comes in, it’s easy to see it as “free” money to treat yourself to something fun – a weekend away, or special purchase you’ve been eyeing for awhile.

But remember, your refund is actually a percentage of your own hard-earned income, so if you really want to get the most from your refund, it pays to pay yourself first:

1. Start an emergency fund: Your tax refund is the perfect opportunity to start your emergency fund – money set aside in case of situations like income loss or unexpected car repairs. Start with as much as you can afford, building up over time until you have enough to cover three months of bills. When the unexpected happens, you’ll be prepared.

2. Send it directly to savings: Setting up direct deposit allows quicker access to your refund, and can make it a lot easier to save that money: instead of sending it to your primary chequing account, direct your refund right to your savings!

3. Pay down your credit: Most can benefit from paying off credit card debt. If you have multiple cards, put your refund onto the card with the highest interest rate to save money over time in interest charges, and boost your credit score!

4. Put it toward a major financial goal: Maybe it’s time for a more reliable car or to think about buying your first house. A larger downpayment can make major purchases much more affordable longterm, lowering the amount paid over time and offering long-term advantages like lower interest rates. Your tax refund can help make your financial dreams a reality!

5. Start a retirement account: While retirement savings can be tough to commit to with so much else tugging on your wallet, every bit helps. If you’ve already started saving through an RRSPs, RIFs or Tax-Free Savings Account, your tax return can give your savings a boost. Even better, that contribution will lighten your tax burden next year!

6. Invest in the online stock market: Today online investing is becoming easier and much more accessible, allowing beginners and professionals alike to create a diversified portfolio. Robo-advisors provide sophisticated algorithms, comprehensive dashboards and interactive reporting that allow you to take a set-it-and-forget it approach and still see long-term benefits.

7. Spend it (wisely) on yourself: There’s no harm in spending a little of your tax refund on yourself, but as with so many things, the key is moderation. Maybe it’s time to pay for that certification or class, or invest in a stand-up desk. These are ways to use your refund to invest in yourself!

When you need short-term help

If your refund was not as much as you were expecting, or worse yet, you end up owing this year, easy, safe and secure options are available through Canada’s licensed payday loan specialists.

“Sometimes you just need a little help getting back on track, and that’s where a payday loan from MyCanadaPayday.com can help,” says Sundeep Thind, manager of MyCanadaPayday’s Surrey office.

1546,"Meet Tyler Watts, St. Stephen’s Community House

In 2019, St. Stephen’s Community House lost provincial funding for its overdose prevention services program. Then the pandemic happened. For drug users and people in life-threatening withdrawal, support services like ERs, detox beds, shelters, drop-ins, and doctors and psychiatrists have become hard to access, according to Tyler Watts, a coordinator of overdose prevention services at St. Stephen’s. Many services have also gone phone- or web-based, which is a barrier for people that are on a fixed income or homeless.

Social isolating is also often impossible for St. Stephen’s clients—and dangerous. Watts usually urges clients to never use drugs alone. “But how do you maintain that in a society that is now told to isolate?” he asks. “Plus, they’re being criminalized for being on the streets and not isolating because there is nowhere to go. They struggle to find a drug supply that isn’t toxic and deadly and it is increasingly hard to find spaces they can use and feel safe.”

Now, every morning, a larger-than-normal line of clients snakes around the building. Only two people are allowed in at a time. If someone overdoses, employees must get into full PPE before helping. “It can be quite distressing when you’re looking at someone turning blue and you’re trying to squeeze goggles onto your face before jumping in to save them,” says Watts.

Recently, Watts says, a woman arrived at the site in tears because she had been wandering around all night, looking for somewhere to use the washroom. “She told me she’d never felt so stripped of her dignity,” Watts remembers. “It makes me so sad that people can’t even get their most basic needs met.” Still, Watts soldiers on. “The reason I come to work now is the same as it’s always been: to save lives. The pandemic hasn’t changed that—only made it that much more important.”

Meet Kylie Beatty and Theresa Hirschberg, Sistering

On any given day, more than 9,000 Toronto citizens experience homelessness. Many of them are even further marginalized. “There weren’t—and still aren’t—many specialized services that focus on women, and trans and non-binary folks,” says Theresa Hirschberg, a team coordinator at Sistering, the multi-service agency’s Parkdale Pandemic Response Site. “Sistering provides a collaborative space to advocate for the most vulnerable folks in the city.”

Before the pandemic, an average day for Hirschberg involved building relationships with clients, crisis intervention and referring people out to collaborative agencies. While the pandemic rages on, their clients still need help. “Closing the drop-in and shifting to a respite program was that ‘whoa’ moment,” says Kylie Beatty, who is also a team coordinator at Sistering’s response site. “It was clear that access to services had changed significantly, and the way we were connecting would have to change.”

So what does an average day look like now? “No two days are alike,” Beatty says. “But we’re still checking in with folks and making sure we’re all supporting each other and staying safe.” Each day, the team coordinators read up on the ever-changing interaction guidelines, and they’re outfitted in personal protective equipment (PPE). They also must screen every client for potential COVID-19 exposure, along with adhering to the distancing requirements. “We had to redefine our service model but still keep that level of participant focus and care,” says Hirschberg. “The pandemic has highlighted the willingness and capacity to come together as a community. [Clients] reassure each other and show generosity to each other—and seeing the community that they have developed in the space has been heartwarming.”",Community crusaders,6,0.20943697126947192

Over nearly two decades in financial services he’s learned a lot about everything from residential financing to small-business loans, commercial buy-outs and agriculture equipment financing, but the bigger lesson was more personal.

“Working for banks allowed me to reflect on who I want to be and who I want to represent,” Nathan says.

He realized he cared most about the financial wellbeing of his clients, and didn’t like the pressure to cross-sell chequing accounts and credit cards. Now that he’s self-employed as a mortgage broker, he works for you — not the bank.

Make a date with your mortgage broker

Nathan says the first step of any home purchase is a visit with your mortgage broker. Whether you’re a first-time buyer or already own a home, you don’t want to fall in love with a property only to have the application process fall through.

“It’s always good to know where you stand and know what’s possible.”

With that in mind, Nathan shares three tips to empower borrowers and simplify the application experience:

1. Know your budget – Dig into your finances and get a solid sense of your monthly income and expenses to help you decide what kind of monthly payment you’re comfortable carrying.

“Don’t forget to include things like property taxes, heating costs and, potentially, strata fees when making your budget,” Nathan says.

2. Know your credit score – It’s a good idea to review your credit report annually to make sure there are no surprises. Some clients assume their credit’s fantastic but discover a long-forgotten event is affecting their rating. By checking your score annually, you’ll have a good sense of where you stand and won’t be scrambling for extra documentation at the last minute.

“Many people don’t realize that you can call and talk with the credit provider if an item is reporting incorrectly on your credit report or even ask for forgiveness on one-off late payments. All of which can improve your score,” Nathan says.

When buying his first house years ago, Nathan learned of a reporting error that was affecting his credit score. His credit report included a chequing account that a financial institution forgot to properly close.

“If I’d checked my credit earlier, my home purchase wouldn’t have been delayed.”

3. Know your documents – Knowing who to ask and where to look for documents takes time, so Nathan recommends organizing your paperwork before you start house hunting. “It may take time to figure out whether the documents you need are hiding in a filing cabinet or an email,” Nathan says.

It’s less stressful to track down documents from your accountant, employer, filing cabinets and emails before your dream house hits the market.

1549,"As one of the fastest-growing industries in Canada, data science has become a lucrative career path for many. That’s because evidence suggests that artificial intelligence — or AI — will be one of the leading economic drivers of our time, with an estimated worldwide business value of $3.9 trillion USD by the year 2022.

Canada has quickly become a leader in the AI space, with research strength and transformative startups. In fact, Montreal has the highest concentration of researchers and students of deep learning (a subgroup of machine learning in AI) in the world, and Toronto has the highest concentration of AI startups in the world. As AI and machine learning are increasingly changing and improving how we do business, companies don’t want to be left behind. And with more companies adopting these technologies, the demand for high-quality talent is on the rise.



The university recognized the demand for data scientists within organizations, and the small talent pool, and decided to bridge the gap. The program aims to help put students on the right path toward a career as a data analyst, data engineer, data scientist, or AI practitioner.

Students in the program have the opportunity to work in cross-functional teams to translate learnings into business insights and help guide business decisions. “The majority of our students are mature students who have some work experience and are looking to reskill or upskill within their careers,” says Beitinjaneh, “and what they learn can be applied directly to their work.”

Jean-Olivier Pitre, a data engineer with the Société de transport de Montréal (STM), Montreal’s municipal transport service, enrolled in the program to advance his skills in turning data into insight, and it paid off. “Because of the advanced analytics work that I produced with my team on how to optimize service on the Montréal metro's orange line, I received the Coup de Coeur STM award, an award given to STM employees who did astounding work for the customer experience and/or directly contributed to our 2025 organizational plan,” he says. “This wouldn’t have been possible without this program. McGill gave me the knowledge and the tools, but especially the roadmap and strategy on how to generate value from data in order to make a positive impact in the real world — in our case, to millions of weekly users”

1550,"TORONTO -- When Erin O’Brien opened up her email last week, she was shocked to find a notice from the federal government informing her that she would not receive her Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) payment the following week.

The Ottawa mother said the email explained that she was receiving the smaller amount in June because she was given a $2,000 advance when she collected her first CERB payment in April.

“I didn’t realize that this was even going to happen,” she told CTVNews.ca during a telephone interview from her home in Ottawa on Wednesday. “I thought it would just be all in the end that they would fix things. Not halfway through.”

O’Brien is far from alone in her surprise at the sudden reduction in CERB payments this month.

Dozens of Canadians have written in to CTVNews.ca to share how they, too, received word from the government last week notifying them that they weren’t eligible for the full $2,000 in June because of the earlier advance.

Kimberly Drew said she will only be receiving $500 this month, instead of the $2,000 she was expecting because of the advance payment she collected in April.

“It was not explained well when the payment came out so it was a bit of a shock,” she said. “I am frustrated.”

WHY ARE THERE REDUCED PAYMENTS NOW?

According to one of the Service Canada emails a CERB claimant received and forwarded to CTVNews.ca, the extra $2,000 that some people collected at the beginning of the program was an “advance of four weeks of the CERB, which was issued in order to get money in your pocket as quickly as possible.”

“Because of this advance, you will not receive a payment when you complete your next report. This is equivalent to the first two-week period of the advance. Please continue completing reports. This shows that you are eligible for all weeks of the CERB, including the four weeks of the benefit covered by the advance payment,” the message continued.

The notice also informed claimants that CERB would be extended by another eight weeks with a maximum payable amount of $12,000 over 24 weeks, which equals $2,000 per month for 6 months.

Ashley Michnowski, the director of communications for Employment Minister Carla Qualtrough, explained that CERB was initially intended to be available for a total of 16 weeks to a maximum of $8,000 before the extension.

Because those Canadians who were eligible for Employment Insurance (EI) received an extra $2,000 when the CERB benefit began, they had reached their maximum payable amount in June.

“As a result, starting the week of June 8th, some people would have received their full $8,000 initial CERB entitlement for the first initial 16 weeks and will therefore not receive a regular CERB payment this month,” Qualtrough’s spokesperson said in a statement to CTVNews.ca on Wednesday.

The minister’s office said eligible CERB claimants will receive money again at the beginning of July at the start of the next pay period now that the benefit has been extended for an additional eight weeks.

“In order to ensure claimants receive the available funding through the extension of CERB, they should continue to complete their biweekly reports,” the statement said.

'CLEAR, CONCISE, AND CONSISTENT DIRECTION'

There was some initial confusion when the CERB benefit was first rolled out in April because some claimants received more money than others.

For example, some people who applied for both employment insurance (EI) and CERB received two payments, even though no one is eligible to receive payments from both programs simultaneously.

As another example, those who were already on EI may have also received more than the initial $2,000 CERB payment when they were switched over to the new program because of residual EI benefits they had already qualified for.

At the time, Qualtrough reassured Canadians the additional deposits were not mistakes and recipients would be contacted about next steps.

“The CRA and Service Canada are working together to ensure that these situations are reconciled and payments do not exceed the maximum amount allowed per individual of $8,000 over a 16-week period,” she said in early April.

“So it won't necessarily be a clawback situation. It might be, but you can’t apply for more than the $8,000.”

However, days earlier Treasury Board President Jean-Yves Duclos created some confusion when he said the double payments were paid retroactively for the four-week period dating back to March 15, the first day people could apply for CERB.

A spokesperson from Qualtrough’s office clarified later that week that individuals who received $4,000 collectively from both the EI and CERB program would be contacted.

Conservative employment critic MP Dan Albas said the confusion and panic some Canadians are experiencing now could have been avoided if they were told what the $2,000 advance was for when they first received it.

“We recognize that during a crisis things happen quickly, but it’s really up to the government to provide clear, concise, and consistent direction,” he told CTVNews.ca during a telephone interview on Wednesday.

Albas said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has had multiple opportunities during his daily press briefings to bring Canadians up to speed on this issue and to let those people who received extra payments know what is expected of them.

“That would have been the responsible thing to do because ultimately, leaders take responsibility for mistakes,” he said. “And unfortunately, people are now at the end of the month just before the rent comes due, are being told that they will have considerably less support than they were planning.”

NDP MP and employment critic Daniel Blaikie echoed those sentiments when he said that it is “inexcusable” the government hasn’t made more of an effort to provide them with proper notice. He said it would have been easy to put up a reminder about the upcoming reduced payments on the Service Canada website a month ago for people to see when they log in to file their biweekly reports to claim their benefits.

Blaikie also said that he doesn’t understand why the government is reclaiming that advance money now when they have extended the program by another eight weeks.

“There is no need to do this right now,” he said during a telephone interview with CTVNews.ca on Wednesday. “They’re [the government] going to collect the money one way or another eventually. Doing it in a way that gives Canadians as much lead time as possible benefits CERB recipients and I don't think it does any harm to the government.”

The Better Business Bureau (BBB) says fraudsters are using Amazon to deliver random products to customers throughout North America. The victims of the technique, called 'brushing', may not understand why they're being given products for free.

At face value, the reason for these strange deliveries may be innocuous, the BBB says. Most often, the companies are using your address and Amazon information to send you products and then using your name to write a glowing online review that would, in turn, prompt higher legitimate sales.

However, the BBB says the fact they've gotten hold of your personal information is bad news for you.

""Certainly, they have your name and address, and possibly, your phone number and a password. Once the information is out there, it could be used for numerous crooked enterprises,"" the agency says in a release. ""If your credit card is linked to your Amazon account, they could use it to purchase the products that are delivered to you.""

If you notice this happening, the BBB says the first thing to do would be to contact Amazon immediately through their customer service page. By going to the official Amazon webpage, you will be able to ensure they conduct a proper investigation and take action.

Second, you should change your passwords immediately and take additional steps such as checking your credit report and bills for strange payments.

""You may (also) want to consider a password manager service to improve account security,"" the BBB says.

There is a good side to the scam though. All those products that were sent to your address are yours to keep.

1561,"When the COVID-19 crisis upended the world as we knew it, grocery stores remained sturdy beacons of near normalcy. The way we shop has changed—socially distanced line-ups, one-way aisles, plexiglass cashier shields—but the vital relationship between supermarkets and their customers endures.

In this spirit, Sobeys Inc. launched the Community Action Fund, an initiative aimed at giving back to local communities by committing millions of dollars in donations to organizations helping those in need during these difficult times. The program is focused on creating localized solutions, empowering the company’s some 1,500-strong grocery and drugstore banners—including Safeway, Foodland, FreshCo, IGA and Lawtons—to decide how to best to support their neighbourhoods.

“Nobody has a better idea of what their local communities need now than our frontline store teams across the country,” says Michael Medline, president and CEO of Empire Company Ltd, owner of Sobeys. “It’s inspiring to see how quickly they banded together to give back to people in need.”

For store managers like Don McWilliam of Foodland in Stratford, Ont., the program presented an opportunity to lift up a fellow small business. Upon learning that local spirit-maker Junction 56 Distillery was pivoting its production to create much-needed hand sanitizer—donating much of it to high-risk essential services like shelters, and selling the rest to the public at cost—McWilliam and his team knew they’d found a worthy endeavour. Their contribution—pre-purchasing $1,000 worth of product to be distributed for free—helped two-fold: sanitizer would reach the hands of Canadians faster while helping to alleviate the economic stress faced by the craft distillery after generously transitioning its business.

Standing behind his community feels natural for McWilliam, crisis or not. “I’ve always looked out for the underdog,” he says. Growing up, he remembers that grocery stores were always giving back, a tradition he’s keen to preserve.

Another casualty of the COVID-19 crisis has been food security amongst our most vulnerable populations. Sobeys Inc. and its dedicated partners have stepped up to the plate. Across Ontario, the company has donated $300,000 to resource-strapped food banks like the Daily Bread Food Bank, Second Harvest and regional organizations in North York, Mississauga, Kitchener-Waterloo, Thunder Bay and Ottawa. The company’s contributions—financial support plus donated gift cards, thousands of prepackaged hampers and cases of pantry essentials—helps those who need it most.

Through the Community Action Fund, Myles Power, store manager at FreshCo University & Bridge in Waterloo, Ont. was able to present $1,500 worth of $50 gift cards to his local chapter of Food4Kids. Since 2016, the non-profit organization has been dedicated to serving snacks and meals to children through school programs. But in light of school closures, Food4Kids was struggling to get food on the plates of kids who needed it.

As a grandfather of nine and a two-decade-long owner of the FreshCo store, where he’s employed generations of family members, Power couldn’t fathom the thought of any child in his community going hungry. “This one is close to my heart,” he says.

The concept of family, and of making a difference in the lives of others, has been a throughline within Sobeys Inc. since its inception in Nova Scotia over 100 years ago.

Even as the increased risks and mitigating precautionary measures descended on the stores, this “family first” attitude helped to unite the staff at the Sobeys Queensway location in Etobicoke, Ont. “Everyone looks after each other and helps out, chips in when needed,” says store manager Shawn Bergman. “If someone’s down, we’re there to pick them up.”

When it came time to decide how they’d allocate their share of the Community Action Fund, the Sobeys Queensway staff turned their efforts to nearby St. Joseph’s Health Centre, which recently reported a COVID-19 outbreak. Bergman and his team donated $2,000 worth of Sobeys gift cards to hardworking hospital staff, giving them a chance to pick up lunch or stock their fridge without worry after a long shift.

1567,"TORONTO -- Not all seniors are cheering when it comes to government aid.

On the one hand the government is helping high-risk Canadians get through a tough financial situation. Government benefits are seen by many as the financial lifeline they needed as jobs were lost, income reduced and financial futures were put on shaky ground due to the pandemic.

On the other hand the government will be taking back some of the financial lifeline it provided. The government benefits such as the CERB will be taxed and is considered to be income. Some aren't thinking about this today but it will become a issue when 2020 taxes are filed.

Others such as seniors who currently qualify for the Guaranteed Income Supplement are worried government aid might actually compromise their lifestyle. This fear of struggling financially isn't new to seniors who are vulnerable and barely making ends meet. Especially those who collect the Guaranteed Income Supplement and maybe generate a little bit of income from a side hustle yet still manage to come in below threshold limits.

In 2020 seniors are eligible to receive GIS if they are: A single senior with a total annual income of less than $18,600. A couple both receiving Old Age Security and with a combined annual income of less than $24,576.

Fear is mounting among low-income seniors who are receiving government aid and who may also be living in subsidized housing that is income-tested. The government aid they receive via CERB may push them out of the eligibility requirements for relief on rent. If this happens they will be hit twice - potentially higher rent and taxation on the benefit. Add to this the concern the GIS could be clawed, which has some wondering if the government benefit will do more harm than good to their financial situation.

Now to be fair, not all government aid will be taxed. It doesn't apply to the one-time special payment seniors will be receiving this week. To add some context, there are currently 6.7 million seniors who are eligible for the OAS pension and 2.2 million who are eligible for the GIS.

Where it gets sticky is if you are a senior, low income and collecting the GIS, some will still qualify for the government program even if they have a side hustle that brings them in a little extra money. If they are no longer making that little bit of extra money due to COVID-19 they now qualify for the CERB. The problem is that it isn't tax-free money and given the amount it could be more than they were making and push their income higher. This may result in them earning too much to qualify for low-income housing.

As the government views financial aid and those most vulnerable, there is a reasonable expectation and case to be made for exemptions for some low-income seniors collecting GIS and who qualified for CERB So the question is: do they or don't take advantage of the government benefit?",Pattie Lovett-Reid: Why not all seniors are cheering government aid,6,0.3436021383024037
1568,"TORONTO -- When most people think about making a mistake on their tax return, their fears often revolve around checking the wrong box or missing key facts that might lead the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) to audit them.

But, according to experts, the costliest tax mistakes made by Canadians are usually related to missed deductions and a lack of understanding about whether they need to file.

Here are five costly mistakes to avoid when putting together your return this year:

NOT FILING AT ALL

If you didn’t make a single dime during the tax year, failing to file a tax return will only leadto more money being left on the table.

“One of the most common mistakes is not filing because you don’t think you have enough income, or you didn’t have an income at all,” Lisa Gittens, senior tax professional at H&R Block, told CTVNews.ca by phone earlier this month.

“As long as you are living in Canada you should be filing.”

According to Gittens, students, young adults, stay-at-home parents and the unemployed are the most prone to this mistake, which prevents them from claiming certain tax credits and benefits that all Canadians are entitled to, regardless of their income bracket.

This includes the Canada child benefit, the universal child care benefit, and the GST/HST credit, and provincial credits like the Climate Action Incentive. Keep in mind that both parents must file a tax return in order to receive the Canada child benefit.

You can also claim things like medical expenses, educational expenses, and child care expenses if you didn’t make any income. And, as Gittens notes, the more expenses you can write off, the greater chance you'll get a refund.

Gittens notes that it’s especially important for students to file their returns in order to build credit with the CRA.

“Many students don’t file because they have no income, but once they graduate and start earning income, they have no credit with the CRA,” she explained.

NOT CLAIMING MEDICAL EXPENSES

Medical expenses not covered by provincial health services or benefits plans are another commonly neglected area, especially for low- and middle-income Canadians.

“When your medical expenses are high in comparison to your income you get a medical expense supplement that refunds a portion of the medical expenses you claimed,” said Gittens.

This type of expense can include eye exams, dental expenses not covered by insurance, medical supplies and travel expenses. This year, certain cannabis products are now considered eligible for the medical expense tax credit, if you have a prescription.

You can claim your total eligible medical expenses, minus three per cent of your income or the set maximum for the tax year ($2,352), whichever is less.

For future tax years, Gittens recommends completing all of your miscellaneous medical exams and yearly check-ups towards the end of the year to capitalize on the return and make it easier to organize your receipts.

“When you get all of those eye exams and dental exams taken care of at the end of the year the receipts are all there for you to claim on your taxes,” she said.

MISREPORTING INCOME FROM YOUR SIDE JOB

Whether you are making extra money by driving an Uber, hosting people at your Airbnb, or earning a little side cash online, you want to make sure you are recording those earnings as self-employed income.

“You’ll want to be sure that you’re also contributing to the Canada Pension Plan based on those earnings,” notes Gittens.

If you plan on claiming any expenses related to that income (i.e. expenses related to your vehicle, house, or travel expenses), make sure that you have the receipts to back it up.

MISSING INVESTMENT INCOME

Before filing, make note of your investment streams and make sure you have received a statement for each of them. These annual statements should show the total income you earned during the tax year and the total expenses incurred, such as investment adviser fees (which are deductible).

“Income sometimes gets missed because people don’t understand how much they’ve earned on their investments each year,” Armando Minicucci, tax specialist at Grant Thornton, told CTVNews.ca by phone.

“This is generally the most common area where individual tax payers are reassessed.”

FILING TOO EARLY

The early bird doesn’t always get the worm, especially when it comes to taxes.

“Those early filers who are hoping to get their refunds right away tend to miss certain documents, whether it be T4’s from their employers or investment slips from the bank,” Michael Davis, senior tax specialist at H&R Block, told CTVNews.ca by phone.

Not only could this cause you to make an amendment to your return, it could put you at risk of incurring penalties for misreporting your income if you make a habit of it.

“If you fail to report the same kind of income in back-to-back years it could result in penalties,” said Davis.

April 30 is the last day to file your 2019 income tax return. If you owe the CRA money, it must be paid by this date. Otherwise, you’ll face a late-filing penalty and daily interest chargeson your balance.

If you are self-employed, you have until June 15 to file your return. But keep in mind that if you owe taxes, you’ll still be required to pay your balance by the April 30 deadline.",Income tax: Common mistakes made on tax returns,6,0.07406193499957914
1569,"FREDERICTON -- The province of New Brunswick is offering a rebate to encourage people to take a staycation this summer.

Alma, N.B., motel owner Linda Lindsay says the plan offers hope.

""I am very excited by this program,"" Lindsay said. ""It really is going to incentivize people to travel in the province.""

Debra Cooper is visiting from Nova Scotia and would like to see the program extended to tourists from other bubble provinces.

""We are spending quite a bit of money to be here with our cottage, souvenirs and park entrance fees so it would be nice if all Maritimers were allowed the same,"" Cooper said.

The province says the initiative was developed by the Tourism Labour Force Adjustment Committee, which is made up of industry representatives from various sectors, including the Tourism Industry Association of New Brunswick.

""We understand the province's financial situation and we appreciate the support to the industry through this travel incentive program,"" said Alderdice. ""It will benefit our tourism operators and other economic sectors by encouraging New Brunswickers to travel more and spend time in their province this summer.""

The province says there are four types of expenses they will offer rebates on:

accommodations (such as hotels, motels, inns, B&Bs and campsites);

food and drink (such as restaurants and food trucks);

activities (such as entrance fees to attractions, museums, art galleries, cultural events and outdoor adventure activities); and

travel (such as vehicle rentals, ferries and parking).

Residents can apply for the 20 per cent rebate on eligible expenses up to $1,000.

To qualify for the rebate you must be:

a permanent resident of New Brunswick;

have valid and detailed receipts from registered New Brunswick businesses; and

have a paid overnight stay at a New Brunswick accommodation.

A list of eligible expenses and criteria is available online.

Applications for the rebate will be available online and must be submitted between Oct.1 and Oct. 30.

Anyone with questions about the program should contact the New Brunswick Tourism Department at explorenb@gnb.ca.

Another boost to the tourism industry could be on its way.

New Brunswick Premier Blaine Higgs recently floated the idea of opening the Atlantic bubble to people from the Gaspe region of Quebec.

""We would like to welcome folks from Quebec, but we want to make sure the health and welfare and the safety of the residents of New Brunswick is the number one priority,"" said Tourism, Heritage and Culture Minister Bruce Fitch.

1589,"WATERLOO — You will soon see Waterloo continue its overhaul of Silver Lake and Waterloo Park in the downtown, and construct a new skate park and outdoor plaza at the Albert McCormick recreation complex. City council chose contractors Monday for portions of upgrades that will cost almost $10 million in total. The recreation complex on Parkside Drive is getting a skateboard park, basketball court, splash plaza, climbing structure, seating areas, and public art in the form of outdoor benches.  “I’m so excited,” Coun. Angela Vieth said. She figures it will turn the community centre, with its library and two ice pads, into more than a place for children who can afford to play hockey. The complex is part of a neighbourhood with lower incomes. “It’s getting closer to becoming what I would consider a community hub,” Vieth said. “It’s been a long time coming.”  The upgrade will go where visitors currently park in 33 spaces. Lost spaces will be replaced by new parking spaces elsewhere at the complex. Construction is to start this summer and largely finish by the fall.  At Silver Lake and Waterloo Park in the downtown, council intends to realign Laurel Creek, remove the aging Lion’s Lagoon water park, and dredge and reconfigure the lake. The park is getting new pathways, a new boardwalk, fountain features, and a beach area.  Work on Silver Lake is expected to start this month and conclude in six months, weather permitting. Work on Laurel Creek was approved in May. Other work on Waterloo Park is to be advertised this summer. It’s expected that the overall lake and park project will be completed by the fall of 2021.  Council also voted Monday to reduce more speed limits or install signs or traffic-calming measures as part of its bid to make streets friendlier to pedestrians and cyclists during the COVID-19 pandemic. Various changes will be made on Sundew Drive, in the Old Abbey Road neighbourhood, and Waterloo Street.  Speed limits past five schools will be reduced to 30 km/h within the Eastbridge and Westvale neighbourhoods. Council has reduced other streets in those neighbourhoods to 40 km/h.

1590,"MONCTON, N.B. -- Two people who have been ""plate-shamed"" for their Ontario licence plates are speaking out about the backlash they have received from Maritimers.

In two separate cases, Ontario licence plates have been questioned in New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, and the tone of the response comes as a shock to those who are used to the warm Atlantic Canadian welcome.

Laurie Stewart, a councillor in the village of Petitcodiac, N.B., was enjoying a coffee in Salisbury on Monday.

He was parked in his son's rental car, which had Ontario licence plates, when he was approached by another vehicle.

""They also had their windows down and slowed down and started hollering at me to 'go home!"" and it wasn't just 'go home,' it wasn't nice words at all, and had their fingers out the windows,"" Stewart said.

Stewart says the resistance against plates outside the Atlantic bubble was a shock to him -- and not the welcoming Maritime behaviour he's used to.

""They didn't stop and ask why I was here,"" Stewart said.

There was a similar scenario on Prince Edward Island, where one woman from Ontario is staying at her cottage on the island.

After her 14-day isolation period, she went grocery shopping, where she was asked a series of screening questions, including if she had been outside of Atlantic Canada in the last two weeks to which she replied no and finished her shopping.

""As I was leaving, the security guard talked to me, he asked me whether or not that was my car, he pointed to my car with the Ontario plates, and I said, 'Yes' and he then asked me how long I had been in P.E.I. for,"" said Ontario resident Beverly Carlaw.

Carlaw says she felt she was being questioned a second time because of her plates.

She says she felt it was unwelcoming behaviour and what she calls ""not good for tourism.""

""It's the suspicion,"" she said. ""It's the notion of the 'other' of the person who 'doesn't belong' that comes out very clearly, and that's not how one identifies P.E.I.""

Many say they are feeling self-conscious driving around with licence plates from provinces outside the Atlantic bubble.",People with Ontario licence plates getting rude welcome from presumptuous Maritimers,6,0.3102432117958931

Toronto is getting a unique pop-up event where people can practise their downward dog in a private, geodesic dome outdoors.

Lmnts Outdoor Studio is hosting hot yoga and fitness classes on the grounds of Hotel X from June 21 to July 31.

The company is partnering with six local studios and their instructors, as well as special guests to offer a variety of classes.

“We found a very innovative way to practise safe hot yoga and fitness where you get an individual dome to yourself privately,” Lmnts event organizer Steve Georgive tells CP24. “And you actually have less interaction than being at the park or a regular retail store.”

How it works is 50 outdoor private, clear domes will be set up for users to have a personal fitness experience, all while maintaining physical distance during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Every person will be assigned their own dome which stands more than 2 metres tall and is 3 metres wide. Each dome has built-in heating where temperatures can exceed 37 degrees Celsius.

Lmnts says all domes will be cleaned and disinfected after every use to prevent the spread of the virus.

All classes are categorized based on the four elements: earth, water, air and fire.

Users must bring their own yoga mat to class. But if you forget yours Lmnts will be selling mats, plus water bottles and protein bars on site.

Lmnts will be offering five to six classes a day all week long from 8 to 10 p.m.

Interested participants are urged to secure a reservation online in advance as classes are expected to fill up fast.

With a variety of safety measures in place, the Payton and Buckle team welcomes you back to the store, says owner John Laanstra. Choose from a wide variety of summer-perfect styles at Payton and Buckle.

One of the Fraser Valley’s most popular locally owned shoe stores has reopened for business – and just in time for summer!

“We closed for two months to support the community’s efforts to prevent the spread of COVID-19, but with a variety of safety measures and sanitizing in place, we’re happy to welcome our customers back to the store,” says John Laanstra, owner of Payton and Buckle Fine Footwear in Chilliwack, Abbotsford and Pitt Meadows.

To maintain physical distancing protocols, only four customers are permitted inside at one time, and regular sanitizing of surfaces is happening throughout the day.

Recognizing the importance of fit for any shoe purchase, customers are permitted to try on shoes, Laanstra adds.

Step into a new summer style

The timing of Payton and Buckle’s reopening couldn’t be better, as we step outside and into a variety of warm-weather adventures – adventures that will be a lot more enjoyable with happy feet.

Whether it’s the trails or beach that beckon, it’s important to do it with shoes that provide the right support for your activity.

Fortunately, summer style doesn’t mean foregoing comfort, and conversely, quality and comfort can be super-stylish, Laanstra says. This is one case where you can have the best of both worlds, whether you’re shopping for walking shoes, sandals or flip-flops, or high-fashion shoes.

(Better yet, to welcome shoppers back to the stores following the recent closure, you’ll also find many of your regular-priced favourites at 25 per cent off, and sale footwear at an extra 35 per cent off!)

Brands like Vionic, for example, create “fashionable footwear with supportive footbeds,” giving you the comfort you want no matter the size and shape of your foot. In fact, many designs are adjustable to ensure the perfect fit.

Other popular choices include design-driven comfort styles from Josef Seibel, Clarks – created to let you walk longer and farther with less fatigue – FitFlop, for style and comfort with biomechanical technology, Ecco and Rieker.

Restaurant owner Paul Chaput was working at the time of the theft and said a customer stole the box while waiting for his meal.

""When I realized it was gone, I first thought it was put somewhere else,"" said Chaput. ""Then I realized, I said 'It's not just disappeared.' … I served the young gentleman that took the box.""

There was more than $200 in the box and it was meant to go to Outloud North Bay, a local LGBTQ+ hub space for children and families, to help with the cost of upkeep.

It costs about $1,500 a month to run the space.

""I was upset,"" said owner Seth Compton. ""The staff here and the owner here have done good things for Outloud North Bay.""

The restaurant said it has been extremely difficult to get donations for Outloud North Bay because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

""It's been really tough to raise money,"" said restaurant manager Lucie St. John. ""Seth has been putting his own money into it.""

After hearing about the theft, several local businesses and customers left generous donations, which total more than $1,000.

""It's been one person after another bringing money and donations,"" said St. John. ""My heart is full of gratitude.""

A giving city

Compton arrived to pick up some of the donated money and said seeing the generosity assures him North Bay is a giving city.

""I got up this morning and shed a few tears,"" said Compton. ""It's heartwarming to see a community coming together.""

Every Tuesday, Between The Bun staff wear shirts supporting Outloud North Bay and the LGBTQ+ community.

All tips on Tuesdays are donated to Outloud. Due to the theft, the restaurant decided all tips accepted on Thursday are going directly to the hub space, as well.

The owners have a simple message for the thief.

""I hope you really have time to sit down and think about what you're doing with your life,"" said Chaput.

The restaurant and Outloud said they are thankful customers and the community as a whole stepped up to replace the stolen cash.

1610,"The home of the Edmonton Oilers was flooded during a severe thunderstorm Thursday that saw torrential downpours and dime-size hail hammer down on the city.

Floodwaters and hail pooled inside Rogers Place’s Ford Hall Thursday evening, as seen from outside the building on the south side of 104 Avenue.

A spokesperson for Rogers Place confirmed in a tweet the facility had been damaged and had other “small leaks” but would not hamper plans for Edmonton’s plans to be a hub city for the NHL.

“A significant storm came through #yeg earlier this evening. As a result, #RogersPlace has suffered some water damage to the terminus of Ford Hall, along with some smaller leaks in other parts of the building,” read a tweet from the Rogers Place Twitter account.

“We are assessing the damage and at this time are confident that it will not hamper our planning and preparation and we will be ready to host the return of @NHL hockey as a hub city. We will share more information as it becomes available.”

Got a look at some of the flooding damage to the Rogers Centre from the outside. In one the halls here you can see it’s completely flooded, full of hail. The area is blocked off with caution tape and workers are out looking to be assessing the damage. #yeg pic.twitter.com/baXMCYVFoD — Lauren Boothby (@laurby) July 17, 2020

The storm had let up hours before, but by late Thursday handfuls of hail, chunked together like snow, floated on top of water which was a few centimetres deep and covered the entire room at Ford Hall. Yellow caution tape was wrapped around the exterior of the building.

A now-deleted video posted on Reddit, which appears to have been shot inside the facility, showed water streaming down from the ceiling, pouring into an atrium and pooling near the base of the escalators and stairs at one of the entrances.

At the entrance on the north side of 104 Avenue, a large puddle of water gathered at the base of the stairs and escalator. Outside, there was a small pile of hail that looked to have been shovelled to the side.

East of that entrance, workers were seen using large brooms to sweep water out the door. A van from a carpet cleaning company arrived and workers went inside.

Multiple yellow vans belonging to an emergency and disaster relief company entered the building through a side entrance.

1611,"On a quiet weekday afternoon, Will Johnston was prepping the small but colourful patio seating at the front of Duke’s Refresher + Bar on Front Street East, near the St. Lawrence Market.  For the first time in three-plus months, Johnston, the general manager of the bar, had seats available to customers. It’s just 10 seats for now, with dividers available to shield you from the person next to you. It’s a far cry from the business his bar was doing in early March, when he could expect 400 to 500 customers on a busy night and was anticipating a packed house for St. Patrick’s Day.  “We were fired up,” Johnston recalled. “We loaded up the beer, loaded up the food, got the staff all ready to go. We weren’t taking reservations or anything, but we knew people would fill up the place. Then sure enough, that afternoon (March 16), they said, ‘Hey, all restaurants are closed in Toronto.’” The 10 chairs out front are a baby step for his business, but Johnston is trying to make the most of it. Toronto moved into Phase 2 of its reopening on June 24, allowing restaurants with patios to serve customers. Duke’s got its patio up and running on June 25 and saw a 20 per cent sales increase compared to takeout sales that day a week earlier.  The takeout-to-patio-service dance is one that many restaurants in the city are navigating. But sports bars are in the difficult spot of trying to change their dance steps on the fly. Even if the NBA, NHL, MLB and MLS get off the ground in the coming weeks, there are no guarantees that COVID-19 won’t interrupt or completely derail their seasons.  The biggest issue for sports bars in Toronto will be that they need to not just be functional in Phase 2, but need to have the city advance to at least Phase 3 of reopening, when dining in would presumably become an option.  The pandemic has sports bars across the city and around the world grappling with the same issue: Can sports bars work without sports?  “Part of the draw for sports bars is definitely the sports, there’s no denying that,” said Andrew Kaiser, the co-owner of the Dock Ellis, a sports bar on Dundas West that’s been open almost seven years.  “Given the fact that more than likely it’s going to be at most 50 per cent capacity inside, filling all those seats I don’t think is going to be much of a problem. Definitely, the big sporting events helped us hit 100 per cent capacity. Now the question is, will 50 per cent capacity pay the bills without any kind of support?  “That’s a whole other question.”  Franco Tascione is the chief operating officer for social brands at the Recipe Unlimited Corporation, which owns, among others, Bier Markt. At Bier Markt’s Esplanade location, they have three patios on the property and are capable of seating about 120 people now.  The staff wear masks and every other table is left open to give customers the appropriate space. Inside, where Phase 3 and the big screens await, it’s all about creating the right atmosphere, regardless of what may or may not be available.  “If for any reason sports shouldn’t come back, that doesn’t stop us from (making the restaurant a destination),” Tascione said.  “When guests are sitting in a restaurant, you want to have that atmosphere, that excitement, that energy. Part of that excitement is created by our employees, but imagine walking into the restaurants and you have all these great employees, but none of the TVs are on, no sound is on, no music, no lights, nothing. It just feels very flat.” Tascione points out that there’s a stage at the back of the Bier Markt on the Esplanade. He sees opportunity there, too.  “Streaming live music and streaming things such as events that will create that atmosphere in the restaurant, which I think is important. If for any reason sports shouldn’t come back, that doesn’t stop us from doing all those things,” he said.  Johnston sees challenges ahead for his place and other sports bars. It will be difficult even at 50 per cent capacity when people get together and their inhibitions come down and they start clumping together. He says he and his staff will have to keep people in check. It won’t be fun, but he doesn’t want outbreaks and bar closures like we’re seeing in the United States.  “It’ll be a lot of work to try and keep people away from each other,” he said. “There’s no dancing, there’s no singing on the patio. It’s going to be like a version of ‘Footloose’ in a sense.”  The owners insist there’s still more to a good bar than the games on TV.  “People are social beings. We can’t hide from that or escape that,” Kaiser said.  “A lot of what we do and a lot of what our industry does is make people comfortable, and have people in close quarters and share memorable events, especially in sports bars. People are aching and they’re dying for that level of human contact that I think a good quality sports bar gives. “Before bars we were all sitting around a campfire sharing food and drinks anyway, right?”","A sports bar with no sports?

1615,"Now that Meghan and Harry have gotten the Royal Family’s stamp of approval to move to Canada part time, all they have to do is find a place to live.

Where would a wealthy young millennial couple with a young child want to live in Canada? The Star asked a few luxury realtors for suggestions.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have plenty of choices if they decide to live part-time in British Columbia, said Andrea Jauck, a luxury realtor with Vancouver-based Pinnacle Group Real Estate Marketing. She noted that the province offers private locations with spectacular views that are still relatively close to Vancouver.

The couple reportedly spent the holidays at a secluded beachfront villa in North Saanich, a community located about a half-hour drive north of Victoria on Vancouver Island.

“They could have gone anywhere ... but they chose B.C.,” said Kris Cyganiak, co-founder of the Pinnacle List, a website that curates luxury property listings from around the world. According to Cyganiak, there’s a good chance the couple will choose B.C. again.

Have your say:

But Barry Cohen, a luxury realtor in Toronto, says the couple is more likely to move to Canada’s largest city.

Meghan lived in Toronto for at least seven years while filming her TV show “Suits,” and the city is also much closer to the United Kingdom than Vancouver. Harry and Meghan reportedly plan to spend their time in the U.K. at Frogmore Cottage, in Windsor.

1080 Uplands Drive, Anmore, British Columbia

Listing price: $6.5 million

Sometimes, you want something a little outside the city, new with a contemporary feel to it. This newly constructed 8,277 sq. ft. lot is only a one-hour drive from downtown Vancouver — so the duchess can commute to any potential acting jobs in Hollywood North — and is located in Anmore, a quiet community of 2,200 people.

The home features built-in Tesla charging stations, 46 solar panels and a view of the North Shore mountains. It has a “chateau” and “Whistler-inspired” look, that could give the royal couple the West-coast feel they seem to enjoy.

This listing also features a lower price point, thanks to its location outside of Vancouver’s city centre, something Harry and Meghan may consider if they are striving for “financial independence,” as they suggested in their public statement announcing they planned to step back from their royal duties.

The duke and duchess appear to enjoy waterfront properties — they reportedly stayed at a beachfront villa on Vancouver Island over the holidays — so they may enjoy a home with a private dock, like this North Vancouver property, which also features panoramic ocean views and a private elevator.

North Vancouver is a short 15-minutue Seabus trip to downtown Vancouver. Prince Harry and Meghan, along with their young son Archie, may appreciate the municipality known for its family-friendly neighbourhoods and proximity to hiking trails, said Jauck.

The couple was spotted hiking on Vancouver Island on New Year’s Day, and even stopped to help fellow hikers take a photo.

229 Dunvegan Rd., Toronto, Ontario

Listing price: $16 million

“Being that they are a young couple, and with a growing family, they are looking for community, and given their wealth and potential need for privacy, they would consider Forest Hill,” said Cohen, of the north Toronto neighbourhood.

“They are familiar with Forest Hill, they have friends that live at Forest Hill,” he said, adding there are excellent private-school options in the area. Plus, Meghan’s close friend, Jessica Mulroney, lives in a nearby neighbourhood.

This particular home features an indoor tennis court, an indoor saltwater pool and a marble staircase. Not to mention an underground eight-car garage.

61 The Bridle Path, Toronto, Ontario

Listing price: $16.9 million

This gated community is known for its expansive two-acre lots and is home to some of Canada’s most famous residents, including rapper Drake.

The Bridle Path neighbourhood would offer the royal couple the “utmost of privacy,” said Cohen. “That community could service them well.”

And this particular 14,280 sq. ft., 11-bedroom property is no stranger to royalty.

“The sprawling bungalow used to be owned by Prince,” said Cohen.

1617,"The trend away from cash transactions was already strong before the fear of COVID-19 turned it into an avenue of contagion for businesses and shoppers.

But that doesn’t mean it’s time Canada went cashless, says a report by the Salvation Army.

The charitable organization wants Canada’s financial policy-makers and businesses to know that going cashless is not an option for everyone: Some of those most vulnerable to the virus may not have trust in or access to bank cards.

At the invitation of the Royal Canadian Mint, the Salvation Army has written a report outlining the necessity of maintaining cash currency even though many merchants, shoppers and services are increasingly attracted to the low-contact convenience of credit and debit transactions.

“We believe going cashless directly impacts negatively those people who we support from a social service standpoint… marginalized, people who are being affected by homelessness, new Canadians, people suffering from human and sexual trafficking,” said Salvation Army Lt-Colonel John Murray.

Ensuring that cash remains viable is part of a broader conversation with charities, business and government, he said, noting that the middle of a pandemic isn’t the time to make quick decisions on whether or not to move to a cashless society.

“It needs to have thoughtful reflection, it needs to have conversation and there are multiple stakeholders, agencies, organizations that need to be at the table,” Murray said.

A Bank of Canada survey showed that cash transactions were in decline before anyone had heard of COVID-19. The number of cash transactions dropped from 54 per cent in 2009 to 33 per cent in 2017.

But cash is still king with consumers on some types of transactions, said Murray, citing the Salvation Army’s annual Christmas kettle fundraiser. Although the agency has introduced an electronic “tap-to-donate” option, those contributions only accounted for 1 to 1.5 per cent of the $23 million the Salvation Army collected last year.

The report, which was also sent to federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau, found that 54 per cent of purchases in the Salvation Army’s 294 thrift stores were made in cash last year accounting for about $75 million in sales with most cash transactions valued at less than $15.

“People who are often coming to our stores are seniors, students, new Canadians – maybe they don’t have a living wage or they’re on very limited or fixed income so they need to get the best bang for their buck,” said Murray.

For newcomers to Canada, “cash is accessible and empowering, it’s a way to begin acclimatizing to otherwise unfamiliar financial systems in their new home,” said the report “A Cashless or Cash-lite Canada?”

The loss of a bank card for a homeless person, it says, “It may mean the loss of all the money you have for the month, as well as any extra fees associated with replacing the card or re-accessing your account.”

Murray said the Salvation Army’s global efforts to stop human trafficking and slavery have shown that cash currency allows people to escape with a taxi or a train ticket.

“When we think of emergency disaster services work, you will see how quickly that all you need is for the networks to go down for two or three days and you’ll see the value and importance of cash,” he said.

In the case of the pandemic, the Bank of Canada found that there was more cash in circulation in March and April even though consumer spending declined, according to a staff briefing note called, Cash and COVID-19: The impact of the pandemic on the demand for and use of cash.

It says banks increased their inventory of cash so they could respond to consumer demand and also be prepared for events such as transportation disruptions.

A national bank survey of 4,192 Canadians conducted April 3 to 22, showed 74 per cent had no intention of going cashless. Sixty-four per cent said they did not change their use of cash in response to COVID-19 but 35 per cent indicated they used less cash.

1620,"VANCOUVER -- Beware of paying too much for life insurance. According to PolicyMe, an online insurance platform, a recent survey found Canadians are overpaying for life insurance by as much as 36 per cent.

The start-up looked at how the industry calculates coverage and found the average customer with a policy had $200,000 more in coverage than they actually needed, and weren't looking for deals.

It also examined how much those with existing policies pay, and their habits while looking for coverage.

""When it comes to life insurance, it's not just a buy or do not buy decision. A lot of consumers are confused by that,"" says PolicyMe co-founder and CEO Andrew Ostro. ""You should be looking at different insurance companies to see for your particular policy, your unique needs, (and) who is offering you the best price. And we see, too often, customers are not doing that and that leads to about a nine per cent increase in price from not shopping around.""

Some insurance providers have also seen a bump in interest for life insurance policies since the pandemic began, Ostro says.

""Interestingly enough, (we found) it hasn't really been a fear of passing away as a result of COVID, it's more been just a general awareness around mortality,"" he says. ""The life insurance need has always been there. The pandemic hasn't caused people to need the product more.""

He advises those currently looking shop around, ask a lot of questions and try to understand exactly what the coverage entails. Ostro says PolicyMe finds in the end, many people don't even need it.

""Twenty-six per cent of the users that come through our platform and use our advice algorithms, the recommendation to them is do not buy life insurance,"" he says. ""Through our calculations we've determined that your family does not need that protection, and we're not going to sell you something that you don't need.""",Are you paying too much for life insurance?,6,0.12836484447905394
1624,"Toastmasters experience is a great way to gain confidence, whether you’re just starting out life or well into retirement.

Gaining confidence in yourself can have a positive effect in every area of your life.

Toastmasters International, which has nearly 30 clubs between Surrey and Langley, can take credit for creating its fair share of confident people, through its programs teaching public speaking, communication and leadership skills, says Michael Bown, a District Director in B.C. for the organization.

“We support people with a number of things, but communications and leadership are the bread and butter, all resulting in greater confidence,” he says.

Nervous? Don’t worry, you’re supported

If you’re feeling uneasy about being in a space where speaking to others is a central element, you’ll be glad to learn guests are not required to speak at their first meeting. “We want people to sit back, listen, observe and enjoy the meeting,” Bown says. “They can speak when they’re ready as it’s a self-paced program. The clubs provide a supportive and positive learning experience, and everyone is trying to improve each other.”

Modern education tools available online

If you haven’t investigated Toastmasters in a while or are just starting to get curious, its Pathways educational program may be new to you. Its 11 project-based categories range from dynamic leadership and effective coaching to innovative planning and visionary communication. Using an online assessment tool that helps determine a Path, you pick the area you’d like to improve on and follow the steps. “Pathways uses modern methods to cater to people’s specific needs and learning styles,” Bown says. “If someone wants to grow in public speaking, there’s a focus on that, or communication, management skills and more.”

Plenty of experience to draw from

Not only has ToastmastersInternational been around since 1924, the organization today has nearly 300 clubs in British Columbia alone. Within them you’ll find a mix of in-house corporate programs and community clubs, and a lot of wisdom and expertise from longtime members who have helped others achieve their public speaking, communication and leadership goals.

Get your message across in a big way

One of the exciting things happening right now within Toastmasters, Bown says, is the International Speech Contest. Individual clubs are in the process of holding in-house competitions, and winners advance through various local, District and International levels, ultimately competing in the World Championship of Public Speaking in Paris this August! Not everyone is expected to compete, but Bown says the competitions offer a good opportunity for members and their guests to hear some inspirational speaking.

1627,"Residents encouraged to participate in farm gate passport program in a bid to buy local

The 11th annual Langley Eats Local event will celebrate the abundance of food and produce from the Lower Mainland with a lineup of local vendors and activities for the whole family.

Amanda Smith, agriculture program coordinator with Langley Environmental Partners Society (LEPS), said people can explore the diversity of what is produced in Langley and nearby, from vegetables to breads, cheeses, berries, wines and more.

“This year, LEPS has planned a whole month of eating local, starting with the kickoff, a take-home dinner and a movie event on July 30, and activities wrapping up by August 27,” Smith said.

Back again is the Eat Local Challenge to take place August 9 to 15, and the Farm Gate Passport Program.

“Participants in the challenge pledge to source as much of their food as possible from local producers for one week, and can use the passport for added inspiration,” she added.

If committing to eating local for seven days seems too much, this year’s passport will feature 15 local farms and businesses and will take place the entire four weeks of the event.

“You may find yourself visiting your local turkey farm, and possibly grabbing some cider while enjoying your staycation this summer,” Smith advised.

LEPS peppered the next month with mini events;

• the kickoff take-home dinner and a movie with Chef Adrian Beaty and the Fraser Valley Cider Company on July 30

• a historic, socially-distanced lunch gathering at the Michaud House

• a surprise video feature in celebration of the Blackberry Bake off Cookbook launch

“Join us to celebrate our local farmers and food producers who care for this delicious array of ingredients, from the fields of Langley to your plate,” Smith added.

1632,"Queen Elizabeth II knighted 100-year-old World War II veteran Captain Tom Moore, who became a national celebrity by raising millions for the UK's National Health Service (NHS), in an outdoor ceremony in Windsor Castle on Friday.

Moore raised almost £33 million (US$40 million) by walking laps of his backyard, and received a knighthood after a special nomination from Prime Minister Boris Johnson.

The ceremony marked the Queen's return to her public duties after the coronavirus pandemic forced her to cancel virtually all of her engagements.

She knighted Moore with her father's sword, and praised him for his fundraising efforts, saying: ""Thank you so much, an amazing amount of money you raised,"" according to the PA Media news agency.

Earlier, the veteran had tweeted that he was ""ready and raring to go for what is a very special day.""

""I could never have imagined this would happen to me. It is such a huge honour and I am very much looking forward to meeting Her Majesty The Queen,"" he said earlier in the week. ""It is going to be the most special of days for me.""

Moore was accompanied to the ceremony on Friday by his daughter Hannah Ingram-Moore, son-in-law Colin Ingram, grandson Benji and granddaughter Georgia, according to PA.

""If I kneel down I'll never get up again,"" he said as he left his home for Windsor Castle earlier Friday.

This was the Queen's second important engagement of the day. Earlier, she saw her granddaughter Beatrice get married in a private ceremony in the castle's grounds.

Moore, who rose to the rank of captain during his military career, was recently promoted to honorary colonel in recognition of his efforts.

Johnson personally recommended to the Queen that Moore should be exceptionally honored, according to a Downing Street press release.

""Colonel Tom's fantastic fundraising broke records, inspired the whole country and provided us all with a beacon of light through the fog of coronavirus,"" Johnson said in the release.","Queen knights 100-year-old veteran Captain Tom Moore, who raised millions for British NHS",6,0.29375152571511043
1633,"MEXICO CITY - Soon after arriving in Mexico in 2000, British journalist Jo Tuckman reported on what many Mexicans could scarcely have imagined: the election defeat of the political party that had governed autocratically for 71 years. Tuckman made Mexico her home for the next two decades, reporting, mainly for The Guardian, on drug violence, the disappeared, the struggles of women and migrants, and the uneven transition to democracy. In one of her last articles, published Jan. 2, she wrote about a new imprint of Mexican writer Tita Valencia’s 1976 novel Minotaur Fighting and other “works by Latin American women who were once feted but have fallen out of print.” Tuckman, 53, died in Mexico City on July 9 after being diagnosed with cancer last year. Colleagues remembered her as a committed journalist who mentored young writers. Jenaro Villamil, the head of Mexico’s public radio and TV system, praised Tuckman’s 2012 book “Mexico: Democracy Interrupted” and said she “fell in love with Mexico, with its bright and its dark sides.” “Jo’s departure deeply saddened all of us who knew her, of her commitment to social causes, to her great work and to life in general,” said Edgardo Buscaglia, an organized crime expert at Columbia University. Tuckman worked in the 1990s for The Associated Press as a freelancer in Guatemala, and then a staff employee in Spain. She also reported from Mexico for The Daily Telegraph and was an editor for Vice Mexico. A mother of two, she gravitated early toward Latin America, focusing on the region for a master’s degree at the University of London. Journalist Lomi Kriel spent time with Tuckman in the Darien rainforest in Panama, near the border with Colombia, while reporting in 2013 on climate change. They travelled in dug-out canoes and stayed with an Indigenous Emberá community, sleeping side by side in a thatched home on stilts. Tuckman generously shared knowledge about “freelancing and working internationally in difficult situations as a woman,” said Kriel, then a freelancer nervous about the assignment. “She has always been a role model, both in how she treated everyone around her and the adventure and light with which she approached learning about the world as a journalist. She is deeply missed – even by those who only met her once,” Kriel, who now works for the ProPublica/Texas Tribune investigative unit, wrote in an email. Ahead of 2012 elections that returned Mexico’s old ruling PRI party to power, Tuckman reported in The Guardian on documents purportedly showing that a unit of Televisa, Mexico’s leading TV and radio broadcaster, supported and promoted Enrique Peña Nieto, the PRI candidate. Televisa denied allegations of political bias. Tuckman also covered the 2014 disappearance of 43 students from a teacher’s college in the southern state of Guerrero, one of the most horrific cases of violence and corruption during Peña Nieto’s government. The students were abducted by local police and then allegedly turned over to a local gang that killed them and burned some of their bodies. “The challenge now is to make sure that interest is maintained in what is going on in Mexico so that the pressure that has been gathering around those issues of human rights, those issues of corruption, those issues of lack of accountability and transparency, don’t just fade away,” Tuckman said to Las Perlas TV, an online video service. Last week, Mexican authorities said they had identified the remains of a second of the 43 students who disappeared. It was a small step in a country haunted by impunity, corruption and extreme violence. Tuckman delivered plenty of humour and humanity in her reporting. On assignment for the AP, she interviewed a Mexican tequila industry regulator who displayed a bottle adorned with a vulture in dark glasses and said it “gives you the message, `Let’s go crazy.? In 2014, she wrote in The Guardian about violence driving Central American child migrants to the U.S. border and spoke to a man who said: “My granddaughter was the apple of my eye... I cried for a month after she left, but it is the best thing.

1641,"BEIRUT, Lebanon — International donors pledged about $1.35 billion in humanitarian aid for Yemen on Tuesday, far short of the $2.4 billion the United Nations had said was needed to pull a country shredded by years of war, hunger and disease from the brink of further disaster.Mark Lowcock, the United Nations’ emergency relief coordinator, was blunt about the results of the donor conference, which was hosted, virtually, by Saudi Arabia.“We cannot be satisfied where we got to today,” he said. In addition, he noted that the money raised had not yet been paid, only promised.Funding had withered this year over donors’ concerns that the Houthis, the Iran-backed armed group that controls northern Yemen, were interfering with aid distributed in their territory. The Houthis have since made some concessions to allow aid to flow more freely, said Lise Grande, the United Nations’ top official in Yemen.United Nations officials warned that without more donations, nearly 400 hospitals and health care centers it finances would have to reduce services just as the coronavirus pandemic has surged in Yemen. Already, food rations have been halved for 8.5 million hungry Yemenis, and 10,000 health care workers have lost the United Nations payments that for many are their only salary, Ms. Grande said.Since the war began five years ago, pitting the Houthis against a government backed by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, Yemenis have endured doomsday after doomsday: relentless airstrikes against hospitals and schools by the Saudi-led military coalition using American-made weapons, a severe cholera outbreak, the ever-present threat of famine, a health care system in collapse and now the coronavirus.“Yemenis themselves say things are worse today than at any time in their recent history,” Mr. Lowcock said in his appeal to donors, asking “whether the world is prepared to watch Yemen fall off the cliff.”The donor conference, hosted online by Saudi Arabia, aimed to raise $2.4 billion. Officials said that without more donations, hundreds of health care centers would have to cut services.Saudi Press Agency, via Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesThough Covid-19 deaths appear to be multiplying quickly across Yemen, Yemeni authorities have done little to check the virus’s spread. The Houthis, in the north, have denied the outbreak’s existence; their enemies, battling for dominance of the south, are too weak and divided to respond.As the pandemic bore down, Saudi Arabia, which has poured tens of billions of dollars into the war to little tangible end, announced a unilateral cease-fire in Yemen in early April. But that has not prevented conflict from erupting in the weeks since, as the Houthis continue to mount attacks, a separatist group battles the internationally recognized government for control in the south, and bombs from the Saudi-led coalition keep falling.Aid groups urged all sides on Tuesday to negotiate an end to the war — the only real hope of resolving Yemen’s many humanitarian crises. And critics of Saudi Arabia said the fortune it had spent on aid for Yemen, including the $500 million it pledged on Tuesday, meant little if it continued to bomb civilians and blockade supplies from reaching Houthi territory.“Saudi Arabia keeps trying to whitewash its coalition’s role in the deepening humanitarian catastrophe in Yemen, but co-hosting the funding event won’t fool anyone,” said Afrah Nasser, the Yemen researcher at Human Rights Watch. The Saudi-led coalition and the Houthis, she said, “should immediately cease violating the laws of war and put an end to the humanitarian crisis in Yemen for which they’re all responsible.”Jan Egeland, the secretary general of the Norwegian Relief Council, an aid group that works in Yemen, said that millions of Yemenis were “staring down the double barrel of starvation and a global pandemic.”He urged donors to reach deep into their pockets, adding, “But money alone is not enough. These pledges are worth little if people are still fleeing from bombs and crossfire and their hospitals attacked.”Even as he issued his appeal, the hostilities marched on.On Monday, a spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition, Col. Turki al-Malki, said the Saudis had intercepted two Houthi drone strikes aimed at civilian targets across the border in Saudi Arabia. And on Tuesday, soon after Saudi Arabia trumpeted its hosting of the donor conference in a series of news releases, the Houthis said that Saudi Arabia had launched several airstrikes on its territory.","Yemen Aid Falls Short, Threatening Food and Health Programs",9,0.6175297889169927
1642,"BEIRUT, Lebanon — In northern Yemen, more and more people are falling ill and dying after having trouble breathing, yet the Iran-backed group that controls the region, the Houthis, has acknowledged only a few coronavirus deaths.In southern Yemen, where two groups that previously fought the Houthis together have turned on each other, mortality rates have more than tripled compared with last year.The coronavirus appears to have slammed into Yemen, a country already staggering from five years of war, competing power centers, a health care system in ruins, widespread hunger and outbreaks of cholera and other infectious diseases.But the denial of the outbreak in the Houthi-controlled north, the absence of clear authority in the divided south and the drying-up of aid everywhere have hobbled any hope of limiting the virus’s spread, leaving health care workers and hospitals ill-equipped to cope with it and the public confused and suspicious of efforts to combat it.Yemen was already facing what has been called the world’s worst humanitarian crisis before the virus hit. The war, in which a Saudi-led military coalition is battling the Houthis, has taken 100,000 lives. Saudi-led airstrikes have killed thousands of civilians and destroyed hospitals and schools, while United Nations officials have accused the Houthis of diverting humanitarian aid.The pandemic has generated rumors that patients were being euthanized at hospitals, causing many Yemenis to shy away from treatment. Yet when they can no longer avoid the hospital, they are regularly turned away for lack of beds, protective equipment and medical supplies.The authorities in many places are too weak to prevent large crowds from gathering at prayers, funerals and marketplaces, or residents from traveling within the country.The confusion and doubt are compounded by the secrecy surrounding the outbreak — officially, the country has only 282 confirmed cases and 61 deaths.“In Yemen, we think there’s no coronavirus because we don’t trust our own health system,” said Salah Mohammed, a school security guard in the southern port city of Aden. “They talk about a curfew to prevent the spread of the disease. Great. But why do they allow people to move freely around the country if there’s a curfew?”With little testing available and the government and hospitals in disarray, it is difficult to measure the virus’s true spread in Yemen. What numbers are known, however, are grim.As of last week, tests had confirmed more than 500 coronavirus cases just in Sana, the Houthi-controlled capital, said a doctor who advises the Health Ministry there. The deputy health minister is among those infected, and a former president of Sana’s flagship university is among the nearly 80 dead.Vehicles are sprayed with disinfectant in Sana.Yet the Houthi authorities have acknowledged only four cases in their territory, leaving public health officials, health care workers and aid groups to sound the alarm about an outbreak whose severity the authorities are playing down.Some Health Ministry employees have been pleading with senior officials to make the true numbers public so that emergency medical workers and residents understand the gravity of the threat, said the doctor, who asked to remain anonymous because the authorities had threatened colleagues who had tried to go public.On Thursday, the Health Ministry in Sana asserted in a statement that other countries’ decisions to publicize their coronavirus case counts had “created a state of fear and anxiety that was more deadly than the disease itself.” The ministry offered no numbers of its own. “We don’t have to adhere to what the world wants us to,” Yousif al-Hadhiri, a ministry spokesman, said in an interview on Friday. He blamed the World Health Organization and international aid groups for being “lazy” and failing to deal with the outbreak.The reason for the secrecy is unclear. But one result is that the virus is likely to spread further, analysts said.“The Houthis aren’t just shooting themselves in the foot,” said Osamah al-Rawhani, the deputy executive director of the Sana’a Center for Strategic Studies, a think tank focused on Yemen. “They’re shooting people. The people who are in power haven’t recognized or revealed the right information to the public. And secrecy makes people do the wrong things because they’ve gotten the wrong message.”A separatist group, the Southern Transitional Council, fighting near Zinjibar, in southern Yemen, this month. The group seized the main southern city, Aden, last month, creating an absence of clear authority to manage the health crisis. The coronavirus is ravaging the other side of the front lines as well, where forces opposed to the Houthis are also reporting dubiously low numbers. There, however, the main problem is not denial, but lack of governance and a health care system in meltdown.In Aden, which served as the interim seat of Yemen’s internationally recognized government until a separatist group seized it last month, burial data showed that 950 people had died in the city in the first 17 days of this month, more than triple the 306 recorded for all of May 2019, according to an analysis by Abdullah Bin Ghouth, an epidemiology professor at Hadramout Universitywho advises the minister of health in Aden.The spike in deaths suggests that the official virus death toll is a vast undercount.At a hospital for coronavirus cases that Doctors Without Borders has set up in Aden, the only dedicated Covid-19 facility in southern Yemen, 173 patients have been admitted, more than 68 of whom have died, the group said.In other countries, 80 percent of patients did not need hospitalization, suggesting that many more people may be infected than those who went to the hospital.Yemen’s health care system, already overrun with outbreaks of cholera and other serious diseases, is gasping. Most doctors and nurses have not been paid in years, leading many to leave the public health system. Those who stayed are now being asked to treat coronavirus patients without protective gear.Azzubair, an emergency room doctor at a hospital in Dhamar Province, south of Sana, said he and his colleagues had been given only cheap, flimsy masks and gowns despite treating an average of six suspected Covid patients a day.“We can’t help but deal with possible Covid-19 cases on a daily basis,” said Azzubair, who asked to be identified only by his first name to avoid reprisals. “It’s like being in the monster’s jaws. By the time you realize you’re dealing with a suspected coronavirus case, it’s too late. You don’t really understand why they’re handling this issue in such secrecy.”In the south, only a few hospitals are accepting coronavirus cases, with other facilities refusing patients or closing down altogether because they lack protective equipment or staff are abandoning their posts. Doctors Without Borders, which operates Covid-19 centers with a total of 25 intensive-care beds across the country, does not have enough masks, gowns or medical staff to open more, said Claire Ha-Duong, the head of the group’s mission in Yemen, and turns away patients every day.Funding has fallen far short of the need. International donors suspended or cut much of their funding before the pandemic over concerns that the Houthis were keeping aid from going where it was needed. Lise Grande, the top United Nations official in the country, said the Houthis had since agreed to concessions that she hoped would reopen the spigot.A vendor at a market in SanaFor any public health response to stick, however, Yemenis need to accept the need for it at a time when trust in the powers that be is at a low ebb.One persistent rumor darting around Yemen is that people who go to the hospital receive lethal injections to put them out of their misery. In Houthi territory, armed personnel have fired into the air to keep people away as medical teams take people suspected of being infected into quarantine, residents said.In Aden, a city of half a million, the recent power transfer has left no authority capable of mounting an organized public-health campaign. There are no quarantine centers and no restrictions on movement or gathering, and residents have protested against attempts to impose them.Yahya, 36, a Sana resident who asked to be identified only by his first name to avoid running afoul of the Houthis, buried three relatives who died with coronavirus-like symptoms. He partly blamed those in charge: If officials had been transparent about the size of the outbreak, he said, people would have taken the virus more seriously.He, too, had begun to show symptoms, but said he had refused to go to a hospital or a quarantine center.“I wouldn’t go anywhere, even if it’s a Movenpick,” he said, referring to the five-star Sana hotel that shut down during the war and has now been converted into a quarantine facility. “There’s no trust anymore.”","Coronavirus Slams Broken, Embattled Yemen",9,0.6297499405186971
1643,"Long before the coronavirus caused human suffering and economic chaos on a global scale, the world’s worst humanitarian crisis was unfolding in Yemen, the Arab world’s poorest country and one that has been mired in civil war.In all, about 100,000 people — including more than 12,000 civilians — have been killed in the conflict, which pits the Saudi-backed government of Yemen against Iranian-aligned Houthi rebels who took control of the northern parts of the country five years ago.For many, the cause of death was not illness but bombs supplied by American companies and approved for sale to the Saudi coalition by American officials.The New York Times investigated how and why the weapons came to kill civilians — at funerals, in town squares, even on a school bus — across two U.S. administrations. These are some of the findings.For President Trump, arms sales mean more jobsMr. Trump has backed arms deals with the Saudis and their partners, citing benefits to the American economy, even as some of the weapons have been used in strikes against civilians in neighboring Yemen.Not even the killing of the journalist and American resident Jamal Khashoggi — which led both Democrats and Republicans to call for ending sales to the Saudis — could change the president’s mind.“I want Boeing and I want Lockheed and I want Raytheon to take those orders and to hire lots of people to make that incredible equipment,” Mr. Trump told Fox Business in 2018, after Mr. Khashoggi was ambushed, killed and dismembered inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.The approach marks a shift in American foreign policy, elevating economic considerations over other concerns. Where foreign arms sales in the past were mostly offered and withheld to achieve diplomatic goals, the Trump administration pursues them mainly for the profits they generate and the jobs they create.His administration has removed obstacles to the salesAs the civilian death toll in Yemen has mounted, American officials tried three times to block arms sales to the Saudis, only to have their efforts undone by a White House intent on pursuing foreign deals.The Trump administration reversed the first attempt, initiated in the waning days of the Obama administration, after Mr. Trump announced a massive arms sale package on a visit to Saudi Arabia in 2017.In early 2018, it turned back a second attempt, by Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee. And it declared an emergency last year to bypass a third attempt, by Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, who was refusing to clear pending arms sales over humanitarian concerns.The White House referred requests for comment to the National Security Council, where a spokesman said that the U.S. was supporting Saudi Arabia’s defense after attacks in Yemen by “Iran and its Houthi proxies,” and that it was urging that “all appropriate measures” to “prevent civilian casualties.”A top aide has been a powerful ally to the arms industry“This White House has been more open to defense industry executives than any other in living memory,” said Loren B. Thompson, a longtime analyst and consultant for major arms manufacturers.Among the people most responsible for that posture is Mr. Trump’s combative trade adviser, Peter Navarro, whose mission has been to stoke American manufacturing, beginning with the defense industry.Mr. Navarro, an economist and former college professor who had been an adviser to Mr. Trump’s election campaign in 2016, acted as a proponent for defense companies during White House discussions about arms sales. He frequently raised the importance of the sales to Saudi Arabia, sometimes while repeating talking points used by the companies themselves, former administration officials said.In an interview, Mr. Navarro said he advocated on behalf of Mr. Trump’s economic policies, not companies. “I got involved in this not because of any defense contractor,” he said. “I advocate for the president and for American workers and for our men and women in uniform.”One company pushed especially hard for Saudi salesAmerican arms makers who sell to the Saudis say they are accountable to shareholders and have done nothing wrong. They also say that because arms sales to foreign governments must be approved by the State Department, they don’t make policy, only follow it.As the Yemen crisis deepened, at least one firm, Raytheon Company, went to great lengths to influence American decision-making, even after members of Congress tried to halt sales over humanitarian concerns.The company, which has booked more than $5 billion in sales to the Saudis and their partners since the Yemen war began, courted Mr. Navarro, who intervened with White House and State Department officials.It also enlisted the help of a lobbyist who attended West Point with both Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Mark Esper, who worked for Raytheon before joining the administration.Approached a half-dozen times, Raytheon representatives declined to speak with reporters about foreign sales.A State Department spokeswoman, in a statement, said the administration had “made it clear that economic security is national security,” and said there was an increased focus “on human rights” through training programs with arms partners.President Barack Obama got the U.S. involved in the first placePresident Barack Obama oversaw his own outflow of arms to the Middle East, including weapons that the Saudis have used in the Yemen war, which began on Mr. Obama’s watch.Former Obama administration officials have since expressed regret, not only for weapons sales but for agreeing to support the Saudi-led war in the first place in 2015.“People make miscalculations all the time,” Steve Pomper, a former senior State Department official, said in an interview. “But it was striking to me as I reflected on my time in the Obama administration that it wasn’t just that we embarked on this escapade — it’s that we didn’t pull ourselves out of it.”",5 Takeaways on U.S. Involvement in the World’s Worst Humanitarian Crisis,9,0.24349513436220727
1644,"Year after year, the bombs fell — on wedding tents, funeral halls, fishing boats and a school bus, killing thousands of civilians and helping turn Yemen into the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.Weapons supplied by American companies, approved by American officials, allowed Saudi Arabia to pursue the reckless campaign. But in June 2017, an influential Republican senator decided to cut them off, by withholding approval for new sales. It was a moment that might have stopped the slaughter.Not under President Trump.With billions at stake, one of the president’s favored aides, the combative trade adviser Peter Navarro, made it his mission to reverse the senator. Mr. Navarro, after consulting with American arms makers, wrote a memo to Jared Kushner and other top White House officials calling for an intervention, possibly by Mr. Trump himself. He titled it “Trump Mideast arms sales deal in extreme jeopardy, job losses imminent.”Within weeks, the Saudis were once again free to buy American weapons.The intervention, which has not been previously reported, underscores a fundamental change in American foreign policy under Mr. Trump that often elevates economic considerations over other ones. Where foreign arms sales in the past were mostly offered and withheld to achieve diplomatic goals, the Trump administration pursues them mainly for the profits they generate and the jobs they create, with little regard for how the weapons are used.President Trump has encharged his trade adviser Peter Navarro with growing American manufacturing, particularly in the arms industry.With billions at stake, one of the president’s favored aides, the combative trade adviser Peter Navarro, made it his mission to reverse the senator.

His administration has also rewritten the rules for arms exports, speeding weapon sales to foreign militaries. The State Department, responsible for licensing arms deals, now is charged with more aggressively promoting them.“This White House has been more open to defense industry executives than any other in living memory,” said Loren B. Thompson, a longtime analyst who consults for major arms manufacturers.No foreign entanglement has revealed the trade-offs of this policy more than the war in Yemen. There, Mr. Trump’s embrace of arms sales has helped prolong a conflict that has killed more than 100,000 people in the Arab world’s poorest nation, further destabilizing an already volatile region, according to a review of thousands of pages of records and interviews with more than 50 people with knowledge of the policy or who participated in the decision-making.American arms makers who sell to the Saudis say they are accountable to shareholders and are doing nothing wrong. And because weapon sales to foreign militaries must be approved by the State Department, the companies say they don’t make policy, only follow it.“The Weekly” — Watch how arms sales to Middle Eastern allies that were meant to shore up American jobs are contributing to a humanitarian crisis. The full episode of our TV show is available online to Times subscribers in the U.S.“Our economic policy can be summed up in three very beautiful and simple words.” It’s a common refrain. “Jobs, jobs, jobs.” “You’re talking about jobs. What I’m doing here, we’ve created an incredible economy.” But when promises of jobs are tied to the arms trade, where do we draw the line? And what happens when this promise collides with the mistakes of a previous administration? “We found ourselves locked into this terrible situation, unable to wrap it up and handing it off to an administration that was going to handle it even worse than we did.” It’s a scenario that has plunged the U.S. deeper into one of the world’s most catastrophic conflicts. “These were not mistakes. These were deliberate and precise attacks, and everybody in Yemen knows that the bombs causing this suffering are made in the United States.”But as the situation in Yemen worsened, at least one firm, Raytheon Company, did more than wait for decisions by American officials. It went to great lengths to influence them, even after members of Congress tried to upend sales to Saudi Arabia on humanitarian grounds.Raytheon, a major supplier of weapons to the Saudis, including some implicated by human rights groups in the deaths of Yemeni civilians, has long viewed the kingdom as one of its most important foreign customers.After the Yemen war began in 2015 and the Obama administration made a hasty decision to back the Saudis, Raytheon booked more than $3 billion in new bomb sales, according to an analysis of available U.S. government records.Intent on pushing the deals through, Raytheon followed the industry playbook: It took advantage of federal loopholes by sending former State Department officials, who were not required to be registered as lobbyists, to press their former colleagues to approve the sales.And though the company was already embedded in Washington — its chief lobbyist, Mark Esper, would become Army secretary and then defense secretary under Mr. Trump — Raytheon executives sought even closer ties.They assiduously courted Mr. Navarro, who intervened with White House officials on Raytheon’s behalf and successfully pressured the State Department, diminished under Mr. Trump, to process the most contentious deals.They also enlisted the help of David J. Urban, a lobbyist whose close ties to Mr. Esper and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo go back to the 1980s, when all three men were at West Point.As the nation turned against the war, a range of American officials — Democratic and Republican — tried three times to halt the killing by blocking arms sales to the Saudis. Their efforts were undone by the White House, largely at the urging of Raytheon.Approached a half-dozen times, Raytheon representatives declined to speak with reporters about foreign sales. “We believe further dialogue regarding foreign military sales is best directed to officials in the U.S. government,” Corinne Kovalsky, then a company spokeswoman, said in December.Lawmakers from both parties have condemned the continued arms sales in the Yemen war, expressing both humanitarian and security concerns: Some of the weapons have wound up in the hands of militant Islamic groups in the country.“We don’t know how these weapons are really being used or whether they may be turned against U.S. troops in the future,” said Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, who has publicly criticized the administration’s approach to the conflict. “This war was never authorized by Congress.”Others say the president’s arms sale policies diminish the United States.“People look to us. We’re the only country in the world that is ever capable of using this immense power that we have in a way that’s more than just about our naked self-interest,” said Representative Tom Malinowski, a New Jersey Democrat who was born in Communist Poland and led the State Department’s human rights bureau under President Barack Obama.“President Trump has proudly said that we should continue to sell weapons to Saudi Arabia because they pay us a lot of money,” Mr. Malinowski said. “He seems to see foreign policy in the way he viewed the real estate business — every country is like a company and our job is to make money.”The Trump administration has defended arms sales to Saudi Arabia as being vital to job growth and the American economy.“We’ve created an incredible economy,” Mr. Trump told Fox Business in October 2018, after the killing of the journalist and American resident Jamal Khashoggi sparked calls to stop selling to the Saudis. “I want Boeing and I want Lockheed and I want Raytheon to take those orders and to hire lots of people to make that incredible equipment.”Raytheon hired former U.S. officials to press for approval of arms deals with Saudi Arabia, one of its most important clients.Records show that foreign military sales, facilitated by the U.S. government, rose sharply after Mr. Trump became president. They averaged about $51 billion a year during Mr. Trump’s first three years, compared with $36 billion a year during the final term of Mr. Obama, who also oversaw a big increase. Arms industry groups say defense jobs rose more than 3.5 percent to about 880,000 during Mr. Trump’s first two years, though the numbers, the most recent available, do not specify how many were in manufacturing.The White House referred requests for comment to the National Security Council, where a spokesman said that “Iran and its Houthi proxies” had targeted Saudi Arabia and had endangered Americans. “We remain committed to supporting Saudi Arabia’s right to defend against those threats, while urging that all appropriate measures are taken to prevent civilian casualties,” said the spokesman, John Ullyot.A State Department spokeswoman said that the administration had made clear that “economic security is national security,” and that the administration was “strengthening our advocacy for defense sales that are in our national interest.” She disputed the suggestion that human rights had taken a back seat to other considerations, insisting the new approach “actually increases focus on human rights” through military training and other programs with allies.Anthony Wier, a former State Department official under Mr. Obama, said past administrations of both parties had sought to balance the economic benefits of arms sales with the realities on the ground.“This is an important export industry with a lot of factory jobs, with a lot of states,” Mr. Wier said. “But there’s also a crater in Yemen where a school bus used to sit, and there’s a stack of children dead.”Getting the President’s EarMr. Trump won the presidency partly on promises to resuscitate American manufacturing.“We’re going to bring back the jobs that have been stolen from you,” he told a packed arena in Raleigh, N.C., on Nov. 7, 2016, the day before the election. “We’re going to bring back the miners and the factory workers and the steelworkers. We’re going to put them back to work.”But as the initial glow of victory faded, reality set in. Mr. Trump’s aides realized there were not many ways the executive branch, on its own, could affect manufacturing and trade, three former Trump administration officials said.One campaign adviser, Mr. Navarro, thought he had a solution. A Harvard-educated economist, Mr. Navarro had published papers on management strategy and a book of investment advice, “If It’s Raining in Brazil, Buy Starbucks.”He had not specialized in the American arms industry. Even so, he made the case to members of Mr. Trump’s transition team, including Stephen K. Bannon, then one of Mr. Trump’s most trusted advisers, that invoking national security and promoting the defense industry were ways to impose tariffs, create manufacturing jobs and shrink the trade deficit. Mr. Bannon embraced the pitch, according to a person with knowledge of the conversations.In December 2016, the president-elect named Mr. Navarro head of the newly created National Trade Council, an ill-defined position that seemed in conflict with other, more established roles in the White House. And though the organization apparently existed only on paper, the title afforded him access to Cabinet-level meetings, where he would forcefully argue his points as the principals looked on.Mr. Trump gave him responsibility for stoking American defense manufacturing by growing foreign arms sales, among other things. Defense companies took notice.After Mr. Trump’s inauguration, representatives of Raytheon and other firms streamed in to see Mr. Navarro, finding him ready to listen. Mr. Navarro’s hard-line stance toward China was well known, and they played it to their advantage, said Mr. Thompson, the analyst and consultant, who soon arranged a lunch meeting between Mr. Navarro and industry leaders, including Thomas A. Kennedy, then Raytheon’s chief executive and now its executive chairman.Mr. Trump in the Oval Office with Mr. Navarro, an economist who previously worked on the 2016 campaign.The defense firms presented themselves as the rare high-tech industry that had not recently lost ground to China, Mr. Thompson said.During the first years of Mr. Trump’s presidency, as aides undermined one another and turned over on a regular basis, Mr. Navarro’s claim to an essential mission, and his new ties to arms executives, insulated him from the turbulence, according to the former administration officials.In Mr. Navarro, they said, the companies had an advocate who was not shy about confronting senior leaders over matters he deemed important. And while the officials often bristled at his presumption, and worked to marginalize him, Mr. Navarro nevertheless retained influence with Mr. Kushner and Mr. Trump.Mr. Trump relished having around him an Ivy League economist who agreed with his pronouncements on trade. The president, in turn, listened when Mr. Navarro repeatedly raised arms sales to Saudi Arabia and other countries, sometimes repeating talking points used by Raytheon and other arms makers, the former administration officials said.In an interview, Mr. Navarro said that his focus has been on carrying out Mr. Trump’s economic policies, not on corporate cheerleading.“I don’t advocate for companies,” Mr. Navarro said. “I advocate for the president and for American workers and for our men and women in uniform. That’s it. Period. Full stop.”Mr. Trump’s aggressive arms sale policies were met with alarm by some in the State Department, in part because the administration did not seem concerned with human rights issues, according to several current and former State Department officials, who like others interviewed for this article were not authorized to speak publicly. Though past administrations had sometimes shown a willingness to achieve narrow goals by arming rough regimes, Mr. Trump seemed to view weapon sales as ends in themselves.Worse, they said, were signs of how little the administration grasped the basics of arms deals, which can have profound foreign policy and national security consequences.One episode in spring 2017 underscored those concerns. When Mr. Kushner and others wanted to line up military sales ahead of a visit by Mr. Trump to Saudi Arabia, they convened meetings at the White House but did not invite the State Department — the only agency by law that can authorize foreign deals.Arms sale specialists in the State Department learned about the gathering only after a senior Pentagon official called and urged them to hurry over, current and former officials said.A $5 Billion TurnaroundAs war broke out five years ago in Yemen, Raytheon was a company on the rebound.Based in Waltham, Mass., it had risen over the years to become the third-largest defense firm in the United States, bolstered by sales of its best-known system, the Patriot missile. But Raytheon had been battered by flagging profits and federal budget cuts, and Mr. Kennedy, the chief executive, was determined to turn things around, starting with international sales.Raytheon earned more of its revenue from sales to foreign governments than Lockheed Martin and other American defense giants, and few foreign customers were more important than Saudi Arabia. Its ties with the Saudis dated to the 1960s, when the company became one of the first American defense firms to build a permanent base in the kingdom.Since then, generations of Raytheon executives had sought to ingratiate the company with the Saudis, hiring members of the royal family as consultants, building schools and investing in projects favored by the royal court.The close relationship was evident two days after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, when three Saudi college students began their journey out of the country from Raytheon’s private terminal in Tampa, Fla., according to a report by the 9/11 Commission. (None of the men, including one who was a member of the Saudi royal family, was tied to the attacks, though Saudi nationals were among the hijackers.)The longstanding ties helped Mr. Kennedy turn around the company. Since the Yemen war began, Raytheon has booked at least a dozen major sales to the kingdom and its partners worth more than $5 billion, U.S. government records show, helping lift the firm’s fortunes and position it to pursue a merger with another large defense company, United Technologies, that was completed in April.Some of the deals, for defensive items, sailed through the government approval process. But sales of offensive weapons, including more than 120,000 precision bombs and bomb parts that the Saudis were using in Yemen, faced major hurdles. Those deals were among the most lucrative ones, worth more than $3 billion, the government records show.Rescue workers at the funeral hall that was bombed in Sana.Trouble for the company started on Oct. 8, 2016, when Saudi coalition planes repeatedly targeted a funeral hall in Sana, the Yemeni capital, where some 1,500 men, women and children had gathered to mourn the father of a government official.The first bomb shattered the building, killing some instantly and sending others on a scramble to escape the smoldering rubble. A second landed as people poured in to help the survivors. A third fell as the newly injured and dying were clambering amid the splintered wood and broken concrete.“People were on fire, and some people were burned alive,” one survivor, 42-year-old Hassan Jubran, told human rights workers.“There were also many children,” he said. “There were three children whose bodies were completely torn apart and strewn all over the place.”At least 140 people died and another 500 were wounded in the bombing, which the Saudis later said was a mistake. Soon after the attack, human rights workers discovered amid the wreckage a bomb shard bearing the identification number of an American company: Raytheon.It was one of at least 12 attacks on civilians that human rights groups would tie to the company’s ordnance during the first two years of the war.Asked in 2017 whether dead and wounded civilians gave him pause, John D. Harris II, then Raytheon’s vice president of business development, told CNBC that they did not, “because we do the hard work of making sure that the countries that employ our systems have the very best training and the ability to use the system in an appropriate manner.”",Why Bombs Made in America Have Been Killing Civilians in Yemen,9,0.39467922135711064
1645,"WASHINGTON — The American military killed 132 civilians in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Somalia during ground and air operations in those countries in 2019, according to an annual Pentagon report.The grim tally, which watchdog groups contend undercounts the real total by hundreds, has changed little since last year’s report recording 120 civilians killed in 2018. Deaths of innocents in Afghanistan once more eclipsed those in Syria and Iraq, as the Islamic State there has receded to rural areas and U.S. forces in Afghanistan had ramped up attacks on the Taliban. Two civilians were killed in Somalia during strikes on the Qaeda-affiliated group Al Shabab, according to the 20-page report released on Wednesday. Not one was reported killed in Libya and Yemen — two countries with a minimal U.S. troop presence that are often the focus of sporadic airstrikes aimed at killing high-ranking fighters aligned with Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and the Islamic State.Watchdog groups that track conflicts in those countries, such as Amnesty International, Airwars and the United Nations, assert that the Pentagon’s numbers are far lower than reality on the ground.The Pentagon’s report, mandated by Congress, is a fatal accounting of the United States’ long-running wars that began after Sept. 11, 2001, and now span two continents — with little hope of ending anytime soon.“If the U.S. is going to engage in lethal operations abroad, then it must develop a reliable means for investigating and reporting on who it has killed and injured in the process,” Daphne Eviatar, the director of the Security with Human Rights program at Amnesty International, said in a statement. “The content of the report, however, suggests that the Pentagon is still undercounting civilian casualties.”During the first six months of 2019, Airwars estimated that the American-led coalition in Syria and Iraq killed 416 to 1,030 civilians, a range that is far higher than the 22 civilians claimed in the Pentagon’s report. American aircraft conduct the majority of airstrikes in Iraq and Syria.The United Nations attributed 559 civilian deaths in Afghanistan to “international military forces” in its 2019 annual report on civilian harm, an 18 percent increase from 2018. The United States is the only country with troops and aircraft in Afghanistan that conduct offensive operations.The Pentagon’s report claims that U.S. forces were responsible for 108 civilian deaths in Afghanistan.In the report, the American-led mission in Afghanistan acknowledged the death of 15 civilians after an airstrike in the country’s southern Helmand Province in January of last year, the most grievous episode acknowledged by the Pentagon in 2019. The strike occurred as American and Afghan forces were conducting operations in Sangin district, according to information compiled by The New York Times.The Pentagon has long promoted its commitment to avoiding civilian casualties but has been criticized for an opaque reporting process and disjointed steps to guarantee accountability.Nonprofit groups use social media and on-the-ground reporting to track civilian deaths, a process acknowledged by military officials but sometimes dismissed as unreliable. The Defense Department, with limited troop numbers in most of these countries, does little in-person investigation and often relies on drone feeds and pilots to provide information on errant strikes.","U.S. Military Killed 132 Civilians in Wars Last Year, Pentagon Says",9,0.21014841364230163
1646,"Yemen, one of the Arab world's poorest countries, has been devastated by a civil war. Here we explain what is fuelling the fighting, and who is involved.How did the war start?Houthi rebel fighters entered Sanaa in September 2014 and took full control in January 2015The conflict has its roots in the failure of a political transition supposed to bring stability to Yemen following an Arab Spring uprising that forced its longtime authoritarian president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, to hand over power to his deputy, Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi, in 2011.As president, Mr Hadi struggled to deal with a variety of problems, including attacks by jihadists, a separatist movement in the south, the continuing loyalty of security personnel to Saleh, as well as corruption, unemployment and food insecurity.Ali Abdullah Saleh (R) was forced to hand over power to Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi (L)The Houthi movement (known formally as Ansar Allah), which champions Yemen's Zaidi Shia Muslim minority and fought a series of rebellions against Saleh during the previous decade, took advantage of the new president's weakness by taking control of their northern heartland of Saada province and neighbouring areas.Disillusioned with the transition, many ordinary Yemenis - including Sunnis - supported the Houthis, and in late 2014 and early 2015 the rebels gradually took over the capital Sanaa.A Saudi-led multinational coalition intervened in the conflict in Yemen in March 2015 The Houthis and security forces loyal to Saleh - who was thought to have backed his erstwhile enemies in a bid to regain power - then attempted to take control of the entire country, forcing Mr Hadi to flee abroad in March 2015.Alarmed by the rise of a group they believed to be backed militarily by regional Shia power Iran, Saudi Arabia and eight other mostly Sunni Arab states began an air campaign aimed at defeating the Houthis, ending Iranian influence in Yemen and restoring Mr Hadi's government.The coalition received logistical and intelligence support from the US, UK and France.What's happened since then?Yemen air strike: The school that's lost 42 childrenAt the start of the war Saudi officials forecast that it would last only a few weeks. But four years of military stalemate have followed.Coalition ground troops landed in the southern port city of Aden in August 2015 and helped drive the Houthis and their allies out of much of the south over the next few months.Mr Hadi's government has established a temporary home in Aden, but it struggles to provide basic services and security and the president continues to be based in Saudi Arabia.The Houthis meanwhile have not been dislodged from Sanaa and north-western Yemen. They have been able to maintain a siege of the third city of Taiz and to launch regular ballistic missile and drone attacks on Saudi Arabia.In September 2019, Saudi Arabia's eastern oil fields of Abqaiq and Khurais were attacked by air, disrupting nearly half the kingdom's oil production - representing around 5% of global oil output.The Houthis claimed responsibility but Saudi Arabia and the US accused Iran of carrying out the attacks.Militants from al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and the local affiliate of the rival Islamic State group (IS) have taken advantage of the chaos by seizing territory in the south and carrying out deadly attacks, notably in Aden.Yemen: Where children rummage through rubbish for foodThe launch of a ballistic missile towards Riyadh in November 2017 prompted the Saudi-led coalition to tighten its blockade of Yemen. It said it wanted to halt the smuggling of weapons to the rebels by Iran - an accusation Tehran denied - but the restrictions led to substantial increases in the prices of food and fuel, helping to push more people into food insecurity.The alliance between the Houthis and Ali Abdullah Saleh also collapsed in November 2017 following deadly clashes over control of Sanaa's biggest mosque. Houthi fighters launched an operation to take full control of the capital and Saleh was killed.Ali Abdullah Saleh ruled Yemen for 33 yearsIn June 2018, the coalition attempted to break the deadlock on the battlefield by launching a major offensive to capture from the Houthis the Red Sea city of Hudaydah, whose port is the principal lifeline for almost two thirds of Yemen's population.The UN warned that the port's destruction would constitute a ""tipping point"" beyond which it was going to be impossible to avert massive loss of life due to famine.Where the fighting in Yemen has stopped... but not the sufferingAfter six months of fighting, the warring parties agreed a ceasefire at talks in Sweden. The Stockholm agreement required them to redeploy their forces from Hudaydah, establish a prisoner exchange mechanism, and to address the situation in Taiz.While hundreds of prisoners have since been released, the full redeployment of forces from Hudaydah has not yet taken place, raising fears that the Stockholm agreement will collapse and that the battle for Hudaydah will resume.In July 2019, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), a key ally of Saudi Arabia in the war, facing international criticism of its conduct, announced a withdrawal of its forces from Yemen.In August, fighting erupted in the south between Saudi-backed government forces and an ostensibly allied southern separatist movement supported by the UAE, the Southern Transitional Council (STC).Southern separatists have fought allied forces loyal to President Hadi. Forces loyal to the STC, which accused Mr Hadi of mismanagement and links to Islamists, seized control of Aden and refused to allow the cabinet to return until Saudi Arabia brokered a power-sharing deal that November.The UN hoped the agreement would clear the way for a political settlement to end the civil war, but in January 2020 there was a sudden escalation in hostilities between the Houthis and coalition-led forces, with fighting on several front lines, missile strikes and air raids.In April 2020 the STC declared self-rule in Aden, breaking a peace deal signed with the internationally recognised government, saying it would govern the port city and southern provinces.Saudi Arabia announced a unilateral ceasefire the same month due to coronavirus pandemic but the Houthis rejected it, demanding the lifting of air and sea blockades in Sanaa and Hudaydah.What's been the human cost?In short, Yemen is experiencing the world's worst humanitarian crisis.The UN says Yemen is on the brink of the world's worst famine in 100 years if the war continuesThe UN had verified the deaths of at least 7,700 civilians by March 2020, with most caused by Saudi-led coalition air strikes.Monitoring groups believe the death toll is far higher. The US-based Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED) said in October 2019 that it had recorded more than 100,000 fatalities, including 12,000 civilians killed in direct attacks.More than 23,000 fatalities were reported in 2019, making it the second most lethal year of the war so far.The sick children trapped by war in Yemen. Thousands more civilians have died from preventable causes, including malnutrition, disease and poor health.The charity Save the Children estimated that 85,000 children with severe acute malnutrition might have died between April 2015 and October 2018.About 80% of the population - 24 million people - need humanitarian assistance and protection.Some 20 million people need help securing food, according to the UN. Almost 10 million of them are considered ""one step away from famine"".The hidden victims of the Yemen warAn estimated 2 million children are acutely malnourished, including almost 360,000 children under five years old who are struggling to survive.With only half of the country's 3,500 medical facilities fully functioning, almost 20 million people lack access to adequate healthcare. And almost 18 million do not have enough clean water or access to adequate sanitation.Consequently, medics have struggled to deal with the largest cholera outbreak ever recorded, which has resulted in more than 2.2 million suspected cases and 3,895 related deaths since October 2016.The United Nations has warned that the death toll from the coronavirus pandemic could ""exceed the combined toll of war, disease, and hunger over the last five years."" The UN also issued a desperate plea for financial aid saying its operations in the country, including vital health services, were severely underfunded.The war has displaced more than 3.65 million from their homes.Suicide bombings claimed by the Islamic State group have killed dozens of people in Aden. What happens in Yemen can greatly exacerbate regional tensions. It also worries the West because of the threat of attacks - such as from al-Qaeda or IS affiliates - emanating from the country as it becomes more unstable.The conflict is also seen as part of a regional power struggle between Shia-ruled Iran and Sunni-ruled Saudi Arabia.Gulf Arab states - backers of President Hadi - have accused Iran of bolstering the Houthis financially and militarily, though Iran has denied this.Yemen is also strategically important because it sits on a strait linking the Red Sea with the Gulf of Aden, through which much of the world's oil shipments pass.",Yemen crisis: Why is there a war?,9,0.15198323667114044
1647,"Even in a country where crisis has become the norm, the past month has been eventful for Venezuela.On April 3 Juan Guaidó, the Venezuelan National Assembly president who is leading an effort to remove President Nicolás Maduro from office, was stripped of his parliamentary immunity. Arrest seems increasingly likely. Guaidó’s chief-of-staff was jailed on March 22, on charges of organizing a “terrorist cell.”Two days later, two Russian military planes carrying 35 tons of unspecified equipment and 100 soldiers landed at the international airport in Caracas.Meanwhile, three blackouts left over 90 percent of the country in the dark. Since water pumps need electricity to run, neighborhoods and families were forced to organize water rationing systems or fetch water from polluted rivers and streams.Maduro blames the blackouts on “sabotage” by Guaidó and the United States. The opposition blames government corruption and neglect of Venezuela’s energy grid.Thousands of Venezuelans protesting the power outages on March 30 were met with violent repression. Counter-protestors came out to support the Maduro government. These extraordinary events may give the appearance that armed conflict is on the horizon. But having researched Venezuela for over 25 years, I believe a prolonged deadlock – and deeper human suffering – is the more likely result.International conflict Each side in Venezuela’s political struggle has powerful international backers. Guaidó has been coordinating with the Trump administration since before assuming the interim presidency, and Trump has made regime change in Venezuela a foreign policy priority. Over 50 countries now recognize Guaidó as Venezuela’s legitimate president.Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó at a rally in Caracas, March 29, 2019. Reuters/Carlos Garcia RawlinsMaduro’s government retains important support from Cuba, Turkey and China – though China, which has loaned Venezuela some $60 billion over the last 12 years, has diminished its public backing of Maduro.Russia has become Maduro’s most important ally. The Russian military equipment and personnel sent in March will likely help maintain and operate Venezuela’s sophisticated Russian-made S-300 air defense system, which protects the capital and key military bases from air attack.The missile defense system may have been damaged in recent power outages, or left understaffed by desertions from Venezuela’s military.In a March 29 press statement, White House national security adviser John Bolton called Russia’s military assistance to Venezuela a “direct threat to international peace and security in the region” that will “perpetuate the economic crisis that has destroyed Venezuela’s economy.”Russian officials retorted that the deployment is part of a prior bilateral arms trade agreement with Venezuela.“The United States is present in many parts of the world and no one is telling it where it should or shouldn’t be,” said Russian President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov at a March 28 Kremlin press conference.Regime change stalled Venezuela’s opposition coalition and its allies in the U.S. appear to have thought that global rejection of Maduro’s re-election and Guaidó’s assuming the interim presidency – coupled with threats of a U.S. military invasion and sanctions on Venezuelan oil – would lead Venezuela’s armed forces to turn against Maduro. That would then usher in a democratic transition.Eighty percent of Venezuelans oppose Maduro, but he retains some popular support – and the power of the Venezuelan armed forces. Miraflores Palace via Reuters Recent events have shown that this strategy was simplistic.More than 500 Venezuelan soldiers have defected to Colombia and Brazil. But most have stayed loyal, as have the generals who hold high positions in Maduro’s government. And Maduro has shown himself quite adept at using dispersed violence to discourage dissent. Despite President Donald Trump’s repeated mentions of a “military option” for dealing with Venezuela, it’s become clear in recent weeks that the U.S. has no actual plans for military action. Indeed, it does not have significant military assets in position near Venezuela. Venezuela’s armed forces are the fifth most powerful in Latin America, according to Global Fire Power, which ranks military strength. It has around 200,000 troops, a volunteer militia, plus paramilitary forces and a fleet of Russian Sukhoi fighter jets. The presence of Russian troops in Venezuela further complicates any plans for U.S. intervention. Russia is a nuclear power, so incurring Russian casualties is probably too big of a risk for the U.S. to take. Adam Isacson, a defense expert at the Washington Office on Latin America, a human rights organization, suggests that removing Maduro by force would not only kill thousands of people on the ground, it would likely require tens of thousands of U.S. troops to occupy Venezuela for years in order to stabilize it. Outside of south Florida, where some 200,000 Venezuelan exiles are clamoring for Maduro’s ouster, few Americans would have an appetite for such a prolonged operation.U.S. economic sanctions – which are now targeting Venezuelan oil – appear to be hurting the Venezuelan people more than Maduro’s government. That will only make a democratic transition more elusive. Depriving the Venezuelan government of cash and credit will impede it from fixing the electrical grid by preventing the purchase of new equipment. And without electricity and water, Venezuelans, who in their vast majority oppose Maduro, will be concentrating on survival rather than protest. Venezuelans protest water shortages in Caracas on March 31, 2019. Reuters/Carlos Garcia Rawlins Working for peace An international effort led by the European Union, Uruguay, Ecuador and Costa Rica is seeking to negotiate new elections. Calling itself the International Contact Group, this coalition has sent technical teams to Caracas twice to meet with the Maduro government and the opposition. The International Contact Group has not actually found much interest on either side. The opposition and its allies in the Trump administration still believe that their strategy of political pressure and economic punishment will lead to the government’s collapse. Maduro, it appears, thinks he can hunker down and wait out the storm. There is one glimmer of hope. After years of political wrangling over humanitarian aid, on March 29 the International Committee of the Red Cross announced that it had brokered agreements with both the Maduro government and the opposition. They will allow the Red Cross to distribute food and medicine to Venezuelans, who have suffered severe shortages of both since 2015. The United Nations estimates that 94 percent of Venezuela’s population now lives in poverty, and a quarter of its people urgently need humanitarian assistance. The Red Cross deal shows what can be achieved with “satellite diplomacy” – that is, negotiations that engage with rival factions independently rather than requiring them to meet face to face. This is significant. It is the first time that this diplomatic technique has succeeded in Venezuela’s conflict. In the best-case scenario, the humanitarian aid agreement will stick. And it could serve as a model for how international actors can facilitate a democratic transition in Venezuela.","Venezuela’s power struggle reaches a tense stalemate, as human suffering deepens",9,0.9895122669581666
1648,"This August marks a full year since one of the 21st century’s worst refugee crises gripped the world’s attention. In 2017, an unprecedented number of Rohingya Muslim refugees began fleeing Myanmar’s Rakhine state for neighbouring Bangladesh, after Myanmar’s military launched a crackdown in response to attacks on border posts by Rohingya rebels. This crisis is, as rightly pointed out by UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, “a humanitarian and human rights nightmare”; the United Nations described the military offensive in Rakhine that provoked the exodus as a “textbook example of ethnic cleansing”.A full year later, the plight of hundreds of thousands of Rohingya people is as abject as ever. In June 2018, Myanmar’s government signed an agreement with the United Nations that will lead to the “voluntary, safe, dignified, and sustainable” repatriation of some 700,000 Rohingya refugees back to their homes, or their place of choosing. At the same time, Myanmar’s civilian and military powers seem to have entirely ignored international condemnation of the crackdown and allegations that it amounted to ethnic cleansing, and Aung San Suu Kyi’s government is still insisting that only refugees with the correct identity documents can return.Small wonder then that the Rohingya themselves remain pessimistic. A recent Amnesty International report on the crisis stated that former Rohingya villages – some of which had been burned to the ground – are now the site of new construction, including new roads and infrastructure for the military. Amnesty fears that the new construction makes it even less likely that the roughly 1m refugees who fled to Bangladesh will ever be able to return to their homes.Rohingya women line up to receive aid at the Balukhali food distribution centre near Cox’s Bazar in Bangladesh. EPA But even if the repatriation agreement is accepted at face value, without the oversight of the United Nations, Myanmar’s military cannot be trusted to broker the conflict-affected population’s competing demands fairly. It already stands accused of widespread violence against Rohingya Muslims within Rakhine state. The post-repatriation time will remain a period during which the big challenge will be about how to restore relationships across the divides in question.And this challenge seems almost impossible. The agreement between the UN and the government of Myanmar is far from detailed, and violence against the Rohingya population is far from over, Rohingya refugees are hardly be keen to return home.The reality is that without a deal on work rights, citizenship and so on, there are deep concerns that Rohingya refugees will be repatriated only to face a situation barely changed since they fled. In the meantime, the monsoon season has already started in Bangladesh, and there are grave concerns for the safety of the refugees. The situation is serious: caught between extreme weather, funding shortfalls and uncertainty about their future, the Rohingya refugees are still living in a humanitarian catastrophe. Dereliction of duty This disaster was created by the Myanmar government’s brutal policies. A recent report by the organisation Fortify Rights confirmed that Myanmar’s military systematically planned a genocidal campaign to rid the country of Rohingya Muslims. But the United Nations Security Council has avoided the “G” word since the exodus began in August 2017; to formally utter it would, in principle, have committed the council’s members to robust action that they are clearly unwilling to take. As long as China and Russia are on Myanmar’s side, an intervention by the Security Council seems out of the question. Neighbouring India also shares no love for the Rohingya. Meanwhile, the rest of the world is still struggling to bring relief to the refugees. For the Rohingya refugees however, repatriation is not an option but an imperative, the only alternative to the limbo of protracted displacement. A Rohingya woman living in a refugee camp holds up a picture of her family. EPA/Nyunt Win. The job of implementing the sustainable repatriation and reintegration of the Rohingya refugees obviously falls to Myanmar itself. So far, the government has done nothing to indicate that it will take that responsibility seriously – and beyond token humanitarian assistance, the countries of the global north have made no major commitment to resolve this crisis.Somewhere along the line, it has been forgotten that Rakhine is one of Myanmar’s poorest and least developed states. According to World Bank estimates it suffers a poverty rate of 78%, dramatically higher than the national average of 37.5%. And since 2012, as communal violence between Buddhist and Muslim communities swept Rakhine, the authorities dramatically intensified their crackdown, deploying excessive lethal force, conducting mass arrests, and blocking aid to displaced Muslims.The Rohingya are discriminated against in many ways, and are denied legal rights to challenge this discrimination. Their demand is not for an independent state per se, but rather for identity and recognition within the state. The Rohingya crisis is therefore not only a humanitarian emergency, but also concerns issues of security, identity and development. Unless these challenges are addressed, the long-term reconciliation processes in both communities will always be more conjecture than reality.","Rohingya crisis: a year since it shocked the world, what’s changed?",9,0.74381410866067
1649,"A Syrian woman is waiting in line for an aid package, distributed by an international aid worker from the UN. War has left her without access to food, water or clothing, and she needs this aid package to survive until next week.The aid worker tells her she will get her package – in exchange for certain favours.This is an imagined scenario, but the issue of sexual exploitation for aid is real. It is known as “survival sex”. My research shows victims are not currently protected by international human rights law. Urgent action is required to enforce zero tolerance and to improve accountability of perpetrators. Trading sex for aid Survival sex is an abuse of power between international humanitarian aid workers and local people. It is the most offensive form of sexual exploitation and it happens everywhere.An official report, Voices of Syria 2018, reveals some women in refugee camps have to offer sexual favours in return for aid packets from UN workers. Some women are afraid to go to distribution points to pick up aid packets because of fear of sexual exploitation and abuse. The more the girl gives to the distributor, the more aid she will receive. – Adolescent girl from Badama sub-district. With 13.5 million people in Syria in need of humanitarian assistance, these revelations are deplorable. This report follows hard on the heels of sexual misconduct reports against members of Oxfam operating in Haiti and Chad. In the wake of the recent #Metoo campaign, these stories are becoming less and less surprising. Yet this is not a recent or an isolated problem. Sex scandals have blighted the international humanitarian aid sector on and off for more than 20 years. In particular, sexual exploitation and abuse has been reported from almost every area in which the UN operates. Some peacekeepers and aid workers can come to believe they are the rescuers of the local community they serve. from www.shutterstock.com, CC BY-ND In 2015, French peacekeepers were accused of forcing children as young as nine to exchange sex for food in the Central African Republic. A later report revealed there were more than 200 victims of sexual abuse in the Central African Republic alone. Allegations involve rape, sexual violence against both adults and children, and exchanging aid for sex. Gender issues in peacekeeping Peacekeepers and humanitarian aid workers are often dispatched to countries that are experiencing the aftermath of conflict, including political instability, severe poverty, displacement, and personal or community trauma. Women in particular have limited access to shelter, food, water, clothing and money. The arrival of aid workers and peacekeepers can offer hope to those who are suffering the most. They control access to refugee camps and distribution of aid packages filled with items local people need to survive from day to day. On the other side is the “saviour” mentality, where peacekeepers and aid workers can come to believe they are the rescuers of the local community they serve. The context can also be gendered, particularly in relation to peacekeeping, which is overwhelmingly male. It results in reluctance to enforce zero-tolerance standards. These circumstances can lead to “othering”, where aid workers perceive the local people as different, inhuman or inherently vulnerable. It is within this context in which survival sex takes place. On foreign ground Accountability for sexual exploitation and abuse, including survival sex, is woeful. UN peacekeepers and aid workers often have legal immunity from the host country’s criminal system. The most the UN can do, and likewise humanitarian aid providers like Oxfam, is terminate the employment of the person and send them home. Sometimes, even this doesn’t happen. Any criminal investigation, and possible punishment, must be conducted by the perpetrator’s home country. Herein lies the problem. Survival sex is unlikely to be a crime in the perpetrator’s home country. Because of its transactional nature, survival sex can often be disguised as prostitution. Soliciting sex from prostitutes may or may not be criminalised in the home country but even if it is, this does not capture the exploitative nature of survival sex and the particular abuse of power taking place. Aid, which is already owed to local people, is being exchanged for sex. Survival sex is not the same as prostitution. Culture of sexual exploitation Because the perpetrator is likely to be a foreign national, victims have no power to pursue criminal justice against them. International human rights law does not yet require countries to criminalise survival sex and provides limited protection to victims. Victims also have reduced access to remedies. Neither the UN nor humanitarian aid services provide compensation to victims for any kind of sexual exploitation and abuse. Often the victim is referred to another agency for medical or psycho-social support. Where UN agencies, like UNICEF, have intervened, they have, on occasion, been accused of being grossly incompetent. The result is a culture of sexual exploitation and abuse which is being committed with impunity. Holding perpetrators to account So what can we, as supporters of international humanitarian aid, do to appropriately respond to such a problem? One option is to pressure humanitarian aid providers, such as Oxfam, to change the underlying culture that fosters sexual exploitation. Challenge them to put your money aside for compensation and other remedies that victims or survivors need. Ask that they put pressure on world governments to hold perpetrators criminally accountable. In my research I argue that survival sex is a form of violence against women under international human rights law. However, there are no current obligations on countries to respond to survival sex. As a result, at the very least, human rights treaty bodies (such as the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women) should tackle this gap in the law and obligate countries to do something.",Urgent action needed to enforce zero tolerance of sexual exploitation by aid workers,9,0.8791372504837682
1650,"The province of Reggio Calabria on the toe of Italy is a hotspot for natural disasters. As a humanitarian reaction to severe floods in 1951 and 1953, thousands of Calabrian children were displaced and sent to live with other families or in summer camps, military bases or Church-sponsored institutions across Italy.Both the Christian-Democrat government in charge at the time as well as the Italian Communist Party (PCI) and their associated civic groups were directly involved in the relocations.This is a silenced corner of Italian and European history. It is not part of official Italian history textbooks, nor an issue readily discussed in local Calabrian communities. As part of my own ongoing research I interviewed a number of former displaced children, now in their sixties and seventies, who spoke to me for the first time about their experiences. They empathise with the problems facing displaced people, particularly children, currently entering Europe and see similarities in their stories of being uprooted. Childhoods uprooted In the floods of 1951, the Ministry of the Interior reported that the damage affected 68 municipalities in Reggio Calabria, that 3,090 houses were severely damaged or destroyed, 3,797 families were hosted in temporary shanty towns and 49 people died. Two years later, more floods killed 55 people with 2,500 more left homeless. Reacting to the disasters, the PCI, involving a number of groups such as the Union of Italian Women, took the initiative to relocate children aged three to 12-years-old from southern Italy – with the agreement of their parents – to live with new communist families in the north of Italy. Centre-right newspapers at the time condemned the scheme as an “abduction of infancy”, echoing criticisms of child evacuations instigated by the Communists during the Greek civil war. An error occurred. Try watching this video on www.youtube.com, or enable JavaScript if it is disabled in your browser.Interventions by the Catholic Church and police, who openly opposed the relocations by the communists, only led to the removed children being sent to monasteries, orphanages or juvenile detention centres across Italy instead of moving to new families or back home. Children stayed away from their parents for between one and ten years.Under other disaster relief schemes active during the early 1950s, the government and church as well as their associated civic groups, primarily the Italian Women’s Centre, also relocated orphans and children from very poor families to place them in institutions across the country. Some of the people who were relocated as children who I interviewed spoke of having very positive experiences of living in new towns. There were opportunities to go to the cinema, get a good school education and eat new foods. But others were deeply traumatised.Two such children, displaced at the age of six and seven, remember the day they describe as being “snatched” by the Italian Red Cross, without warning and while playing with their friends. They stopped only momentarily to wave goodbye to their parents working in a nearby field. They were taken to Sicily before being separated and sent to gender segregated institutions in different parts of Italy where they lived for over a year until they returned home. Life in the institutions was hard: there was hunger, malnutrition, stale bread, and corporal punishment. Today, recalling memories of this experience provokes immense suffering and disbelief about the political decision-making processes and power games between left and right that were involved in these children’s relocation for “humanitarian” reasons. Silent reunions Upon their return, many children remained silent about their experiences. They soon understood that what had happened caused a great deal of suffering to their parents. The relocations were a source of constant humiliation and shame for both the children and their families. According to many of those who were relocated as children that I spoke to, their parents were victims of false promises by the government to provide them with subsidies and a new house – things which never materialised. It has become apparent during my research that even in close-knit Calabrian village communities, children who were relocated are to this day rarely aware of neighbours who suffered the same fate. In Italy, where secrets are often public knowledge, families and neighbours kept their personal story of displacement well guarded. People do still remember and evaluate what happened to them. But I believe there was no space for the existence of these divisive and shameful stories in the newly united Italian collective post-war imagination. The child displacement seemed to be an extra burden that Italy could not or was not willing to shoulder after the moral and political defeat of the war. After the devastating schisms of World War II, silence in Europe seemed like a natural condition. The post-war period was fundamental in giving birth to and establishing top-down policies, spawning lasting ideological positions concerning displacement and refugees. In the same way, Europe today is unprepared for the current migration crisis while still dealing with the debris of economic meltdown. The silenced child displacement of 1950s Italy is not simply a thing of the past. Humanitarian actions that took place several decades ago continue to affect the lives of relocated children. Displaced children breaking their silence about their experiences is fundamental not only to piecing together silenced European histories but, crucially, to better evaluate the current politics of mass relocation.",The untold story of thousands of Italian children sent away from their parents in the 1950s,9,0.0014632322837967449
1651,"1. Climate displacement: Tomorrow’s emergencies today From rising sea levels to withering drought and unpredictable weather: projections for what the world can expect if climate change remains unchecked are grave. Yet extreme weather is already uprooting populations around the globe, and the aid sector and governments are struggling to cope. Vulnerable communities have long known what the aid sector is just beginning to articulate: climate change is a humanitarian issue, and its fingerprints are already evident in today’s most pressing emergencies. Why we’re watching:  Severe drought in 2018 affected hundreds of thousands of people, from Central Asia to Central America, from the Sahel to North Korea. In Afghanistan, drought displaced nearly as many people as conflict in 2018, and the worst impacts may be yet to come. In Somalia, food shortages from drought and floods combined with conflict to force people from their homes. In low-lying Pacific nations, governments are reluctantly making worst-case contingency plans to permanently move entire communities – a handful of managed relocations are already quietly underway. World Bank research predicts climate change could force 143 million people by 2050 to migrate within their own countries in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Latin America. This year could offer an early climate test for the aid sector. The UN’s meteorological agency says there is a 75-80 percent chance of a weak El Niño event developing by February, which could combine with long-term climate change to destabilise already volatile rainfall and temperature patterns around the world. It’s a threat multiplier that could sharpen food insecurity and exacerbate existing emergencies. Keep in mind: Recently, the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre estimated drought-linked displacement for the first time in four countries, tallying 1.3 million people in Burundi, Ethiopia, Madagascar, and Somalia. These numbers, researchers said, “suggest that the true scale of displacement far exceeds available estimates”. Attributing climate change to specific disasters is an emerging science, though, and definitively linking climate change to specific displacement is even more difficult. Uncertainties in estimating displacement are a “major blind spot” for the aid sector: without knowing how many people could lose their homes and livelihoods, planning humanitarian responses and enacting responsive policies becomes more problematic. 2. Syria: It’s not over ‘til it’s over A win by President Bashar al-Assad is increasingly seen as a fait accompli, but with large parts of the country still controlled by rebels and others seemingly up for grabs, the fighting isn’t finished, nor are attempts to influence the aid effort. Why we’re watching: Nearly eight years since the uprising against al-Assad began, his government appears to be closing in on victory, both on the battlefield and in the political arena: rebel pockets in the capital Damascus have been defeated, and the Arab League is reportedly looking to readmit Syria to its ranks, after expelling it for violent repression of demonstrators in 2011. But the war is not over yet: there are still an estimated three million people in the rebel-held northwest around Idlib province, which is only quiet due to a Turkey-Russia deal. The US announcement that it will pull its troops out of Syria at some point could mean a bloody power struggle in the northeast, where Turkey, Kurdish fighters, government forces, and the remnants of so-called Islamic State all have an interest. As donors, al-Assad, and outside powers all look to get a foothold in Syria’s future, the mix of potential chaos and pockets of calm – including areas run by groups designated as terrorists by Western countries – will make it even harder to deliver neutral aid, based on need alone, to all Syrians. That aid includes emergency needs like food, shelter, and healthcare, as well as the increasingly controversial issue of reconstruction during wartime. If you think aid has already been manipulated in Syria, there’s plenty more of that to come. Keep in mind: The UN no longer considers any part of Syria besieged, but 45,000 people are trapped in a no man’s land between Syrian government front lines and the border with Jordan. With aid deliveries few and far between, this makeshift camp is a reminder of ongoing blockages in the aid effort. 3. Outsourcing risk: Local responders shoulder the danger In insecure areas with limited access, many international aid organisations subcontract donor-funded programmes to local groups – “remote management” in industry jargon. But aid analysts say this increasingly widespread strategy carries ethical and moral quandaries. Why we’re watching: From Afghanistan and Syria to the Central African Republic and South Sudan, violence is pushing international aid groups to rethink their operations in conflict areas, as once-accepted norms of providing humanitarian access safely to aid workers are repeatedly flouted. Faced with threats to humanitarian staff and shrinking access, international aid groups are relying more and more on local responders, but those responders don’t always have the resources to stay safe. In 2017, nearly half of the 300 aid workers killed, kidnapped, or wounded on the job worked for local non-governmental organisations – a sharp rise reflecting “near-universal reliance” on local staff in the riskiest areas, according to the Aid Worker Security Database. Despite taking on more of the risk, local groups say they don’t always have the means to stay safe. Strapped for cash and commonly unable to access direct donor funding, local NGOs frequently have no alternative but to accept short-term sub-grants. Funding and project plans often trickle down without the support to strengthen security and manage the risks. The trend stretches beyond conflict zones: the wider humanitarian sector has promised to “localise” aid – empowering local communities, NGOs, and authorities to lead their own responses – but local organisations say they’re often treated as sub-contractors rather than equal partners. Is there a solution? Local aid organisations are pushing for direct, longer-term funding and a greater share of the resources that could help their staff manage the risks. But promised reforms have been slow across the aid sector, let alone in conflict zones. Keep in mind: There’s a common assumption that local staff and organisations face fewer risks in insecure areas, precisely because they are local. But local aid workers have always carried the greatest burden in violent humanitarian emergencies: roughly nine of every 10 aid workers attacked are local staff. 4. Ethiopia: Gambling on reforms Loosening a political straitjacket on 105 million people and weakening central control at the same time: Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed’s moves could be the biggest relaxation of state control – and the least predictable humanitarian planning scenario – since the death of Ethiopia’s Emperor Menelik in 1913. In a country whose poorest have little room for error, his experiment is a high-stakes gamble that could backfire and cause less welcome upheavals. Why we’re watching: For many years, Abiy, who took office in April 2018, was an officer in the vast national intelligence apparatus. Since taking power, he has moved boldly to rein in that same security establishment, end a cold war with Eritrea, and even install a former political prisoner (jailed by his own party in 2005) to run the country’s elections. The developments are breathtaking – but a little scary. Inter-communal tensions have been flaring in Ethiopia since 2017: violent clashes over land and resources left 1.4 million displaced in 2018 alone. In addition, about four million are on welfare schemes every year, and some eight million more have needed help with basic food in the last two years thanks to poor weather. Ethiopia relies on rain-fed agriculture and is precariously low on foreign exchange. Regions (and sub-regions) are demanding more autonomy, the ruling political coalition is under strain, and a military old guard feels cornered. Keep in mind: Ethiopia hosts more than 900,000 refugees, mainly from South Sudan, Somalia, and Eritrea. It has a military presence in Somalia, including part of a flagging African Union force fighting al-Shabab extremists. It is also the top contributor of troops to UN peacekeeping. 5. Returning refugees: The meaning of ‘voluntary’ Pressure is building on millions of vulnerable people to return to dangerous homelands, with 2019 shaping up as a pivotal year for the world’s four largest refugee crises. Between them, Syrians, Afghans, South Sudanese, and Myanmar’s Rohingya account for well over half the world’s refugees, not to mention an almost equal number of internally displaced people. Refugees IDPs Hosts Why we’re watching: Aid agencies and analysts say it’s not peace and readiness driving returns, but political considerations and poor conditions in host countries. And returns are often voluntary in name only. Refugees can have their right to stay revoked or be offered incentives to return, but in many cases they feel compelled to head back to danger for family reunification or because they have little prospect of integration (access to housing, schools, work, and healthcare) elsewhere. The UN refugee agency is forecasting 250,000 Syrians to return to their country in 2019. But not all of Syria’s 5.6 million refugees or 6.2 million IDPs want to go back. For those who do return, obstacles can include a lack of documentation confirming identity and property ownership, few or no basic services, and the risk of unexploded ordnance – not to mention forced conscription and the ongoing war. In South Sudan, where a fragile peace deal is encouraging returns, returnees also face extreme food insecurity and few functioning markets in one of the world’s most underdeveloped economies. A recent report highlighted a dearth of planning “to ensure a continuation of protection and life-saving aid services in potential areas of returns”. Afghans fleeing war are now finding it harder to find refuge abroad, and hundreds of thousands of refugees in Pakistan and Iran face increasing pressure to return to a country still mired in conflict, with safe land and job opportunities in short supply. Neighbouring countries are also reportedly preparing for a fresh refugee influx linked to US withdrawal plans. Meanwhile, Rohingya in Bangladesh remain in a stateless limbo, having been denied citizenship in their home country of Myanmar. Attempts to kickstart repatriations floundered in 2018. But Bangladesh says the nearly one million Rohingya refugees on its soil must one day return home, and no one really knows what 2019 will bring. Keep in mind: The UN abides by the legal principle of non-refoulement and has criteria for refugee returns: they mustn’t be rushed or premature and they must be voluntary and sustainable. We’ll be watching to see if this holds true over the next 12 months. 6. Infectious diseases: Healthcare as a casualty of crisis Countries experiencing humanitarian crises are seeing the re-emergence of previously forgotten diseases; for example, diphtheria, which took a toll on Yemenis, Venezuelans, and Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh in 2018. And political and structural challenges in some of the world’s least developed countries are fostering rich environments for many other diseases to thrive: cholera, Ebola, malaria, measles, MERS, yellow fever, and Zika. Why we’re watching: Despite significant medical advances and modern organisational procedures that can help tackle outbreaks almost as soon as they occur, epidemics and infectious diseases are still among the most common killers in many countries caught up in conflicts or natural disasters. In places like South Sudan, with weak healthcare systems weakened further by war, resources are unavailable to deal with even treatable diseases like malaria. As a result, thousands of lives are unnecessarily lost. In countries gripped by protracted conflict, like the Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of Congo, years of fighting have decimated health facilities. The presence of armed groups often thwarts attempts to reach patients, preventing measles or yellow fever vaccination campaigns for instance and, in 2018, enabling Ebola to spread in eastern Congo. In countries in all-out war, like Syria and Yemen, bombs and attacks have left hospitals in ruins, while the destruction of water and sanitation infrastructure has made it easy for diseases like cholera to spread. Keep in mind: While outbreaks of disease are a medical concern, it is the larger structural and political issues that allow them to thrive and recur. The combination of weak systems, flaws in prevention efforts, ineffective response capabilities, and ongoing conflict is making healthcare a casualty of crisis and a huge concern for humanitarian workers going into 2019. 7. South Sudan and Congo: Politics versus peace 2019 is a political year of promise for the Democratic Republic of Congo and South Sudan: the reason we’ve grouped them together. While the world watches to see if the DRC can achieve a first peaceful transfer of democratic power and if a fledgling peace deal in South Sudan will hold, how both situations develop also carries major implications for millions of people in need of assistance. Why we’re watching: South Sudan and the DRC are two of the world's largest humanitarian crises, displacing almost 10 million people between them. The roots of conflict and the historical backdrop in each country are very different, but civilians in both are desperately hoping that political change in 2019 will yield more peaceful conditions on the ground. In Congo, long-delayed elections to replace President Joseph Kabila – in power since 2001 – finally took place on 30 December. The polls, although relatively peaceful, were marred by reports of widespread irregularities, including broken voting machines and missing voter rolls. Other areas (largely opposition strongholds) were excluded from the vote entirely, the government citing instability and Ebola as reasons for the decision. This sparked violent street protests, as opposition figures alleged the move was a ploy by Kabila to manipulate the polls and ensure his party retains power (more than one million registered voters were excluded). If elections aren’t viewed as free and fair, tensions could escalate – as they have in the past – moving political violence to the top of Congo's extensive list of challenges. The country is in the midst of its worst Ebola outbreak; armed attacks continue in the central and eastern regions, including Ebola-affected North Kivu and Ituri; and intercommunal conflict, displacement, and severe food insecurity have left almost 13 million people in need of assistance. In South Sudan, where half a decade of war has devastated the country, yet another peace agreement was signed between the warring parties in September. While some see signs of hope that this new truce will hold, ushering in the return of refugees and the rebuilding of the country, many analysts fear more of the same, as the new accord is not that different from the one drafted in 2015 that fell apart soon after being signed. Although violence has reduced in some parts of the country, armed groups are still active; IDPs are not yet rushing home as security and basic social services are lacking; and many remain suspicious of the motivations of the politicians whose in-fighting triggered the crisis. Keep in mind: The extent of displacement and food insecurity in South Sudan and the large number of conflicts in Congo amount to a scale of humanitarian crisis only matched by Syria and Yemen. It will take more than ballot sheets and paper pacts to turn lives around, although it’s a start. And Ebola could become an even bigger problem, especially if it spreads from Congo to South Sudan. 8. Anti-terror compliance: When aid falls foul of the law Hussam Baradi/UNICEF It’s getting harder to stay on the right side of counter-terrorism legislation, NGOs say. That means more vulnerable people could be left without the aid they and their families depend on. And the penalties for the wrong type of engagement with sanctioned groups can be very costly, as the NGO Norwegian People’s Aid found. Why we’re watching: The scope of counter-terrorism legislation has not widened dramatically – although the UK may add new legal provisions – but the machinery of enforcement has matured. Risk is thus being pushed down to implementing agencies, observers say. Donors’ compliance demands are getting heavier, and that’s making it harder to help people who, whatever their views, just happen to live where sanctioned groups are in control – from Somalia to Palestine to Syria. Whatever the regulations, NGOs still need to move funds and engage in dialogue with whichever authority holds sway. NGO advocates say they can’t possibly check every aid recipient’s family for members who are militants, but they fear that’s where things are heading. Investigators attached to USAID told IRIN they don’t pursue petty cases but have a duty to stop large-scale criminal fraud in taxpayer-funded aid programmes. But even minor infractions – like who attends a training session or public event – can put an aid agency on the wrong side of sweeping counter-terrorism laws. Working in Gaza, for example, is a US legal minefield, as the de facto authority that runs hospitals and schools, Hamas, is a designated terrorist group. Keep in mind: Several US investigations are expected to become public in 2019, which may impact more NGOs. Some aid agencies may shut up shop in the most difficult areas. Donors may choose to transfer more funding through large UN agencies or international banks to avoid the enforcement headaches of dealing with smaller NGOs with less legal clout. Getting help to Palestinians and parts of Syria will be particularly difficult. 9. Militancy in Africa: Weak governments struggle, civilians suffer Violent jihadism continues to gain ground in Africa, representing a serious trial for weak and neglectful governments, and driving up humanitarian needs for civilians. In Nigeria, the Islamic State of West Africa Province (a Boko Haram splinter group) is now the deadliest IS franchise – seizing towns and racking up more killings in November than IS-linked groups in Syria and Iraq. Security has also worsened due to Islamist attacks in several other countries in recent months, noticeably in Mali and Burkina Faso. Meanwhile, governments from North Africa to South Africa appear unprepared for the potential security impact of the return of citizens who fought with IS in Syria and Iraq. Why we’re watching: Extremist groups operate in Egypt and Libya, and across a belt of Sahelian countries, including Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Mali, Niger, and Nigeria. In Somalia they control a large swathe of territory, threatening other countries in East Africa, while a new militant group has emerged in the southern African nation of Mozambique. Somalia and Mali have been the hubs of longstanding jihadist insurgencies, which have also lent support to like-minded groups in neighbouring countries, such as Burkina Faso. In the Sahel, violent events linked to militant Islamist groups tripled in 2018. All this prevents governments from delivering public goods and services to affected regions, robbing them of an effective riposte to the ideological challenge posed by the militants, who portray their rebellions in terms of justice and righteousness. Keep in mind: African armies have proven unprepared to deal with these guerrilla forces. Governments continue to reach for military solutions, backed by their Western partners. At the same time, an over-militarised response risks fuelling support for the extremist cause as a consequence of human rights abuses committed by the security forces and measures that restrict people’s livelihoods. 10. Yemen: Risk of fragmenting conflict Yemen’s main warring parties are finally talking, and even shaking hands. But even if the 45- month war ends – and that’s a big if – the country could easily slide into a series of local conflicts, bringing little respite for the 24 million civilians the UN says need some sort of aid, be it food, clean water, or shelter. Why we’re watching: The sheer scale of Yemen’s humanitarian catastrophe is staggering: the figure for those in need (above) represents 80 percent of the country’s population, and 2018 also saw economic collapse, a renewed cholera outbreak, and a further slide towards famine. The conflict sometimes seems intractable, and so it was to the surprise of many observers that UN-led talks on Yemen bore some fruit at the end of the year, when two delegations in Stockholm agreed to a ceasefire in the key port city of Hodeidah, among other measures. But Yemen’s conflict has more than two sides; it’s really a fractured web of alliances at local, national, and international levels so complicated that few people really understand it, and the main negotiating parties don’t always control the troops fighting on the ground. As 2019 starts, a UN observer mission is in Hodeidah and more talks are scheduled. But if those with a place at the negotiating table do agree to end the larger war without addressing local grievances, there’s a real risk that a series of smaller conflicts will leave civilians in the line of fire and prevent them from getting the help they desperately need. Keep in mind: The UN is appealing for $4 billion to help 15 million Yemenis in 2019 – that’s the most it has ever requested for one country. The needs are huge, and even though the world is finally paying some attention to Yemen, the violence, hunger, and death may not end even if the war does.",Ten humanitarian crises and trends to watch in 2019,9,0.7044709823089177
1652,"When Abdulla Bin Ghooth saw the computed tomography scan of the lungs of a colleague’s brother in Aden, Yemen, in April, he knew the outlook was grim. The 55-year-old man had complained of a fever and shortness of breath, and likely had COVID-19. But hospital staff, afraid of the novel coronavirus, sent him home with an oxygen cylinder, says Bin Ghooth, an epidemiologist at Hadhramout University College of Medicine. He pleaded with friends at the ministry of health to intervene, to no avail. The colleague’s brother was never tested for COVID-19 and died at home 3 days later. Perhaps no country is more vulnerable to COVID-19’s depredations than Yemen. Even before the virus’ arrival, the country was grappling with “the largest humanitarian crisis in the world,” as a result of a civil war now grinding into its sixth year, says Jens Laerke, a spokesperson at the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Yemen has 3.6 million internally displaced people, scores of attacks have left half of the nation’s medical facilities in tatters, and a cholera outbreak has sickened some 2.3 million Yemenis, killing nearly 4000. The United Nations classifies nearly one-quarter of the population of 30 million as malnourished. And now, after staging massive aid operations in Yemen over the past few years, the United Nations is running out of cash as donations from member countries—busy battling COVID-19 on their own turf—dry up. “Tragically, we do not have enough money to continue” the relief work, the heads of the World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF, and other U.N. agencies write in an urgent call to donors issued today. “COVID-19 could be the straw that breaks the camel’s back,” says Abdulwahed Al-Serouri, technical adviser to the Yemen Field Epidemiology Training Program run by the health ministry in Sana’a. The United Nations and Saudi Arabia are cohosting a virtual pledging event on 2 June. If that fails to drum up support, Laerke warns, “The world will have to witness what happens in a country without a functioning health system battling COVID-19. I don’t think we’ll want to see that.” Yemen reported its first COVID-19 case on 10 April in a port town in Hadhramout governorate; authorities closed schools days later, and mosques posted signs asking people to pray 1 meter apart. Official case numbers remain low: As of 27 May, the country had reported 253 cases and 50 deaths. That’s hard to square with reports of mass graves being dug in Aden, the capital. On 21 May, Doctors Without Borders reported at least 68 people had died from the virus at its facility in Aden alone, and that scores more were dying at home. In Sana’a, the former capital where Houthi rebels, aligned with Iran, have set up their own government, the rebel health ministry has so far reported just four COVID-19 cases. But Al-Serouri says there are unofficial reports of hundreds of laboratory-confirmed cases. The rival health ministries in Aden and Sana’a “each accuse the other of lying about the extent of COVID-19 in the areas they control,” says Hakeem Al-Jawfy, a critical care and respiratory specialist at Al Thawra Modern General Hospital. Altaf Musani, an epidemiologist who heads WHO’s office in Yemen, says one problem is that official tallies only reflect severely ill patients in COVID-19 isolation wards. People with mild or moderate symptoms—not to mention asymptomatic individuals—are simply not getting tested. The fuse for a calamity has been lit. “We have at least nine clusters showing active transmission in the south,” Musani says. Earlier this week, during a monthlong ceasefire in much of the country, revelers celebrating Eid, the festival marking the end of Ramadan, thronged markets. “Many people are going about their lives unconcerned and unaware of danger,” says Abdul Rahman Al-Azraqi, a physician and former hospital manager in Taiz. Based on modeling by a group at Imperial College in London, WHO is bracing for the novel coronavirus to infect about half of Yemen’s population and kill an estimated 30,000 to 40,000. But the toll could be much higher if the United Nations can’t replenish its coffers. Last year, the agency spent $4 billion on humanitarian efforts in Yemen. Nearly halfway into 2020, it has received only $700 million. “Of 41 major UN programs in Yemen, more than 30 will close in the next few weeks if we cannot secure additional funds,” today’s letter from U.N. agency heads says. “This means many more people will die.” Oh, it’s so sad. The political and security situation has eviscerated the country. Yemen is facing the crisis after a conflict-driven brain drain hollowed out its ranks of doctors and scientists. In 2011, the Arab Spring stoked a revolution that ended the 33-year rule of President Ali Abdullah Saleh. Fighting broke out in March 2015. Yemen “took a hard hit at the start of the war,” says Hilal Lashuel, a neurobiologist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne who left Yemen in 2005. “Many Yemeni scientists fled. I don’t believe there’s any serious research activity now.” “Oh, it’s so sad. The political and security situation has eviscerated the country,” says Mustafa al’Absi, a Yemen-born neuroscientist at the University of Minnesota who led a National Institutes of Health–supported project in Yemen on mental health and substance abuse until 2014. Deprived of government subsidies, hospitals have sought to prop themselves up by charging more, which put medical care out of reach for poorer patients. Before 2011, people had to pay at most 10% of the cost of procedures, Al-Jawfy says. “Now they pay 100%.” Humanitarian groups have provided basic medicines such as adrenalin, and some protective equipment, Al-Jawfy adds. But his hospital’s MRI machine hasn’t worked in 4 years, he says. He contends that Saudi customs officials seized a shipment of spare parts on the grounds they could be used in missiles. “Most of our ventilators are out of order. No spare parts,” he adds. Only 157 of Yemen’s 500-odd ventilators are working, Laerke says. WHO has worked to bring into Yemen more ventilators, intensive care unit beds, and other critical supplies as part of its effort to expand the number of COVID-19 isolation wards from 38 to 59 nationwide. And WHO has provided 8400 test kits—a down payment on the estimated 9.2 million kits the organization forecasts the country will need. The government in Sana’a now has a COVID-19 advisory committee that includes representatives from the Yemen Field Epidemiology Training Program, which is also staffing a new COVID-19 hotline. However, notes Nasser Zawia, a Yemen-born pharmacologist at the University of Rhode Island, Kingston, “There is no Tony Fauci of Yemen,” referring to the head of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. One asset in the battle against COVID-19 is a legacy of Yemen’s attempts to quell its cholera outbreak, the largest ever recorded. To run down leads and rumors of suspected cholera cases, the United Nations trained rapid-response teams in all of Yemen’s 333 districts. These health care workers, Musani says, are “playing a pivotal role” against COVID-19, sleuthing for suspected cases, contact tracing, and getting samples back to labs in Aden, Mukalla, Say’un, and Sana’a for virus testing. “They’re the real heroes,” Musani says, adding that the United Nations now aims to double the number of rapid-response teams. This small army on the front lines of Yemen’s existential crisis has its work cut out for them. “Tackling COVID in Yemen,” Lashuel says, “is almost mission impossible.”",Yemen was facing the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.

1653,"A woman's migraine medication caused a rare reaction: a burning sensation in her legs and the loss of one of her toes, according to a new report of the case.Doctors diagnosed the woman with ergotism — also known as St. Anthony's fire — a now uncommon condition that once caused mysterious outbreaks in medieval Europe. Her medication was derived from the same natural chemical behind these historical outbreaks.The 24-year-old woman went to the doctor after she suddenly began to experience a severe burning pain in her legs, from her midthigh down to her toes, according to the report, published Wednesday (July 22) in The New England Journal of Medicine. She also had discoloration in her feet and trouble walking, and both legs were cold to the touch, according to the authors, from Government Medical College in Thiruvananthapuram, a city in southern India. Four days earlier, she had started taking a medication called ergotamine for migraine headaches. The woman was also born with HIV and was taking several antiviral medications to treat the disease.A CT scan revealed that the arteries in both her legs had narrowed and thus reduced blood flow to the area.Based on her symptoms, her doctors suspected she had ergotism, a disease traditionally caused by ingesting poisonous compounds made by a fungus called Claviceps purpurea, which infects cereal grains such as rye. In the Middle Ages, the disease caused large outbreaks among people who ate tainted rye, according to the American Society for Microbiology (ASM). Afflicted individuals developed mystifying symptoms including burning pain and gangrene in their limbs, while others experienced convulsions and hallucinations. Some researchers hypothesize that ergotism was also behind the mysterious symptoms experienced by girls accused of ""bewitchment"" in the 17th-century Salem witch trials, according to a 2016 paper in the journal JAMA Dermatology.C. purpurea produces compounds called ""ergot alkaloids,"" which affect the cells that line blood vessel walls and lead to constriction, or narrowing, of the blood vessels, resulting in reduced blood flow, according to a 2016 paper in the International Journal of Angiology.Public health measures to prevent ergotism — such as removal of infected grains (which appear black) from the harvest — started in the 1800s, and the disease has been rare since then, according to ASM. But the same fungal compounds that cause ergotism were later isolated and used for medical purposes, including treatment of headaches, as is the case for the drug ergotamine. Today, most cases of ergotism are due to ergot alkaloid treatments, for instance, if the doses are too high or the treatment is prolonged, ASM said. But people can sometimes develop ergotism even when taking normal doses of ergot-based drugs. This happens when people are taking other medications that lead to a drug interaction. One such drug is the HIV medication ritonavir, which blocks the enzyme involved in breaking down ergot compounds, according to a 1999 paper in the journal BMJ. Because of this interaction, the National Institutes of Health warns that people should not take ergotamine if they also take certain HIV medications. The woman in this case was taking ritonavir as part of her HIV treatment. Doctors treated her ergotism with the blood-thinning drug heparin, and her symptoms soon improved — her pain subsided and her legs became warmer. However, the treatment didn't come soon enough to prevent gangrene in one of the toes on her left foot, which had to be amputated. A CT (computed tomography) scan two weeks later showed improved blood flow in both legs, the report said.",Woman's migraine medication caused a bizarre 'medieval' disease,8,0.4979107243633002
1654,"Antibodies are specialized, Y-shaped proteins that bind like a lock-and-key to the body's foreign invaders — whether they are viruses, bacteria, fungi or parasites. They are the ""search"" battalion of the immune system's search-and-destroy system, tasked with finding an enemy and marking it for destruction.""They're released from the cell and they go out and hunt,"" said Dr. Warner Greene, the director of the Center for HIV Cure Research at the Gladstone Institutes in San Francisco.When antibodies find their target, they bind to it, which then triggers a cascade of actions that vanquish the invader. Antibodies are part of the so-called ""adaptive"" immune system, the arm of the immune system that learns to recognize and eliminate specific pathogens, Greene said. What do antibodies look like? The two arms at the top of the antibody's Y shape bind to what's known as the antigen. The antigen can be a molecule, or a molecular fragment — often some part of a virus or bacteria. (For instance, the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has unique ""spikes"" on its outer coat, and some antibodies bind to and recognize these spike proteins.) The bottom of the Y, or the stalk, binds to several other immune-system compounds that can help kill the antigen or mobilize the immune system in other ways. One set of these, for instance, triggers the complement cascade, Greene told Live Science.""Complement is actually the executioner,"" that punches holes in the target cell, such as the membrane of a virus, Greene said. Antibodies, which are also called immunoglobulins (Ig), all have the same basic Y-shape, but there are five variations on this theme — called IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD and IgE, said Jason Cyster, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of California, San Francisco. Each variation looks slightly different and plays slightly different roles in the immune system. For instance, immunoglobulin G, or IgG, is just one Y, whereas IgM looks a bit like the 10-armed Hindu goddess Durga, with five Ys stacked together, and each prong can bind one antigen.IgG and IgM are the antibodies that circulate in the bloodstream and go into solid organs, Cyster said. IgA is ""squirted out of the body,"" in mucus or secretions, Cyster told Live Science. IgE is the antibody that typically triggers allergic responses, such as to pollen or peanuts, according to the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology. IgD has historically been enigmatic, but one of its roles is to help activate the cells that make antibodies. Where do antibodies form? To understand antibodies, you first need to know about B-cells, which are a type of white blood cell that forms in the bone marrow. There are about a trillion B-cells in the body, and each one has a unique IgM antibody that sits on the B-cell surface and each binds, to one antigen, said Simon Goodman, the Science and Technology Program Manager for The Antibody Society, a nonprofit organization that represents those involved in antibody research and development. This staggering level of variation allows the body to recognize almost any substance that could enter. Here’s how it achieves that diversity: In each B-cell, the genes that code for the antibody's binding site are shuffled like playing cards in a deck.""The amount of rearrangement that can occur is enormous,"" Cyster told Live Science. These B-cells then patrol the body, often lingering longer in areas like the lymph nodes or the tonsils, Cyster said. Most of the time, these B-cells don't bind anything. But if, by a one- in-a-million chance, a B-cell does bind some foreign substance, ""that triggers the B-cell to say 'Hey we need to get activated,'"" Cyster said.The B-cell grows in size and starts to divide in what's called ""clonal expansion,"" Cyster said.""It's an identical copy of the parent, just like the mother,"" Cyster said. After a week or so, there may be hundreds of thousands to a million of these copies.Eventually, these clonally expanded B-cells differentiate into plasma cells, which are antibody factories.”They secrete 10,000 antibodies per cell per second. They can do that for weeks or years if you're lucky,"" Cyster said. But not all B-cells divide the same amount. ""If you consider the B-cell to be a lock, and you consider all of these different things to be floating around to be different keys, then some of the keys will fit better, some will fit worse, and some won't fit at all,"" Goodman told Live Science. ""And depending on how well the key fits into the lock on the surface of a particular B-cell, that cell will be triggered to divide more."" Then, the more prolific B-cells produce more plasma cells and churn out more of a specific type of antibody.The body doesn't just produce one type of antibody either; it produces a messy, chaotic zoo of them. Each locks onto different parts of an invader. And antibodies don't all do the same thing once they've bound to a target. Some will nip infection in the bud by directly neutralizing a threat, preventing a pathogen from entering a cell. Others tag invaders, so that the immune system's killer cells (which aren’t antibodies) can remove it, Greene said. Still others may wrap viruses or bacteria in a gooey coating. And other antibodies might tell Pac-Man-like immune cells called macrophages to come gobble up the invader. (That strategy can sometimes backfire with viruses, which may co-opt this response to invade new cells, Cyster added.)The first type of antibody to form after you are exposed to a virus is IgM, which emerges within 7 to 10 days after exposure, Greene said. IgM can bind to an invader, but each ""Y"" in this 10-armed protein does so fairly weakly. But, just as five weak people working together can tackle a large, strong adversary, IgM's five Y's (10 arms) working together can bind tightly to an antigen, he added.At about 10 to 14 days, the body begins making IgG, which is the immune system's ""major workhorse,"" Greene said. IgG can cross the placenta in a pregnant woman, giving a newborn passive protection against disease until their own immune system can ramp up, Greene added.Normally, the immune system is stunningly good at recognizing the enemy and ignoring, or tolerating, our own cells. Sometimes, however, this process goes awry. That’s when T-cells (another type of white blood cells) come in. The body uses these T-cells to cross-check targets — only if both a B-cell and a T-cell recognize something as a foreign invader will an immune response be triggered, Goodman said. The body is supposed to remove B-cells that make so-called auto-antibodies, which react to the body's own cells. But when that doesn't happen, the body may mark its own cells for destruction and then relentlessly eliminate them. Autoimmune diseases such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, or type 1 diabetes can result, Goodman said. There are more than 100 autoimmune disorders, according to the American Autoimmune Related Diseases Association.What are monoclonal antibodies?Antibodies have become the basis for some of the most useful medicines, as well as some of the most powerful lab techniques in biology, Goodman said. One of these clinical and therapeutic superstars is what's known as a monoclonal antibody. To create a monoclonal antibody, researchers vaccinate an animal (or possibly a human) to stimulate the production of antibodies against a particular substance. The body will gradually make antibodies that are more and more effective against that antigen. These antibody-producing cells are then filtered out of white blood cells and put into a dish to see which cells bind the antigen best, Goodman said. The cell that binds the best is then isolated — it is an antibody-producing factory, specifically honed to churn out one super-selective antibody.From there, that cell is fused to a blood cancer cell, producing something called a hybridoma. This hybridoma, or monoclone, is an inexhaustible generator of exactly the same antibody, over and over and over. (Researchers bind the monoclonal cell to a cancer cell because cancer just continues to reproduce.)""It just produces and produces and produces, and it will never stop, and it's a cancer, so it's essentially immortal,"" Goodman said. What it produces is a monoclonal antibody. Such cell lines have an incredibly diverse range of uses. There are millions of commercial monoclonal antibodies, which are used in labs to tag the tiniest, most specific cellular targets for study, Goodman said.""They're incredible, they're amazingly precise tools,"" Goodman said. Monoclonal antibodies also form the basis for many blockbuster drugs. For instance, the drug adalimumab (brand name Humira), is a monoclonal antibody that treats rheumatoid arthritis by inhibiting an inflammatory protein known as a cytokine. Another, called bevacizumab (Avastin), targets a molecule that fuels blood vessel growth; by blocking this molecule, bevacizumab can slow the growth of lung, colon, kidney and some brain cancers. And in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, doctors around the world are racing to create monoclonal antibodies that will hopefully neutralize the new coronavirus, Greene said. These antibodies are filtered from the plasma of people who have recovered from COVID-19 (also called convalescent serum). The hope is that by isolating the most effective antibodies, and then producing them en-masse, doctors can create a treatment that provides a temporary, ""passive"" immunity until the body can catch up and mount an effective, more long-lasting response on its own, Greene said.By contrast, polyclonal antibodies are derived from multiple B-cells. Polyclonal antibodies are a library of antibodies that all bind to slightly different parts of the antigen, or target. Polyclonal antibodies are typically produced by injecting an animal with the antigen, stimulating an immune response, and then extracting the animals' plasma to produce antibodies en masse, according to a 2005 study in the Institute for Laboratory Animal Research (ILAR) journal. Unlike monoclonal antibodies, which can take up to 6 months to produce, polyclonal antibodies can be made in 4 to 8 weeks, and require less technical expertise. In addition, for certain types of tests where you are trying to detect the antigen, polyclonal antibodies might have a better chance of binding to the target antigen, making them potentially more sensitive. The downside of polyclonal antibodies is that, because each individual animal might produce a different array of antibodies, making polyclonal antibodies that are consistent from batch to batch can be more challenging, and it isn't as easy to have a large supply, according to a 2005 study in the journal Biotechniques. How do antibody tests work? Antibody tests detect whether the body has produced detectable quantities of antibodies to a certain molecule, and can therefore reveal whether someone has been infected by a specific virus or bacteria in the past. Usually, these tests are detecting IgM or IgG, Live Science previously reported.For instance, SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests typically detect either part or all of the coronavirus' spike protein and can reveal whether someone has had COVID-19 in the past. Because the body takes time to ramp up its production of antibodies, people usually only test positive about two weeks after they were first exposed to the pathogen, Live Science previously reported. There are two common types of antibody tests — lateral flow assays and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests. Both involve fixing an antigen to a surface and then detecting whether an antibody binds to that antigen. Usually, a chemical reaction, such as fluorescence or a color-change, is triggered when the antibody binds to the antigen. Lateral flow assays are similar to pee-on-a-stick pregnancy tests; rather than pee, for antibody tests, blood or serum is washed over the flat surface, which is usually paper. ELISA tests work on a similar principle, only the tests are conducted in microplates and require a lab technician, and the results may not read out instantly, Charlotte Sværke Jørgensen, who studies Virus and Microbiological Special Diagnosis Serology at the Statens Serum Institut in Copenhagen, previously told Live Science in an email.A good antibody test is one that produces few false positives and few false negatives, Live Science previously reported. To ensure that happens, scientists need to ""calibrate"" their test, for instance, by making sure that samples known to not have the antigen do not falsely produce a positive test. For instance, with SARs-CoV-2, that would mean testing blood samples from before the pandemic started and making sure no samples come up positive. They also need to take samples that definitely have the antibody in them, and make sure the antibody test does a good job of detecting those positives.",What are antibodies?,8,0.6752514254032553
1655,"That tickle in your throat? It could be allergies, irritation or even COVID-19. But here's one explanation that may not be on your radar: a worm wriggling in your tonsils.

1656,"Herd immunity describes the point at which a population is sufficiently immune to a disease to prevent its circulation. Researchers at the University of Manchester first coined the term in 1923, to describe how an entire herd of animal subjects (in that case, mice) could become immune to a disease even though not every member of the herd had been immunized.Widespread vaccination is the most reliable way to achieve herd immunity. ""The whole concept of herd immunity arose from the question: How many people do you need to vaccinate in a population to eradicate a disease,"" said Paul Hunter, a professor at the University of East Anglia in the United Kingdom and a member of the World Health Organization's infection prevention committee. But achieving herd immunity is often more complicated than that and it's not always possible — especially when it comes to the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19, for which there is no vaccine. ""Herd immunity involves a variety of factors above and beyond the virus itself,"" said Gregory Poland, director of the Mayo Clinic's Vaccine Research Group. How herd immunity is measured Calculating how many people need to be immune to a disease for it to stop infecting the population any further is relatively simple. First, scientists determine the pathogen's R0 (pronounced R-nought), a variable that estimates the average number of people one contagious individual will infect based on the inherent qualities of the pathogen. It is important to note that R0 is not set in stone. A more precise figure, Rt, captures the number of cases expected per individual as an outbreak progresses and conditions change over time in response to the outbreak. But for the purpose of calculating the threshold necessary for herd immunity, epidemiologists start with R0. The 2014 Ebola outbreak had an R0 of about two, meaning that one contagious Ebola patient infected two others on average, NPR reported. For measles, that figure is closer to 15. Although it is too early to know for sure, researchers suspect the R0 of the virus that causes COVID-19 is roughly three, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Diseases with seemingly low R0 values are still capable of quickly spiraling out of control, provided they are even slightly above one. ""If we assume the R0 for COVID-19 is three, this means that, for every one case, you'll end up with three secondary cases,"" Hunter told Live Science. ""That's one, three, nine, 27, and so on."" The key to achieving herd immunity is driving a disease's R0 (or, as updated information becomes available, Rt) to one. As individuals become immune to a pathogen, either through vaccination or natural immunity acquired from having recovered from the disease, one case is expected to infect fewer and fewer individuals within that population. For measles (R0 = 15), herd immunity kicks in when 14 out of 15, or about 93% of individuals are immune. For COVID-19, two out of three (about 66%) would likely be sufficient.""With a very infectious pathogen you need close to 100% of the population vaccinated,"" Hunter said. ""With COVID-19, given that its R0 is somewhere between two and three, if we could get two thirds of the population immunized I think we would be okay."" How to achieve herd immunity When scientists talk about herd immunity, it is almost always in the context of vaccines. ""Herd immunity would be very much the aim of a [COVID-19] vaccine program,"" Danny Altmann, professor of immunology at Imperial College London, told Live Science. ""This is why vaccine candidates need to be evaluated and compared calmly and objectively. We need the ones that are immunogenic [produce an immune response], protective, safe and confer a sustained level of response."" But there is another way to achieve herd immunity. If the pathogen in question causes lifelong immunity in those it infects, and is allowed to spread more or less unchecked, infection rates will increase exponentially and then naturally flatten, decline and disappear as more people catch the disease, recover and become immune to reinfection — all without introducing a vaccine. This method is far less reliable, however, for two reasons. First, it only works within a relatively closed population in which new, unexposed individuals are not constantly arriving to provide fodder for hungry pathogens. Even isolated communities are not entirely safe from this risk, because ""children are not born with immunity,"" Hunter said. ""Many diseases that we would expect to die out because of herd immunity stay around because there are just enough newborns coming into the population to keep the disease going."" Second, herd immunity by acquired infection only takes hold if a sufficient proportion of the population actually contracts the disease. This is not a forgone conclusion, and is almost certainly not the case with COVID-19, according to preliminary data from affected European countries and a study from Spain published July 2020 in the journal The Lancet. The numbers suggest that, despite dire losses, the novel coronavirus infected only a fraction of the population—far below the threshold for herd immunity. ""Sweden has had many infections, many deaths, and did not achieve herd immunity. Spain and Italy did not achieve herd immunity either, and surveys find that the rates of immunity in those countries are maybe 15%,"" Poland said. And while it is tempting to assume that once an individual recovers from COVID-19, they are immune from future infection, studies increasingly suggest that this may not be the case. ""We are seeing these 'COVID parties', with people thinking 'I'll go, get infected, and be over it,'"" he added. ""Beyond the stupidity of exposing yourself to a potentially lethal disease, it's an ignorant approach that presupposes a truth that is likely not there — once infected, immune."" Herd immunity doesn't always work The ingredients for achieving herd immunity naturally are well understood. ""You want a disease that is guaranteed to produce robust immunity with largely asymptomatic spread, and have a low R0,"" Altmann told Live Science. But even if the R0 is relatively high and most patients are symptomatic, herd immunity is still possible with an effective vaccine, and a vaccine program that immunizes the population en masse. ""Think of our big, public-health vaccination success-stories: Smallpox and polio, both entirely due to massive, sustained vaccine programs with simple, highly effective vaccines,"" he said. Robust immunity is necessary to ensure that those who become immune stay that way long enough for the pathogen to die out. Asymptomatic spread helps, because it means that fewer people are likely to die while the population waits for herd immunity to take hold — and increases the likelihood that there will be enough survivors to affect herd immunity in the first place. A low R0, of course, lowers the bar for how many individuals need to be immune before we see the infection rate flatten and decline. Nonetheless, some diseases that are seemingly strong candidates for herd immunity never quite achieve it. Despite widespread infection and vaccination, chicken pox, for instance, has never been entirely eradicated from the population. That's because the virus that causes chicken pox remains latent in the nerve roots of those who are infected by it, even after they recover and acquire immunity to the disease. As once-infected individuals grow older their immune systems weaken and the virus can reactivate, causing shingles, which can, in turn, cause chicken pox. ""You might have eradicated chicken pox in a small island community, but then somebody's granny gets an attack of shingles and, over a matter of weeks, every kid on the island gets chicken pox,"" Hunter said. ""You've achieved herd immunity, and [it appears] the virus has died out, but it's actually waiting to come out."" Similar phenomena have been observed with tuberculosis, according to the WHO. Vaccine-induced herd immunity can also fail when a vaccine results in only short-lived immunity within a population. Pertussis and mumps recently reappeared long after vaccine programs were assumed to have eradicated these diseases, and studies suggest that, while vaccine noncompliance played a role, the outbreaks were in part due to the vaccines losing effectiveness over time. ""In the past few years we've had both pertussis and mumps outbreaks, and those have primarily resulted from waning immunity over time,"" Poland said. Is herd immunity possible for COVID-19? With an effective vaccine, it is possible that we could achieve herd immunity and end the COVID-19 pandemic. But regular booster shots would likely be necessary, as early data from recovering patients suggests that the novel coronavirus confers immunity for only a few months or years. ""We know that, two or three years after an infection, antibodies become undetectable in SARS, MERS and seasonal coronavirus patients, so this is no surprise,"" Poland said. ""The idea that I am going to get a vaccine and be permanently immune the way that it happened with measles, rubella, smallpox or polio is simply not true in this case,"" he added. Without a vaccine, however, COVID-19 is exceedingly unlikely to produce natural herd immunity because the rates of infection are not even close to the percent needed to bring the R0 down to one. ""The Spanish study suggests that, even now, fewer than 10% of Spaniards have had the infection,"" Hunter said. ""You would need 10 or 15 times as many cases — and deaths — before you would get to herd immunity."" It could take months or years to reach that threshold and, by then, many of those who contracted the disease could lose their immunity anyway — setting the stage for reinfection and another cycle of disease and loss. The sobering takeaway is that it would require orders of magnitude more carnage than we have already seen to even approach the possibility of herd immunity naturally occuring for COVID-19, if it's even possible at all. ""You can endure a horrendous pandemic at a level that destroys societal infrastructure with a massive death toll, and still not achieve herd immunity,"" Altmann said.",What is herd immunity?,8,0.3707593190445929
1657,"On the evening of 4 August, Pierre Khoueiry was making birthday plans with his wife and two-year-old daughter when a blast shattered the windows of the family’s apartment in Beirut. About 2.5 kilometres away, in the city’s port, a powerful explosion had sent a huge orange fireball into the sky, followed by a massive shock wave that overturned cars, damaged buildings and shook the ground across the Lebanese capital. “It was a moment of great fear,” says Khoueiry, a genomics researcher at the American University of Beirut. Lebanese authorities say that the explosion, which killed at least 220 people, injured more than 5,000 and left an estimated 300,000 people homeless, was caused by 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate, a chemical compound commonly used as an agricultural fertilizer, which had been stored for 6 years at a port warehouse. An investigation into what triggered the explosion is under way, and early reports suggest that it was probably a nearby fire. The blast is one of the largest accidental ammonium nitrate explosions ever recorded (see ‘Explosive chemical’) — so powerful that it was heard more than 200 kilometres away in Cyprus. The sheer amount of ammonium nitrate involved is “nuts, insane, huge”, says Andrea Sella, a chemist at University College London. The chemical has caused serious industrial disasters in the past. In 1921, an explosion at an ammonium nitrate factory in Oppau, Germany, killed 561 people and could be heard hundreds of kilometres away. And in 2015, the detonation of around 800 tonnes of ammonium nitrate in the port of Tianjin, China, killed 173 people. Manufactured as little beads that resemble cooking salt, ammonium nitrate is cheap to buy and usually safe to handle, but storing it can be a problem. Over time, the compound absorbs moisture, which can make the beads stick together into a huge rock, says Sella. When such a large quantity of compacted ammonium nitrate is exposed to intense heat — if, say, an accidental fire breaks out — it can trigger an explosion. The shock wave following a such a blast can be deadly. The explosion produces an area of high pressure that travels faster than the speed of sound, shattering glass and injuring people. In Beirut, the disaster has had such tragic consequences for reasons unrelated to the explosion itself. Efforts to treat injured people have been hampered by damage to hospitals near the blast site, many of which were already under strain from the coronavirus pandemic. People who weren’t able to get medical assistance quickly enough might end up with lifelong consequences of their injuries, says Paul Gardner-Stephen, who studies disaster-mitigation technology at Flinders University in Adelaide, Australia. “Lives and livelihoods will be lost, because there’s a limited capacity to respond,” he says. Lebanon was also already reeling from an economic crisis that triggered anti-government protests starting in October 2019, when the country’s currency began to lose its value against the dollar, says Charlotte Karam, a social scientist at the American University of Beirut. Since then, food prices have gone up and about one in three people in the country are unemployed. Now, with the destruction of Beirut’s port and the country’s main grain silo — which was close to the warehouse storing the ammonium nitrate — Karam says the consequences of the blast will be felt across the nation. “This is a crisis layered upon multiple crises — an economic crisis, a political crisis, a health crisis,” she says. “We need to work together to rebuild Lebanon.”",Why Beirut’s ammonium nitrate blast was so devastating,9,0.5538954760275303
1658,"About 60 historic buildings in Beirut are at risk of collapse following last week’s devastating port explosion, Lebanese officials have warned, as the UN’s cultural agency vowed to lead the international campaign for the recovery and restoration of Beirut’s heritage. At least 8,000 buildings, many concentrated in the historic quarters of Gemayzeh and Mar Mikhael, were affected, said Sarkis Khoury, director general of antiquities at Lebanon’s Ministry of Culture, according to Unesco. Among them are some 640 historic buildings, approximately 60 of which were at risk of collapse, he said. Also affected was Beirut’s eastern neighbourhood of Achrafieh where the landmark Sursock museum is located. Other neighbourhoods that are home to the National Museum and the Archaeological museum of the American University of Beirut were damaged too, Unesco said. Damaged structures also included art galleries and religious sites. On 4 August, 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate stored at Beirut’s port blew up, obliterating the city’s main commercial hub and damaging large swathes of the Lebanese capital. The blast, the most destructive in the country’s troubled history, killed more than 170 people, wounded more than 6,000 and caused damage worth $10bn-$15bn. The FBI will join Lebanese, French and other international investigators in the inquiry after being invited by Lebanese authorities. Lebanese officials agreed on Thursday to name a judicial investigator to lead the inquiry under the auspices of the supreme judicial council, which handles crimes that infringe on the country’s national security, as well as political and state security crimes. A painting hangs on the wall of a heavily damaged room in the Sursock palace. The most-affected areas were Gemayzeh and Mar Mikhael, which face the port and are known for their active night life, with many old buildings turned into pubs or restaurants. “The international community has sent a strong signal of support to Lebanon following this tragedy,” said Ernesto Ottone Ramirez, assistant Unesco director general for culture. “Unesco is committed to leading the response in the field of culture, which must form a key part of wider reconstruction and recovery efforts.” There have been concerns for years in Lebanon about historic buildings being sold and then demolished to be replaced by high rises. There have been reports in recent days that middlemen have been contacting owners of damaged historic buildings and offering high prices to buy their property. Ghazi Wazni, the caretaker finance minister, issued a decree on Wednesday preventing the sale of any historic building without permission from the Ministry of Culture. The move aims to prevent any “exploitation,” the finance ministry said. The 150-year-old Sursock palace withstood two world wars, the fall of the Ottoman empire, the French mandate and Lebanese independence. Abbas Murtada, the caretaker minister of culture, said on Thursday his ministry was working to prevent exploitation by businessmen adding that the restoration of the damaged historic buildings was estimated to cost about $300m. He added that teams from his ministry were developing plans to renovate the buildings. The World Bank, in a preliminary assessment, said about 50,000 residential units were damaged and 80% of residential buildings and infrastructure were affected by the blast, aside from the destruction to the port. An earlier estimate from Beirut governor, Marwan Abboud, said the blast caused $10bn-$15bn in damage, with nearly 300,000 people left homeless. On Thursday, Lebanon’s parliament approved a state of emergency in Beirut in its first session since the explosion, granting the military sweeping powers amid rising popular anger at official corruption and mismanagement and political uncertainty. The disaster has raised popular fury toward Lebanon’s leaders to a new level as the country reels from an unprecedented economic and financial crisis, along with the coronavirus pandemic.",Beirut blast: dozens of historic buildings in Lebanon capital at risk of collapse,9,0.8743782177656371
1659,"Beirut is still shedding glass and tears. Eddie Bitar takes me into his apartment. Without windows. Strewn with the shattered debris. Deep cracks zigzag along every wall. He steps over rubble and wrestles the front door aside. It is smeared red and he points it out: ""This is the blood of my brother."" We walk in. His wife Yara recounts the day she can never forget, and weeps. This country was already wracked with crisis; people's savings and hopes were evaporating. Now grief and rage are Lebanon's new currency. ""We will stay here, we will raise our kids here, stronger than ever. Nothing like this will ever [be allowed to] happen again,"" Yara cries. Eddie and Yara's apartment was destroyed in the explosion The explosion was like 15 years of war in 15 seconds, says Lebanon's team at the United Nations, comparing its impact to the devastation from the country's civil war that lasted from 1975 to 1990. Now, amid financial meltdown and political turmoil, Lebanon has to undertake a single recovery effort of unprecedented scale. The level of destruction is hard to believe and it is everywhere. Starting with the epicentre, we follow how the blast ripped through the city, bringing life to a halt At the port, the grain silo that stored much of the country's wheat supplies is a tomb-like wreck rising from vaporised remains of the docks. Where people worked unloading ships there is now a flooded crater more than 40m (130ft) deep. Among the dead there were at least 43 Syrian workers, according to embassy officials. The homes and savings of many refugee families who lived in nearby industrial neighbourhoods have been destroyed. Syrian refugee Ahmed Staifi lost his wife and two of their daughters Further back in Gemmayzeh, where Eddie and Yara lived, I walk through streets carpeted with broken glass; where beautiful old stone buildings are now rubble heaps that crushed cars when they toppled. The destruction goes on and on; miles from the blast site apartments are wrecked and families left homeless. It's estimated 300,000 people do not have homes fit to live in. Many families need sanitation and hygiene supplies until basic services can be restored, according to the UN's humanitarian agency. Three major hospitals are out of action and less than half of all healthcare centres are able to provide full services. ""The blast took everything,"" says Marc, who ran a shop near the port. ""The metal was torn like paper, it was crazy. Two people died in front of our store."" But the new symbols of Lebanon's famed resilience are everywhere. Squads of people with brooms and shovels are trying to sweep up a broken city. Near the port I bump into Fadi, a construction engineer who is rallying friends to try to make safe the scores of wrecked buildings. He points to a high-rise block. ""If you take a look, see that balcony over there, that's almost another projectile [that could] fall from 30 floors."" 'We are doing what we can': How Beirut is trying to pull together to help in the clean up after the blast He is working with other engineer friends to photograph danger points, geo-tagging and sending them around so people can try to remove them safely. But these people will not be enough to restore a country brought even closer to collapse. Fortitude has its limits after the multiple shocks Lebanon has already endured; a currency collapse, mass anti-government protests, coronavirus. Authorities estimate the blast caused $15bn (£11.5bn) in damages The explosion of thousands of tonnes of unsafely stored ammonium nitrate has come to symbolise the perceived mismanagement of an entire country. The political system was established after the civil war in an effort to enable power-sharing in a country of sectarian divides. But instead many see it as a front for patronage, cronyism and endemic corruption. When it comes to Beirut's residents the blast did not discriminate. Gemmayzeh was hard hit. It is a wealthy area where there is strong support for the Lebanese Forces, one of the main Christian factions. The Sunni Muslim areas of the Corniche and Ain al-Mraysseh were damaged. Others have been searching for loved ones lost in the port - many Shia Muslim labourers whose families form a base of support for Hezbollah, the armed movement which dominates Lebanese politics. The explosion left about 300,000 people without habitable housing Amid growing anger at what many see as a corrupt political elite sharing out jobs and favours based on sect, and not merit, the explosion's aftershocks also risk aggravating divisions. Lebanese political analyst Sami Nader describes the system as a ""cartel of political parties"" which take advantage of sectarian division to establish their rule. In the wake of the blast he believes this establishment ""will try their old tricks"" to hold onto power. Anti-government protests are growing. In Martyrs' Square, groups of demonstrators gather each afternoon. They have been surging towards the parliament complex, trying to breach the barricades and met by riot police firing tear gas and rubber bullets. The mass resignation of the cabinet on Tuesday marked the second fall of a government in a year. But it has done little to quell the fury - MPs must choose a new prime minister; involving the same sectarian politics as before. Another mass protest is planned for Saturday; the authorities have sent workers to weld giant metal plates to already blast-hit buildings close to the parliament. Many have blamed the blast on decades of corruption and mismanagement Back at Eddie Bitar's damaged apartment I hear how his wounded brother is recovering. Eddie blames the blast on incompetent ""criminals"". ""They took our money, they put debts for the generations to come. They killed our forest, they burned them. They are killing our soul. But we are resilient people,"" he says. Amid the wreckage, he vows that Lebanon ""will be ruled by the youth who did everything... to reconstruct our country"".",Beirut blast: Picking up the pieces of a shattered city,9,0.5132069251663592
1660,"When Westerners think of Beirut, they might rely on dated notions of the city: a 15-year civil war that ended in 1990; a war with Israel and sporadic airstrikes; bombings of the U.S. Marine barracks and the U.S. Embassy; an attack 15 years ago on the prime minister's convoy. So it may seem hard to believe that the biggest blast of them all — the one at the Beirut port on Tuesday, which killed some 150 people, wounded thousands and caused destruction across half the city — was an accident, possibly the outcome of neglect on a massive scale. But that's what signs point to now. Officials have launched an investigation looking at the port warehouse that had held 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate, a chemical used for fertilizer and as an ingredient in bombs. It has fueled many explosions around the world — both accidental and intentional. Lebanese officials say there has been concern about this volatile cargo for years, something Prime Minister Hassan Diab noted publicly in the first hours after the blast. Beirut Explosion Update: Lebanon Detains 16 People In Inquiry As Anger Mounts So, rather than war or terrorism, this blast brings to a head something else about Lebanon — the deep paralysis, official corruption and unaccountability that Lebanese demonstrators had been protesting in huge numbers for months before the coronavirus pandemic shut them down. Here are some of the factors that shed light on this week's catastrophe. Explosive chemicals languish at the port In 2013, a ship filled with 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate stopped at the Lebanese port. It had a Russian crew, and reports say it was bound for Mozambique. The ship's former captain told Reuters this week that he had been instructed to stop in Beirut to pick up more cargo, but there was a legal dispute over port fees and the shipping company was in debt. Lawyers representing some of the crew said in 2015 that the ship had stopped at the Beirut port with ""technical problems."" Satellite Images Show Aftermath Of Beirut Blas The ammonium nitrate, a fairly common cargo on the oceans, was impounded and unloaded; the crew had to stay on board for nearly a year and was then released. The port's customs director says he sounded several alarms about the material. Since the blast, some port officials have been placed under house arrest. A city of neglect and shortages In 2015, trash choked Lebanon's streets amid corruption and infighting over solid waste contracts. The garbage crisis spawned a protest movement dubbed ""You Stink."" The investigation into the massive explosion at Beirut's port is looking at the warehouse that had held 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate. More crises would come. High government debt and mismanagement caused an economic collapse. There's hyperinflation. Unemployment is high. The country's once-comfortable middle class is slipping into poverty. People have trouble buying bread and are selling their possessions. Amid Lebanon's Economic Crisis, The Country's Health Care System Is Ailing Lengthy daily power outages have resulted after a corruption scandal disrupted fuel imports from Algeria. And with the country's currency losing 80% of its value since October, the government is struggling to pay for fuel from elsewhere. Widespread street protests started a year ago. Chanting slogans like ""The people want the fall of the regime"" and ""All means all,"" protesters called for the removal of the entire political class. A rigidly divided political system Who's responsible for all this? That's hard to say, in part because Lebanon's government is designed for no single group to be too powerful — or accountable. Lebanon's civil war ended in 1990 with a deal — enforced by neighboring Syria — to divide power among sectarian factions. The presidency is set aside for a Christian, the prime minister is a Sunni Muslim and the speaker of parliament is always a Shiite Muslim. It means that the real decisions are made behind closed doors and that elections allow limited choice for the voting public. The various sectarian groups tend to protect the status quo to ensure they each can hang onto as much power as possible. Some sectarian leaders are former warlords and worried they could face revenge or prosecution if the system changes. The presence of Hezbollah further complicates matters. The Shiite Muslim group is not officially part of Lebanon's power-sharing deal but enjoys support from Shiites and some Christians and holds seats in parliament. More importantly, it has the most muscle on the ground. Its militia drove Israel from the country in the late 1990s and rivals the Lebanese military in firepower. The group runs the country's international airport and gets money from vast business interests and from Iran. In other words, the fragmented nature of Lebanese power makes it hard to organize a protest campaign targeting a single leadership — and to vote, or force, it out of power. Full circle: Investigating the blast Lebanon's prime minister and president have formed an investigative committee to find the cause of the blast and those responsible. On Wednesday, a Lebanese couple inspects the damage to their house in an area overlooking the destroyed Beirut port the day before. But already the country's elites are trading blame. The Ministry of Public Works and port authorities say the explosion was the fault of the judiciary, which allegedly did not act on repeated requests by port officials for a legal release of the cargo. Judicial officials have hit back, saying that politicians are trying to scapegoat them and that the investigative committee is not impartial. They say an investigation led by establishment politicians and security officials loyal to them — rather than by independent investigators — will not bring justice. Lebanon's elites and political leaders — including Hezbollah, the U.S. Treasury Department believes — have long had interests at the Beirut port, which brings in most of the country's imports. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah denied Friday that his group controls the port. ""People think that Hezbollah knows everything that goes on in the Beirut port,"" he said. ""Hezbollah does not run or control Beirut's port and does not interfere with it."" For Lebanese who have no confidence in their leaders, the destruction of Beirut is the ultimate example of the political rot that for too long has benefited the few at the cost of the country. A crowd yelling, ""Resign, resign, resign!"" chased the justice minister and threw water on her Thursday, when she tried to visit a Beirut neighborhood. A popular slogan is ""Hang the nooses."" Now, Lebanese say, is not the time for compromise. But with the system rigged against them, the road to meaningful change will be a long and difficult.",Beirut Explosion Looks Like An Accident — And A Sign Of The Country's Collapse,9,0.31758324011456673
1661,"Last week, an explosion rocked Beirut, the capital city of Lebanon. Over 200 people died and thousands were injured in the blast, which occurred after 2,700 tons of ammonium nitrate detonated. The port city suffered billions of dollars in damage in the wake of the explosion and, according to UNICEF, hundreds of thousands of people were left homeless. The explosion has spurred a series of protests and the resignation of a number of the country's leaders, including its prime minister. Now, the residents of Beirut—already struggling to control the coronavirus pandemic—are left to pick up the pieces.

1662,"The average human farts eight times per day, expelling 33 to 125mL per fart Diets high in fibre, raffinose, lactose, fructose and sorbitol can increases the amount of gas in the digestive tract and, with it, the need to fart An increase in the potency of the smell of a fart accompanied by abdominal pain is a symptom of food insensitivity — including lactose intolerance and celiac disease Shame associated with talking about bodily functions, including farting, can pose a barrier to receiving proper healthcare The pride of some, the horror of others, farting is an integral part of a healthy digestive system. As farting is such an integral part of our daily lives — the average human farts about eight times per day — the sometimes stinky deed can provide us with quite a bit of information about our own bodies. There are several sources of the gas that likes to announce itself at inopportune moments, including swallowing air as we eat and the waste from bacteria in our digestive system, according to Medical News Today. Dietary fibre and starches are a common cause of the build-up of gas in our intestines. The stomach and small intestine are largely unable to break these carbohydrates down, so it is left to the bacteria in the small intestine. As they work, the bacteria expels gas, which is then released as a fart. The International Foundation for Gastrointestinal Disorders notes that raffinose (a complex sugar found in beans, cabbage, and broccoli), lactose, fructose and sorbitol (often found in artificial sweeteners and diet sodas), will also increase the presence of gas in your intestine. How big is a fart? Researchers from the Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield took five male and five female volunteers and, using what can only be described as a revolutionary impermeable gas-collecting apparatus, inserted a rubber tube four centimetres into their rectum. The tube was then connected to a laminated bag, where the noxious discharge was collected. Over the course of the 24 hour study, eight of the ten subjects were fed a normal diet including, naturally, beans. The remaining two participants were relegated to a fibre-free, liquid diet. Subjects on the normal diet cut loose between 476 to 1491 millilitres of fumes in 24 hours. On average, subjects farted eight times throughout the day, and expelled between 33 to 125 millilitres per fart — the largest farts tended to occur within an hour after eating. The two participants who followed a liquid, fibre free diet for this study produced a much lower amount of gas than the other volunteers — an average of 214 millilitres in a day. Finally, in a show of equality of the sexes, there was no significant difference between how much gas the women produced versus the men. What your farts can tell you about your health The next time you unleash your very own SBD (silent but deadly) assault on the unsuspecting co-inhabitants of whatever room you find yourself in, it may also be beneficial to take stock of the process. Horrifically smelling farts, accompanied with abdominal pain or discomfort, may be a sign of a food sensitivity. “The prime example is if you drink milk or eat cheese and then feel cramps and have excessive flatulence that also smells like a manifestation of doomsday,” Dr. Niket Sonpal, an internist and gastroenterologist in New York City, told Health.com. This experience is not limited to lactose intolerance and can include a host of other disorders – including celiac disease. As always, if there are any sudden changes with your body, it’s best to get it checked out by a doctor. Let ‘er rip In typical society outside of the frat house or school playground, farting is seen as undesirable and — depending on the smell — downright embarrassing. Horrifically smelling farts, accompanied with abdominal pain or discomfort, may be a sign of a food sensitivity But before you resort to clenching, shifting, or any manner of tricks to hold it in, it might just be best to channel your inner-most form of self-acceptance and let go of what you’ve been holding onto. Some researchers believe withholding farts, and the resultant pressure increase in your rectum, is a factor in diverticular disease, a condition where small sacs form in the wall of the large intestine. In more serious cases, diverticular disease is linked to abscess formation, rectal bleeding and fistulas. Taking pride in what you produce is not only helpful in relieving discomfort in the present moment but is also protective in the long run. Studies have shown that shame in talking about bodily functions with healthcare professionals poses a significant barrier to proper care. So go ahead and stop blaming it on the dog and take credit for what is rightfully yours. Your future health may depend on it.",What the smell of your farts say about you,8,0.5836119252877
1663,"CBD is the second most common identified cannabinoid, and it’s everywhere, from tinctures and oils to clothes and pillows. Still, when it comes to smoking and vaping, the majority of people are looking for THC strains, even when they’re after therapeutic effects such as relief from pain or anxiety. Even if CBD isn’t known for its psychoactive effects, its presence in cannabis strains has been associated with pleasant and mellow highs, some of which are perfect for beginners or for people who don’t want to worry about experiencing a cannabis-inspired panic attack. Thanks to it’s less intoxicating properties, CBD-dominant strains are great for people who are looking for medicinal benefits of the plant or are planning on consuming it during the middle of the day, before doing an activity that requires some concentration. CBD strains are not as popular as THC strains, which is why it may be more difficult to find them in the U.S. in a favourite dispensary. But as more and more people continue to get involved with CBD, the more common these strains are expected to become. The effects of CBD strains are similar to the effects produced by consuming CBD oils and products, only acting faster due to the way in which the compound is ingested. These strains tend to provide relief from pain, inflammation, anxiety and, it is reported, even seizures. When vaped or smoked, these strains generally produce positive highs, leaving consumers with a clear head. Unlike THC-dominant strains, CBD strains have not been reported to be associated with side effects, such as anxiety, dizziness, increased heart rate and nervousness. Even if you’re someone who’s not looking for the medicinal effects of CBD, these types of strains might be a good fit if you’ve had negative experiences with THC or are simply looking to try something new. Like THC, there are many factors that influence the outcome of a CBD high. It remains important to speak to your budtender about the strain you’re considering buying and the effects sought. It’s also key to smoke or vape carefully, giving your body the chance to respond to the strain before inadvertently consuming too much of it and experiencing a bad high.",What should you expect when smoking a CBD-dominant strain?,8,0.2922887638986177
1664,"Ottawa Public Health and a slate of partner organizations have launched a pilot program believed to be the first in the country to deliver free HIV self-tests for at-home use. It’s an innovation fuelled in part by the COVID-19 pandemic that project leaders hope will help empower people who would prefer an alternative to traditional testing at a clinic or doctor’s office, and reach some of those whose HIV-positive status might otherwise remain undiagnosed. Patrick O’Byrne is a uOttawa nursing professor and Ottawa Public Health’s acting supervisor for sexually transmitted and blood-borne infection case management. He’d long been mulling the design of a project offering HIV self-testing, and had successfully pitched the idea to his OPH colleagues last winter. It was slowly moving along, until COVID-19 compromised many people’s access to traditional avenues for testing, and the project’s rapid acceleration became a priority. They applied to a program at Health Canada that allows special access to medical devices not yet licensed for sale, a process that requires explaining how the benefits of the proposal outweigh the risks (in this case, the use of the INSTI HIV Self Test from Richmond, B.C.,’s bioLytical Laboratories). In a matter of days, Health Canada had authorized the request. Potentially working in OPH’s favour is the fact that Health Canada is believed to be on the verge of approving the INSTI HIV Self Test for use by the Canadian public, following a study led by St. Michael’s Hospital researchers that tested its use by 1,000 participants in five cities. “Summary data from the Canadian clinical trial provided preliminary evidence that the INSTI HIV Self Test has acceptable performance for self-testing,” said Health Canada, in response to a question from this newspaper about its decision to grant special access for the Ottawa project. Ottawa residents interested in a test can visit GetaKit.ca, answer a series of eligibility questions, register an account and order a test kit for mail delivery. The test-taking is relatively straightforward – O’Byrne compares it to a cross between a finger prick for blood sugar and a pregnancy test – and whatever the result, the kit comes with resources. If it’s negative, there’s information and tools to help maintain that status, if users are interested. If it’s reactive, meaning HIV antibodies are detected, users are provided a long list of supports and links to care, and asked to come in for confirmatory testing. Test-takers are requested to report their results, but they’re not required to do so. Nor do they have to provide any personal information beyond an email and phone number for SMS verification. “I feel that it gives a little bit more control to people, instead of saying, ‘I have to present to a health care provider who administers a test to me,’ it’s, ‘Here is a test, you want to do it, you do it yourself. We’ll give you all the supports,’” said O’Byrne. Sixteen days after its July 20 soft launch, nearly 100 tests had been shipped out via GetaKit.ca. While the project leaders will be watching to see how much uptake it gets, the success of the pilot also hinges on who is getting tested. “If everyone who uses it is not somebody who’s particularly affected by HIV, then it’s not all that successful,” O’Byrne explained. Ideally, the program will provide access to testing to people who need it but were facing barriers, diagnoses to people who were HIV-positive but unaware and linkage through the testing process to care and other resources. Follow that forward, and you get improvements to the health of those living with HIV, and decreased onward transmission of the virus. According to the Public Health Agency of Canada, an estimated 14 per cent of the more than 63,000 people living with HIV in Canada at the end of 2016 weren’t aware of their infection. “It’s a very exciting project for our community,” said Matthew Harding, acting executive director of MAX Ottawa, a non-profit focused on supporting the health of GBT2Q men and other guys who are into guys. While gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men make up two to three per cent of Canada’s adult male population, PHAC found they accounted for more than half of all new HIV infections in 2016. This new option for getting tested could help reduce some of the barriers community members can face to accessing a diagnosis, and through this, care and support — from discomfort discussing sexual practices with health-care providers to fear of being judged or outed, to financial or scheduling constraints that make it difficult to get to a clinic, said Harding. At-home self-testing is also an great option to have available in the middle of a global pandemic, noted Alexandra Musten, senior lead of testing and clinical initiatives at the Ontario HIV Treatment Network, another collaborator on the pilot project. “COVID has changed how people are able to move around the city, how people are able to engage with health care,” said Musten. “Having an option, for people who feel comfortable with it, to order it and have it delivered at home is, I think, really positive.” While O’Byrne would like to see at-home testing rolled out for other sexually transmitted infections – a urine cup for gonorrhoea or chlamydia testing that people can drop off at a lab, or a downloadable requisition for syphilis testing – Ontario’s ministry of health requires that medical practitioners see a patient before testing can be administered. (This pilot project was able to go ahead because it’s technically an HIV screening device, rather than a test, and has Health Canada approval.) “Any new testing approach will fit the needs of some group,” said O’Byrne. “It’s a bureaucratic barrier that we need to address.”","OPH, uOttawa project delivers free HIV self-tests – a first for Canada",8,0.5480517049332726
1665,"Employing intestinal bacteria could boost the effectiveness of some cancer treatment four-fold, say researchers at the University of Calgary. A lead scientist in an ongoing study said Thursday her team has made huge strides in understanding how such microbiomes supercharge the potency of immunotherapy in targeting cancer cells. “We think the impact is huge,” said Dr. Kathy McCoy of the Snyder Institute for Chronic Diseases at the U of C’s Cumming School of Medicine. “With cancers (normally) susceptible to immunotherapy 20 per cent of the time, and it responds at 80 per cent, that’s a major increase in efficacy.” A series of published studies on the approach dating back to 2015 hinted strongly at the potential of combining some forms of gut bacteria with immunotherapy in treating diseases like melanoma and colorectal cancer. But scientists weren’t able to pinpoint how it worked, said McCoy, who set about using germ-free mice as research subjects. “We’d have to identify a mechanism…we identified three bacteria that were in an animal model of colorectal cancer and we wondered if we could tease apart the differences in the microbiomes,” she said. Her team noted immunotherapy by itself was conspicuously ineffective. But the bacteria that worked, she said, activated a T-cell which ultimately takes on cancerous tumours, shrinking them significantly. “The three specific bacteria by themselves turn on a first switch on the T-cells within the intestine,” said McCoy. That bacteria generates a tiny molecule called inosine that interacts with the T-cells to boost the immunotherapy that in turn eradicates cancer cells. Another bacteria, akkermansia, has also been found to be an effective tumour fighter, said the scientist, and like the other three bacteria, is one present in humans who have been the subject of some study. “We actually found there was an increase in bacterium in the patients responding, but the studies were too small,” said McCoy. The U of C studies using humans remain preliminary for now with researchers seeking grants to further and broaden that work, to focus on lung cancer and melanoma over several years, she said. “We’re going to see if we can find this metabolite in the serum, or blood, and in feces and see if they’re working with the same mechanism,” said McCoy. And there’s a strong likelihood that approach could be applied to a much wider variety of cancers, she added. That latest work is set to be published in the magazine Science, which has highlighted earlier discoveries using gut bacteria to enhance the immune system. Efforts that have pushed the envelope on the treatment, said McCoy, are “a purely Calgary” achievement and one that should help undermine public skepticism over the effectiveness of cancer research funding that’s often led to conspiracy theories. “I don’t know what people expect – research has made amazing strides in developing cancer therapies,” she said.",Calgary researchers zero in on gut bacteria as potent cancer fighter,8,0.2761228787119213
1666,"As kids in many states head back to school, doctors warn that potential outbreaks of whooping cough, measles, the flu, and other vaccine-preventable diseases may overwhelm hospitals and impact public health at large this fall. Results of a survey found that two-thirds of parents are still nervous that taking their children to the doctor could expose them to the new coronavirus. Falling vaccination rates threaten the herd immunity Americans have built against certain deadly diseases. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many people have tried to safeguard their health by avoiding public areas and nonemergency medical visits. Fearing exposure to the new coronavirus, parents across the country have canceled their children’s checkups over the last few months, causing vaccine rates to plummet. Now, public health officials are focusing on getting kids caught up on vaccines. As kids in many states head back to school, doctors warn that potential outbreaks of whooping cough, measles, the flu, and other vaccine-preventable diseases may overwhelm hospitals and impact public health at large this fall. Why vaccine rates are falling When the pandemic first hit the United States, the pediatricians’ offices saw visits from families drop by 50 to 70 percent. The reason? Fear. Results of a survey from Orlando Health, released on Aug. 12, found that two-thirds of parents are still nervous that taking their children to the doctor could expose them to the new coronavirus. Delayed and canceled well checkup appointments have led to a significant drop in vaccination rates Trusted Source since the national emergency was declared on March 13, according to a report released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on May 15. “When California had a shelter-in-place order, the vaccine rate dropped by well over 80 percent in kids compared to the year before,” said Dr. Jennifer Foreman, medical director of pediatrics at Valley Health Center Bascom at Santa Clara Valley Medical Center. “While we’re seeing a big increase in the number of vaccines we’re giving now, we have in no way made up for the time when people weren’t coming in. Some people are still hesitant to come in because they’re afraid of catching COVID,” she added. Risk of disease outbreaks Falling vaccination rates threaten the herd immunity Americans have built against certain deadly diseases. In fact, communities with immunization levels of 85 to 90 percent have experienced outbreaks of measles and rubella in the past, according to a 2015 report from the American Academy of Pediatrics. Doctors warn that the recent drop in vaccination rates may lead to outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases as kids return to school and day care this fall. “Herd immunity is something that keeps our kids safe, and if we can’t rely on it, measles and whooping cough can easily come back. They affect kids much more than COVID,” said Dr. Katherine Williamson, pediatrician at Mission Hospital in Southern California and president of the Orange County chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics. An outbreak of a vaccine-preventable disease could overwhelm hospitals at a time when they’re already stressed from COVID-19. “If we’re not vaccinating and people get sick from a vaccine-preventable disease, we’re going to clog up the emergency rooms and see sick people getting sicker. We can’t ignore these basic things that are so preventable while in the midst of a pandemic,” urged Dr. Janet Mason, a family medicine physician who has the largest pediatric practice affiliated with the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. Flu season, which typically starts in October , may be the biggest threat on the horizon for communities and hospitals if families continue to delay their children’s medical appointments, doctors warn. “We’re all very concerned about the risk of having both the flu and COVID very active at the same time, which is a problem not just for at-risk adults, but for everyone,” Foreman said. “Every year, the flu stretches hospital capacity to its limit. It will be very important for everyone to get the flu vaccine.” Don’t skip your child’s well checkup If your child has fallen behind on immunizations, your local department of health may be able to help them get caught up quickly. A number of states, including Maine, Michigan, and West Virginia, have scheduled immunization clinics for children in the coming weeks. Vaccines aside, it’s still important to schedule your child’s well checkup — even if they’re not planning to go back to the classroom in person this fall. “Routine physical exams are recommended annually for older kids, and even more frequently for younger ones, to make sure that nothing atypical is going on,” said Williamson, adding that her colleague recently discovered a heart murmur in an otherwise healthy 4-year-old during their appointment. “It’s never just a straightforward head-to-toe check. We give families anticipatory guidance, and even parents who think they don’t have any questions end up asking 10 things when they see me,” she explained. The well checkup is also an opportunity to address health concerns — like weight gain, mental health issues, and lack of physical activity — that might have popped up while kids were stuck at home over the last few months, added Foreman. Worried about exposure to the new coronavirus? Talk to your physician about their prevention efforts. Many pediatricians require masks, conduct temperature checks, and coronavirus screenings, and have significantly reduced the number of people allowed in the practice at one time to help keep people safe. “Parents are really scared about exposure at the pediatrician’s office, but really, it’s the safest place they can go,” said Mason. “Plus, it’s been a good emotional thing for kids to come in for their annual checkup and keep their routine.”",Kids’ Vaccination Rates Have Plummeted — Here’s What That Means for the Fall,8,0.011292985394507404
1667,"Researchers say adults over the age of 65 may be getting unnecessary cancer screenings. They say the screenings may not be beneficial due to the risk of side effects as well as the expected longevity of a patient. Experts say the screenings may be occurring because older adults want them and it’s a difficult conversation for a doctor to tell a patient they’re past the age where screenings are effective. Older adults may be undergoing cancer screenings beyond the age recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. In a new study , researchers from Penn State University have concluded that more than 45 percent of older adults in the United States underwent screening for colorectal, cervical, or breast cancer beyond the recommended age of 75 for colorectal cancer, 65 for cervical cancer, and 74 for breast cancer. “We hypothesized that people who are older or who have lower life expectancies would be less likely to report having received their cancer screenings recently, but we didn’t see strong evidence of this,” Jennifer Moss, PhD, an assistant professor of family and community medicine and public health sciences at Penn State and author of the study, said in a press release. “This pattern shows us that too many people are getting screened after a point when the screening is probably not going to provide benefit and may cause harm.” “There are two reasons why people should stop screening for cancer,” Moss added. “First, when they ‘age out’ of the recommended screening age, or second, when their life expectancy is too low. As with any clinical procedure, there are risks from the cancer screening tests. These risks are even higher for people who have aged-out or who have a low life expectancy.” Moss and colleagues used data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, which collects information about health behaviors, such as screening for cancer. The researchers analyzed data from more than 20,000 men and 34,000 women screened for colorectal cancer, as well as more than 82,000 women for cervical cancer and more than 38,000 women for breast cancer. They found that 59 percent of men and 56 percent of women were over-screened for colorectal cancer. In addition, 45 percent of women were over-screened for cervical cancer and 73 percent of women were over-screened for breast cancer. Why the screenings are happening Dr. Carolyn Kaloostian, a family medicine physician and geriatric care specialist at Keck Medicine of USC in Los Angeles, says over-screening is likely due to a number of factors. “Having the discussion that a patient no longer needs screening is a challenging topic to broach,” Kaloostian told Healthline. “There is also a lack of knowledge, time, and skills to develop an individualized discontinuation plan. Also, there is a lack of quality and process improvement initiatives in clinic and imaging centers in this regard.” Robert A. Smith, PhD, is the senior vice president of cancer screening at the American Cancer Society. He says time pressures in medical appointments can make it difficult to have a conversation about cancer screenings. “You can imagine that in the short duration of the average visit, it is hard to initiate a discussion with the patient that says it is time to focus on other priorities and cancer screening isn’t one of them,” he told Healthline. “Many doctors don’t have this skill no matter how much time they have. So, it is easier to just make the referral if the patient says, ‘And I need my mammogram.'” Risks and benefits Smith argues that for some older adults, there could be a benefit to cancer screening under certain circumstances. “Most cancer risk is increasing with age. So, there still is potential to benefit from screening. Older adults should have an opportunity to avert a premature death from cancer as long as they are in good health,” he said. Diana L. Miglioretti, PhD, a professor of biostatistics at the University of California, Davis, says one of the risks of unnecessary screening is over-diagnosis. “Over-diagnosis occurs when an asymptomatic cancer is detected by screening that would have never otherwise been diagnosed or harmed the individual during their lifetime because the cancer is very slow growing or the person dies from other causes before it would cause symptoms,” Miglioretti told Healthline. “Over-diagnosed cancers are typically treated the same as all other cancers because we can’t tell which are over-diagnosed,” she added. “Individuals often undergo aggressive treatments to treat these over-diagnosed cancers, such as surgery and chemotherapy, which could decrease their quality of life, but they experience no benefit from these treatments — they die at the same age regardless of whether treated. This is a very important harm of screening that becomes more frequent with age, given older individuals are much more likely to die from other diseases than younger individuals.” Preventing unnecessary screenings Preventing unnecessary cancer screenings, the study researchers say, can be challenging. Part of the problem is screening awareness campaigns and incentives for doctors to continue screening. “The messaging of screening has never included any discussion about when to stop, so the public is not necessarily in tune to that and that’s part of the challenge,” Dr. Deanna Attai, an assistant clinical professor of medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles, told Healthline. “The worry of cancer outweighs sometimes the perception of risk or the understanding of risk. There are some situations where providers or health systems are incentivized for screening tests; sometimes it’s part of their performance metric.” She says life expectancy estimates can also be problematic and are not always accurate. “Any estimate of life expectancy is an estimate at best; we don’t have a crystal ball. I think these are some of the challenges and some of the reasons that screening continues even in older patients,” Attai said. In the United States, primary care providers typically follow the guidelines set out by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. But there are guidelines from other organizations that vary in their recommendations of age cut-offs for screening. Kaloostian notes that the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American Cancer Society recommend people ages 75 to 85 have a discussion with their doctor and decide whether to screen “based on the patient’s individualized health and screening history.” She argues age, life expectancy, and overall goals of care should all be factored into the decision as to whether older adults should be screened for cancer. “Unfortunately, patients may get into the habit of routine screening, expect this automatic referral, and it takes time and disruption of this momentum by a beloved provider to initiate a deeper conversation to guide a well-thought-out plan. This shared decision-making takes time and effort but produces meaningful patient-centered outcomes,” Kaloostian said. Smith argues it’s not always appropriate to apply a standard cut-off age for stopping cancer screenings. He says it depends on the individual. “Screening in older adults is both under- and over-utilized,” Smith said. “The challenge is to identify which older adults should not continue screening, and which can still benefit from screening. It is not a problem solved by setting an arbitrary date to stop screening. If the evidence is clear that continued screening has little benefit based on a history of screening results, then screening should cease.”",Are Older Adults Getting Too Many Cancer Screenings?,8,0.3107254784722183
1668,"A recent study shows the incidence rate of dementia in the United States and Europe from 1988 to 2015 declined by 13 percent per decade. If trends continue, this means there could be 15 million fewer people living with dementia in high-income countries by 2040. Experts say the change is likely linked to increased health literacy along with better understanding of modifiable risk factors, such as exercise and diet. Experts stress the need for doctors and patients alike to lower one’s risk for developing dementia by following healthy habits. A new study shows that the chances of developing dementia have declined over time. The study, published last week in the journal Neurology, looked at trends in the United States and Europe between 1988 and 2015. Researchers observed that the incidence rate of dementia has dropped by 13 percent per decade over the past quarter-century. If these trends continue, they note, there could be as many as 15 million fewer people in high-income countries as well as up to 60 million fewer people worldwide living with dementia by 2040. The researchers also examined those with an Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis, the most common type of dementia. The likelihood of developing that condition has dropped by 16 percent per decade. Experts say the findings are a positive sign for the future of dementia research, and may suggest that modern medicine is doing a better job of controlling risk factors that lead to dementia. “The data are particularly encouraging because the study looked at an extraordinarily large number of people from longitudinal studies conducted in different regions of the world, so the data are especially applicable and trustworthy,” Dr. Jason Krellman, an assistant professor of neuropsychology at Columbia University Medical Center in New York, told Healthline. What’s changed? It’s important to note that the study’s findings don’t imply that dementia will ever be eradicated. Dr. Marc Gordon, chief of neurology at Zucker Hillside Hospital in Glen Oaks, New York, told Healthline that the study examined incidence (one’s chance of developing dementia) and not prevalence (the overall percentage of people who have dementia). “Just because age-related incidence is going down does not mean that there’s not going to be a problem,” he explained. “The population is getting older, and there are still going to be a lot of people with disease, whether it’s 15 million fewer in 20 years that they projected, or not. It’s still a lot of people with Alzheimer’s disease and other causes of dementia. It’s not to say that this isn’t good news, but it’s not like there’s no problem either,” Gordon said. While the study’s numbers speak for themselves, the authors didn’t speculate on a specific cause for the decline, noting that “there have been many concurrent changes over time in possible key risk factors.” Krellman points out that modifiable lifestyle factors, such as exercise, diet, intellectual stimulation, and social interaction, are all known to reduce the risk of developing dementia. “Patients today are living longer but also healthier lives because of this awareness, and this study is probably reflecting that positive fact,” he said. “In general, the patients we see today are undoubtedly more health conscious and compliant with medical advice than their counterparts from a generation or two ago.” Krellman also points to a number of developments in the field of dementia research over the past few decades that have aided understanding, although treatment options for someone who already has dementia remain limited. “We have come to understand much more about the biological mechanisms that underlie the development of Alzheimer’s disease and other conditions that lead to dementia, and we have learned in recent years about the important link between cardiovascular disease and dementia. “Unfortunately, treatments to delay or slow the progression of dementia are still early in development. Although promising, these treatments are not available yet, which makes staying aware of, and reducing modifiable risk factors, for dementia quite important,” Krellman said. Another factor to keep in mind is that systemic factors will likely influence who develops dementia. Krellman notes that poor cardiovascular health and dementia will likely continue to be more common in those with lower levels of education and socioeconomic status due to limited access to quality healthcare. Looking ahead Twenty years from now, there will still be people living with dementia, but if the study’s projections are accurate, there will still be a significant reduction. If this happens, Krellman says, the healthcare field could turn its efforts toward continual education about how people can use lifestyle modifications to minimize their risk. “Maintaining those modifiable risk factors at an optimal level is a different challenge for a 60-year-old than an 85-year-old, so the field would need to learn how to educate and address these factors in older individuals who might have a more difficult time staying active, engaged, and practicing healthy habits because of advancing age,” he said. It’s also important to recognize that these projections may not be borne out, despite the recent trend. “I think the study authors do make the point that you can’t necessarily assume that these trends will continue,” Gordon said. “One other thing to bear in mind is that what we’re seeing in terms of analyzing the rates of dementia is that they’re reflecting things that actually changed 20 years ago — so the changes may have happened 20 years ago, and we’re seeing results now here. “The good news is it does suggest that there may be things we can do, and raises questions as to what we can do that could affect the incidence of dementia,” Gordon said. Krellman stresses that dementia isn’t an inevitable side effect of getting older, and that reducing the risk is a job for both doctors and patients. “The study emphasizes the need for us to work diligently to reduce healthcare disparities so that all people can access quality healthcare and understand the lifestyle habits that reduce dementia risk,” he said.",Why Dementia Risk Is Declining and What That Means for the Future,8,0.08643084495293651
1669,"A new injectable drug called ofatumumab helped reduce multiple sclerosis relapses in a phase III clinical trial. The drug is scheduled for a review process next month by the Food and Drug Administration. Ofatumumab works by targeting B cells in an effort to control the immune system. If approved, it would join the drugs Ocrevus and Aubagio in treating multiple sclerosis relapses. A new drug for treating relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS) is showing some promise. More than 900 patients received an injectable drug called ofatumumab in a phase III multicenter clinical trial. In study results published last week, the immune-modulating drug was shown to quiet inflammatory disease activity. Researchers said a subcutaneous injection of ofatumumab produced a significant reduction in new inflammation as well as fewer clinical relapses and progression events. In the second year of treatment, nearly 9 out of 10 study participants on ofatumumab showed no sign of disease activity. The study covered two double-blind, double-dummy phase III trials, ASCLEPIOS I and ASCLEPIOS II. Both were funded by Novartis. The trials were conducted at 385 sites in 37 countries, comparing ofatumumab with teriflunomide, currently marketed in the United States as Aubagio, by Sanofi Genzyme. The results of the new study showed that 20 milligrams (mg) of injection of ofatumumab every 4 weeks reduced relapses by more than 50 percent, the risk of disability progression by 34 percent, and new T2 lesions by more than 80 percent, compared to a 14-mg daily pill of Aubagio. Ofatumumab is an anti-CD20 immune modulator designed to selectively deplete B cells. Teriflunomide has different mechanics and is designed to reduce T-cell and B-cell activity. “This data is very promising and very positive,” Bruce Bebo, PhD, the executive vice president of research at the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, told Healthline. “We are excited about this option.” How these drugs work Ofatumumab is similar in action to ocrelizumab, marketed in the United States as Ocrevus by Genentech. These two drugs were not compared against each other, but the mechanics are the same as they target B cells in an effort to manage the immune system. “The clinical data is similar between the two, but the route of administration is different,” said Bebo. Ocrevus is a twice-a-year IV infusion and is performed in a hospital setting. The most common side effects are infusion reactions, which can happen up to 24 hours after injection. Other side effects include upper and lower respiratory tract infections, skin infections, herpes, and a reduced immune system. Ofatumumab is a subcutaneous self-injection performed by the patient in their home. The drug is injected on day 1, day 7 and day 14, then continues once every 4 weeks. Side effects during the studies included headaches, increase risk for upper respiratory tract infections, and possible injection site reactions. Other things to know Neither ofatumumab nor Ocrevus has shown cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), but both drugs warn about the possibility. There were eight cases of appendicitis reported in the ofatumumab group versus two with Aubagio. Researchers do not know if this was coincidental or related to the drug. Ofatumumab had a slightly higher rate of herpetic diseases such as herpes. Out-of-pocket expenses for infusions tend to be more than an injection. And there are insurance issues around infusions that can make it more complicated. Genentech provides patient assistance for financial and personal support via their Ocrevus website. Ocrevus was approved in 2017 by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) and primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS). Ofatumumab was only tested for relapsing forms of MS, including active secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS). The FDA’s approval review for this drug is scheduled for next month. “The data is highly impressive,” Dr. Barry Singer, director and founder of The MS Center for Innovations in Care at Missouri Baptist Medical Center, told Healthline. “Ofatumumab will be another great option for relapsing forms of MS.” “There was not a trial for progressive MS, but it might have a similar effect as Ocrevus,” he added. If the drug is approved by the FDA, the label will have specific application details and will include the protocol such as injection locations. Singer has already had a number of conversations with patients regarding the potential of this new drug. Cautions during COVID-19 Both Singer and Bebo emphasized the importance of people with MS talking with their neurologists and healthcare providers during the COVID-19 pandemic regarding their therapy and risks. The National MS Society, in a joint effort with The Consortium of MS Centers and Multiple Sclerosis Society of Canada, created a data collection bank called COViMS at the onset of the pandemic. This is a data collection resource for physicians to enter clinical data on COVID-19 cases among people with MS and other demyelinating diseases within the central nervous system. At this time, there are 800 cases registered. This data will help uncover if there are any consequences with COVID-19 and any of the MS disease-modifying therapies. “Based on the data in hand now, it does not seem like having MS in itself changes the course of COVID-19,” Bebo said, “It is the comorbidities that make a difference and can cause poor outcome, the same as in the general population.” “The National MS Society has posted several informative articles about those living with MS and concerns with COVID-19. In addition, the Society has turned all of their MS support groups into a digital format to help more people,” he said. “Even in the face of COVID, we are still making progress in MS, still looking for hope,” Bebo said. “We’ve had two MS drugs approved this year, maybe a third one by the end of the year.”",Drug Shows Promise in Preventing Multiple Sclerosis Relapses,8,0.4918912508708685
1670,"The annual healthcare costs of gun violence in the United States exceed $170 billion. According to surgeons at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles, operations account for more than $16 billion of these costs. The team has tracked the changing frequency and cost of surgery for gunshot wounds, as well as the severity of the injuries. “We’re now seeing a lot more on the impact of gun violence. In the past, gun violence was never really discussed in the open — it was thought to only affect a certain population. However, now we know that it affects everyone,” says Dr. Peyman Benharash, who led the research. “In the hopes of trying to reduce it at a systemic level from top to bottom, we’re reporting, as surgeons, how gun violence in the patients that we treat has changed over the last decade.” Major surgery Using a database called the National Inpatient Sample, the researchers identified all the adults admitted to U.S. hospitals with gunshot wounds that required major surgery between 2005 and 2016. Over this period, a total of 322,599 people were admitted with gunshot wounds, of whom 262,098 underwent surgery. The frequency of operations increased by 18%, from 19,832 in 2005 to 23,480 in 2016. But the data suggest that this increase was largely the result of improved survival rates of individuals prior to hospital admission. “It appears that patients are reaching surgery more often because of reduced mortality before they get to the hospital,” says Dr. Benharash. The researchers attribute this to more successful resuscitation and improvements in the process of transporting people to the hospital. In addition, they believe that the American College of Surgeons’ Stop the Bleed campaign, which teaches the public how to stop life threatening bleeding, has helped more people survive long enough to reach the hospital. However, the severity of gunshot injuries that surgeons treated did worsen between 2005 and 2016. According to the International Classification of Diseases Injury Severity, which scores a person’s chances of surviving surgery, there was a 2.5% increase in the severity of injuries. Rising costs Meanwhile, the median cost associated with hospitalization for a gunshot injury requiring surgery — adjusted to account for the change in gross domestic product (GDP) over this period — increased significantly. It went up by more than 27%, from $15,100 in 2005 to $19,200 in 2016. Over the same period, the average hospital stay lengthened from 7.1 days to 12.6 days. The most expensive operations involved head and neck, vascular, and gastrointestinal injuries. “We hope that our findings are able to better inform policy in terms of violence prevention, as well as remuneration for hospitals that care for these patients, which are often in underserved regions,” says Dr. Benharash. “It’s also important to note that the economic and psychological costs of gunshot wounds do not stop when the patient is discharged,” he adds. “This stays with them and their families and their neighborhoods for a very long time.” A preprint of the study appears online in the Journal of the American College of Surgeons. “Over the past decade, the increase in gun violence and severity has resulted in higher costs. Operations involving selected surgical treatments incurred higher in-hospital costs. Given the profound economic and social impact of surgically treated [gunshot wounds], policy and public health efforts to reduce gun violence are imperative.” Improved chances of survival The study did bring some good news: The mortality rate for patients who underwent surgery for gunshot wounds declined from 8.6% in 2005 to 7.6% in 2016. The researchers attribute this to improved surgical techniques and associated hospital treatments, as well as better patient management. The highest mortality rates were associated with gunshot wounds from suicide attempts, highlighting the importance of mental health services. “The group of patients who self-harmed actually had the highest mortality overall,” says Dr. Benharash. “This situation points again to the need for better mental health access that hopefully leads to a reduction in suicide attempts.”","Gunshot wounds needing surgery in the US increase in frequency, severity",8,0.5011489035231449
1671,"One of the biggest risk factors for osteoporosis is biological sex. Females are much more likely to experience this condition than males. After reaching peak bone mass at age 25–30, there is a gradual, age-related decline in bone mass. As a result of changes in the amount of estrogen in the body, in females, this bone loss accelerates after menopause. During perimenopause, which refers to the years before menopause, the ovaries gradually start to produce less estrogen. This loss of estrogen affects each female differently, and the impact varies between cultures. Menopause can be a positive experience for some, but it can also induce a raft of changes in the body. These include mood changes, hot flashes, and night sweats, as well as a loss of bone density. Extensive loss of bone density, which leads to an increased risk of breaking a bone, is called osteoporosis. In the United States, nearly 25% of females over the age of 65 have osteoporosis. In males of the same age, this figure is 5%. Globally, the rates of osteoporosis vary by up to 10-fold between ethnic groups. Aside from making certain lifestyle changes, there is currently no effective way to prevent osteoporosis. However, scientists in Brazil think that they may have found one. In experiments in female rats, the scientists used the hormone oxytocin to reverse processes that reduce the density and strength of bone. If studies in humans produce similar results, doctors could eventually use oxytocin clinically to prevent the onset of osteoporosis. The findings appear in full in the journal Scientific Reports. Perimenopause Researchers at São Paulo State University in Brazil conducted this study. In Brazil, due to the aging population, experts predict that around 100,000 hip fractures now occur each year. Hip fractures are three to four times more common in females than males, and they can have serious consequences, including loss of mobility and a higher risk of mortality in the years following. “Loss of function and independence is profound among survivors,” explains senior study author Rita Menegati Dornelles. “Approximately 40% become unable to walk independently, and about two-thirds of these need help a year later. Less than half recover their previous level of function.” The new study focused on a part of the hip called the femoral neck, which is the most common site for a fracture. The researchers studied this site in 18-month-old female rats, an age that is equivalent to perimenopause in human females. Dornelles says that research into this phase is critical yet currently underrepresented in the literature. “There’s a lot of research on the postmenopause phase, which follows a woman’s last period, but hormone swings in perimenopause are already sharp and are associated with a gradual decrease in bone density.” “More research is needed to support the prevention of osteoporosis during perimenopause, as the period after menopause represents about a third of a woman’s life and should have the best quality possible.” Treatment: The ‘love hormone’ Dornelles and team treated the perimenopausal rats with oxytocin, a hormone most commonly associated with feelings of affection, bonding, and empathy but which also has important roles in regulating bone mass. Oxytocin is secreted by bone cells and is associated with bone metabolism in females. Levels of this hormone also decline during menopause. Around 1 month after the scientists treated the rats, they analyzed blood and tissue samples and compared them with those of animals that did not receive oxytocin. The rats that received oxytocin showed no loss of bone density and had biochemical markers of bone renewal in their blood. The bone itself was also more robust in the treated animals. The femoral neck region was stronger and less porous, and it had properties consistent with higher bone density.",Oxytocin could prevent osteoporosis in females,8,0.8702219322743177
1672,"A person may develop a thrombus (blood clot) for a variety of reasons. Some blood clots, such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which is in a deep vein, can be life threatening. A thrombosis occurring in the coronary artery can interrupt blood flow to the heart, resulting in a heart attack. In situations such as this, doctors must administer rapid treatment to resolve the blood clot and save a person’s life. Blood-thinning agents, or anticoagulants, such as heparin, help the body break down clots in the blood and prevent additional clots from forming. However, anticoagulant agents prevent the enzymes that help stop bleeding from working. This can lead to a significant risk of bleeding, which can be life threatening. In a new study, researchers from the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland describe a new type of blood thinner that resolves thrombosis, without a risk of major bleeds. Although experiments in mice, rabbits, and pigs show the molecule to be stable, safe, and effective, scientists need to conduct further research before doctors can use it in people. The study appears in the journal Nature Communications. The target: FXII The new blood thinner works by inhibiting coagulation factor XII (FXII), which kicks off the blood-clotting process. Scientists know that targeting this molecule is safe because humans that naturally lack FXII are at less risk of thrombosis but do not bleed more than normal. Studies in mice without FXII also show this to be accurate, and other studies in rats, rabbits, and primates also confirm the evidence. Although this study is not the first to successfully create an inhibitor of FXII, doctors have not been able to use previous compounds because they do not have sufficient potency or selectivity. In this study, the researchers made some small but significant changes to a previously designed inhibitor — called FXII618 — to make it a viable treatment option. Using a combination of random screening approaches and rational design, they identified parts of the molecule that they could change. They strengthened its binding capacity by more than 20 times and increased its stability in the blood 25-fold. After completing this painstaking design process, the team collaborated with experts in disease modeling at the University of Bern in Switzerland to test the drug in animals. Bleeding-free anticoagulation Experiments in mice, rabbits, and pigs revealed important properties of the molecule, such as the dose needed for it to be effective. The experiments also confirmed that it was safe and showed no signs of toxicity. Further experiments in a mouse model of thrombosis showed that the inhibitor could effectively treat blood clots without increasing the risk of bleeding. “Our collaboration found that it is possible to achieve bleeding-free anti-coagulation with a synthetic inhibitor.” – Prof. Christian Heinis, Laboratory of Therapeutic Proteins and Peptides, EPFL In the final set of experiments, the researchers tested the inhibitor in an artificial lung model. Doctors use artificial lungs to keep a person alive when their lungs are unable to do so, for example, between lung failure and receiving a transplant. Artificial lungs can help keep people alive in life threatening situations, such as severe cases of COVID-19. However, they also increase the risk of blood clots. “In these devices, contact of blood proteins with artificial surfaces, such as the membrane of the oxygenator or tubing, can cause blood clotting,” senior author of the study Prof. Heinis explains. This process, called contact activation, can lead to dangerous complications and may even be fatal. Increasing retention time In a rabbit model of an artificial lung, the team found that the new blood thinner prolonged important blood clotting parameters around 10-fold, which is five times more effective than heparin. Rabbits who received the new blood thinner also showed completely normal bleeding, while those treated with heparin bled longer than normal. Overall, the findings suggest that the new blood thinner could offer safe protection against blood clots in patients receiving artificial lung treatment. The authors suggest that doctors could also use the molecule for other medical conditions that involve FXII, such as hereditary angioedema, Alzheimer’s disease, and multiple sclerosis. Although these results are encouraging, the blood-thinner does not stay in the body for very long. In rabbits, the body eliminates the compound within 30 minutes. This means that doctors would need to infuse it continuously for it to have any effect. For the drug to be a viable alternative to other anticoagulants, the researchers are designing new variants with longer retention times. It is also important to note that scientists do not intend for people to receive this treatment long-term (over months, weeks, or even days), and a person could not take it by mouth. Therefore, doctors could only administer this treatment to prevent blood clots during acute procedures, such as bypass surgery or treatment that involves an artificial lung.",New blood thinner without bleeding risk,8,0.7479066300640735
1673,"Medical News Today has interviewed Prof. Cheryl Giscombé, an expert on stress-related health disparities among African Americans, about a source of pressure that many African American women experience: the obligation to project an image of strength or that of fulfilling a ‘superwoman’ role. Many African American women find it hard to integrate self-care into their daily lives. In 2010, Prof. Cheryl Giscombé, Ph.D., published a paper entitled Superwoman Schema: African American Women’s Views on Stress, Strength, and Health in the journal Qualitative Health Research. In it, she explained: “Researchers have suggested that health disparities in African American women, including adverse birth outcomes, lupus, obesity, and untreated depression, can be explained by stress and coping. The Strong Black Woman/Superwoman role has been highlighted as a phenomenon influencing African American women’s experiences and reports of stress.” MNT reached out to Prof. Giscombé — who is the Melissa and Harry LeVine Family Professor of Quality of Life, Health Promotion and Wellness at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill — in an attempt to find out more about how this role affects Black women. We spoke to Prof. Giscombé — who is also a social and health psychologist and a psychiatric-mental health nurse practitioner — about her past and current research, and how she developed the superwoman schema. We also talked about how the superwoman role affects the mental (and physical) health of African American women, whether there are any benefits to the role, and what are some interventions that could help offset its adverse effects — both on an individual and a societal level. We have lightly edited the interview for clarity. MNT: Could you kindly define the notion of the superwoman schema for our readers and tell us a bit about what prompted you to research it?Prof. Giscombé: Yes, thank you for asking. So, the superwoman schema is a conceptual framework that I developed based on research with African-American women across various age groups and educational backgrounds to understand better how to conceptualize stress and coping in African American women. I have been interested in the effects of stress on health behaviors and health outcomes for a number of years, since I was an undergraduate in college, and probably before. I was quite concerned when I saw that there seemed to be inadequate measures, inadequate ways to evaluate stress that were often void of the gender and/or race-specific nuances that may influence how African American women experience and cope with stress. So, I became interested in this — really, I became interested in emotional suppression first. So, if women felt like they could not express their emotions, how might that impact their health? And then I became interested in this concept of strength — if they feel obligated to present an image of strength. So, through qualitative research with African American women, the superwoman schema conceptual framework was developed, and we identified [its] five characteristics: a perceived obligation to present an image of strength a perceived obligation to suppress emotions a perceived obligation to resist help or to resist being vulnerable to others […] [a] motivation to succeed despite limited resources [p]rioritization of caregiving Basically, prioritization of caregiving is a role of caregiving that really is the prioritization of caregiving over self-care, that’s what it ends up being, and that’s how the women describe it. The superwoman schema is a conceptual framework. […] When I talked to people, they were generally talking about the characteristics that I described. But, from the research, we also identified antecedents and motivations for it — because it’s not like women just woke up one day and decided, “I’m going to feel obligated to do these things.” They talked about historical factors, societal factors, lessons from their foremothers, how they saw their moms cope, their grandmothers cope and deal with stress. They talked about how showing your emotions could be seen as a sign of weakness and make you more vulnerable, how asking for help could make you be disappointed. Because, first of all, when we ask for help, people may then want you to do a favor for them and not a good favor — you know how people do take advantage of you if you let them help you? And not only that, [but also] if you allowed people to help you, women felt that it was inefficient, often because they could probably do a better and quicker job themselves, and so they defaulted to taking care of things on their own versus asking for help. So, there were a number of reasons [for taking on the superwoman role], including historical oppression, gender- and race-related oppression and abuse. Many of the [women] talked about a history of experiencing verbal, physical, and sexual abuse. And the themes were similar across age groups. We interviewed women in college; we interviewed women with no college and some who hadn’t even completed a high-school education. We interviewed women who had completed college and women who had terminal degrees (law degrees, Ph.D. degrees) and young adult women from age 18 [to women in their 60s]. So it was a broad range, yet the themes were very similar across ages and educational backgrounds. MNT: Could you tell us more about the relationship with racial discrimination and historical racism and how they contributed to the superwoman role and the perceived pressures of this role? Prof. Giscombé: In particular, some women talked about not wanting to be perceived as “low on the totem pole.” That’s a quote from a group of women, and particularly the women from what we call a lower SES [socioeconomic status]. And [they spoke about] trying to dispel stereotypes about Black women by, what one might consider over-performing, so making sure you’re taking care of your family, your community. And that’s the other thing. These women weren’t just discussing these characteristics in response to their own stressors, but they were responding to the stressors facing their community, their children, the Black males. And they felt that there was some obligation and responsibility to perform [or behave] in these ways or to believe these things and then act upon them based on what they saw going on in their community — their relationships with men, protecting their children, [and} being the “backbone” of the African American community. So they saw this as part of their role. I call it the superwoman schema because of the psychological and cognitive components of this [phenomenon], where this may be a way of thinking that has grown over time. It may be subconscious — although, of course, talking about it brought it to women’s consciousness. But when I interviewed women, [it was interesting to see] how they talked about it. They became enlightened as they talked about it. So, I remember one of the participants talking about her grandmother and what she remembered seeing her grandmother do and not do […], work all day and do things on her own. And she talked about how yet [she] never saw her cry, and the more she talked, the more she recognized “Wow, she did model this for me, and maybe unintentionally I picked it up! I never saw her cry, yet she ended up having heart disease, and she had diabetes […].” So, women came to those realizations as they talked about their experiences and their foremothers in particular. So, racism directly [contributed to these pressures], but also the effects of racism on society, on Black society. And what that causes people to have to do in their daily lives to survive and thrive. So, direct racism but also indirect [racism contributed to creating the superwoman role]. MNT: In some of our previous articles, we often came across the so-called ‘spillover effects’ of experiencing racism, whether it’s via police brutality or interpersonal discrimination or systemic discrimination. Could this pressure to overperform and place caretaking duties first be an example of one such spillover effect, for example, in situations where young Black males are at the receiving end of police violence, and so on? Prof. Giscombé: Yes, definitely. So, either direct or vicarious experiences [of racism] and also trying to fill in the gaps generated through racism that your foreparents experienced, which could cause less economic stability. And this is [true] even in the higher educated, higher SES groups. Even a high income family may not have the financial foundation that a high income family from, say, a European American group might have. That’s not to say that all European Americans are high income, but there’s different access to resources and that different access to resources affects what one can do, even when they do have resources. So it’s a number of those factors. In my research, I also study this concept called network stress, and we’ve learned that it’s just as important to study network stress as it is to study individually experienced stress. So maybe you’ve never had financial strain, or you’re not having health issues. But if your loved ones are, we found that Black women who report that their loved ones are experiencing stressors [are] carrying those stressors and responding to them emotionally as if it’s their own stress. That can compound the stress experience and this desire to preserve family, community, as well as self. But what we are finding also is that [s]trength in and of itself may not be so bad! [T]he superwoman schema, in general, is a double-edged sword because it can contribute to resilience and survival and get you through tough times. So, […] I don’t encourage the idea that the superwoman schema is bad or strength is bad — sometimes, emotional suppression can even be quite appropriate, and resisting being vulnerable can be quite appropriate. But when you think about, perhaps a combination of those things — so, if you feel obligated to be strong, but you have no one to express your emotions to safely, or if you feel obligated to be strong and you can’t be vulnerable with anyone, and you’re prioritizing caregiving of others, and you haven’t made time for self-care, the combination of those factors, those characteristics may be what’s challenging. And that’s the kind of thing we’re trying to tease apart. I did research with Dr. Amani Allen [from the] University of California, Berkeley, and we looked at superwoman schema and allostatic loads — so, risk factors for cardiometabolic conditions — and we looked at it in the context of exposure to racism, [and the research revealed that] strength could be protective in certain situations. [I]’ve developed a psychometrically valid questionnaire to measure superwoman schema, along with my colleagues, including Drs. Allen, Angela Rose Black, Teneka Steed, Yin Li, and others. We were able to look at each characteristic (strength, suppression, resistance to vulnerability, motivation to succeed, and the prioritization of caregiving), and we’re seeing some differences in how those different characteristics relate to things, such as sleep quality, physical activity or sedentary behavior, depressive symptoms, and perceived stress. We need to do more work in this area, but we are learning that it’s not all similar, and we’ll be doing more work to test what I just suggested — looking at the combination of different characteristics to see what might actually make women most vulnerable and in what context. And, actually, I will be conducting a study funded by NIH [the National Institutes of Health] to look at intervening. I also do mindfulness and self-care interventions with African Americans. So, our next study will look at how a culturally relevant, mindfulness-based interventions target characteristics of superwoman schema that may be less adaptive. How might that help improve women’s stress levels and their risk for chronic health conditions? So, we don’t want to take it all away; we just want to help women — if they had those [superwoman characteristics] at appropriate times, but they engage in self-care […], maybe that’s the [missing] piece. Like, okay, say you do these things when appropriate, yet you also make time to exercise, meditate, eat properly, take time away from being a caregiver, put that role down from time to time — will that be what [offsets] superwoman schema characteristics [and not make them turn into] risk factors for mental health, distress, or other chronic health issues? So, we’re looking at that, and it’s really exciting, and we’re trying to tailor it specifically for African American women. MNT: Can you tell us more about these interventions? Prof. Giscombé: [O]ne of our latest papers is on mindfulness meditation, and this one was actually with both African American men and women who have prediabetes. And [the participants] found it culturally acceptable, but they also gave us some feedback on how to make it even more relevant. [W]e did interviews with everyone, and then we did focus groups with African American women. And that’s where we found out that even when they’re exposed to mindfulness and appreciate it, they greatly appreciate mindfulness, they saw the benefits, they knew it could help them in their lives — taking the time to practice at home [was hard]. The superwoman schema characteristics were getting in the way […]. They talked about how they loved being able to take a break from their regular lives and learn about mindfulness, and not only learn about mindfulness but engage in groups with other African American women in support of one another. Yet, they said they want more tools to know how to integrate the feeling and the activities that they did in our intervention. They wanted more tools to figure out how to break down their behavior patterns of being at home. So, they couldn’t actually integrate it and sustain it because they weren’t able to. They would get home, and they weren’t practicing because they were cooking, or taking care of people, or working, you know, and just not figuring out completely how to take time for themselves because they feel guilty. I haven’t mentioned that yet, but they talked about feeling guilty: “when I take time for myself, that makes me feel like I should be doing something for somebody else. There’s so much to do for other people, that when I take time for myself, I feel guilty.” So, they talked about appreciating the intervention — and not only appreciating the intervention but appreciating the fact that they learned that they had prediabetes because then that was a reason [for self-care]. And their family members said, “yes, go, you need to do this,” so they finally felt like they had an “excuse” — it’s incredible that you need an excuse to take care of yourself. So even when we asked them things like, well, in our next intervention […], if you’re a mom, do you want us to provide childcare on site? they said, “No, we don’t want to bring our children; we want this to be our time.” So, they know that’s what they need; they just need help creating the architecture in their lives to do it. And that’s what we aim to do in our next step. It’s not enough to give them the tools; we have to help them figure out how to integrate those tools. MNT: Speaking of maternal health, I spoke to Prof. Tiffany Green about untreated postpartum depression (PPD) being more prevalent amongst women of color. She pointed out that income disparities or educational levels do not fully explain these differences (in fact, she said a higher educational level correlates with more, not less, racial discrimination in some studies). Do you think some aspects of the superwoman schema might explain why some women are less likely to seek or receive treatment for conditions like PPD? Prof. Giscombé: I’m so glad you asked, and I agree completely with Dr. Green and what she shared with you. Women’s perinatal health was actually [o]ne of my first areas of research, under the mentorship of Dr. Marci Lobel (in addition to stress and cardiovascular outcomes) but in my doctoral program that is exactly what inspired me to do this work on superwoman schema — trying to understand why African American women have stress-related birth outcomes and why the disparity continues to exist among higher educated, higher-income women. In my research, I always attempt to recruit across SES groups, because if we only recruit low SES groups, we might assume that it’s SES, you know, and a lot of research is done with “African American women,” but you’ll often see “low-income African American women” and that’s the sample that was selected. Sometimes, people don’t even know that higher SES Black women exist, number one, and they might assume that once you’re higher SES, then you don’t have these issues. But [w]e have these data that demonstrate that these birth outcome disparities exist despite higher SES and might even be greater in these higher SES groups [and] racism exposure [may be higher]. And, [i]f you think about it, there’s a couple of factors going on. Higher SES African Americans tend to be in more integrated environments, and often, they’re the only one or one of few. They also may be more likely to be separated from their family of origin, so they may have moved away. Or even if they haven’t moved away, they spend more time in their work environments. And [t]heir family may not understand their new roles, possibly. Because it might be that they have been the first, or they might just be unique. So, they are in two worlds, and there’s definitely research and literature about that — the two worlds that you could be living in. So you may be exposed to more discrimination, you may be isolated, and you may not have a community, and your community may not be as rich with people that you can completely trust and rely upon. We need to continue to dig deeper to see if that’s really the case, but those things have been hypothesized. As I said in the research on Black women and birth outcomes, their measures of stress were void of race and gender factors. I came across literature and articles in Essence magazine, for example, where I saw this type of superwoman — what I now call superwoman schema — described in words shared by Black women. I thought, “We’re not measuring that in our research! How can I get at that?” And my hypothesis is that it is a factor [in conditions like PPD]. Also, if you have more means, you may be more likely to feel obligated to give back — to the people coming behind you, meaning the people you’re mentoring, to your family at home, people might [look up to you]. Even if it’s not giving back financially, it’s giving back through your knowledge and your resources, and that’s a gift to be able to do that. But it also creates another job. And there’s less time for downtime. [J]ohn Henry-ism is also a factor that has been explored in Black men and also Black women — of course, Black men also experience similar phenomena […]. But I was particularly interested in Black women because of the birth outcomes and because of the different ways that they are expected to or expect themselves to care for others in their communities. MNT: Before we draw to a close, is there anything that I haven’t asked that you would like our readers to know? I would say yes, and it relates to kind of what we were just saying before. I think many people, many women operate on this idea that, to whom much is given, much is required. So if one has something to give, then they want to give it. They want to share. They don’t want to hold it. Yet, we haven’t learned as much about how to care for ourselves and these disparities, these inequities in health — diabetes, birth outcomes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, lupus, numerous things — we can address them, that’s the exciting part! So, what’s exciting is that so many people are now entering the dialogue about self-care, and mindfulness is becoming more [popular], people are more curious about that […]. I think that will be important, but what will be critical is, as I mentioned before, helping people make space for those things. The other thing is helping healthcare providers and healthcare systems understand these things because it’s one thing for people who have the wherewithal to engage in self-care, meditation, exercise, etc., […] yet, we also have to [get] the medical community, the healthcare community [u]p to speed and keep them up to speed. Because other factors in these [health] disparities that we see are bias, assumptions, lack of understanding of the Black experience, lack of understanding of what you’re seeing or what you’re looking at, when a Black woman, for example, enters your hospital or emergency room or clinic. And so, a lot of my work also focuses on educating providers to provide culturally sensitive, culturally humble, and culturally relevant care. And we’ve unfortunately recently seen [i]n the media, [stories] about African American women who’ve lost their lives because of the treatment that they received in perinatal care. But those are just examples of many experiences that African American women and others face when they engage with the healthcare system, and there’s a lack of understanding or even a lack of an attempt to understand the context of their lives and how that’s influencing how they show up in care. Or what their symptoms look like. So, we have to educate Black women and their families also — because that’s another thing; if Black women are educated, and they start taking better care of themselves, their families need to also understand that there may be a new attitude happening — but we must also educate healthcare providers — nurses, physicians, nurse practitioners, psychologists, physicians assistants, speech and respiratory therapists, social workers, and other professionals. One of the greatest joys [I had was] maybe about a year ago, [when] I was invited to speak to an organization of healthcare and hospital executives [that] determine patient flow, […] so much about how physicians and nurses and nurse practitioners and others operate in the patient care setting (we have to understand that side of health and healthcare as well to tackle health disparities). So, they wanted to hear about the superwoman schema, [a]nd they wanted to understand how that influences the lives of their patients, their stress, and coping in general. So that is important work that researchers and policymakers should attend to — to improve these outcomes that are unacceptable. As we work to promote equitable care for African Americans, attention also needs to be placed on other groups (Native Americans, Hispanic/Latinx populations, Asian Americans, LGBTQIA populations, and those with disabilities). As we address inequities in one group, we can apply what we learn, and what we do to help optimize care and create equity for all groups [S]tructures, policy, work policy [are all important]. I’m working on a paper now on workplace meditation and the feasibility of workplace programs. [The responsibility to stay healthy] can’t just be on the individual. Because they are in a context, they are in a structure; we’re in a society that is supporting inequities. So, we can start with the individual because awareness is important, they can try to strive for improving their lives, focus on the providers, the healthcare systems, and we need to focus on workplace settings because we spend most of our time at work — and other policies. So, it is a multifaceted so-called socio-ecological framework where you’re dealing with the individual, the family, the community, and all of these institutions that impact health. So, it’s a lot of work, but it’s exciting.",‘We must educate healthcare providers’ about Black women’s experience,8,0.7493779731799824
1674,"In this article, we learn about the gynecological healthcare experiences of Black women in the United Kingdom. We also speak with Dr. Christine Ekechi, who is a co-chair of the Race Equality Taskforce that the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) recently formed to tackle racial bias and disparities in women’s healthcare. Implicit bias in healthcare can be detrimental to Black women’s health. “I can’t breathe” were the words that George Floyd repeated more than 20 times while a white Minneapolis police officer unjustly murdered him. The resonance of these words not only triggered a global outcry against violence inflicted on Black communities; it also propagated recollections of similar experiences of oppression within Black communities. In a similar vein, this article shares the experiences of six Black women and their ongoing battle with painful reproductive conditions. They all reveal a similar story: that Black women’s “cries” for help are routinely unheard, unseen, and misunderstood. As a result of this, these women are disproportionately suffering in healthcare. This is a reminder that Black Lives Matter (BLM) is an expansive and inclusive movement that brings all Black lives to the forefront of the ongoing fight against systemic racism. In contrast, the “All Lives Matter” counterprotest is supposedly intended to establish solidarity and common ground in support of the BLM movement. However, it parallels the “colorblind” ideology, according to which “we all bleed the same color.” In a healthcare context, the latter violates the concept of triage in medical ethics, which demands that life endangering issues be dealt with first. These stories are also a reminder of the fact that Black women do not have medical conditions simply because they are Black. So, using “Blackness” as a proxy may never help us understand how their experiences inform the disparities in their healthcare outcomes. It is the harsh reality that exposes the vulnerability of Black people in U.K. healthcare systems, where implicit bias permeates the healthcare workforce and, in some cases, puts “Black lives at risk” in comparison with other ethnicity groups. This is apparent in the 2019 MBRRACE-UK report, which confirms that Black women are five times more likely than white women to die as a result of complications in their pregnancy. Reproductive health research also reports that Black women have a higher risk of miscarriage with both spontaneous and in vitro fertilization (IVF) pregnancy. For full-term pregnancies, stillbirth is also twice as likely to occur in Black women compared with white women. Reproductive conditions such as fibroids are three times more likely to occur in Black women than white women. Similarly, endometriosis is traditionally associated with being a “white woman’s disease,” which may consequently lead to misdiagnosis and delays in appropriate treatment for Black women. Dr. Christine Ekechi — who is also a consultant obstetrician and gynecologist at Imperial Healthcare in London, U.K. — recently announced that a multi-focused approach and collaborative effort between doctors and the government, implemented by the newly established Race Equality Taskforce, “[will] ensure that no woman or her family suffers unnecessarily, and that [it should hopefully] address racial inequality, where it exists.” Medical News Today reached out to six Black women from the U.K. All the women keenly responded to our request for them to talk about the difficulties they had experienced in getting a diagnosis and treatment for reproductive and gynecological conditions such as endometriosis and fibroids. What was pertinent in the conversations was their appreciation that “someone cared” and was “holding a safe space” to listen to their concerns and, at last, take them seriously. The case studies In the sections below, we summarize their unique yet broadly similar experiences by including key quotes from each case study. The quotes reflect the women’s collective experiences, and, more importantly, they are thematically consistent with the reported drivers that may contribute to implicit bias and racism in healthcare. Most significantly, Dr. Ekechi endorsed MNT’s decision to include personal case studies for this article. Her interview responses reveal that she places particular emphasis on “listening to the experiences of individual women and clinicians” as a way to best improve the Race Equality Taskforce’s understanding of the causes of the inequalities in Black women’s healthcare. Self-advocacy Self-advocacy in healthcare refers to a person’s ability to ask for what they need and want and to tell doctors about their thoughts and feelings. MNT first spoke with 32-year-old Latoya, who talked about dealing with 20-plus years of pain and being “fobbed off” with prescriptions for birth control pills and mefenamic acid, a type of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, for pain management. After requesting a female doctor multiple times, Latoya explained that “it took me having to cry helplessly in front of my GP [general practitioner] to be taken seriously, which finally led to my referral to a specialist.” After a series of investigations, a healthcare professional discovered numerous fibroids in her uterus. They removed them in two separate laparoscopic surgeries — one of which removed two tennis ball-sized fibroids. Latoya continues to manage her flare-ups by eating a healthful, balanced diet at the recommendation of a female doctor, who said to her [paraphrased]: “I’m not supposed to tell you this, but eat more fruit[s] and vegetables. Although I’m meant to prescribe medication, following a health[ful] diet will limit the growth of your fibroids.” Latoya’s tenacity to learn about fibroids led her to start her own online platform called Wombbae, which she uses to continue advocating for other women with fibroids. We also spoke with Paige, 24, who experienced such unbearable pain at times that she had no choice but to defer her university studies due to multiple hospital admissions. Each time she left, a healthcare provider prescribed a stronger combination of pain relievers. Paige’s reliance on pain relief medication started to affect her mental health. So, after researching alternative ways to manage her pain, she found that her symptoms were consistent with endometriosis and pushed to be referred for an MRI scan. The MRI scan confirmed the presence of fibroids. After a healthcare provider offered Paige birth control pills to manage the pain — which, like Latoya, she refused — a female doctor encouraged her to push for a laparoscopy. Around 6 months later, Paige underwent laparoscopic surgery. It revealed no evidence of endometriosis. She explained to us that a male doctor left her feeling humiliated when, soon after she awoke from surgery, he said, “[W]hat you have done [supposedly wasting their time] is serious, and you need to consider if you have psychological problems.” Paige has lost trust in the National Health Service (NHS). She is now focusing on educating herself on how she can manage her pain using holistic therapies. The negative feedback cycle and ‘stereotype threat’We also spoke to Mel and Sarah, both 30 years old, who experienced years of debilitating pain that doctors eventually diagnosed as severe endometriosis. One similarity in both stories is the constant dismissal of their reported pain, despite the fact that the severity of the condition (unknown at the time) was causing extreme symptoms that they feel should have warranted specialist investigation. Both women spoke about the pain being so unbearable that it would cause vomiting and fainting. The inconvenience and sense of embarrassment associated with trying to navigate extremely heavy periods while working also affected their mental health. There were also a few occasions where they both questioned the validity of their own concerns as a result of the lack of healthcare-related empathy in their cases. In the earlier stages of investigation, Mel asked her GP if they had considered endometriosis or fibroids as the cause of her pain. To this, her doctor replied, “Hmmm, maybe, as it’s common in ‘BAME’ [Black, Asian, and minority ethnic] people.” The doctor still prescribed birth control pills to manage the pain, despite later finding out that she also had a case of fibroids. Sarah also spoke about a time when she had a doctor’s appointment, and a doctor discussed her case in a nonconfidential patient waiting area. She explained that this particular situation made her feel “worthless” and showed the “lack of care in maintaining her dignity.” Both experiences highlight negative medical interactions through a loss of patient-centeredness and the removal of patient autonomy. This, in turn, breeds “stereotype threat” and hinders interactions between the patient and the doctor. Mel continues to research lifestyle changes and natural remedies that will help her manage her pain flare-ups. Sarah underwent three surgeries to manage the pain and is now pregnant with her first baby. Self-funding We also spoke with Liz, 33, and Hafiza, 30. They both waited approximately 10 years to receive a diagnosis of stage 4 endometriosis. Healthcare providers left both women “to their own devices,” meaning that they needed to self-fund their specialist investigations and treatment. This is because they faced significant delays in investigating their long history of pain cycles and had to manage with prescriptions of the birth control pill. In Liz’s case, the severity of the endometriosis affected her bowel and bladder. It also compromised her fertility, as the condition caused scarring and blockages, leading to the removal of both of her fallopian tubes. Liz is now undergoing IVF treatment. Similarly, Hafiza underwent surgery to remove two parts of her bowel, remove her appendix, resection her bladder, and place a stoma bag. Despite all the difficulties she faced, she now has two young children. Lessons learned One thing that each of these eye-opening accounts highlights is the need for early intervention in gynecological and reproductive health investigations and self-advocacy to “follow one’s gut” when something feels wrong. The case studies we heard have shown how desperation can cause a person to take matters into their own hands. However, the implications rest on the intersectional difficulties that Black women may face regarding their class and socioeconomic background, where a lower status can hinder a person’s access to private healthcare. This, in turn, has detrimental effects on their health outcomes.",‘We all bleed the same color’: Why do Black women in the UK experience disparities in gynecological care?,8,0.9896444225826386
1675,"Despite spending around one-third of our lives in the land of nod, sleep still holds many mysteries. Scientists are chipping away at the details, but the wonder of slumber is much more complex than it appears. In this Special Feature, we dispel some common myths. Sleep is mysterious, but science is chipping away at the details. Many animals need sleep of some kind, and if evolution has retained a behavior across many species, it must be important. After all, lying unconscious for hours does not seem like the safest activity for an animal in the wild. So whatever goes on during sleep is vital. “Those little slices of death,” as Edgar Allen Poe referred to sleep, help maintain good physical and mental health. The long-term effects of sleep loss are associated with a range of health conditions, including diabetes, depression, stroke, and more. However, because sleep has a perpetual association with the ethereal: dreams, altered states, and emotions, it is no surprise that it is tied to a legion of myths. In this Special Feature, we address some of the most common myths related to the ubiquitous snooze. 1. Your brain shuts down during sleep Thankfully, our brains do not quit their day job during sleep. Important functions, such as breathing, mean our brains can never fully shut down. In fact, during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, when most dreams occur, brain wave activity is like that of wakefulness. Interestingly, despite the high level of activity, it is hardest to wake a sleeper during REM sleep. This is why this stage of sleep is sometimes called paradoxical sleep. While we sleep, our white and gray matter has much to do. Once we have dropped off, our brain cycles through three stages of non-REM sleep, followed by one phase of REM sleep. In each of the four stages, the brain demonstrates specific brain wave patterns and neuronal activity. This cycle of four stages repeats five or six times during a full night’s sleep. While some regions of the brain fall quiet during non-REM sleep, other areas leap into action. For instance, the amygdala, most famous for its role in emotion, is active during slumber. The thalamus is an interesting case. This part of the brain is a relay station for our senses. What we see, hear, and feel arrives first at the thalamus. From there, sensory signals are ferried to the cerebral cortex, which makes sense of the inputs. During non-REM sleep, the thalamus is relatively quiet. However, during REM sleep, the thalamus becomes active, and sends the cerebral cortex the sights and sounds of our dreams. 2. If you remember your dream, you slept well Most people dream every night, yet we often don’t remember them. Dreams mostly occur during REM sleep, but they are almost immediately forgotten. It is only when someone wakes during or just after REM sleep that the memory of a dream has not yet faded. Some evidence suggests certain neurons that are active during REM sleep might actively suppress dream memories. These neurons produce melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH), which helps regulate sleep. MCH also inhibits the hippocampus, a key brain region for memory storage. One of the authors of the study linked above, Thomas Kilduff, Ph.D., explains: “Since dreams are thought to occur primarily during REM sleep, the sleep stage when the MCH cells turn on, activation of these cells may prevent the content of a dream from being stored in the hippocampus — consequently, the dream is quickly forgotten.” One study approaches this question from a different angle. The researchers recruited individuals who tend to remember their dreams most nights. They found that these people became wakeful during the night more often than people who more rarely remembered their dreams. This suggests that people who often recall dreams might sleep less well. In short, remembering a dream is not an indication of good sleep. It is just that you woke up at the right time to recall it. 3. Never wake up a sleepwalker The common claim is that if you wake a sleepwalker, they might have a heart attack or even die. This is not true. However, if someone wakes a sleepwalker, they can spark confusion and sometimes fear. Some sleepwalkers may act aggressively, so people need to be cautious if they wake them. Sometimes, sleepwalkers can injure themselves as they navigate the house with their eyes closed. For this reason, the best course of action is to try and coax them back to the safety of their bed. The United Kingdom’s National Health Service (NHS) website suggests that “the best thing to do if you see someone sleepwalking is to make sure they’re safe.” The NHS website also explains once the sleepwalker has gone back to sleep and the episode is over, it is a good idea to gently wake them before allowing them to drop back to sleep. This might “prevent another episode occurring in the same deep-sleep cycle.” They also add a note of caution: “Do not shout or startle the person and do not physically restrain them unless they’re in danger, as they may lash out.” 4. Alcohol guarantees a good night’s sleep Alcohol reduces the amount of time it takes to get to sleep. Someone who has drunk alcohol might also be more difficult to rouse. Because of this, people often assume that it has a beneficial impact on sleep overall. This is not the case. The quality of sleep under the influence of alcohol is poorer in comparison to sleep without alcohol. To awake feeling refreshed, our brain must cycle through the highly orchestrated series of phases and cycles mentioned earlier. Alcohol knocks this series of repetitions out of whack. For instance, as the authors of a review on the topic explain, after drinking alcohol, “REM sleep reduction in the first part of sleep is significant. Total night REM sleep percentage is decreased in the majority of studies at moderate and high doses.” According to another paper, which looks at the relationship between drugs and sleep more broadly, “self-reported sleep problems are highly prevalent among alcohol users with rates of clinical insomnia between approximately 35% and 70%.” To summarize, while alcohol does get you to sleep quicker, the sleep you have will be less refreshing. 5. Cheese and other foods This is an old myth that most people in the Western world will have heard. Although well known, one only has to eat cheese before bedtime to find that it is certainly not true for everyone. However, eating a large meal just before bed, whether it includes cheese or not, can cause indigestion or heartburn, which could interfere with sleep. If your sleep is disturbed by an active gut, and you become more wakeful more often, you will be more likely to remember any dreams you had. As mentioned earlier, people forget dreams almost as quickly as they form — unless you wake up during a dream, you are unlikely to remember it. And, if your gut is uncomfortable, it might increase the chances of having an unpleasant dream. The type of meal enjoyed before dinner could also make a difference. Dr. William Kormos, Editor in Chief of Harvard Men’s Health Watch, explains: “[E]ating a large meal, especially a high-carbohydrate meal, could trigger night sweats because the body generates heat as it metabolizes the food.” Again, this is likely to disrupt sleep, increase wakefulness, and therefore increase the likelihood of remembering dreams. Why and how the cheese/nightmare myth began is unclear, but the fact that cheese boards tend to appear at the end of a large meal might offer some insight. Although some believe the origins of the cheese myth might lie in ancient legends. A related myth is that certain foods, including milk, cheese, and turkey might help induce sleep. This is because they contain an amino acid called tryptophan. Tryptophan is necessary for the body to make serotonin, which is necessary for the manufacture of melatonin, a hormone that plays a role in sleep. Therefore, the theory goes that foods containing tryptophan might aid sleep. The most common of these myths is that Thanksgiving turkey, with its dose of tryptophan, makes someone sleepy after lunch. However, studies investigating tryptophan intake have not found an overwhelming effect on sleep. Additionally, the levels of this acid in a portion of cheese or turkey are not high enough to make a difference. The takehome Sleep still holds many mysteries. Only through science and research can we eventually unlock more answers. However, as this article outlines, we have data to dispel many of the most entrenched myths. For now, the best advice is to avoid late-night meals, reduce alcohol intake, and be gentle with sleepwalkers.

1676,"For World Hepatitis Day, Medical News Today spoke with Dr. Alexandra Buzea about hepatitis C — how the infection manifests, what treatments are available, and how to fight harmful stereotypes and misinformation about this illness. Medication can cure 95% of HCV infections, Dr. Alexandra Buzea pointed out. July 28 is World Hepatitis Day, the yearly day of awareness of hepatitis, a viral infection that affects the liver. It can result from different strains of the hepatitis virus: A, B, C, D, or E. Hepatitis C infections are some of the most common that affect the liver. They are caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV). Globally, HCV affected an estimated 71 million people in 2015, and between 2013 and 2016, about 2.4 million people in the United States were living with HCV infections. If a person does not receive a diagnosis and treatment, an HCV infection can become chronic, leading to a risk of cirrhosis, which is scarring of the liver. Because initial symptoms of an HCV infection can go undiagnosed for a long time, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) now advise “one-time hepatitis C testing of all adults (18 years and older) and all pregnant women during every pregnancy.” To better understand how HCV infections manifest, what treatment options there are, and how to combat harmful stereotypes about the condition, MNT has spoken with Dr. Alexandra Buzea. Dr. Buzea is a vascular surgeon with additional experience in liver, or hepatic, transplantation affiliated with the Ponderas Academic Hospital, in Bucharest, Romania. We have lightly edited the interview transcript for clarity. HCV cannot be contracted through hugging, ‘so hug away!’ MNT: What is hepatitis C, and what are its effects on health? Dr. Alexandra Buzea: HCV is a well-known virus that can affect the liver, both in an acute form and in chronic form. HCV can lead to hepatitis — characterized by inflammation of the liver cells — ranging from a mild form lasting a few weeks to a lifelong disease. What people need to understand is that this virus, although highly curable, if left untreated, becomes one of the main causes of cirrhosis and liver cancer. Most people do not exhibit any symptoms, but a few “unlucky” ones may experience fatigue, fever, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and even jaundice. MNT: How can a person contract HCV? Dr. Alexandra Buzea: The most common way of becoming infected is through exposure to infected blood. A small quantity of it is enough for someone to contract the virus. Although the most cited means of infection are through intravenous drug use, unsafe injection practices, contaminated blood transfusions or blood products, or inadequate sterilization of medical equipment, sometimes a small cut on the finger will suffice. We should also mention other, less common ways of contracting HCV, like unsafe sexual practices or through birth. A mother who has contracted HCV can pass it on to her baby, but not through breast milk. Hepatitis C is also not transmitted through sharing food or water with an infected person or through hugging them, but small gestures such as these can help them feel loved and safe in their community and help them recover faster — so hug away! MNT: What are some therapeutic options? Dr. Alexandra Buzea: Unfortunately, there is no vaccine available at the moment, but there are a few treatment options, and, of course, prevention plays a key role in medical practice. Antiviral medication, pangenotypic direct-acting antivirals, can cure up to 95% of patients. We have to be aware that only about 30% of patients clear the virus spontaneously in 6 months and do not require treatment. The rest will develop a chronic infection and will need antiviral medication, usually over 12–24 weeks, depending on the presence or absence of cirrhosis. For people already infected with HCV, immunization with the hepatitis A and B vaccines is crucial in preventing co-infection and protecting the liver. ‘People need to be more empathetic and minimize the stigma’ MNT: Studies such as this one, published in Public Health Reports in 2016, suggest that baby boomers are the generation with the highest rate of HCV infections. Why is that? Dr. Alexandra Buzea: HCV infections occur worldwide, but depending on the country, the virus can be concentrated in certain populations and, yes, even in certain age groups. A few factors to blame could be infection control practices that were historically insufficient in HCV infection, the generation’s low compliance with screening, misinformation, the fear of disease — any disease — and the fact that, in many countries, the genotype distribution remains unknown. Also, approximately 80% of people do not exhibit any symptoms after infection, or [they] experience general ones, such as fatigue, fever, or nausea, that do not prompt them to seek medical attention right away. MNT: There are many harmful myths about HCV infections, such as the belief that they are incurable. How might the media and healthcare organisations fight such disinformation and encourage people to seek treatment and support? Dr. Alexandra Buzea: Healthcare organizations can fight disinformation only through the help of mass media. Any means of communication is encouraged — newspapers, TV, radio, social media apps… even smoke signals, if that leads to a higher understanding of diseases. However, the information sources must be reliable. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the CDC are trustworthy and offer helpful explanations. Taking the advice of a neighbor who recommends a tea because they used it and it “helped with liver problems” is not the best idea, because it can delay access to a treatment plan and affect the patient’s general health status. Our collaborators in public relations carry the burden of developing informative campaigns that reach a broad spectrum of audiences. I believe that understanding the implications of HCV infections motivates people to seek medical attention and screening, even in the absence of any symptoms. MNT: Is there anything else you would like to mention to our readers, as we draw to a close? Dr. Alexandra Buzea: I just want to point out that having an HCV infection is not a death sentence. It is highly curable, as long as people know about it and seek care from healthcare specialists. As soon as we can diagnose it, we can treat it. There are therapy options, even in more advanced phases of the disease — hepatic transplant is becoming more and more accessible, and antiviral treatments are increasingly affordable. People need to be more empathetic with those who have HCV infections and minimize the stigma — if society would stop seeing it as a “shameful” disease, maybe more people would seek help for it without the fear of becoming outcasts.","Hepatitis C infection: 'Not a death sentence, it is highly curable'",8,0.37273558813646146
1677,"In a step closer to skyscrapers that serve as power sources, a team led by University of Michigan researchers has set a new efficiency record for color-neutral, transparent solar cells. The team achieved 8.1% efficiency and 43.3% transparency with an organic, or carbon-based, design rather than conventional silicon. While the cells have a slight green tint, they are much more like the gray of sunglasses and automobile windows. “Windows, which are on the face of every building, are an ideal location for organic solar cells because they offer something silicon can’t, which is a combination of very high efficiency and very high visible transparency,” said Stephen Forrest, the Peter A. Franken Distinguished University Professor of Engineering and Paul G. Goebel Professor of Engineering, who led the research. Buildings with glass facades typically have a coating on them that reflects and absorbs some of the light, both in the visible and infrared parts of the spectrum, to reduce the brightness and heating inside the building. Rather than throwing that energy away, transparent solar panels could use it to take a bite out of the building’s electricity needs. The transparency of some existing windows is similar to the transparency of the solar cells Forrest’s group reports in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. “The new material we developed, and the structure of the device we built, had to balance multiple trade-offs to provide good sunlight absorption, high voltage, high current, low resistance and color-neutral transparency all at the same time,” said Yongxi Li, an assistant research scientist in electrical engineering and computer science. The new material is a combination of organic molecules engineered to be transparent in the visible and absorbing in the near infrared, an invisible part of the spectrum that accounts for much of the energy in sunlight. In addition, the researchers developed optical coatings to boost both power generated from infrared light and transparency in the visible range–two qualities that are usually in competition with one another. The color-neutral version of the device was made with an indium tin oxide electrode. A silver electrode improved the efficiency to 10.8%, with 45.8% transparency. However, that version’s slightly greenish tint may not be acceptable in some window applications. Transparent solar cells are measured by their light utilization efficiency, which describes how much energy from the light hitting the window is available either as electricity or as transmitted light on the interior side. Previous transparent solar cells have light utilization efficiencies of roughly 2-3%, but the indium tin oxide cell is rated at 3.5% and the silver version has a light utilization efficiency of 5%. Both versions can be manufactured at large scale, using materials that are less toxic than other transparent solar cells. The transparent organic solar cells can also be customized for local latitudes, taking advantage of the fact that they are most efficient when the sun’s rays are hitting them at a perpendicular angle. They can be placed in between the panes of double-glazed windows. Forrest and his team are working on several improvements to the technology, with the next goal being to reach a light utilization efficiency of 7% and extending the cell lifetime to about 10 years. They are also investigating the economics of installing transparent solar cell windows into new and existing buildings.

1678,"A small but evolving dent in Earth’s magnetic field can cause big headaches for satellites. Earth’s magnetic field acts like a protective shield around the planet, repelling and trapping charged particles from the Sun. But over South America and the southern Atlantic Ocean, an unusually weak spot in the field – called the South Atlantic Anomaly, or SAA – allows these particles to dip closer to the surface than normal. Particle radiation in this region can knock out onboard computers and interfere with the data collection of satellites that pass through it – a key reason why NASA scientists want to track and study the anomaly. The South Atlantic Anomaly is also of interest to NASA’s Earth scientists who monitor the changes in magnetic field strength there, both for how such changes affect Earth’s atmosphere and as an indicator of what’s happening to Earth’s magnetic fields, deep inside the globe. Currently, the SAA creates no visible impacts on daily life on the surface. However, recent observations and forecasts show that the region is expanding westward and continuing to weaken in intensity. It is also splitting – recent data shows the anomaly’s valley, or region of minimum field strength, has split into two lobes, creating additional challenges for satellite missions. A host of NASA scientists in geomagnetic, geophysics, and heliophysics research groups observe and model the SAA, to monitor and predict future changes – and help prepare for future challenges to satellites and humans in space. Earth’s magnetic field acts like a protective shield around the planet, repelling and trapping charged particles from the Sun. But over South America and the southern Atlantic Ocean, an unusually weak spot in the field – called the South Atlantic Anomaly, or SAA – allows these particles to dip closer to the surface than normal.

The South Atlantic Anomaly is also of interest to NASA’s Earth scientists who monitor the changes in magnetic strength there, both for how such changes affect Earth’s atmosphere and as an indicator of what’s happening to Earth’s magnetic fields, deep inside the globe. Credit: NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center It’s what’s inside that counts The South Atlantic Anomaly arises from two features of Earth’s core: The tilt of its magnetic axis, and the flow of molten metals within its outer core. Earth is a bit like a bar magnet, with north and south poles that represent opposing magnetic polarities and invisible magnetic field lines encircling the planet between them. But unlike a bar magnet, the core magnetic field is not perfectly aligned through the globe, nor is it perfectly stable. That’s because the field originates from Earth’s outer core: molten, iron-rich and in vigorous motion 1800 miles below the surface. These churning metals act like a massive generator, called the geodynamo, creating electric currents that produce the magnetic field. As the core motion changes over time, due to complex geodynamic conditions within the core and at the boundary with the solid mantle up above, the magnetic field fluctuates in space and time too. These dynamical processes in the core ripple outward to the magnetic field surrounding the planet, generating the SAA and other features in the near-Earth environment – including the tilt and drift of the magnetic poles, which are moving over time. These evolutions in the field, which happen on a similar time scale to the convection of metals in the outer core, provide scientists with new clues to help them unravel the core dynamics that drive the geodynamo. “The magnetic field is actually a superposition of fields from many current sources,” said Terry Sabaka, a geophysicist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. Regions outside of the solid Earth also contribute to the observed magnetic field. However, he said, the bulk of the field comes from the core. The forces in the core and the tilt of the magnetic axis together produce the anomaly, the area of weaker magnetism – allowing charged particles trapped in Earth’s magnetic field to dip closer to the surface. When solar material streams strikes Earth’s magnetosphere, it can become trapped and held in two donut-shaped belts around the planet called the Van Allen Belts. The belts restrain the particles to travel along Earth’s magnetic field lines, continually bouncing back and forth from pole to pole. The Sun expels a constant outflow of particles and magnetic fields known as the solar wind and vast clouds of hot plasma and radiation called coronal mass ejections. When this solar material streams across space and strikes Earth’s magnetosphere, the space occupied by Earth’s magnetic field, it can become trapped and held in two donut-shaped belts around the planet called the Van Allen Belts. The belts restrain the particles to travel along Earth’s magnetic field lines, continually bouncing back and forth from pole to pole. The innermost belt begins about 400 miles from the surface of Earth, which keeps its particle radiation a healthy distance from Earth and its orbiting satellites. However, when a particularly strong storm of particles from the Sun reaches Earth, the Van Allen belts can become highly energized and the magnetic field can be deformed, allowing the charged particles to penetrate the atmosphere. “The observed SAA can be also interpreted as a consequence of weakening dominance of the dipole field in the region,” said Weijia Kuang, a geophysicist and mathematician in Goddard’s Geodesy and Geophysics Laboratory. “More specifically, a localized field with reversed polarity grows strongly in the SAA region, thus making the field intensity very weak, weaker than that of the surrounding regions.” A pothole in space Although the South Atlantic Anomaly arises from processes inside Earth, it has effects that reach far beyond Earth’s surface. The region can be hazardous for low-Earth orbit satellites that travel through it. If a satellite is hit by a high-energy proton, it can short-circuit and cause an event called single event upset or SEU. This can cause the satellite’s function to glitch temporarily or can cause permanent damage if a key component is hit. In order to avoid losing instruments or an entire satellite, operators commonly shut down non-essential components as they pass through the SAA. Indeed, NASA’s Ionospheric Connection Explorer regularly travels through the region and so the mission keeps constant tabs on the SAA’s position. The International Space Station, which is in low-Earth orbit, also passes through the SAA. It is well protected, and astronauts are safe from harm while inside. However, the ISS has other passengers affected by the higher radiation levels: Instruments like the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation mission, or GEDI, collect data from various positions on the outside of the ISS. The SAA causes “blips” on GEDI’s detectors and resets the instrument’s power boards about once a month, said Bryan Blair, the mission’s deputy principal investigator and instrument scientist, and a lidar instrument scientist at Goddard. The Sun expels a constant outflow of particles and magnetic fields known as the solar wind and vast clouds of hot plasma and radiation called coronal mass ejections. This solar material streams across space and strikes Earth’s magnetosphere, the space occupied by Earth’s magnetic field, which acts like a protective shield around the planet. “These events cause no harm to GEDI,” Blair said. “The detector blips are rare compared to the number of laser shots – about one blip in a million shots – and the reset line event causes a couple of hours of lost data, but it only happens every month or so.” In addition to measuring the SAA’s magnetic field strength, NASA scientists have also studied the particle radiation in the region with the Solar, Anomalous, and Magnetospheric Particle Explorer, or SAMPEX – the first of NASA’s Small Explorer missions, launched in 1992 and providing observations until 2012. One study, led by NASA heliophysicist Ashley Greeley as part of her doctoral thesis, used two decades of data from SAMPEX to show that the SAA is slowly but steadily drifting in a northwesterly direction. The results helped confirm models created from geomagnetic measurements and showed how the SAA’s location changes as the geomagnetic field evolves. “These particles are intimately associated with the magnetic field, which guides their motions,” said Shri Kanekal, a researcher in the Heliospheric Physics Laboratory at NASA Goddard. “Therefore, any knowledge of particles gives you information on the geomagnetic field as well.” Greeley’s results, published in the journal Space Weather, were also able to provide a clear picture of the type and amount of particle radiation satellites receive when passing through the SAA, which emphasized the need for continuing monitoring in the region. The information Greeley and her collaborators garnered from SAMPEX’s in-situ measurements has also been useful for satellite design. Engineers for the Low-Earth Orbit, or LEO, satellite used the results to design systems that would prevent a latch-up event from causing failure or loss of the spacecraft. Modeling a safer future for satellites In order to understand how the SAA is changing and to prepare for future threats to satellites and instruments, Sabaka, Kuang and their colleagues use observations and physics to contribute to global models of Earth’s magnetic field. The team assesses the current state of the magnetic field using data from the European Space Agency’s Swarm constellation, previous missions from agencies around the world, and ground measurements. Sabaka’s team teases apart the observational data to separate out its source before passing it on to Kuang’s team. They combine the sorted data from Sabaka’s team with their core dynamics model to forecast geomagnetic secular variation (rapid changes in the magnetic field) into the future. The geodynamo models are unique in their ability to use core physics to create near-future forecasts, said Andrew Tangborn, a mathematician in Goddard’s Planetary Geodynamics Laboratory.“This is similar to how weather forecasts are produced, but we are working with much longer time scales,” he said. “This is the fundamental difference between what we do at Goddard and most other research groups modeling changes in Earth’s magnetic field.” One such application that Sabaka and Kuang have contributed to is the International Geomagnetic Reference Field, or IGRF. Used for a variety of research from the core to the boundaries of the atmosphere, the IGRF is a collection of candidate models made by worldwide research teams that describe Earth’s magnetic field and track how it changes in time. “Even though the SAA is slow-moving, it is going through some change in morphology, so it’s also important that we keep observing it by having continued missions,” Sabaka said. “Because that’s what helps us make models and predictions.” The changing SAA provides researchers new opportunities to understand Earth’s core, and how its dynamics influence other aspects of the Earth system, said Kuang. By tracking this slowly evolving “dent” in the magnetic field, researchers can better understand the way our planet is changing and help prepare for a safer future for satellites.",NASA Tracking Slowly Splitting “Dent” in Earth’s Magnetic Field – Could Cause Big Headaches for Satellites,4,0.10248681602567233
1679,"Deep inside the brain the putamen, not just the cortex, contributes to multitasking ability. Multitasking performance stems from the speed of information exchange between inner and outer regions of the brain, according to new research in eNeuro. Doing two things at once courts disaster, as multitasking requires outer cortical brain regions to rapidly communicate with each other. The speed of this information exchange limits multitasking capability yet can improve with practice. But that’s not the whole story: multitasking also depends on the striatum, a previously overlooked region deep inside the brain. Proposed model for the modulatory influence of multitasking. Garner et al. compared the brain activity of 100 healthy adults before and after a week of multitasking practice. The participants completed two different tasks, first separately and then at the same time. The putamen — a brain region in the striatum involved in habitual behavior — and two cortical regions were activated by the tasks separately and increased activity during multitasking. After testing a variety of potential models, the research team found that multitasking ability hinged on how effectively the putamen could exchange information with the cortical areas. A week of practice improved the participant’s task performance in concert with an increase in communication rates between the putamen and the cortex.",Deep Inside the Brain: Neuroscientists Discover the Missing Piece of the Brain’s Multitasking Network,4,0.5152291321320495
1680,"Cosmic gas cloud blinks in sync with circling black hole. Scientists have detected a mysterious gamma-ray heartbeat coming from a cosmic gas cloud. The inconspicuous cloud in the constellation Aquila is beating with the rhythm of a neighboring precessing black hole, indicating a connection between the two objects, as the team led by DESY Humboldt Fellow Jian Li and ICREA Professor Diego F. Torres from the Institute of Space Sciences (IEEC-CSIC) reports in the journal Nature Astronomy. Just how the black hole powers the cloud’s gamma-ray heartbeat over a distance of about 100 light years remains enigmatic. The research team, comprising scientists from Germany, Spain, China and the U.S., rigorously analyzed more than ten years of data from the US space administration NASA’s Fermi gamma-ray space telescope, looking at a so-called micro quasar. The system cataloged as SS 433 is located some 15 000 lightyears away in the Milky Way and consists of a giant star with about 30 times the mass of our sun and a black hole with about 10 to 20 solar masses. The two objects are orbiting each other with a period of 13 days, while the black hole sucks matter from the giant star. “This material accumulates in an accretion disc before falling into the black hole, like water in the whirl above the drain of a bathtub,” explains Li. “However, a part of that matter does not fall down the drain but shoots out at high speed in two narrow jets in opposite directions above and below the rotating accretion disk.” This setting is known from active galaxies called quasars with monstrous black holes with millions of solar masses at their centers that shoot jets tens of thousands of lightyears into the cosmos. As SS 433 looks like a scaled-down version of these quasars, it has been dubbed a micro quasar. The microquasar SS 433 consists of a black hole and a giant star orbiting each other, with the black hole constantly sucking matter from the star. This matter collects on an accretion disk before falling into the black hole. However, some of the matter does not fall into the black hole, but is hurled out into space in two narrow jets at the top and bottom. As the accretion disk does not lie exactly in the orbital plane of the two partners, it sways like a spinning top set at an angle, and with it the jets do so as well, describe spirals in space. In the same rhythm as the tumbling jets and accretion disk, an inconspicuous gas cloud about 100 light years away shines in the light of the gamma radiation. This temporal correspondence suggests a direct connection, but it is not clear exactly how the microquasar drives the gamma-ray “heartbeat” of the gas cloud. The high-speed particles and the ultra-strong magnetic fields in the jet produce X-rays and gamma rays. “The accretion disc does not lie exactly in the plane of the orbit of the two objects. It precesses, or sways, like a spinning top that has been set up slanted on a table,” says Torres. “As a consequence, the two jets spiral into the surrounding space, rather than just forming a straight line.” The precession of the black hole’s jets has a period of about 162 days. Meticulous analysis revealed a gamma-ray signal with the same period from a position located relatively far from the micro quasar’s jets, which has been labeled as Fermi J1913+0515 by the scientists. It is located at the position of an unremarkable gas enhancement. The consistent periods indicate the gas cloud’s emission is powered by the micro quasar. “Finding such an unambiguous connection via timing, about 100 light years away from the micro quasar, not even along the direction of the jets is as unexpected as amazing,” says Li. “But how the black hole can power the gas cloud’s heartbeat is unclear to us.” Direct periodic illumination by the jet seems unlikely. An alternative that the team explored is based on the impact of fast protons (the nuclei of hydrogen atoms) produced at the ends of the jets or near the black hole, and injected into the cloud, where these subatomic particles hit the gas and produce gamma rays. Protons could also be part of an outflow of fast particles from the edge of the accretion disc. Whenever this outflow strikes the gas cloud, it lights up in gamma rays, which would explain its strange heartbeat. “Energetically, the outflow from the disc could be as powerful as that of the jets and is believed to precess in solidarity with the rest of the system,” explains Torres. Further observations as well as theoretical work are required to fully explain the strange gamma-ray heartbeat of this unique system beyond this initial discovery. “SS 433 continues to amaze observers at all frequencies and theoreticians alike,” emphasizes Li. “And it is certain to provide a testbed for our ideas on cosmic-ray production and propagation near micro quasars for years to come.”",Mysterious Gamma-Ray Heartbeat Coming From Cosmic Gas Cloud Leaves Scientists Baffled – “As Unexpected as Amazing”,4,0.5113284003962864
1681,"The human brain efficiently executes highly sophisticated tasks, such as image and speech recognition, with an exceptionally lower energy budget than today’s computers can. The development of energy-efficient and tunable artificial neurons capable of emulating brain-inspired processes has, therefore, been a major research goal for decades. Researchers at the University of Gothenburg and Tohoku University jointly reported on an important experimental advance in this direction, demonstrating a novel voltage-controlled spintronic microwave oscillator capable of closely imitating the non-linear oscillatory neural networks of the human brain. The research team developed a voltage-controlled spintronic oscillator, whose properties can be strongly tuned, with negligible energy consumption. “This is an important breakthrough as these so-called spin Hall nano-oscillators (SHNOs) can act as interacting oscillator-based neurons but have so far lacked an energy-efficient tuning scheme — an essential prerequisite to train the neural networks for cognitive neuromorphic tasks,” proclaimed Shunsuke Fukami, co-author of the study. “The expansion of the developed technology can also drive the tuning of the synaptic interactions between each pair of spintronic neurons in a large complex oscillatory neural network.” Scanning electron microscopy image and schematic of cross-sectional structure of the created spin-Hall nano-oscillator device with the gate electrode. Earlier this year, the Johan Åkerman group at the University of Gothenburg demonstrated, for the first time, 2D mutually synchronized arrays accommodating 100 SHNOs while occupying an area of less than a square micron. The network can mimic neuron interactions in our brain and carry out cognitive tasks. However, a major bottleneck in training such artificial neurons to produce different responses to different inputs has been the lack of the scheme to control individual oscillator inside such networks. The Johan Åkerman group teamed up with Hideo Ohno and Shunsuke Fukami at Tohoku University to develop a bow tie-shaped spin Hall nano-oscillator made from an ultrathin W/CoFeB/MgO material stack with an added functionality of a voltage controlled gate over the oscillating region [Fig. 1]. Using an effect called voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy (VCMA), the magnetic and magnetodynamic properties of CoFeB ferromagnet, consisting of a few atomic layers, can be directly controlled to modify the microwave frequency, amplitude, damping, and, thus, the threshold current of the SHNO [Fig. 2]. Experimental result of oscillation property under various gate voltages. Red and yellow regions mean a strong oscillation taking place. One can see that the oscillation property changes with the gate voltage. The researchers also found a giant modulation of SHNO damping up to 42% using voltages from -3 to +1 V in the bow-tied geometry. The demonstrated approach is, therefore, capable of independently turning individual oscillators on/off within a large synchronized oscillatory network driven by a single global drive current. The findings are also valuable since they reveal a new mechanism of energy relaxation in patterned magnetic nanostructures. Fukami notes that “With readily available energy-efficient independent control of the dynamical state of individual spintronic neurons, we hope to efficiently train large SHNO networks to carry out complex neuromorphic tasks and scale up oscillator-based neuromorphic computing schemes to much larger network sizes.” Collaboration between Tohoku University and the University of Gothenburg will continue to strengthen as Tohoku University has recently joined the Sweden-Japan collaborative network MIRAI 2.0, a project that aims to enhance research collaborations between Swedish and Japanese universities.",Energy-Efficient Tuning of Spintronic Neurons to Imitate the Non-linear Oscillatory Neural Networks of the Human Brain,4,0.12972492942256642
1682,"Scientists demonstrate new method of producing a specific class of organic compounds, which promises to accelerate drug discovery research for several diseases. Several drugs, including those for depression, schizophrenia, and malaria, would not be if not for a type of organic chemical compound called alicyclic compounds. These compounds are 3D structures formed when three or more carbon atoms join in a ring via covalent bonds, but the ring is not aromatic. Aromatic compounds (or arenes) are another class of organic compounds which are 2D structures with reactive properties distinct from those of alicyclic compounds. A well-known example is benzene, the six-carbon ring comprising alternating single- and double-bonds between the carbon atoms. By dearomatizing arenes, one can get alicyclic compounds. In fact, this dearomatization is one of the most powerful ways of obtaining alicyclic compounds. But some of the most abundantly available arenes, such as benzene and naphthalene, are very stable, and breaking them up to construct alicyclic compounds has been challenging. With existing methods, often large amounts of reactants yield very little product. “The highly efficient conversion of readily and commercially available arenes to high value-added alicyclic compounds could accelerate drug discovery research by leaps,” say Assistant Professor Kei Muto and Professor Junichiro Yamaguchi of Waseda University, Japan, who led the discovery of a novel efficient method. Their study is published in the Royal Society of Chemistry’s Chemical Science. In the novel method, bromoarenes are reacted with two other classes of organic compounds, diazo compounds and malonates, in the presence of a palladium catalyst (compound that enables a chemical reaction), under optimal conditions of concentration, temperature, and time (experimentally ascertained in the study). Subsequently, good amounts of the corresponding alicyclic compounds are produced. “What is really special about this method is that a range of bromoarenes, including benzenoids, azines, and heteroles, can be converted to their alicyclic counterparts,” Muto says. He speaks also of the key portions of an alicyclic molecule that give it complexity and utility–the functional groups attached to the cyclic carbons. He says, “The obtained compounds have functional groups at two points in the cyclic chain, and these can be easily diversified through further reactions to yield a variety of highly functionalized 3D molecules.” The use of malonates as reactant is what allows this multi-functionalization, setting this novel method apart from existing methods, which are often highly specific in terms of the products possible. Because malonates are known to predominantly react with palladium-benzyl complexes, the use of a palladium-based catalyst became key to the success of this method. The palladium catalyst led to the formation of a benzyl-palladium intermediate that could then react with malonates, producing the final multi-functionalized alicyclic products. Thus, designing an appropriate catalysis process was essential to developing the aromatic-to-alicyclic transformation technique. “Next, we would like to design new catalysts to make this reaction more general; that is, compatible with a broader range of arenes,” says Yamaguchi. With their future plans in place, Muto and Yamaguchi are confident of the good that their team’s work can do in the world: “We believe this organic reaction will help drug discovery research finally ‘escape from the flatland’ of the simpler and 2D aromatic compounds, so to speak, thereby advancing medicinal chemistry significantly.”",Efficiently Creating “Building Blocks” of Pharmaceuticals to Accelerate Drug Discovery Research,4,0.9225410152101894
1683,"In research published in Science Advances, a group led by scientists from the RIKEN Center for Emergent Matter Science (CEMS) have used a principle, “magneto-rotation coupling,” to suppress the transmission of sound waves on the surface of a film in one direction while allowing them to travel in the other. This could lead to the development of “acoustic rectifiers”—devices that allow waves to propagate preferentially in one direction, with potential applications in communications technology. Devices known as “rectifiers,” are extremely important for our technological civilization. The best known are electronic diodes, which are used to convert AC into DC electricity, essentially making electrification possible. Schematics of the magneto-rotation coupling. In the current study, the group examined the movement of acoustic surface waves—movements of sound like the propagation of earthquakes over the surface of the earth—in a magnetic film. It is known that there is a interplay between the surface acoustic waves and “spin waves”—disturbances in magnetic fields within the material that can move through the material. Acoustic surface waves can excite spin waves in two different ways. One, magneto-elastic coupling, is very well documented. However, a second, magneto-rotation coupling, was proposed more than forty years ago by Sadamichi Maekawa, one of the authors of the current study, but was not experimentally verified until now. In the current study, the authors found that the two mechanisms occur at the same time but under different intensities. They found that when the magnetization of the magnetic specimen is rotating in the same direction of the surface acoustic waves, the energy of the acoustic surface waves is more efficiently transferred to the spin waves, increasing the rotation of the magnetization. In fact, the researchers were able to identify a configuration of unidirectional coupling where only the energy of surface acoustic waves in one direction could be transferred to the rotation of the magnetization. They also noticed that this “rectification” effect was more pronounced when the magnetic material contained magnetic anisotropy, meaning there was a preferred direction of internal magnetization even before the application of an external magnetic field. Nonreciprocal propagation of acousto-magnetic waves in Ta/CoFeB/MgO.  According to Mingran Xu of RIKEN CEMS, the first author of the paper, “It was very exciting to show that the phenomenon of magneto-rotation coupling actually takes place, and that it can be used to completely suppress the movement of acoustic energy in one direction.” Jorge Puebla, also of RIKEN CEMS, says, “We hope that we can use this work to create an “acoustic diode” equivalent to the electronic diodes that are so important. We could relatively easily make a device where the acoustic energy is efficiently transfer in one direction but blocked in the other. This is happening at microwave frequencies, which is the range of interest for 5G communication technology, so surface acoustic waves may be an interesting candidate for this technology.”",Scientists Design “Acoustic Diode” – Device Would Allow Sound Waves to Propagate in Only One Direction,4,0.9785034275373752

1685,"An immunomodulatory drug called fingolimod, which is approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, blocks human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and transmission in human immune cells, according to a study published today (August 13, 2020) in the open-access journal PLOS Pathogens by Postdoctoral Fellow Rachel Resop and Assistant Professor Alberto Bosque of The George Washington University, and colleagues. Although future studies in animals and humans are needed, these preliminary findings suggest that this compound may be a promising novel therapy for HIV treatment and prevention. Nearly 40 million people worldwide currently live with HIV. Treatment of infection is lifelong, due to the ability of the virus to establish latency by integrating its genome into that of host cells, resulting in potential viral reactivation at a future time. By establishing latency, HIV evades eradication by host defense mechanisms and drug treatment. HIV is currently managed by antiretroviral drugs, which do not specifically target latent infection, may have side effects, and are of limited use in preventing transmission of the virus between individuals. For this reason, the discovery of novel strategies to target HIV infection and latency is crucial. Bosque and colleagues investigated an alternative tactic to combat HIV infection by targeting Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptors– a component of the immune system involved in the progression of infection. To do so, they focused on FTY720 (fingolimod) – a well-tolerated drug that blocks the action of S1P receptors and is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. They found that FTY720 blocks HIV infection in human immune cells called CD4+ T cells by hindering multiple steps in the HIV lifecycle. For example, FTY720 reduces the density of CD4 – a protein found on the surface of T cells — thereby inhibiting viral binding and fusion. The drug blocked HIV transmission between the cells, and consequently reduced detectable latent virus. According to the authors, the role of S1P signaling in the establishment of HIV infection, and the potential to modulate this pathway to alter the course of infection or prevent establishment of the latent reservoir in CD4+ T cells, had not been previously reported. As such, targeting the S1P pathway with FTY720 could be a novel strategy to inhibit HIV replication and reduce the latent reservoir. The authors note, “These results indicate that Fingolimod merits further investigation as an exciting novel therapy for HIV.”","Drug, Already Approved to Treat Multiple Sclerosis, Blocks HIV Infection and Transmission in Human Immune Cells",8,0.003171001914415661
1686,"A compound given as a dietary supplement to overweight but otherwise healthy people in a clinical trial caused many of the patients to slim down, research by Oregon State University and Oregon Health & Science University showed. The research, published in the Journal of Nutrition, analyzed the effects of 24 weeks of daily, 600-milligram doses of lipoic acid supplements on 31 people, with a similarly sized control group receiving a placebo. “The data clearly showed a loss in body weight and body fat in people taking lipoic acid supplements,” said Balz Frei, director emeritus of OSU’s Linus Pauling Institute and one of the scientists on the study. “Particularly in women and in the heaviest participants. Produced by both plants and animals, lipoic acid sets up shop in cells’ mitochondria, where it’s normally attached to proteins involved in energy and amino acid metabolism. A specialized, medium-chain fatty acid, it’s unique in having two sulfur atoms at one end of the chain, allowing for the transfer of electrons from other sources. The body generally produces enough lipoic acid to supply the enzymes whose proper function requires it. When taken as a dietary supplement, lipoic acid displays additional properties that might be unrelated to the function in the mitochondria. They include the stimulation of glucose metabolism, antioxidant defenses, and anti-inflammatory responses – making it a possible complementary treatment for people with diabetes, heart disease, and age-related cognitive decline. “Scientists have been researching the potential health benefits of lipoic acid supplements for decades, including how it might enhance healthy aging and mitigate cardiovascular disease,” said Alexander Michels, another Linus Pauling Institute scientist involved with the study. “In both rodent models and small-scale human clinical trials, researchers at the LPI have demonstrated the beneficial effects of lipoic acid on oxidative stress, lipid metabolism, and circadian rhythm.” The OSU/OHSU project addressed two issues commonly ignored by previous human trials, said Tory Hagen, a professor of biochemistry and biophysics in the OSU College of Science and the study’s corresponding author. “Many existing clinical studies using lipoic acid have focused on volunteers with pre-existing conditions like diabetes, making it difficult to determine if lipoic acid supplements simply act as a disease treatment or have other beneficial health effects,” said Hagen, principal investigator and Helen P. Rumbel Professor for Healthy Aging Research at the institute. “Another issue is the formulation of the supplement. Many previous studies have used the S form of lipoic acid, which is a product of industrial synthesis and not found in nature. We only used the R form of lipoic acid – the form found in the body naturally.” Contrary to what was expected by the researchers, decreased levels of triglycerides – a type of fat, or lipid, found in the blood – were not seen in all the participants taking lipoic acid. “The effect of lipoic acid supplements on blood lipids was limited,” said Gerd Bobe, another LPI scientist who collaborated on the study. “But people who lost weight on lipoic acid also reduced their blood triglyceride levels – that effect was clear.” Other effects of the lipoic acid supplements were measurable as well. “By the end of the study, some markers of inflammation declined,” Hagen said. “The findings also suggest that lipoic acid supplementation provides a mild reduction in oxidative stress. It is not a perfect panacea, but our results show that lipoic acid supplements can be beneficial.” Identifying which patients will benefit the most from lipoic acid supplementation, and how much they need, is important for both clinical and economic reasons, he added. “Lipoic acid supplements are often quite expensive,” he said. “So understanding how we can maximize benefits with smaller amounts of the supplement is something we are interested in pursuing.”",Lipoic Acid Supplements Help Overweight People Lose Weight in Clinical Trial,8,0.0617972941915782
1687,"NIH-funded clinical trial provides independent evidence that multifocal contact lenses reduce worsening myopia. Children wearing multifocal contact lenses had slower progression of their myopia, according to results from a clinical trial funded by the National Eye Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health. The findings support an option for controlling the condition, also called nearsightedness, which increases the risk of cataracts, glaucoma and retinal detachment later in life. Investigators of the Bifocal Lenses In Nearsighted Kids (BLINK) Study published the results on August 11, 2020, in JAMA. “It is especially good news to know that children as young as 7 achieved optimal visual acuity and got used to wearing multifocal lenses much the way they would a single vision contact lens. It’s not a problem to fit younger kids in contact lenses. It’s a safe practice,” said BLINK study chair, Jeffrey J. Walline, O.D., Ph.D., associate dean for research at the Ohio State University College of Optometry Myopia occurs when a child’s developing eyes grow too long from front to back. Instead of focusing images on the retina—the light-sensitive tissue in the back of the eye—images of distant objects are focused at a point in front of the retina. As a result, people with myopia have good near vision but poor distance vision. Single vision prescription glasses and contact lenses are used to correct myopic vision but fail to treat the underlying problem. Multifocal contact lenses – typically used to improve near vision of people over the age of 40 years – correct myopic vision in children while simultaneously slowing myopia progression by slowing eye growth. Shaped like a bullseye, the soft multifocal contact lenses have two basic portions for focusing light. The center portion of the lens corrects nearsightedness so that distance vision is clear, and it focuses light directly on the retina. The outer portion of the lens adds focusing power to bring the peripheral light rays into focus in front of the retina. Animal studies show that bringing light to focus in front of the retina cues the eye to slow growth. The higher the power added, the further in front of the retina it focuses peripheral light. By comparison, single vision glasses and standard contact lenses focus peripheral light to a point behind the retina, which prompts the eye to keep growing. The researchers examined whether high-add power contact lenses provided better slowing of myopia progression and eye growth than medium-add power contact lenses. They found that only the high-add power contact lenses produced meaningful slowing of eye growth. In addition to multifocal lenses, other myopia control options include orthokeratology contact lenses, which are worn overnight to reshape the cornea, or low-dose atropine eye drops used at bedtime. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved one lens for myopia control in November 2019, but multifocal contact lenses have been used off-label to slow myopia progression for many years. Myopia has surged in prevalence over the past five decades. In 1971, 25% of Americans were myopic, compared to 33% in 2004. By 2050, the worldwide prevalence of myopia is projected to be 54%, and the prevalence of high myopia, the most severe form, is projected to increase to 10%. High myopia means that a person’s vision requires at least -5.00 diopters, the unit of focusing power correction required to optimize distance vision. Reasons for the spike are unclear, but evidence suggests that near work, such as screen time, and shrinking outdoor time during early eye development are contributing factors. Genetic factors also play a role in one’s predisposition to become myopic. There are no tests to identify which individuals with myopia will progress to high myopia, but the younger a child is affected, the more opportunity their myopia has to progress if there is no intervention to slow it. Study participants were 287 myopic children, ages 7 to 11 years. At baseline, the children required -0.75 to -5.00 diopters of correction to achieve clear distance vision. The children were randomly assigned to wear single vision contact lenses or multifocal lenses, the outer lens of which were either high-add power (+2.50 diopters) or medium-add power (+1.50 diopters). They wore the lenses during the day as often as they could comfortably do so. All participants were seen at clinics at the Ohio State University, Columbus, or University of Houston. After three years, children in the high-add multifocal contact lens group had the slowest progression of their myopia. Mean myopia progression, as measured by changes in the eye prescription required to correct distance vision, was -0.60 diopters for the high-add group, -0.89 diopters for the medium-add group, and -1.05 diopters for the single vision group. The multifocal lenses also slowed eye growth. The three-year adjusted eye growth was .42 mm for the high add group, .58 mm for the medium add group, and .66 mm for the single vision group. “Greater amounts of myopia and longer eyes are associated with increased prevalence of eye conditions that can lead to visual impairment. Our study shows that eye care practitioners should fit children with high-add power multifocal contact lenses in order to maximize myopia control and the slowing of eye growth,” said principal investigator, David A. Berntsen, O.D., Ph.D., associate professor and Golden-Golden professor of optometry at the University of Houston.. “Compared with single vision contact lenses, multifocal lenses slow myopia progression by about 43% over three years.” “There is a clear benefit from multifocal lenses at three years, but further study is needed to determine the ideal duration for wearing the lenses. Researchers will need determine how permanent the prevention of myopia progression will be once children stop wearing the multifocal lenses,” said Lisa A. Jones-Jordan, Ph.D., principal investigator of the Data Coordinating Center at the Ohio State University. A follow-up study is underway to see if the benefits hold among children in this study when they go off treatment. “We also need more information about the exact nature of the visual signals that slow eye growth. If we understood that process better, perhaps we could maximize it to have an even stronger treatment effect,” said principal investigator, Donald O. Mutti, O.D., Ph.D., the E.F. Wildermuth Foundation professor of optometry at Ohio State. Multifocal lenses tested in the study are available from CooperVision.

1688,"To date, Congress has authorized roughly $3 trillion in COVID-19 relief assistance — the largest relief package in history. With more COVID relief money on the way, a new study led by two Brigham Young University business professors finds these newly available funds led to a significant surge in health sector lobbying activity, especially within the pharmaceutical industry. The research, publishing Wednesday, August 12, in the Journal of General Internal Medicine, finds the lobbying expenditures ($248.4 million) and new lobbyist registrations (357) of the health sector represented nearly a fourth of all lobbying activity, across all industries, in the first quarter of 2020. “This is like sharks to blood, or bees to honey, if you prefer a milder metaphor,” said study author Bill Tayler, an accounting professor in the BYU Marriott School of Business. “Congress is giving out a lot of money, so the lobbyists are swarming. Lobbying activity levels are typically fairly stable, so when you see jumps like this, it’s a big deal.” According to the analysis, health sector lobbying spending increased more than 10% in Q1 of 2020 while non-health sector increased only 1%. Meanwhile, the number of new lobbyists registered in the health sector increased a staggering 140% while non-health sector registrations increased only 63%. The BYU researchers, in collaboration with colleagues from Johns Hopkins University, Columbia University, and the University of Cincinnati, found that across all segments of health sector lobbying, the biggest lobbying increases came from the pharmaceutical industry. Indeed, 16 of the top 30 healthcare organizations in lobbyist expenditures were pharmaceuticals. For example, Novartis International increased their lobbying expenditures by 259% this year, AbbVie Inc. increased theirs by 155% and Biogen Inc. increased their expenditures by a whopping 344%. The organization with the highest lobbying expenditures by far was Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), a non-profit trade association largely sponsored by pharmaceutical companies, spending $11.5 million in the first quarter of 2020. “This is the largest stimulus bill in history,” said study coauthor John Barrick, a fellow accounting professor at BYU and expert on lobbying policy. “It’s important to follow the money. Dollars spent on lobbying influence the allocation of funds and, right or wrong, I think that’s what people need to know.” The data shows Big Pharma has had a very loud voice as Congress has tried to allocate funds to small businesses, the unemployed, healthcare, and more. Overall, the top 30 healthcare organizations (16 of which were pharmaceutical organizations) spent almost $100 million on lobbying in Q1 of 2020, which represented a 55% increase in lobbying spending over Q4 of 2019. The authors said the results of the study illustrate just how much the health sector and others are willing to invest to influence Congress’ appropriation and allocation of funds. “The return on investment on a dollar of lobbying appears much higher than a dollar of R&D,” said study coauthor Shivaram Rajgopal, a professor of accounting and auditing at Columbia Business School.

1689,"“The idea had been going around my head for about 15 years, but I never had the time or the resources to do anything about it.” But now Luc Thévenaz, the head of the Fiber Optics Group in EPFL’s School of Engineering, has finally made it happen: his lab has developed a technology to amplify light inside the latest hollow-core optical fibers. Squaring the circle Today’s optical fibers usually have a solid glass core, so there’s no air inside. Light can travel along the fibers but loses half of its intensity after 15 kilometers. It keeps weakening until it can hardly be detected at 300 kilometers. So to keep the light moving, it has to be amplified at regular intervals. Thévenaz’s approach is based on new hollow-core optical fibers that are filled with either air or gas. “The air means there’s less attenuation, so the light can travel over a longer distance. That’s a real advantage,” says the professor. But in a thin substance like air, the light is harder to amplify. “That’s the crux of the problem: light travels faster when there’s less resistance, but at the same time it’s harder to act on. Luckily, our discovery has squared that circle.” From infrared to ultraviolet So what did the researchers do? “We just added pressure to the air in the fiber to give us some controlled resistance,” explains Fan Yang, postdoctoral student. “It works in a similar way to optical tweezers — the air molecules are compressed and form into regularly spaced clusters. This creates a sound wave that increases in amplitude and effectively diffracts the light from a powerful source towards the weakened beam so that it is amplified up to 100,000 times.” Their technique therefore makes the light considerably more powerful. “Our technology can be applied to any type of light, from infrared to ultraviolet, and to any gas,” he explains. Their findings have just been published in Nature Photonics. An extremely accurate thermometer Going forward, the technology could serve other purposes in addition to light amplification. Hollow-core or compressed-gas optical fibers could, for instance, be used to make extremely accurate thermometers. “We’ll be able to measure temperature distribution at any point along the fiber. So if a fire starts along a tunnel, we’ll know exactly where it began based on the increased temperature at a given point,” says Flavien Gyger, PhD student. The technology could also be used to create a temporary optical memory by stopping the light in the fiber for a microsecond — that’s ten times longer than is currently possible.",Using Air to Amplify Light in Hollow-Core Optical Fibers,4,0.0661665950344017
1690,"Bath scientists take an important step towards understanding the interaction between layers of atomically thin materials arranged in stacks. Scientists at the University of Bath have taken an important step towards understanding the interaction between layers of atomically thin materials arranged in stacks. They hope their research will speed up the discovery of new, artificial materials, leading to the design of electronic components that are far tinier and more efficient than anything known today. Smaller is always better in the world of electronic circuitry, but there’s a limit to how far you can shrink a silicon component without it overheating and falling apart, and we’re close to reaching it. The researchers are investigating a group of atomically thin materials that can be assembled into stacks. The properties of any final material depend both on the choice of raw materials and on the angle at which one layer is arranged on top of another. Dr. Marcin Mucha-Kruczynski who led the research from the Department of Physics, said: “We’ve found a way to determine how strongly atoms in different layers of a stack are coupled to each other, and we’ve demonstrated the application of our idea to a structure made of graphene layers. The Bath research, published in Nature Communications, is based on earlier work into graphene – a crystal characterized by thin sheets of carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb design. In 2018, scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) found that when two layers of graphene are stacked and then twisted relative to each other by the ‘magic’ angle of 1.1°, they produce a material with superconductive properties. This was the first time scientists had created a super-conducting material made purely from carbon. However, these properties disappeared with the smallest change of angle between the two layers of graphene. Since the MIT discovery, scientists around the world have been attempting to apply this ‘stacking and twisting’ phenomenon to other ultra-thin materials, placing together two or more atomically different structures in the hope of forming entirely new materials with special qualities. “In nature, you can’t find materials where each atomic layer is different,” said Dr. Mucha-Kruczynski. “What’s more, two materials can normally only be put together in one specific fashion because chemical bonds need to form between layers. But for materials like graphene, only the chemical bonds between atoms on the same plane are strong. The forces between planes – known as van der Waals interactions – are weak, and this allows for layers of material to be twisted with respect to each other.” The challenge for scientists now is to make the process of discovering new, layered materials as efficient as possible. By finding a formula that allows them to predict the outcome when two or more materials are stacked, they will be able to streamline their research enormously. It is in this area that Dr. Mucha-Kruczynski and his collaborators at the University of Oxford, Peking University and ELETTRA Synchrotron in Italy expect to make a difference. “The number of combinations of materials and the number of angles at which they can be twisted is too large to try out in the lab, so what we can predict is important,” said Dr. Mucha-Kruczynski. The researchers have shown that the interaction between two layers can be determined by studying a three-layer structure where two layers are assembled as you might find in nature, while the third is twisted. They used angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy – a process in which powerful light ejects electrons from the sample so that the energy and momentum from the electrons can be measured, thus providing insight into properties of the material – to determine how strongly two carbon atoms at a given distance from each other are coupled. They have also demonstrated that their result can be used to predict properties of other stacks made of the same layers, even if the twists between layers are different. The list of known atomically thin materials like graphene is growing all the time. It already includes dozens of entries displaying a vast range of properties, from insulation to superconductivity, transparency to optical activity, brittleness to flexibility. The latest discovery provides a method for experimentally determining the interaction between layers of any of these materials. This is essential for predicting the properties of more complicated stacks and for the efficient design of new devices. Dr. Mucha-Kruczynski believes it could be 10 years before new stacked and twisted materials find a practical, everyday application. “It took a decade for graphene to move from the laboratory to something useful in the usual sense, so with a hint of optimism, I expect a similar timeline to apply to new materials,” he said. Building on the results of his latest study, Dr. Mucha-Kruczynski and his team are now focusing on twisted stacks made from layers of transition metal dichalcogenides (a large group of materials featuring two very different types of atoms – a metal and a chalcogen, such as sulfur). Some of these stacks have shown fascinating electronic behavior which the scientists are not yet able to explain. “Because we’re dealing with two radically different materials, studying these stacks is complicated,” explained Dr. Mucha-Kruczynski. “However, we’re hopeful that in time we’ll be able to predict the properties of various stacks, and design new multifunctional materials.”",Stack and Twist: Physicists Accelerate the Hunt for Revolutionary New Materials,4,0.008962288758721404
1691,"Light can sometimes play tricks on our eyes. If you look at a shiny surface, what you see will largely depend on the surrounding environment and lighting conditions. Berkeley researchers have now taken ocular distortion a step further, finding a way to imbed visual “decoys” into surfaces of objects in a way that can fool people into thinking they detect a specific image in the infrared that actually isn’t there. In a new paper published in July in the journal Advanced Materials, Junqiao Wu, UC Berkeley professor of materials science and engineering, and post-doctoral researcher Kechao Tang described a process in which they created special structures made from delicately engineered thin films of tungsten-doped vanadium dioxide. Infrared light is invisible to the human eye, but can be detected by a range of devices, such as night-vision goggles and thermal-imaging cameras. The coatings developed by Berkeley researchers can effectively tune target objects into emitting the same infrared radiation as the surrounding environment, making them invisible to infrared detection devices. But what makes the researchers’ work particularly novel is that they can manipulate the coatings in a way that a person trying to view the object with such a device would instead see a false image. “This structure offers a general platform for unprecedented manipulation and processing of infrared signals,” the researchers wrote in the paper. To create the structures, Wu and his team focused on coating objects with tungsten-doped vanadium dioxide, a substance that at certain temperatures can phase shift from an insulator, which suppresses electric conductivity, to a metal, which conducts electricity. With judicious engineering of the doping profile, the insulator-metal phase transition can even out, allowing the substance to emit a constant level of thermal radiation over wide range of temperature variations (15-70 degrees Celsius). This state of equilibrium prevents a camera from detecting the true infrared signals that an object normally emits around room temperature. Other researchers have explored concealing infrared emissions with different phase-changing materials. Previously, scientists at the University of Wisconsin at Madison experimented with samarium nickel oxide, while engineers at Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, China focused on germanium-antimony-tellurium to achieve thermal camouflage. But Berkeley researchers, backed by the National Science Foundation and the Bakar Fellows Program, say their technology represents several advancements. They grew ultra-thin layers of vanadium dioxide (less than 100 nanometers thick) on structures made from borosilicate glass and sapphire. Using pulsed lasers, researchers doped the films with different amounts of tungsten and then transferred the material onto a special adhesive tape called polyethylene (PE) film tape. The researchers say this method provides better, more consistent camouflage because the product is mechanically flexible, power free and inherently self-adaptive to temporal fluctuation as well as spatial variation of the target temperature. Additionally, by manipulating the configuration and composition of tungsten-doped vanadium dioxide on coatings applied to the PE tape, researchers can create an infrared decoy. “How we grow the material changes the image people ultimately think they see,” Wu said. In the paper, researchers described encoding the letters C-A-L onto samples that they later placed on the surface of an object. The color of the letters represents the temperature people see when viewing from an infrared camera. For example, the blue C shows it is at a constant 5 degrees Celsius, the lighter blue A at a constant 15 degrees Celsius, and the green L at a constant 25 degrees Celsius, regardless of the actual temperature of the samples. Even though the object’s actual temperature varies widely from 35-65 degrees Celsius, a person who views the object through night-vision goggles will distinctly see a colder “CAL” that is independent of the actual temperature. “We can both erase real information and create false information,” Wu said, “CAL stays cool when the environment is hot.” This kind of technology could prove useful for military and intelligence agencies, as they seek to thwart increasingly sophisticated surveillance technologies that pose a threat to national security. It might also incubate future encryption technology, allowing information to be safely concealed from unauthorized access.",Engineers Create Surface Coating With Visual “Decoys” That Can Create False Infrared Images,4,0.5379466439718743
1692,"The speed of a message traveling in these packets is no longer affected by traveling through different materials of different densities. University of Central Florida researchers have developed a new type of laser beam that doesn’t follow long-held principles about how light refracts and travels. The findings, which were published recently in Nature Photonics, could have huge implications for optical communication and laser technologies. “This new class of laser beams has unique properties that are not shared by common laser beams,” says Ayman Abouraddy, a professor in UCF’s College of Optics and Photonics and the study’s principal investigator. The beams, known as spacetime wave packets, follow different rules when they refract, that is when they pass through different materials. Normally, light slows down when it travels into a denser material. “In contrast, spacetime wave packets can be arranged to behave in the usual manner, to not change speed at all, or even to anomalously speed up in denser materials,” Abouraddy says. “As such, these pulses of light can arrive at different points in space at the same time.” “Think about how a spoon inside a water-filled glass looks broken at the point where the water and air meet,” Abouraddy says. “The speed of light in air is different from the speed of light in water. And so, the light rays wind up bending after they cross the surface between air to water, and so apparently the spoon looks bent. This is a well-known phenomenon described by Snell’s Law.” Although Snell’s Law still applies, the underlying change in velocity of the pulses is no longer applicable for the new laser beams, Abouraddy says. These abilities are counter to Fermat’s Principle that says light always travels such that it takes the shortest path, he says. “What we find here, though, is no matter how different the materials are that light passes through, there always exists one of our spacetime wave packets that could cross the interface of the two materials without changing its velocity,” Abouraddy says. “So, no matter what the properties of the medium are, it will go across the interface and continue as if it’s not there.” For communication, this means the speed of a message traveling in these packets is no longer affected by traveling through different materials of different densities. “If you think of a plane trying to communicate with two submarines at the same depth but one is far away and the other one’s close by, the one that’s farther away will incur a longer delay than the one that’s close by,” Abouraddy says. “We find that we can arrange for our pulses to propagate such that they arrive at the two submarines at the same time. In fact, now the person sending the pulse doesn’t even need to know where the submarine is, as long as they are at the same depth. All those submarines will receive the pulse at the same time so you can blindly synchronize them without knowing where they are.” Abouraddy’s research team created the spacetime wave packets by using a device known as a spatial light modulator to reorganize the energy of a pulse of light so that its properties in space and time are no longer separate. This allows them to control the “group velocity” of the pulse of light, which is roughly the speed at which the peak of the pulse travels. Previous work has shown the team’s ability to control the group velocity of the spacetime wave packets, including in optical materials. The current study built upon that work by finding they could also control the spacetime wave packets’ speed through different media. This does not contradict special relativity in any way, because it applies to the propagation of the pulse peak rather than to the underlying oscillations of the light wave. “This new field that we’re developing is a new concept for light beams,” Abouraddy says. “As a result, everything we look into using these beams reveals new behavior. All the behavior we know about light really takes tacitly an underlying presumption that its properties in space and time are separable. So, all we know in optics is based on that. It’s a built-in assumption. It’s taken to be the natural state of affairs. But now, breaking that underlying assumption, we’re starting to see new behavior all over the place.” Co-authors of the study were Basanta Bhaduri, lead author and a former research scientist with UCF’s College of Optics and Photonics, now with Bruker Nano Surfaces in California, and Murat Yessenov, a doctoral candidate in the college. Bhaduri became interested in Abouraddy’s research after reading about it in journals, such as Optics Express and Nature Photonics, and joined the professor’s research team in 2018. For the study, he helped develop the concept and designed the experiments, as well as carried out measurements and analyzed data. He says the study results are important in many ways, including the new research avenues it opens. “Space-time refraction defies our expectations derived from Fermat’s principle and offers new opportunities for molding the flow of light and other wave phenomena,” Bhaduri says. Yessenov’s roles included data analysis, derivations and simulations. He says he became interested in the work by wanting to explore more about entanglement, which in quantum systems is when two well-separated objects still have a relation to each other. “We believe that spacetime wave packets have more to offer and many more interesting effects can be unveiled using them,” Yessenov says. Abouraddy says next steps for the research include studying the interaction of these new laser beams with devices such as laser cavities and optical fibers, in addition to applying these new insights to matter rather than to light waves.",Space-Time Refraction Defies Fermat’s Principle: New Class of Laser Beam Doesn’t Follow Normal Laws of Refraction,4,0.3327113820996075
1693,"Wits Researchers have demonstrated a new quantum approach for sharing a secret amongst many parties, setting a new record for the highest dimensions and parties to date. Researchers at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa, have demonstrated a record setting quantum protocol for sharing a secret amongst many parties. The team created an 11-dimensional quantum state and used it to share a secret amongst 10 parties. By using quantum tricks, the secret can only be unlocked if the parties trust one another. The work sets a new record for the dimension of the state (which impacts on how big the secret can be) and the number of parties with whom it is shared and is an important step towards distributing information securely across many nodes in a quantum network. Laser & Photonics Reviews published online the research by the Wits team led by Professor Andrew Forbes from the School of Physics at Wits University. In their paper titled: Experimental Demonstration of 11-Dimensional 10-Party Quantum Secret Sharing, the Wits team beat all prior records to share a quantum secret. “In traditional secure quantum communication, information is sent securely from one party to another, often named Alice and Bob. In the language of networks, this would be considered peer-to-peer communication and by definition has only the two nodes: sender and receiver,” says Forbes. “Anyone who has sent an email will know that often information must be sent to several people: one sender and many receiving parties. Traditional quantum communication such as quantum key distribution (QKD) does not allow this, and is only of the peer-to-peer form.” Using structured light as quantum photon states, the Wits team showed how to distribute information from one sender to 10 parties. Then, by using some nifty quantum tricks, they could engineer the protocol so that only if the parties trust one another can the secret be revealed. “In essence, each party has no useful information, but if they trust one another then the secret can be revealed. The level of trust can be set from just a few of the parties to all of them,” says Forbes. Importantly, at no stage is the secret ever revealed through communication between the parties: they don’t have to reveal any secrets. In this way a secret can be shared in a fundamentally secure manner across many nodes of a network: quantum secret sharing. “Our work pushes the state-of-the-art and brings quantum communication closer to true network implementation,” says Forbes. “When you think of networks you think of many connections, many parties, who wish to share information and not just two. Now we know how to do this the quantum way.” aThe team used structured photons to reach high dimensions. Structured light means ‘’Patterns of light” and here the team could use many patterns to push the dimension limit. More dimensions mean more information in the light, and translates directly to larger secrets.",New Quantum Approach for Sharing Secrets Sets a Record With 11 Dimensions,4,0.01873790183304469
1694,"For several weeks in summer 2020, NASA’s Solar and Terrestrial Relations Observatory, or STEREO, had the solar system’s best view of the star Betelgeuse, whose extreme dimming over the past several months has intrigued scientists. STEREO’s measurements revealed more unexpected dimming by the star, further adding to the questions around Betelgeuse’s recent behavior. Starting in late spring 2020, Betelgeuse has appeared close to the Sun in the sky because of Earth’s position in space. However, the STEREO spacecraft is currently about 70 degrees away from Earth — meaning that in late June, STEREO was in approximately the same position that Earth was in around mid-April, and could therefore see the stars that appeared in Earth’s night sky during April. This figure shows measurements of Betelgeuse’s brightness from different observatories from late 2018 to present. The blue and green points represent data from ground-based observatories. The gaps in these measurements happen when Betelgeuse appears in Earth’s day sky, making it impossible to take precise brightness measurements. During this observation gap in 2020, NASA’s STEREO spacecraft — with measurements shown in red — stepped in to observe Betelgeuse from its unique vantage point, revealing unexpected dimming by the star. The 2018 data point from STEREO was found in the mission’s archival data and was used to calibrate STEREO’s measurements against other telescopes. Credit: Dupree, et al
Scientists took advantage of this unique orbital position to keep tabs on Betelgeuse while the star was invisible to Earth-bound observatories. During this period between late June and early August, STEREO observed Betelgeuse on five separate days, rolling the spacecraft for about two hours each time to place Betelgeuse in the field of view of STEREO’s Heliospheric Imager, an instrument usually used to capture images of the Sun’s outflowing material, the solar wind, as it passes by the spacecraft and towards Earth. The team shortened the instrument’s exposure time to account for Betelgeuse’s relative brightness compared to the solar wind. The instrument’s wide field of view covers about 70 degrees of sky, which allowed scientists to calibrate their measurements using steady stars in the night sky across several weeks. STEREO’s measurements revealed that Betelgeuse is dimming again — an unexpected development so soon after its last dim period. Betelgeuse typically goes through brightness cycles lasting about 420 days, with the previous minimum in February 2020, meaning this dimming is happening unexpectedly early. These observations were reported by the science team via The Astronomer’s Telegram on July 28, 2020. This is an intriguing phenomenon that scientists will study with additional Earth-orbiting and ground-based observatories when Betelgeuse returns to the night sky in late August. This four-panel graphic illustrates how the southern region of the rapidly evolving, bright, red supergiant star Betelgeuse may have suddenly become fainter for several months during late 2019 and early 2020. In the first two panels, as seen in ultraviolet light with the Hubble Space Telescope, a bright, hot blob of plasma is ejected from the emergence of a huge convection cell on the star’s surface. In panel three, the outflowing, expelled gas rapidly expands outward. It cools to form an enormous cloud of obscuring dust grains. The final panel reveals the huge dust cloud blocking the light (as seen from Earth) from a quarter of the star’s surface. Illustration credit: NASA, ESA, and E. Wheatley (STScI) Is a Supernova Imminent? The red supergiant is destined to end its life in a supernova blast. Some astronomers think the sudden dimming may be a pre-supernova event. The star is relatively nearby, about 725 light-years away, which means the dimming would have happened around the year 1300. But its light is just reaching Earth now. “No one knows what a star does right before it goes supernova, because it’s never been observed,” Andrea Dupree, associate director of the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian (CfA), Cambridge, Massachusetts, explained. “Astronomers have sampled stars maybe a year ahead of them going supernova, but not within days or weeks before it happened. But the chance of the star going supernova anytime soon is pretty small.”",NASA STEREO Spacecraft’s Lone View of Betelgeuse Reveals More Strange Behavior – Is Supernova Imminent?,4,0.008799244158186337
1695,"Uniforms of U.S. Army soldiers must meet a long list of challenging requirements. They need to feel comfortable in all climates, be durable through multiple washings, resist fires and ward off insects, among other things. Existing fabrics don’t check all of these boxes, so scientists have come up with a novel way of creating a flame-retardant, insect-repellent fabric that uses nontoxic substances. The researchers will present their results today (August 17, 2020) at the American Chemical Society (ACS) Fall 2020 Virtual Meeting & Expo. ACS is holding the meeting through Thursday. It features more than 6,000 presentations on a wide range of science topics. “The Army presented to us this interesting and challenging requirement for multifunctionality,” says study leader Ramaswamy Nagarajan, Ph.D. “There are flame-resistant Army combat uniforms made of various materials that meet flame retardant requirements. But they are expensive, and there are problems with dyeing the fabrics. Also, some of the raw materials are not produced in the U.S. So, our goal was to find an existing material that we could modify to make it flame retardant and insect repellent, yet still have a fabric that a soldier would want to wear.” Because Nagarajan’s research group focuses on sustainable green chemistry, the team sought nontoxic chemicals and processes for this study. They chose to modify a commercially available 50-50 nylon-cotton blend, a relatively inexpensive, durable, and comfortable fabric produced in the U.S. The material is used in a wide range of civilian and military applications because the nylon is strong and resistant to abrasion, whereas the cotton is comfortable to wear. But this type of textile doesn’t inherently repel bugs and is associated with a high fire risk. “We started with making the fabric fire retardant, focusing on the cotton part of the blend,” explains Sourabh Kulkarni, a Ph.D. student who works with Nagarajan at the University of Massachusetts Lowell Center for Advanced Materials. “Cotton has a lot of hydroxyl groups (oxygen and hydrogen bonded together) on its surface, which can be activated by readily available chemicals to link with phosphorus-containing compounds that impart flame retardancy.” For their phosphorus-containing compound, they chose phytic acid, an abundant, nontoxic substance found in seeds, nuts, and grains. Next, the researchers tackled the issue of making the material repel insects so that soldiers wouldn’t have to spray themselves repeatedly or carry an additional item in their packs. The team took permethrin, an everyday nontoxic insect repellent, and attached it to the fabric using plasma-assisted deposition in collaboration with a local company, LaunchBay. Through trial and error, the researchers eventually got both the phytic acid and permethrin to link to the fabric’s surface molecules. Using methods to measure heat release capacity and total heat release, as well as a vertical flame test, they found that the modified material performed at least 20% better than the untreated material. They also used a standard insect repellency test with live mosquitoes and found that the efficacy was greater than 98%. Finally, the fabric remained “breathable” after treatment as determined by air permeability studies. “We are very excited,” Nagarajan says, “because we’ve shown we can modify this fabric to be flame retardant and insect repellent — and still be fairly durable and comfortable. We’d like to use a substance other than phytic acid that would contain more phosphorous and therefore impart a greater level of flame retardancy, better durability and still be nontoxic to a soldier’s skin. Having shown that we can modify the fabric, we would also like to see if we can attach antimicrobials to prevent infections from bacteria, as well as dyes that remain durable.” A press conference on this topic will be held Thursday, August 20, at 12 p.m. Eastern time online.","Sustainable Green Chemistry Used to Create Safer, More Comfortable Uniforms for Soldiers",4,0.21135937026857277
1696,"By formulating positively charged fluorescent dyes into a new class of materials called small-molecule ionic isolation lattices (SMILES), a compound’s brilliant glow can be seamlessly transferred to a solid, crystalline state, researchers report August 6 in the journal Chem. The advance overcomes a long-standing barrier to developing fluorescent solids, resulting in the brightest known materials in existence. “These materials have potential applications in any technology that needs bright fluorescence or calls for designing optical properties, including solar energy harvesting, bioimaging, and lasers,” says Amar Flood, a chemist at Indiana University and co-senior author on the study along with Bo Laursen of the University of Copenhagen. This image shows a stack of 3D printed gyroids glowing in the dark from the bright SMILES materials. “Beyond these, there are interesting applications that include upconverting light to capture more of the solar spectrum in solar cells, light-switchable materials used for information storage and photochromic glass, and circularly polarized luminescence that may be used in 3D display technology,” Flood says. While there are currently more than 100,000 different fluorescent dyes available, almost none of these can be mixed and matched in predictable ways to create solid optical materials. Dyes tend to undergo “quenching” when they enter a solid state due to how they behave when packed close together, decreasing the intensity of their fluorescence to produce a more subdued glow. “The problem of quenching and inter-dye coupling emerges when the dyes stand shoulder-to-shoulder inside solids,” says Flood. “They cannot help but ‘touch’ each other. Like young children sitting at story time, they interfere with each other and stop behaving as individuals.” To overcome this problem, Flood and colleagues mixed a colored dye with a colorless solution of cyanostar, a star-shaped macrocycle molecule that prevents the fluorescent molecules from interacting as the mixture solidified, keeping their optical properties intact. As the mixture became a solid, SMILES formed, which the researchers then grew into crystals, precipitated into dry powders, and finally spun into a thin film or incorporated directly into polymers. Since the cyanostar macrocycles form building blocks that generate a lattice-like checkerboard, the researchers could simply plug a dye into the lattice and, without any further adjustments, the structure would take on its color and appearance. While previous research had already developed an approach to spacing the dyes apart using macrocycle molecules, it relied on colored macrocycles to do the job. Flood and colleagues found that colorless macrocycles were key. This image shows how 3D printed gyroids made with SMILES materials are colored under white light and fluoresce brightly under UV. “Some people think that colorless macrocycles are unattractive, but they allowed the isolation lattice to fully express the bright fluorescence of the dyes unencumbered by the colors of the macrocycles,” says Flood. Next, the researchers plan to explore the properties of fluorescent materials formed using this novel technique, enabling them to work with dye makers in the future to realize the materials’ full potential in a variety of different applications. “These materials are totally new, so we do not know which of their innate properties are actually going to offer superior functionality,” says Flood. “We also do not know the materials’ limits. So, we will develop a fundamental understanding of how they work, providing a robust set of design rules for making new properties. This is critical for putting these materials into the hands of others–we want to pursue crowd sourcing and to work with others in this effort.”",SMILES: Chemists Create the Brightest-Ever Fluorescent Materials,4,0.20010978926913914
1697,"Two of Earth’s most colorful upper atmospheric phenomena, aurora and airglow, met just before dawn in this photo shot by an astronaut on the International Space Station (ISS). Wavy green, red-topped wisps of aurora borealis appear to intersect the muted red-yellow band of airglow as the ISS passed just south of the Alaskan Peninsula. The rising Sun, behind Earth’s limb at the time of this photo, adds a deep blue to the horizon. Light from cities in British Columbia and Alberta, Canada, joins starlight to dot the early morning skyscape. Though they appear at similar altitudes, aurora and airglow are produced by different physical processes. Nighttime airglow (or nightglow) is a type of chemiluminescence—the emission of light from chemical interactions between oxygen, nitrogen, and other molecules in the upper atmosphere. Airglow occurs all around the Earth, all the time. However, “nightglow” is much easier to spot over a dark Earth than “dayglow,” as airglow is just one billionth as bright as the Sun. Auroras, on the other hand, stem from interactions between solar energy and Earth’s magnetic field. The magnetic field funnels the energy into the upper atmosphere, where it interacts with the same atoms as airglow (mainly oxygen and nitrogen). This is why both phenomena can produce similar colors. The dynamic nature of Earth’s magnetic field moves the solar energy in irregular ways, causing each aurora event to be visually unique.

1698,"Glaciers in the Southern Alps of New Zealand have lost more ice mass since pre-industrial times than remains today, according to a new study. Research led by the University of Leeds, in collaboration with the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) in New Zealand, mapped Southern Alps ice loss from the end of the Little Ice Age — roughly 400 years ago — to 2019. The study found that the rate of ice loss has doubled since glaciers were at their Little Ice Age peak extent. Relative to recent decades, the Southern Alps lost up to 77% of their total Little Ice Age glacier volume. Climate change has had a significant impact on ice loss around the world. Not only do local communities depend on glaciers as sources of fresh water, hydropower and irrigation, but mountain glacier and ice cap melt presently accounts for 25% of global sea-level rise. Rapid changes observed today for mountain glaciers need to be put into a longer-term context to understand global sea-level contributions, regional climate-glacier systems and local landscape evolution. The study, published in the journal Scientific Reports, determined volume changes for 400 mountain glaciers across New Zealand’s Southern Alps for three time periods; the pre-industrial Little Ice Age to 1978, 1978 to 2009 and 2009 to 2019. View from December 2018 across Hooker Lake to Aoraki — Mt Cook with Little Ice Age moraines and trimlines encircling the lake. The team reconstructed glacier volumes using historical records of glacier outlines, as well as examinations of moraines and trimlines, which are accumulations of glacial debris and clear lines on the side of a valley formed by a glacier, respectively. Moraines and trimlines can indicate former ice margin extent and ice thickness changes through time. By comparing changes in the glacier surface reconstructed during the Little Ice Age peak and the glacier surface in more recent digital elevation models, the study found that ice loss has increased two-fold since the Little Ice Age with a rapid increase in ice volume loss in the last 40 years. Up to 17% of the volume that was present at the Little Ice Age was lost between 1978 and 2019 alone. In 2019, only 12% of ice mass remained in what was formerly the low altitude part of the Little Ice Age glacier region — also called the ablation zone — and much of the what used to be ice-covered in the Little Ice Age ablation zone is now completely ice free. Study lead author Dr. Jonathan Carrivick, from the School of Geography, said: “These findings quantify a trend in New Zealand’s ice loss. The acceleration in the rate of ice mass loss may only get worse as not only climate but also other local effects become more pronounced, such as more debris accumulating on glaciers surfaces and lakes at the bottom of glaciers swell, exacerbating melt. Rob Roy glacier in the Matukituki valley in December 2018; this glacier on steep hillslopes is now disconnected from a (out of sight) valley floor part. “Our results suggest that the Southern Alps has probably already passed the time of ‘peak water’ or the tipping point of glacier melt supply. Looking forwards, planning must be made for mitigating the decreased runoff to glacier-fed rivers because that affects local water availability, landscape stability, and aquatic ecosystems.” Co-author Dr. Andrew Lorrey is a Principal Scientist based at NIWA who was involved with the study. He says “The long-term ice volume decline, rising snowlines, and rapid disintegration of glaciers across the Southern Alps we have observed is alarming. Photographic evidence that has been regularly collected since the late 1970s show the situation has dramatically worsened since 2010. “Our findings provide a conservative baseline for rates of Southern Alps ice volume change since pre-industrial times. They agree with palaeoclimate reconstructions, early historic evidence, and instrumental records that show our ice is shrinking from a warming climate.”",New Zealand’s Southern Alps Glacier Melt Has Doubled – Up to 77% of Little Ice Age Glacier Volume Already Lost,4,0.550665754985187
1699,"After four months of darkness, the Sun finally rises on August 11, 2020, at Concordia research station in Antarctica. The crew is understandably reverent. ESA-sponsored medical doctor Stijn Thoolen (left) and engineer Wenceslas Marie-Sainte (right) are part of the 12-member crew spending an entire year at Concordia. For nine months they are holding down the base in one of the most isolated, confined, and extreme environments on Earth, with no way in or out of the station. They run experiments in human physiology and biology, atmospheric physics, meteorology, and astronomy, among other disciplines, as well as maintain the base – one of only three to run year-round on the Antarctic Peninsula. Four months of complete darkness is quite the challenge, one researchers are very interested in studying from a physiological and psychological point of view. From questionnaires to blood and stool samples, the crew is poked and prodded to understand how better to prepare humans for deep space travel. Social dynamics are also of interest to researchers during the period of darkness. Stress brought on by lack of sunlight, changing sleep patterns, fatigue, and moodiness can affect the group. The crew is especially encouraged to take on group activities and get creative to combat the isolation of the winter. The first sunrise is always a remarkable moment, signaling the home stretch of their Antarctic residency. From now on the winter crew will start preparing for summer and the return of scientists that arrive for the warmer months starting in November. The base is cleaned thoroughly, machinery is serviced, tents are erected and heated, and the runway is cleared of snow. Extensive work is required to welcome the new arrivals back to the base at the end of the world.","After Four Months of Darkness, the Sun Finally Rises at Concordia Research Station",4,0.25137969768636803
1700,"Arctic sea ice is subject to some serious travel restrictions. Penned in by major land masses, most ice that forms in the Arctic Ocean stays there for the duration of its existence—typically one to four years before melting. Some ice, however, escapes the Arctic Ocean through a handful of passages and then drifts south. That’s the origin of the sea ice pictured here. When satellites acquired these images in July 2020, the ice had drifted more than 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) from the Arctic Ocean. The wide view above, acquired on July 2 with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA’s Aqua satellite, shows sea ice hugging the coast of East Greenland. The detailed image below, acquired July 3 with the Operational Land Imager (OLI) on Landsat 8, shows ice south of the Scoresby Sound (Kangertittivaq) fjord system along the Denmark Strait. “The pack-ice you see in the image is remnant ice that exited the Arctic through Fram Strait,” wrote Robert Pickart, a high-latitude oceanographer at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. “It is in the process of melting out as it is carried southward by the East Greenland Current.” The Fram Strait is the primary route for sea ice exiting the Arctic Ocean. This 450-kilometer (280-mile) wide passage between Greenland and Svalbard connects the Arctic Ocean with the Greenland Sea. The East Greenland Current originates north of the Fram Strait and moves seawater, along with some sea ice, southward toward the southern tip of Greenland. Pickart, who was sailing on the R/V Armstrong near the southern tip of Greenland at the time of this interview, noted that the current is unstable and tends to meander. The instability causes vortices of water, or “eddies,” to propagate offshore, which can deform the seaward edge of the sea ice. “This is a graphic example of how fresh water—both liquid and frozen—originating from the Arctic gets transferred to the interior of the Nordic seas, which modulates the wintertime transformation of the interior water,” Pickart said. “If this changes in the future, it has implications for the global overturning circulation that helps regulate our climate.” NASA Earth Observatory images by Lauren Dauphin, using Landsat data from the U.S. Geological Survey and MODIS data from NASA EOSDIS/LANCE and GIBS/Worldview.","Sea Ice in Denmark Strait – Drifted More Than 1,000 Km (600 Miles) From the Arctic Ocean",4,0.23351655291523876
1701,"Study is largest ever investigation into evolution of larynges across species. Scientists have discovered that the larynx, or voice box, of primates is significantly larger relative to body size, has greater variation, and is under faster rates of evolution than in other mammals. Published in the journal PLOS Biology and led by academics from Anglia Ruskin University (ARU), Stanford University, and the University of Vienna, the research is the first large-scale study into the evolution of the larynx. 3D image of a gorilla larynx. The larynx has three main functions: protecting the airway during feeding, regulating the supply of air to the lungs, and vocal communication. Because of its important role in facilitating social behavior, through vocalization, it has long been believed that the larynx is a key area of evolution, particularly in species with highly developed vocal communication systems. The researchers made CT-scans of specimens from 55 different species, and produced 3D computer models of their larynges. These were studied alongside detailed measurements, including body length and body mass. The primates ranged in size from a pygmy marmoset (Cebuella pygmaea) weighing just 110g, to a Western gorilla (Gorilla gorilla) weighing approximately 120kg. The carnivorans spanned from a 280g common dwarf mongoose (Helogale parvula) to a 180kg tiger (Panthera tigris). The study found that, for a given body length, primate larynges are on average 38% larger than those of carnivorans, and that the rate of larynx evolution is faster in these species. There is also more variation in larynx size relative to body size among primates, indicating that primates have greater flexibility to evolve in different ways. Carnivorans follow more of a fixed larynx-size to body-size ratio. Larynx size was also found to be a good predictor of the call frequency of a species, which demonstrates the relevance for vocal communication of the observed size variations. Co-lead author Dr. Jacob Dunn, Reader in Evolutionary Biology at Anglia Ruskin University (ARU), said: “This study demonstrates clear differences in the evolution of the larynx between groups of mammals. “Specifically, we have shown for the first time that the primate larynx is larger, less closely linked to body size, and under faster rates of evolution than the carnivoran larynx, which is a well-matched comparison group, indicating fundamental differences in the evolution of the vocal organ across species.” Co-lead author Dr. Daniel Bowling, Instructor in Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University, added: “Our study also shows that differences in larynx size predict changes in voice pitch, highlighting the larynx’s crucial role in vocal communication. This is demonstrated by the rich and varied calls produced by many primate species. “The results imply fundamental differences between primates and carnivorans in the forces constraining larynx size, as well as highlighting an evolutionary flexibility in primates that may help explain why they have developed complex and diverse uses of the vocal organ for communication. This provides an exciting avenue for future studies examining variation among other mammalian groups.”",Evolutionary Investigation Across Species Reveals Primate Voice Boxes Are Evolving at Rapid Pace,4,0.21074885421583522
1702,"Cells work around the clock to deliver, maintain, and control every aspect of life. And just as with humans, communication is a key to their success. Every essential biological process requires some form of communication among cells, not only with their immediate neighbors but also to those significantly farther away. Current understanding is that this information exchange relies on the diffusion of signaling molecules or on cell-to-cell relays. Publishing in the journal Developmental Cell, a research team at Kyoto University’s Graduate School of Medicine reports on a novel method of communication relying on ‘mechano-chemical’ signals to control cell movement. The research group focused on a fundamental pathway — MAPK/ERK, or ERK pathway — and were able to demonstrate how the movement of a single cell could trigger a cascading reaction resulting in the migration of a cell collective. Kyoto University scientists have found how a single cell can move an entire collective. “Mechanical and biochemical signals in cells fundamentally control everything from homeostasis, development, to diseases,” explains Tsuyoshi Hirashima, leader of the study. “We knew from past experiments how vital the ERK pathway is in cell activity, but the mechanism of how it can propagate in a collection of cells was incomplete.” MAPK/ERK is so fundamental that it exists in all cells, controlling a wide range of actions from growth and development to eventual cell death. The pathway is activated when a receptor protein on the cell surface binds with a signaling molecule, resulting in a cascade of proteins and reactions spreading throughout the cell’s interior. Employing a live imaging technique that can visualize an individual cell’s active ERK pathway, the team began observing the effects of cell movement. What they found was unexpected: when a cell began to extend itself, ERK activity increased, causing the cell to contract. “Cells are tightly connected and packed together, so when one starts contracting from ERK activation, it pulls in its neighbors,” elaborates Hirashima. This then caused surrounding cells to extend, activating their ERK, resulting in contractions that lead to a kind of tug-of-war propagating into colony movement. “Researchers had previously proposed that cells extend when ERK is activated, so our results came as quite a surprise.” The team incorporated these observations into a mathematical model, combining mechano-chemical regulations with quantitative parameters. The output demonstrated consistency with experimental data. “Our work clearly shows that the ERK-mediated mechano-chemical feedback system generates complicated multicellular patterns,” concludes Hirashima. “This will provide a new basis for understanding many biological processes, including tissue repair and tumor metastasis.”",Cells Communicate by Doing the ‘Wave’ – Scientists Reverse Engineer Cellular Mechano-Chemical Feedback System,4,0.8870010231418268
1703,"Researchers have sequenced the genome of the tuatara, revealing its unique evolutionary history. International scientists and Ngātiwai, a Māori tribe, teamed up to sequence the genome of a rare reptile, the tuatara, uncovering some unique aspects of the tuatara’s evolution The genome sequence will enable comparative studies to better understand the evolution of the tuatara and its distant relatives: other reptiles, birds, and mammals Shedding light on the tuatara’s biology will help protect this vulnerable species A global team of researchers has partnered up with the Māori tribe Ngātiwai to sequence the genome of the tuatara, a rare reptile endemic to New Zealand. Their work, published in the scientific journal Nature, lays the foundation for understanding the evolution of this ancient species, and can inform conservation efforts to protect it. The study included collaborators at the University of Otago and at EMBL’s European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI). With its small, scaly body, pointy tail, and clawed feet, the tuatara seems to tick all the boxes to be a lizard – yet it isn’t. This ancient reptile is the sole survivor of its own evolutionary branch on the tree of life, the Sphenodontia. Until now, biologists had not reached consensus on the evolutionary history of tuatara – whether they are more closely related to birds, crocodiles, and turtles, or if they stemmed from an ancestor shared with lizards and snakes. “Our research confirms that tuatara have diverged from the ancestor of lizards and snakes about 250 million years ago,” says Matthieu Muffato, the analysis lead from Ensembl comparative genomics at EMBL-EBI. “This long period of independent evolution explains why we found the tuatara genome to be so unlike those of other vertebrates.” A biological curiosity “The tuatara genome is considerably bigger than the human genome, and it has a unique constitution. It contains a lot of repetitive DNA segments that are unique to the species and have no known function,” explains Fergal Martin, Vertebrate Annotation Coordinator at EMBL-EBI. The sequence of the tuatara genome revealed a number of aspects of this reptile’s lifestyle. Although tuatara are predominantly nocturnal animals, their DNA carries a high number of genes involved in color vision, which might help day-active juveniles escape from their predators. If they survive the vagaries of their juvenile life, tuatara can live to be more than 100 years old. Scientists examining some of the genes implicated in protecting the body from ageing have found that tuatara have more of these genes than any other vertebrate species yet examined. “Could this be one of the keys to their long lifespan? Tuatara also don’t appear to get many diseases, so looking into what genetic factors might protect them from infection was another point of focus for our study,” says Neil Gemmell, Professor and Team Leader at the University of Otago. A vulnerable icon “The tuatara is an iconic species, both for the Māori and for biologists. It has a unique biology and its basic body shape hasn’t changed much over evolutionary time, so it’s a precious species for us to understand what the common ancestor of lizards, snakes, and tuatara was like,” explains Paul Flicek, Associate Director of EMBL-EBI Services. The scientists hope that their findings on the genome and biology of the tuatara will inform conservation efforts to protect this unusual reptile. Tuatara used to thrive in New Zealand before the first human settlers brought invasive predators such as rats 800 years ago. The tuatara’s extremely slow life cycle is no match for the voracity of its predators: when it comes to reproduction, tuatara take the scenic route. They sometimes need more than 10 years to reach sexual maturity, and they produce young only every two to five years. Although the species’ conservation status is of “least concern” according to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, the tuatara relies on active conservation management to prevent the establishment of invasive species on the islands where it survives. “Very early on it became clear that a primary goal for us all was to develop new knowledge that would improve the conservation of this species. We agreed to partner together with Ngātiwai to achieve that aim, whilst also looking for opportunities to share other benefits that might derive from the research. It was an informed partnership that I believe was an important enabling element for the project’s success, which extends well beyond the scientific achievement of sequencing the genome,” says Gemmell.","An Ancient Reptile in Peril: The Curious Genome of the Tuatara, a Vulnerable Species That Is NOT a Lizard",4,0.23859133549179212
1704,"In a 99-million-year-old preserved amber fossil, researchers get a detailed glimpse into how ‘Hell Ants’ hunted with scythe-like mandibles and horn appendages. In findings published on August 6, 2020, in the journal Current Biology, researchers from New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT), Chinese Academy of Sciences and University of Rennes in France have unveiled a stunning 99-million-year-old fossil pristinely preserving an enigmatic insect predator from the Cretaceous Period — a ‘hell ant’ (haidomyrmecine) — as it embraced its unsuspecting final victim, an extinct relative of the cockroach known as Caputoraptor elegans. The ancient encounter, locked in amber recovered from Myanmar, offers a detailed glimpse at a newly identified prehistoric ant species Ceratomyrmex ellenbergeri, and presents some of the first direct evidence showing how it and other hell ants once used their killer features — snapping their bizarre, but deadly, scythe-like mandibles in a vertical motion to pin prey against their horn-like appendages. Researchers say the rare fossil demonstrating the hell ant’s feeding mode offers a possible evolutionary explanation for its unusual morphology and highlights a key difference between some of the earliest ant relatives and their modern counterparts, which today uniformly feature mouthparts that grasp by moving together laterally. The hell ant lineage, along with their striking predatory traits, are suspected to have vanished along with many other early ant groups during periods of ecological change around the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event 65 million years ago. “Fossilized behavior is exceedingly rare, predation especially so. As paleontologists, we speculate about the function of ancient adaptations using available evidence, but to see an extinct predator caught in the act of capturing its prey is invaluable,” said Phillip Barden, assistant professor at NJIT’s Department of Biological Sciences and lead author of the study. “This fossilized predation confirms our hypothesis for how hell ant mouthparts worked … The only way for prey to be captured in such an arrangement is for the ant mouthparts to move up and downward in a direction unlike that of all living ants and nearly all insects.” “Since the first hell ant was unearthed about a hundred years ago, it’s been a mystery as to why these extinct animals are so distinct from the ants we have today,” Barden added. “This fossil reveals the mechanism behind what we might call an ‘evolutionary experiment,’ and although we see numerous such experiments in the fossil record, we often don’t have a clear picture of the evolutionary pathway that led to them.” Phylogeny and Cephalic Homology of Hell Ants and Modern Lineages. Credit: NJIT, Chinese Academy of Sciences and University of Rennes, France Driving Diversity of Hell Ants & Their Headgear Barden’s team suggests that adaptations for prey-capture likely explain the rich diversity of mandibles and horns observed in the 16 species of hell ants identified to date. Some taxa with unarmed, elongate horns such as Ceratomyrmex apparently grasped prey externally, while other hell ants such as Linguamyrmex vladi, or “Vlad the Impaler” discovered by Barden and colleagues in 2017, was thought to have used a metal-reinforced horn on its head to impale prey — a trait potentially used to feed on the internal liquid (hemolymph) of insects. Barden says the earliest hell ant ancestors would have first gained the ability to move their mouthparts vertically. This, in turn, would functionally integrate the mouthparts and head in a way that was unique to this extinct lineage. “Integration is a powerful shaping force in evolutionary biology … when anatomical parts function together for the first time, this opens up new evolutionary trajectories as the two features evolve in concert,” explained Barden. “The consequences of this innovation in mouthpart movement with the hell ants are remarkable. While no modern ants have horns of any kind, some species of hell ant possess horns coated with serrated teeth, and others like Vlad are suspected to have reinforced its horn with metal to prevent its own bite from impaling itself.” To explore further, the researchers compared the head and mouthpart morphology of Ceratomyrmex and several other hell ant species (such as head, horn and mandible size) with similar datasets of living and fossil ant species. The team also conducted a phylogenetic analysis to reconstruct evolutionary relationships among both Cretaceous and modern ants. The team’s analyses confirmed that hell ants belong to one of the earliest branches of the ant evolutionary tree and are each other’s closest relatives. Moreover, the relationship between mandible and head morphology is unique in hell ants compared to living lineages as a result of their specialized prey-capture behavior. The analyses also demonstrated that elongated horns evolved twice in hell ants. While the fossil has finally provided Barden’s lab with firmer answers as to how this long-lost class of ant predators functioned and found success for nearly 20 million years, questions persist such as what led these and other lineages to go extinct while modern ants flourished into the ubiquitous insects we know today. Barden’s team is now seeking to describe species from new fossil deposits to learn more about how extinction impacts groups differentially. “Over 99% of all species that have ever lived have gone extinct,” said Barden. “As our planet undergoes its sixth mass extinction event, it’s important that we work to understand extinct diversity and what might allow certain lineages to persist while others drop out. I think fossil insects are a reminder that even something as ubiquitous and familiar as ants have undergone extinction.”","Stunning 99-Million-Year-Old Fossil Reveals “Hell Ants” in Detail: Hunted With Bizarre, Deadly Mandibles",4,0.5553301624994784
1705,"The Chinese government has reportedly detained more than a million Muslims in reeducation camps. Most of the people who have been arbitrarily detained are Uighur, a predominantly Turkic-speaking ethnic group primarily from China’s northwestern region of Xinjiang. Human rights organizations, UN officials, and many foreign governments are urging China to stop the crackdown. But Chinese officials maintain that what they call vocational training centers do not infringe on Uighurs’ human rights. They have refused to share information about the detention centers, and prevented journalists and foreign investigators from examining them. However, internal Chinese government documents leaked in late 2019 have provided important details on how officials launched and maintain the detention camps. When did mass detentions of Muslims start? Some eight hundred thousand to two million Uighurs and other Muslims, including ethnic Kazakhs and Uzbeks, have been detained since April 2017, according to experts and government officials [PDF]. Outside of the camps, the eleven million Uighurs living in Xinjiang have continued to suffer from a decades-long crackdown by Chinese authorities. Most people in the camps have never been charged with crimes and have no legal avenues to challenge their detentions. The detainees seem to have been targeted for a variety of reasons, according to media reports, including traveling to or contacting people from any of the twenty-six countries China considers sensitive, such as Turkey and Afghanistan; attending services at mosques; having more than three children; and sending texts containing Quranic verses. Often, their only crime is being Muslim, human rights groups say, adding that many Uighurs have been labeled as extremists simply for practicing their religion. Hundreds of camps are located in Xinjiang. Officially known as the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region, the northwestern region has been claimed by China since the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) took power in 1949. Some Uighurs living there refer to the region as East Turkestan and argue that it ought to be independent from China. Xinjiang takes up one-sixth of China’s landmass and borders eight countries, including Pakistan, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan. Experts estimate that Xinjiang reeducation efforts started in 2014 and were drastically expanded in 2017. Reuters journalists, observing satellite imagery, found that thirty-nine of the camps almost tripled in size between April 2017 and August 2018; they cover a total area roughly the size of 140 soccer fields. Similarly, analyzing local and national budgets over the past few years, Germany-based Xinjiang expert Adrian Zenz found that construction spending on security-related facilities in Xinjiang increased by 20 billion yuan (around $2.96 billion) in 2017. What is happening in the camps? Information on what actually happens in the camps is limited, but many detainees who have since fled China describe harsh conditions. Detainees are forced to pledge loyalty to the CCP and renounce Islam, they say, as well as sing praises for communism and learn Mandarin. Some reported prison-like conditions, with cameras and microphones monitoring their every move and utterance. Others said they were tortured and subjected to sleep deprivation during interrogations. Women have shared stories of sexual abuse, with some saying they were forced to undergo abortions or have contraceptive devices implanted against their will. Some released detainees contemplated suicide or witnessed others kill themselves. Detention also disrupts families. Children whose parents have been sent to the camps are often forced to stay in state-run orphanages. Uighur parents living outside of China often face a difficult choice: return home to be with their children and risk detention, or stay abroad, separated from their children and unable to contact them. Why is China detaining Uighurs in Xinjiang now? Chinese officials are concerned that Uighurs hold extremist and separatist ideas, and they view the camps as a way of eliminating threats to China’s territorial integrity, government, and population. President Xi Jinping warned of the “toxicity of religious extremism” and advocated for using the tools of “dictatorship” to eliminate Islamist extremism in a series of secret speeches while visiting Xinjiang in 2014. In the speeches, revealed by the New York Times in November 2019, Xi did not explicitly call for arbitrary detention but laid the groundwork for the crackdown in Xinjiang. Arbitrary detention became widely used by regional officials under Chen Quanguo, Xinjiang’s Communist Party secretary, who moved to the region in 2016 after holding a top leadership position in Tibet. Known for increasing the number of police and security checkpoints, as well as state control over Buddhist monasteries in Tibet, Chen has since dramatically intensified security in Xinjiang. He repeatedly called on officials to “round up everyone who should be rounded up,” according to the New York Times report. In March 2017, Xinjiang’s government passed an anti-extremism law that prohibited people from growing long beards and wearing veils in public. It also officially recognized the use of training centers to eliminate extremism. Under Xi, the CCP has pushed to Sinicize religion, or shape all religions to conform to the officially atheist party’s doctrines and the majority Han-Chinese society’s customs. Though the government recognizes five religions—Buddhism, Catholicism, Daoism, Islam, and Protestantism—it has long feared that foreigners could use religious practice to spur separatism. The Chinese government has come to characterize any expression of Islam in Xinjiang as extremist, a reaction to past independence movements and occasional outbursts of violence. The government has blamed terrorist attacks on the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, a separatist group founded by militant Uighurs, in recent decades. Following the 9/11 attacks, the Chinese government started justifying its actions toward Uighurs as part of the Global War on Terrorism. It said it would combat what it calls “the three evils”—separatism, religious extremism, and international terrorism—at all costs. In 2009, rioting in Xinjiang’s capital, Urumqi, broke out as mostly Uighur demonstrators protested against state-incentivized Han Chinese migration in the region and widespread economic and cultural discrimination. Nearly two hundred people were killed, and experts say it marked a turning point in Beijing’s attitude toward Uighurs. In the eyes of Beijing, all Uighurs could potentially be terrorists or terrorist sympathizers. During the next few years, authorities blamed Uighurs for attacks at a local government office, train station, and open-air market, as well as Tiananmen Square in Beijing. The government also feared that thousands of Uighurs who moved to Syria to fight for various militant groups, including the self-proclaimed Islamic State, after the outbreak of civil war in 2011 would return to China and spark violence. Are economic factors involved in this crackdown? Xinjiang is an important link in China’s Belt and Road Initiative, a massive development plan stretching through Asia and Europe. Beijing hopes to eradicate any possibility of separatist activity to continue its development of Xinjiang, which is home to China’s largest coal and natural gas reserves. Human rights organizations have observed that the economic benefits of resource extraction and development are often disproportionately enjoyed by Han Chinese, and Uighur people are increasingly marginalized. Many people who were arbitrarily detained have been forced to work in factories close to the detention camps, according to multiple reports [PDF]. The Australian Strategic Policy Institute estimates that since 2017 eighty thousand previously detained Uighurs have been sent to factories throughout China linked to eighty-three global brands. Researchers from the Center for Strategic and International Studies say forced labor is an important element of the government’s plan for Xinjiang’s economic development, which includes making it a hub of textile and apparel manufacturing. Chinese officials have described the policy as “poverty alleviation.” What do Chinese officials say about the camps? Government officials first denied the camps’ existence. Starting in October 2018, officials started calling them centers for “vocational education and training programs.” In March 2019, their official name became “vocational training centers,” and Xinjiang’s governor, Shohrat Zakir, described them as “boarding schools” that provide job skills to “trainees” who are voluntarily admitted and allowed to leave the camps. But documents leaked in late 2019 showed how officials worked to repress Uighurs, lock them in camps, and prevent them from leaving. Chinese officials publicly maintain that the camps have two purposes: to teach Mandarin, Chinese laws, and vocational skills, and to prevent citizens from becoming influenced by extremist ideas, to “nip terrorist activities in the bud,” according to a government report. Pointing out that Xinjiang has not experienced a terrorist attack since December 2016, officials claim the camps have prevented violence. The government has resisted international pressure to allow in outside investigators, saying anything happening inside Xinjiang is an internal issue. It denies that people are forced to denounce Islam, are detained against their will, and experience abuse in the camps. In early 2019, it organized several trips for foreign diplomats to visit Xinjiang and tour a center; a U.S. official criticized them as “highly choreographed.” What is happening outside the camps in Xinjiang? Even before the camps became a major part of the Chinese government’s anti-extremism campaign, the government was accused of cracking down on religious freedom and basic human rights in Xinjiang. Experts say Xinjiang has been turned into a surveillance state that relies on cutting-edge technology to monitor millions of people. Under Xinjiang’s Communist Party leader, Chen, Xinjiang was placed under a grid-management system, as described in media reports, in which cities and villages were split into squares of about five hundred people. Each square has a police station that closely monitors inhabitants by regularly scanning their identification cards, taking their photographs and fingerprints, and searching their cell phones. In some cities, such as western Xinjiang’s Kashgar, police checkpoints are found every one hundred yards or so, and facial-recognition cameras are everywhere. The government also collects and stores citizens’ biometric data through a required program advertised as Physicals for All. Much of that information is collected into a massive database, known as the Integrated Joint Operations Platform, which then uses artificial intelligence to create lists of so-called suspicious people. Classified Chinese government documents released by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) in November 2019 revealed that more than fifteen thousand Xinjiang residents were placed in detention centers during a seven-day period in June 2017 after being flagged by the algorithm. The Chinese government called the leaked documents “pure fabrication” and maintained that the camps are education and training centers. Many aspects of Muslim life have been erased, journalists reporting from Xinjiang have found. Communist Party members have been recruited since 2014 to stay in Uighur homes and report on any perceived “extremist” behaviors, including fasting during Ramadan. Officials have destroyed mosques, claiming the buildings were shoddily constructed and unsafe for worshippers. Uighur and other minority women have reported forced sterilizations and intrauterine device insertions, and officials have threatened to detain anyone who has too many children. Uighur parents are banned from giving their babies certain names, including Mohammed and Medina. Halal food, which is prepared according to Islamic law, has become harder to find in Urumqi as the local government has launched a campaign against it. Beijing has also pressured other governments to repatriate Uighurs who have fled China. In 2015, for example, Thailand returned more than one hundred Uighurs, and in 2017 Egypt deported several students. The documents released by ICIJ showed that the Chinese government instructed officials to collect information on Chinese Uighurs living abroad and called for many to be arrested as soon as they reentered China. What has the global response been? Much of the world has condemned China’s detention of Uighurs in Xinjiang. The UN human rights chief and other UN officials have demanded access to the camps. The European Union has called on China to respect religious freedom and change its policies in Xinjiang. And human rights organizations have urged China to immediately shut down the camps and answer questions about disappeared Uighurs. Notably silent are many Muslim nations. Prioritizing their economic ties and strategic relationships with China, many governments have ignored the human rights abuses. In July 2019, after a group of mostly European countries—and no Muslim-majority countries—signed a letter to the UN human rights chief condemning China’s actions in Xinjiang, more than three dozen states, including Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, signed their own letter [PDF] praising China’s “remarkable achievements” in human rights and its “counterterrorism” efforts in Xinjiang. Earlier in 2019, Turkey became the only Muslim-majority country to voice concern when its foreign minister called on China to ensure “the full protection of the cultural identities of the Uighurs and other Muslims” during a UN Human Rights Council session. In October 2019, the United States imposed visa restrictions on Chinese officials “believed to be responsible for, or complicit in” the detention of Muslims in Xinjiang. It also blacklisted more than two dozen Chinese companies and agencies linked to abuses in the region—including surveillance technology manufacturers and Xinjiang’s public security bureau—effectively blocking them from buying U.S. products. In June 2020, President Donald J. Trump signed legislation, passed with overwhelming support from Congress, mandating that individuals, including Chen, face sanctions for oppressing Uighurs. The law also requires that U.S. businesses and individuals selling products to or operating in Xinjiang ensure their activities don’t contribute to human rights violations, including the use of forced labor. Human Rights Watch has advocated other actions the United States and other countries could take: publicly challenging Xi; denying exports of technologies that facilitate abuse; pressing China to allow UN investigators in Xinjiang; and preventing China from targeting members of the Uighur diaspora. Activists have also called on the United States to grant asylum to Uighurs who have fled Xinjiang.",China’s Repression of Uighurs in Xinjiang,9,0.45263340350498915
1706,"If you are using any personal protective equipment, or PPE, to guard against the coronavirus, there’s a good chance it was manufactured by Uyghurs in a forced labor camp in China. More than one million Uyghurs have been detained in what the Chinese government calls “reeducation camps” in Xinjiang, the Uyghur homeland in northwest China. The Uyghurs call their autonomous region East Turkestan. “This is one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world. The State Department rightly said this is the largest incarceration of any ethnic minority since the Holocaust,” says Nury Turkel, a leader of the Uyghur community in the United States and a newly appointed member of the US Commission on International Religious Freedom Turkel describes himself as an American by choice. He first arrived in the US in 1995 to attend graduate school, and two years later was granted political asylum. “I have not been home for more than 25 years,” says Turkel, who was born in one of the infamous “reeducation camps” in 1970 during the height of the Chinese Communist Cultural Revolution. He appeared last week on an American Jewish Committee Advocacy Anywhere online program. In describing what has been happening for decades to his people, the Washington, DC-based attorney does not mince words. “It is a genocide,” says Turkel, adding that the “purposeful prevention of population growth” is one of the legal definitions of genocide. “In the last year, Uyghur population growth dropped by 24%, and in the previous three years by 84%.” The Chinese government is “deliberately preventing population growth” by placing half a million Uyghur children in state orphanages, forcing Uyghur women to be sterilized, as well as forcing them to marry men of another race, he says. Why are the leaders of a country with more than 1.4 billion people targeting this ethnic and religious minority, whose population is estimated by the Chinese government to be 12 million, though Turkel says the true number is about 20 million? According to Turkel, the Chinese government has zero tolerance for people who appear and behave differently. The Uyghurs are Muslim, speak a Turkic language, some of the men grow beards, the women wear veils, and children are given names such as Ibrahim, Muhammad and Fatima. UYGHURS ARE generally not seen as “normal” by the Chinese government, explains Turkel, and thus are selected to undergo “transformation,” the new term being used instead of “reeducation,” to forego their unique culture and traditions, and fully embrace Chinese Communist ideology and behavior. Over the past three years, the government has stepped up its oppression of its own citizens by utilizing a surveillance technology, called the Integrated Joint Operations Platform that is mostly used for a detailed database on Uyghurs. “It’s very disappointing that most of the Muslim countries not only did not take a position or publicly speak out. They have been praising the Chinese government,” says Turkel, who singled out Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Turkey for particular condemnation for their duplicity by ignoring the fate of Muslims in China. He’s also critical of Germany, France and the United Kingdom for their lack of action. “They lived through Nazi Germany, Hitler’s Europe, fascism. They know how this ends,” says Turkel. “We’ve seen this movie before.” Turkel, however, is encouraged by recent American actions, notably passage in May of the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act by an overwhelming majority in the US Congress and signed into law by President Donald Trump. This legislative initiative will boost monitoring and reporting on the status of Uyghurs in China, imposing sanctions on Chinese government officials deemed responsible for the persecution of Muslims, and prevent the import of goods produced by detained Uyghurs. Given that 80 global brands are involved, that may be quite challenging, but at least it puts major corporations on notice. If there is no significant change in Chinese government policy regarding the Uyghurs, Turkel would like to see the US boycott the Winter Olympics in Beijing in 2022. “I’ve heard people calling it Holocaust 2.0,” Turkel says of the persecuted population. “Personally, I don’t think it is appropriate. The word Holocaust belongs to the Jewish people.” In the end, there’s only so much one dedicated individual can do. “If the international community stays quiet, the Chinese government will succeed in destroying this proud people,” says Turkel. “If ‘Never Again’ means anything to anyone, they should speak up.” The Uyghurs are waiting.",The Uyghers' plight is a humanitarian crisis.

1707,"Following an agreement between Greek and Albanian authorities, the 20-plus km long queues at the Kakavija crossing have been dispersed. Thousands of Albanians returning to Greece found themselves stranded at the border for over four days. Greek customs were responsible for the holdup due to slow processing times caused by COVID-19 protocols and the fact they did not work in the evening. Last night, the Greeks agreed to work after 22:00 to clear the backlog of citizens and some 3000 were allowed to cross the border. As of today, 750 will be allowed to cross at the Kakavija crossing point and 350 at the Kapshtica crossing point. These citizens must have a negative COVID-19 test from a government licensed laboratory and be prepared to quarantine for seven days. The test certificate must be translated into English and include the name, surname and passport or identity card number. They must also have completed the PLF form from the Greek government website. During the almost five day standoff, a 10-year-old boy was killed by a speeding ambulance as he was queuing for the border. He and his family had been waiting for two days. Director of the General Directorate of Road Transport Services, Blendi Gonxhja wrote a statement on social media blaming the mother of the boy for his death, adding that she “doesn’t care as a parent”. He also said the border crisis was the fault of the immigrants. He deleted the statement after widespread outrage. Prime Minister Edi Rama tweeted about the situation from his holiday, saying that queues are the same in all Greek borders at this time. An article was then published on the government website claiming that there were queues at the border between Bulgaria and Greece, but it in fact referred to a 5km queue that happened on 1 August and was quickly resolved.","Humanitarian Crisis at Greek Border Concludes, New Protocols in Place for Albanians Wishing to Cross from Today",9,0.4067601644974016
1708,"The COVID-19 pandemic has worsened the already distressing humanitarian situation in conflict-marred parts of northeast Nigeria, the UN warned on Thursday. “The ongoing conflict in northeast Nigeria, now entering its eleventh year, and the upsurge in violent attacks over the past year in the crisis-affected states of Borno, Adamawa and Yobe have deepened humanitarian needs,” the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) said in a report. It said the virus pandemic “is further exacerbating the situation and risks wreaking havoc on the most vulnerable population.” “At least 10.6 million people are now in need of life-saving assistance in Borno, Adamawa and Yobe (BAY) states – the highest level recorded since the beginning of the coordinated humanitarian response in 2015,” the report said. The total population of the states is around 13 million, meaning that four in every five people need some form of help. The UNOCHA said the figure was at 7.9 million at the start of 2020 but “is now higher because of the COVID-19 pandemic.” “At the same time, more than 40% of health facilities in those three states have been damaged or destroyed as a result of the protracted conflict,” the report said. According to the report, some 1.9 million people remain internally displaced in the BAY states. “With the upsurge in violence and new waves of displacements in the first half of the year, nearly 60,000 people were forced to flee their homes, some for the second or third time,” it said. The agency called for urgent assistance to curb the spread of COVID-19 in Nigeria, especially in the overcrowded camps for internally displaced persons. The UNOCHA warned that failure to address the situation would “have far-reaching implications in terms of human suffering, as well as on regional stability and prospects for development.”",UN sounds alarm over humanitarian crisis in NE Nigeria,9,0.015991244931119808
1709,"As rescue workers continued to comb the debris for survivors of the deadly explosion in the port of Beirut, and as the United Nations warned that Lebanon faced a humanitarian catastrophe, the nation’s leaders debated the possible cause of the blast but provided little new information. Lebanon’s president, Michel Aoun, on Friday raised the prospect that “external interference” might have played a role in Tuesday’s disaster. “The cause has not been determined yet,” he said. “There is a possibility of external interference through a rocket or bomb or other act.” But he said that was one of many lines of inquiry, and he did not offer evidence to support the suggestion. Lebanese officials have suggested that the powerful blast that leveled large swaths of the city, killed more than 150 people and displaced thousands on Tuesday was caused by the detonation of some 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate fertilizer stored in a warehouse at the port. If that is the case, they have not explained what set off the ammonium nitrate. There were two explosions, and it is possible that the first, smaller one ignited the second larger one, but the government has not issued any public statements about the origin of either. The government has promised an investigation, and Mr. Aoun said it would look at how the explosive material entered the country and was stored, “whether the explosion was a result of negligence or an accident” and “the possibility that there was external interference.” The ammonium nitrate had been stored at the port for more than six years, since it was confiscated from a cargo ship leased by a Russian businessman. The chemical remained in a storage hangar at the port, officials said, despite repeated complaints from the port authorities that it was dangerous and should be disposed of. The suggestion that government officials knew of the dangers posed by the ammonium nitrate at the port for years and failed to act has only fueled public disgust and anger at the government over chronic mismanagement of the country. While the government has directed attention to the port workers by announcing that it had detained 16 employees and questioned others, the public’s anger has focused on the government’s inaction, incompetence and corruption. The French are assisting in the investigation, with a team in Beirut helping to collect evidence from the blast site. Anti-government demonstrators on Thursday in Beirut during the visit of President Emmanuel Macron of France. Dominique Abbenanti, an official with the French forensic team, told The Associated Press that the explosion “appears to be an accident” but that it was too early to say for sure. On Friday, Hassan Nasrallah, the secretary-general of Hezbollah, a powerful Lebanese militant group and political party, made his first public statement about the explosion, denying speculation that it may have been caused by a weapons cache belonging to the group. “I would like to affirm and announce today an absolute, total, resolute and decisive denial that we don’t have anything in the port,” he said. “We don’t have a weapons depot. We don’t have a missiles depot. We don’t have a missile, gun, bomb, bullet or ammonium nitrate.” He said that “several factions who oppose Hezbollah” have been spreading lies that Hezbollah was storing weapons, missiles or ammunition at the storage hangar that exploded, and that Hezbollah controls the port. An Israeli official said that the country’s intelligence services believe the area in the port where the blast happened is full of Hezbollah facilities, but there is no conclusive evidence linking Hezbollah to this particular storage of ammonium nitrate. Hezbollah is considered a terrorist group by the United States and the European Union. Hundreds of thousands of people remained displaced from their homes, with about one in 10 people in the city needing shelter. Thousands of wounded still needed urgent care on Friday, but with three of the city’s largest hospitals in shambles, local officials were struggling to meet the demand. Hundreds of thousands of people in Beirut remained displaced from their homes, with about one in 10 needing shelter. The United Nations warned Friday that the country was facing the prospect of dire shortages of food and medicine. With the country’s largest grain depot destroyed, United Nations officials expressed concern about basic food security in the nation of nearly 7 million people. Families gathered amid the ruins of what used to be the entrance of the port, looking for information about the fate of loved ones as international rescue teams joined the search for scores of missing people. The Lebanese Red Cross believes at least 100 people are still missing, most of whom had been working at the port. The European Union has sent more than 300 rescue workers, sniffer dogs, vehicles and equipment to Lebanon. Search crews from Russia also joined the effort on Friday. “Our experience shows that we can find people alive until up to 72, 75 or 80 hours after an explosion or an earthquake, so for now we are still in time and we cling on to this hope,” Col. Vincent Tissier, head of the French team, told reporters. The mother of Joseph Akiki, a 23-year-old electrician at the port, offered an emotional plea on Lebanese television for the safe return of her son. “I will keep waiting because I know Joe Akiki is strong,” she said. A few hours later, his lifeless body was pulled from the rubble, raising the official death toll to 154. Lebanon’s economy was already in a state of crisis before this week’s disaster. Unemployment was soaring along with inflation. Basic services like trash collection and power were spotty, and corruption was endemic at government ministries. More than a million people in the country live in poverty, according to the United Nations, and a recent survey found half the population fearful they could not find enough to eat. After the blast, the situation has grown even bleaker. Workers repairing Saint George hospital on Friday. The hospital’s urgent care building was damaged in the blast. The World Health Organization said it had airlifted medicines and surgical supplies to support the country’s health care system. Christian Lindmeier, a spokesman for the agency, told reporters in Geneva that there was rising concern that the catastrophe could worsen the coronavirus outbreak in Lebanon. The explosion destroyed 17 containers filled with hundreds of thousands of masks, gowns, gloves and other personal protective equipment needed for medical workers battling the pandemic, Mr. Lindmeier said. While the spread of the disease has been limited in Lebanon, which has reported fewer than 6,000 people infected with the virus and 70 deaths, the United Nations said it had recorded 255 new cases on Thursday, a daily high. Some of the most active areas of community transmission were in neighborhoods devastated by the blast. The W.H.O. and UNICEF, the United Nations’ children’s agency, said they were bringing in replacement supplies of personal protective equipment from logistics hubs in Dubai but appealed for money to support relief efforts and the Covid-19 response. At the same time, the U.N. World Food Program said that the destruction of the nation’s largest grain silo at the port “will exacerbate an already grim food security situation.”","As U.N.

1710,"India’s labouring poor have largely disappeared even from the inner pages of newspapers and from television screens. It is as though, after the country has gradually unlocked and most migrants have returned home, the wrenching distress of mass hunger and sudden unemployment that racked their lives has somehow passed. The reality is entirely the reverse. The devastating impact of the unprecedented closure of the entire economy, which was already in recession, will endure for a long time. However, the immense suffering of the poor has been rendered invisible by the collective indifference of the state and the rich and middle classes. Slipping deeper into want On the banks of the Yamuna, adjacent to the largest cremation ground in Delhi, is an embankment called Yamuna Pushta, home to 4,000 homeless men. In normal times, they survived by doing casual wage work, mostly in eateries or construction. Work was uncertain and always underpaid; still they managed to keep raw hunger at bay by eating food provided by religious food charities in gurdwaras, temples and dargahs. I met them recently. Their destitution and desperation were palpable. There is still no work, and shrines have still not adequately revived their food charities. The Delhi government has mostly ended its free cooked food distribution programme. At the peak of the programme, about 10 lakh people were being fed in over 1,000 centres. I was critical then of the indignity of forcing people to line up for hours each day for a ladle of food. But although it could have been organised with more compassion and respect, that was still a crucial public lifeline for people thrust suddenly into mass hunger. With that lifeline snapped, there is nothing except for some small private charities to shield them from the blistering winds of hunger. My comrades, including those working with homeless people in other cities, activists of the right to food campaign countrywide, and volunteers for food relief of the Karwan-e-Mohabbat, all report conditions of even more worrying precarity and deprivation from around the country. There are communities in the countryside — in forests, deserts, hills, river islands and Dalit ghettos — who even in normal times survived on the edge of hunger. They used to depend on remittances from migrants for their survival; today they have to feed the migrants who returned. Casual daily wage workers, weavers, artisans, home-based workers, rickshaw-pullers and street vendors have always lived precarious lives too. But they have slipped much deeper into want. And there are millions of new entrants into the ranks of the hungry, including laid-off employees of small enterprises and eateries, domestic workers, sex workers, workers in the gig economy, and even teachers in low-income private schools and those taking private tuitions. All of these workers, and tens of millions more, are bracing themselves for the ways that the dispossessed have learnt, from time immemorial, and that are hardwired into their DNA, to live with chronic hunger. The first is to eliminate nutritious but unaffordable portions of one’s diet, including dal, milk, vegetables, fruit, eggs and meat. Many families report that they are eating only coarse rice and roti with salt. The next step is to reduce food intake, cutting down on both the quantity eaten during each meal and the number of meals, teaching one’s body to endure with less and less. As households slide further down this steep slope, there are increasing numbers of nights when they have to sleep hungry. Children who could earlier depend on the school or preschool centre for at least one nutritious meal are now being sent out to work, including scrabbling through waste for anything which can be eaten or sold. Public policy failures A number of global reports warn that hundreds of millions of people are being thrust into extreme poverty and hunger because of the economic impacts of the lockdown and the raging pandemic. A United Nations University paper (Precarity and the pandemic, June 2020) estimates that 400 million new workers are at risk of slipping into extreme poverty, of less than $1.90 a day. What is even more worrying is that “the location of global poverty is likely to shift towards middle-income countries and South Asia and East Asia.” The impact could intensify because of “pre-existing conditions of fragmented or insufficient social protection systems” and could last for “years to come”. The UN Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, Philip Alston, similarly estimated in a study published in early July that more than 250 million people are at risk of acute hunger. This impact, he believes, “will be long-lasting”. He is critical of governments which “rather than acknowledging how badly the efforts to ‘end poverty’ have been faring, and how relentlessly the pandemic has exposed that fact... are doubling down on existing approaches that are clearly failing”. His angst about public policy failures to deal with the scale and depth of the humanitarian crisis is entirely justified. First, at senior levels of the Indian government, there is little acknowledgement of the depth of the crisis of hunger and the annihilation of livelihoods. To revive the economy and, in particular, MSMEs — the sector employing the most people outside agriculture — the Finance Minister relies mostly on credit rather than on fiscal transfers, unmindful that when both demand and production have crashed, credit will have few takers and can accomplish little. Second, governments also sought to revive the broken economy by excluding workers from regimes of labour rights protections, ostensibly for attracting capital investment. Instead of atoning for the immense distress of unprotected workers and mitigating future suffering by building sturdy legal walls for their protections, many State governments used the pandemic to further weaken the scant protections which the law currently provides informal workers. Some governments attempted to extend the workday to 12 hours, to suspend the protections of various labour laws for three years, and regulate the movement of workers across State borders. Abandoned by the state Even prior to the pandemic, India slipped to the 102nd position in the Global Hunger Report of 2019 that ranked 117 countries. It had fallen behind its neighbours Nepal, Pakistan and Bangladesh. The economy was also stuttering, with unemployment at a 45-year high. In the midst of this smouldering crisis, the most stringent lockdown in the world was imposed, nearly halting both demand and supply overnight. As the COVID-19 infection spreads to States with the most broken public health systems, such as Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, and with the homeless and the poor being excluded from highly privatised health facilities in cities, the problems of the poor will further exacerbate. As the virus ravages bodies enfeebled by hunger and distress, they remain abandoned by the state, with no reliable access to care. Through all of this, the political establishment, the media and the middle class remain culpably indifferent, preoccupied instead with buying legislators and toppling governments; purchasing military aircraft; jailing dissenters; and divisive agendas like the triumphalist construction of a Ram temple at the site of a demolished medieval mosque. With millions slipping invisibly into chronic hunger and intense poverty, India is hurtling silently into its gravest humanitarian crisis in over half a century.","As rescue workers continued to comb the debris for survivors of the deadly explosion in the port of Beirut, and as the United Nations warned that Lebanon faced a humanitarian catastrophe, the nation’s leaders debated the possible cause of the blast but provided little new information.

1711,"Nearly 40 years of satellite data from Greenland shows that glaciers on the island have shrunk so much that even if global warming were to stop today, the ice sheet would continue shrinking. The finding, published today, Aug. 13, in the journal Nature Communications Earth and Environment, means that Greenland's glaciers have passed a tipping point of sorts, where the snowfall that replenishes the ice sheet each year cannot keep up with the ice that is flowing into the ocean from glaciers. ""We've been looking at these remote sensing observations to study how ice discharge and accumulation have varied,"" said Michalea King, lead author of the study and a researcher at The Ohio State University's Byrd Polar and Climate Research Center. ""And what we've found is that the ice that's discharging into the ocean is far surpassing the snow that's accumulating on the surface of the ice sheet."" King and other researchers analyzed monthly satellite data from more than 200 large glaciers draining into the ocean around Greenland. Their observations show how much ice breaks off into icebergs or melts from the glaciers into the ocean. They also show the amount of snowfall each year -- the way these glaciers get replenished. The researchers found that, throughout the 1980s and 90s, snow gained through accumulation and ice melted or calved from glaciers were mostly in balance, keeping the ice sheet intact. Through those decades, the researchers found, the ice sheets generally lost about 450 gigatons (about 450 billion tons) of ice each year from flowing outlet glaciers, which was replaced with snowfall. ""We are measuring the pulse of the ice sheet -- how much ice glaciers drain at the edges of the ice sheet -- which increases in the summer. And what we see is that it was relatively steady until a big increase in ice discharging to the ocean during a short five- to six-year period,"" King said. The researchers' analysis found that the baseline of that pulse -- the amount of ice being lost each year -- started increasing steadily around 2000, so that the glaciers were losing about 500 gigatons each year. Snowfall did not increase at the same time, and over the last decade, the rate of ice loss from glaciers has stayed about the same -- meaning the ice sheet has been losing ice more rapidly than it's being replenished. ""Glaciers have been sensitive to seasonal melt for as long as we've been able to observe it, with spikes in ice discharge in the summer,"" she said. ""But starting in 2000, you start superimposing that seasonal melt on a higher baseline -- so you're going to get even more losses."" Before 2000, the ice sheet would have about the same chance to gain or lose mass each year. In the current climate, the ice sheet will gain mass in only one out of every 100 years. King said that large glaciers across Greenland have retreated about 3 kilometers on average since 1985 -- ""that's a lot of distance,"" she said. The glaciers have shrunk back enough that many of them are sitting in deeper water, meaning more ice is in contact with water. Warm ocean water melts glacier ice, and also makes it difficult for the glaciers to grow back to their previous positions. That means that even if humans were somehow miraculously able to stop climate change in its tracks, ice lost from glaciers draining ice to the ocean would likely still exceed ice gained from snow accumulation, and the ice sheet would continue to shrink for some time. ""Glacier retreat has knocked the dynamics of the whole ice sheet into a constant state of loss,"" said Ian Howat, a co-author on the paper, professor of earth sciences and distinguished university scholar at Ohio State. ""Even if the climate were to stay the same or even get a little colder, the ice sheet would still be losing mass."" Shrinking glaciers in Greenland are a problem for the entire planet. The ice that melts or breaks off from Greenland's ice sheets ends up in the Atlantic Ocean -- and, eventually, all of the world's oceans. Ice from Greenland is a leading contributor to sea level rise -- last year, enough ice melted or broke off from the Greenland ice sheet to cause the oceans to rise by 2.2 millimeters in just two months. The new findings are bleak, but King said there are silver linings. ""It's always a positive thing to learn more about glacier environments, because we can only improve our predictions for how rapidly things will change in the future,"" she said. ""And that can only help us with adaptation and mitigation strategies. The more we know, the better we can prepare."" This work was supported by grants from NASA.

1712,"Astronomers using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), in which the European Southern Observatory (ESO) is a partner, have revealed an extremely distant and therefore very young galaxy that looks surprisingly like our Milky Way. The galaxy is so far away its light has taken more than 12 billion years to reach us: we see it as it was when the Universe was just 1.4 billion years old. It is also surprisingly unchaotic, contradicting theories that all galaxies in the early Universe were turbulent and unstable. This unexpected discovery challenges our understanding of how galaxies form, giving new insights into the past of our Universe. ""This result represents a breakthrough in the field of galaxy formation, showing that the structures that we observe in nearby spiral galaxies and in our Milky Way were already in place 12 billion years ago,"" says Francesca Rizzo, PhD student from the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in Germany, who led the research published today in Nature. While the galaxy the astronomers studied, called SPT0418-47, doesn't appear to have spiral arms, it has at least two features typical of our Milky Way: a rotating disc and a bulge, the large group of stars packed tightly around the galactic centre. This is the first time a bulge has been seen this early in the history of the Universe, making SPT0418-47 the most distant Milky Way look-alike. ""The big surprise was to find that this galaxy is actually quite similar to nearby galaxies, contrary to all expectations from the models and previous, less detailed, observations,"" says co-author Filippo Fraternali, from the Kapteyn Astronomical Institute, University of Groningen in the Netherlands. In the early Universe, young galaxies were still in the process of forming, so researchers expected them to be chaotic and lacking the distinct structures typical of more mature galaxies like the Milky Way. Studying distant galaxies like SPT0418-47 is fundamental to our understanding of how galaxies formed and evolved. This galaxy is so far away we see it when the Universe was just 10% of its current age because its light took 12 billion years to reach Earth. By studying it, we are going back to a time when these baby galaxies were just beginning to develop. Because these galaxies are so far away, detailed observations with even the most powerful telescopes are almost impossible as the galaxies appear small and faint. The team overcame this obstacle by using a nearby galaxy as a powerful magnifying glass -- an effect known as gravitational lensing -- allowing ALMA to see into the distant past in unprecedented detail. In this effect, the gravitational pull from the nearby galaxy distorts and bends the light from the distant galaxy, causing it to appear misshapen and magnified. The gravitationally lensed, distant galaxy appears as a near-perfect ring of light around the nearby galaxy, thanks to their almost exact alignment. The research team reconstructed the distant galaxy's true shape and the motion of its gas from the ALMA data using a new computer modelling technique. ""When I first saw the reconstructed image of SPT0418-47 I could not believe it: a treasure chest was opening,"" says Rizzo. ""What we found was quite puzzling; despite forming stars at a high rate, and therefore being the site of highly energetic processes, SPT0418-47 is the most well-ordered galaxy disc ever observed in the early Universe,"" stated co-author Simona Vegetti, also from the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics. ""This result is quite unexpected and has important implications for how we think galaxies evolve."" The astronomers note, however, that even though SPT0418-47 has a disc and other features similar to those of spiral galaxies we see today, they expect it to evolve into a galaxy very different from the Milky Way, and join the class of elliptical galaxies, another type of galaxies that, alongside the spirals, inhabit the Universe today. This unexpected discovery suggests the early Universe may not be as chaotic as once believed and raises many questions on how a well-ordered galaxy could have formed so soon after the Big Bang. This ALMA finding follows the earlier discovery announced in May of a massive rotating disc seen at a similar distance. SPT0418-47 is seen in finer detail, thanks to the lensing effect, and has a bulge in addition to a disc, making it even more similar to our present-day Milky Way than the one studied previously. Future studies, including with ESO's Extremely Large Telescope, will seek to uncover how typical these 'baby' disc galaxies really are and whether they are commonly less chaotic than predicted, opening up new avenues for astronomers to discover how galaxies evolved.",Extremely young galaxy is Milky Way look-alike,4,0.2183698208994641
1713,"NASA's Dawn spacecraft gave scientists extraordinary close-up views of the dwarf planet Ceres, which lies in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. By the time the mission ended in October 2018, the orbiter had dipped to less than 22 miles (35 kilometers) above the surface, revealing crisp details of the mysterious bright regions Ceres had become known for. Scientists had figured out that the bright areas were deposits made mostly of sodium carbonate -- a compound of sodium, carbon, and oxygen. They likely came from liquid that percolated up to the surface and evaporated, leaving behind a highly reflective salt crust. But what they hadn't yet determined was where that liquid came from. By analyzing data collected near the end of the mission, Dawn scientists have concluded that the liquid came from a deep reservoir of brine, or salt-enriched water. By studying Ceres' gravity, scientists learned more about the dwarf planet's internal structure and were able to determine that the brine reservoir is about 25 miles (40 kilometers) deep and hundreds of miles wide. Ceres doesn't benefit from internal heating generated by gravitational interactions with a large planet, as is the case for some of the icy moons of the outer solar system. But the new research, which focuses on Ceres' 57-mile-wide (92-kilometer-wide) Occator Crater -- home to the most extensive bright areas -- confirms that Ceres is a water-rich world like these other icy bodies. The findings, which also reveal the extent of geologic activity in Occator Crater, appear in a special collection of papers published by Nature Astronomy, Nature Geoscience, and Nature Communications on Aug. 10. ""Dawn accomplished far more than we hoped when it embarked on its extraordinary extraterrestrial expedition,"" said Mission Director Marc Rayman of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. ""These exciting new discoveries from the end of its long and productive mission are a wonderful tribute to this remarkable interplanetary explorer."" Solving the Bright Mystery Long before Dawn arrived at Ceres in 2015, scientists had noticed diffuse bright regions with telescopes, but their nature was unknown. From its close orbit, Dawn captured images of two distinct, highly reflective areas within Occator Crater, which were subsequently named Cerealia Facula and Vinalia Faculae. (""Faculae"" means bright areas.) Scientists knew that micrometeorites frequently pelt the surface of Ceres, roughing it up and leaving debris. Over time, that sort of action should darken these bright areas. So their brightness indicates that they likely are young. Trying to understand the source of the areas, and how the material could be so new, was a main focus of Dawn's final extended mission, from 2017 to 2018. The research not only confirmed that the bright regions are young -- some less than 2 million years old; it also found that the geologic activity driving these deposits could be ongoing. This conclusion depended on scientists making a key discovery: salt compounds (sodium chloride chemically bound with water and ammonium chloride) concentrated in Cerealia Facula. On Ceres' surface, salts bearing water quickly dehydrate, within hundreds of years. But Dawn's measurements show they still have water, so the fluids must have reached the surface very recently. This is evidence both for the presence of liquid below the region of Occator Crater and ongoing transfer of material from the deep interior to the surface. The scientists found two main pathways that allow liquids to reach the surface. ""For the large deposit at Cerealia Facula, the bulk of the salts were supplied from a slushy area just beneath the surface that was melted by the heat of the impact that formed the crater about 20 million years ago,"" said Dawn Principal Investigator Carol Raymond. ""The impact heat subsided after a few million years; however, the impact also created large fractures that could reach the deep, long-lived reservoir, allowing brine to continue percolating to the surface."" Active Geology: Recent and Unusual In our solar system, icy geologic activity happens mainly on icy moons, where it is driven by their gravitational interactions with their planets. But that's not the case with the movement of brines to the surface of Ceres, suggesting that other large ice-rich bodies that are not moons could also be active. Some evidence of recent liquids in Occator Crater comes from the bright deposits, but other clues come from an assortment of interesting conical hills reminiscent of Earth's pingos -- small ice mountains in polar regions formed by frozen pressurized groundwater. Such features have been spotted on Mars, but the discovery of them on Ceres marks the first time they've been observed on a dwarf planet. On a larger scale, scientists were able to map the density of Ceres' crust structure as a function of depth -- a first for an ice-rich planetary body. Using gravity measurements, they found Ceres' crustal density increases significantly with depth, way beyond the simple effect of pressure. Researchers inferred that at the same time Ceres' reservoir is freezing, salt and mud are incorporating into the lower part of the crust. Dawn is the only spacecraft ever to orbit two extraterrestrial destinations -- Ceres and the giant asteroid Vesta -- thanks to its efficient ion propulsion system. When Dawn used the last of a key fuel, hydrazine, for a system that controls its orientation, it was neither able to point to Earth for communications nor to point its solar arrays at the Sun to produce electrical power. Because Ceres was found to have organic materials on its surface and liquid below the surface, planetary protection rules required Dawn to be placed in a long-duration orbit that will prevent it from impacting the dwarf planet for decades. JPL, a division of Caltech in Pasadena, California, manages Dawn's mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. Dawn is a project of the directorate's Discovery Program, managed by NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. JPL is responsible for overall Dawn mission science.

1714,"A large number of the valley networks scarring Mars's surface were carved by water melting beneath glacial ice, not by free-flowing rivers as previously thought, according to new UBC research published today in Nature Geoscience. The findings effectively throw cold water on the dominant ""warm and wet ancient Mars"" hypothesis, which postulates that rivers, rainfall and oceans once existed on the red planet. To reach this conclusion, lead author Anna Grau Galofre, former PhD student in the department of earth, ocean and atmospheric sciences, developed and used new techniques to examine thousands of Martian valleys. She and her co-authors also compared the Martian valleys to the subglacial channels in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago and uncovered striking similarities. ""For the last 40 years, since Mars's valleys were first discovered, the assumption was that rivers once flowed on Mars, eroding and originating all of these valleys,"" says Grau Galofre. ""But there are hundreds of valleys on Mars, and they look very different from each other. If you look at Earth from a satellite you see a lot of valleys: some of them made by rivers, some made by glaciers, some made by other processes, and each type has a distinctive shape. Mars is similar, in that valleys look very different from each other, suggesting that many processes were at play to carve them."" The similarity between many Martian valleys and the subglacial channels on Devon Island in the Canadian Arctic motivated the authors to conduct their comparative study. ""Devon Island is one of the best analogues we have for Mars here on Earth -- it is a cold, dry, polar desert, and the glaciation is largely cold-based,"" says co-author Gordon Osinski, professor in Western University's department of earth sciences and Institute for Earth and Space Exploration. In total, the researchers analyzed more than 10,000 Martian valleys, using a novel algorithm to infer their underlying erosion processes. ""These results are the first evidence for extensive subglacial erosion driven by channelized meltwater drainage beneath an ancient ice sheet on Mars,"" says co-author Mark Jellinek, professor in UBC's department of earth, ocean and atmospheric sciences. ""The findings demonstrate that only a fraction of valley networks match patterns typical of surface water erosion, which is in marked contrast to the conventional view. Using the geomorphology of Mars' surface to rigorously reconstruct the character and evolution of the planet in a statistically meaningful way is, frankly, revolutionary."" Grau Galofre's theory also helps explain how the valleys would have formed 3.8 billion years ago on a planet that is further away from the sun than Earth, during a time when the sun was less intense. ""Climate modelling predicts that Mars' ancient climate was much cooler during the time of valley network formation,"" says Grau Galofre, currently a SESE Exploration Post-doctoral Fellow at Arizona State University. ""We tried to put everything together and bring up a hypothesis that hadn't really been considered: that channels and valleys networks can form under ice sheets, as part of the drainage system that forms naturally under an ice sheet when there's water accumulated at the base."" These environments would also support better survival conditions for possible ancient life on Mars. A sheet of ice would lend more protection and stability of underlying water, as well as providing shelter from solar radiation in the absence of a magnetic field -- something Mars once had, but which disappeared billions of years ago. While Grau Galofre's research was focused on Mars, the analytical tools she developed for this work can be applied to uncover more about the early history of our own planet. Jellinek says he intends to use these new algorithms to analyze and explore erosion features left over from very early Earth history. ""Currently we can reconstruct rigorously the history of global glaciation on Earth going back about a million to five million years,"" says Jellinek. ""Anna's work will enable us to explore the advance and retreat of ice sheets back to at least 35 million years ago -- to the beginnings of Antarctica, or earlier -- back in time well before the age of our oldest ice cores. These are very elegant analytical tools.""","Early Mars was covered in ice sheets, not flowing rivers, researchers say",4,0.9056925908180846
1715,"Carbon nanotube fibers made at Rice University are now stronger than Kevlar and are inching up on the conductivity of copper. The Rice lab of chemical and biomolecular engineer Matteo Pasquali reported in Carbon it has developed its strongest and most conductive fibers yet, made of long carbon nanotubes through a wet spinning process. In the new study led by Rice graduate students Lauren Taylor and Oliver Dewey, the researchers noted that wet-spun carbon nanotube fibers, which could lead to breakthroughs in a host of medical and materials applications, have doubled in strength and conductivity every three years, a trend that spans almost two decades. While that may never mimic Moore's Law, which set a benchmark for computer chip advances for decades, Pasquali and his team are doing their part to advance the method they pioneered to make carbon nanotube fibers. The lab's threadlike fibers, with tens of millions of nanotubes in cross section, are being studied for use as bridges to repair damaged hearts, as electrical interfaces with the brain, for use in cochlear implants, as flexible antennas and for automotive and aerospace applications. They are also part of the Carbon Hub, a multiuniversity research initiative launched in 2019 by Rice with support from Shell, Prysmian and Mitsubishi to create a zero-emissions future. ""Carbon nanotube fibers have long been touted for their potential superior properties,"" Pasquali said. ""Two decades of research at Rice and elsewhere have made this potential a reality. Now we need a worldwide effort to increase production efficiency so these materials could be made with zero carbon dioxide emissions and potentially with concurrent production of clean hydrogen."" ""The goal of this paper is to put forth the record properties of the fibers produced in our lab,"" Taylor said. ""These improvements mean we're now surpassing Kevlar in terms of strength, which for us is a really big achievement. With just another doubling, we would surpass the strongest fibers on the market."" The flexible Rice fibers have a tensile strength of 4.2 gigapascals (GPa), compared to 3.6 GPa for Kevlar fibers. The fibers require long nanotubes with high crystallinity; that is, regular arrays of carbon-atom rings with few defects. The acidic solution used in the Rice process also helps reduce impurities that can interfere with fiber strength and enhances the nanotubes' metallic properties through residual doping, Dewey said. ""The length, or aspect ratio, of the nanotubes is the defining characteristic that drives the properties in our fibers,"" he said, noting the surface area of the 12-micrometer nanotubes used in Rice fiber facilitates better van der Waals bonds. ""It also helps that the collaborators who grow our nanotubes optimize for solution processing by controlling the number of metallic impurities from the catalyst and what we call amorphous carbon impurities."" The researchers said the fibers' conductivity has improved to 10.9 megasiemens (million siemens) per meter. ""This is the first time a carbon nanotube fiber has passed the 10 megasiemens threshold, so we've achieved a new order of magnitude for nanotube fibers,"" Dewey said. Normalized for weight, he said the Rice fibers achieve about 80% of the conductivity of copper. ""But we're surpassing platinum wire, which is a big achievement for us,"" Taylor said, ""and the fiber thermal conductivity is better than any metal and any synthetic fibers, except for pitch graphite fibers."" The lab's goal is to make the production of superior fibers efficient and inexpensive enough to be incorporated by industry on a large scale, Dewey said. Solution processing is common in the production of other kinds of fibers, including Kevlar, so factories could use familiar processes without major retooling. ""The benefit of our method is that it's essentially plug-and-play,"" he said. ""It's inherently scalable and fits in with the way synthetic fibers are already made."" ""There's a notion that carbon nanotubes are never going to be able to obtain all the properties that people have been hyping now for decades,"" Taylor said.

1716,"Patients who need surgery to fix major bone fractures use fewer opioid pills after their procedure if they're reminded of their values -- and those reminders don't necessarily need to come from a doctor, according to a new study published in the Journal of Medical Internet Research. ""We showed that opioid medication utilization could be decreased by more than a third in an at-risk patient population by delivering psychotherapy via a chatbot,"" said the study's lead author, Christopher Anthony, MD, the associate director of Hip Preservation at Penn Medicine and an assistant professor of Orthopaedic Surgery. ""While it must be tested with future investigations, we believe our findings are likely transferrable to other patient populations."" Although opioids can be appropriate to treat the pain that results from an injury like a broken leg or arm, there is a concern that a large prescription of opioids might be an on-ramp to dependence for many. The researchers -- who included Edward Octavio Rojas, MD, a resident in Orthopaedic Surgery at the University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics -- believe a low-effort, patient-centered approach to reducing the number of opioids taken can be a valuable method for cutting into the opioid epidemic. To test this approach, 76 patients who went to a Level 1 Trauma Center at the University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics for fractures that required a surgery to fix were randomly divided into two groups. Although each group received the same prescription of an opioid medication for pain, just one group was enrolled in a daily text-messaging program. That group received two daily text messages to their phones for two weeks after their procedure from an automated ""chatbot"" -- a computer that uses artificial intelligence to send messages -- starting the day after their surgery. The goal of each message was to help focus patients and hone their coping skills for the inevitable pain after such a procedure. While they don't expressly discourage using opioid pills, the messages, designed by a pain psychologist who specialized in acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), are designed to direct thoughts away from taking a painkiller. Each message fell under one of six ""core principles"": Values, Acceptance, Present Moment Awareness, Self-As-Context, Committed Action, and Diffusion. So, for example, a message a patient could receive under the Acceptance principle could be: ""Feelings of pain and feelings about your experience of pain are normal after surgery. Acknowledge and accept these feelings as part of the recovery process. Remember how you feel now is temporary and your healing process will continue. Call to mind pleasant feelings or thoughts that you experienced today."" Or a Committed Action message might urge a patient to work toward a life goal, even if some pain might be present. Overall, the patients who didn't receive the messages took 41 opioid tablets after their surgeries, on average. The group who were regularly contacted by the chatbot averaged just 26, a 37 percent difference. Moreover, they reported less pain, overall, just two weeks after their procedure. Importantly, the messages each patient received were not curated for their individual personality. This type of effectiveness was seen without the messages needing to be overly personalized. Combined with the using a chatbot instead of a human-intensive effort, this could be a low-cost, low-effort for orthopaedic and other procedures that provides significant protection from opioid dependence. ""A realistic goal for this type of work is to decrease opioid utilization to as few tablets as possible, with the ultimate goal being to eliminate the need for opioid medication in the setting of fracture care,"" Anthony said. This study was funded by a grant from the Orthopaedic Trauma Association.

1717,"Earth's magnetic field acts like a protective shield around the planet, repelling and trapping charged particles from the Sun. But over South America and the southern Atlantic Ocean, an unusually weak spot in the field -- called the South Atlantic Anomaly, or SAA -- allows these particles to dip closer to the surface than normal. Particle radiation in this region can knock out onboard computers and interfere with the data collection of satellites that pass through it -- a key reason why NASA scientists want to track and study the anomaly. The South Atlantic Anomaly is also of interest to NASA's Earth scientists who monitor the changes in magnetic field strength there, both for how such changes affect Earth's atmosphere and as an indicator of what's happening to Earth's magnetic fields, deep inside the globe. Currently, the SAA creates no visible impacts on daily life on the surface. However, recent observations and forecasts show that the region is expanding westward and continuing to weaken in intensity. It is also splitting -- recent data shows the anomaly's valley, or region of minimum field strength, has split into two lobes, creating additional challenges for satellite missions. A host of NASA scientists in geomagnetic, geophysics, and heliophysics research groups observe and model the SAA, to monitor and predict future changes -- and help prepare for future challenges to satellites and humans in space. It's what's inside that counts The South Atlantic Anomaly arises from two features of Earth's core: The tilt of its magnetic axis, and the flow of molten metals within its outer core. Earth is a bit like a bar magnet, with north and south poles that represent opposing magnetic polarities and invisible magnetic field lines encircling the planet between them. But unlike a bar magnet, the core magnetic field is not perfectly aligned through the globe, nor is it perfectly stable. That's because the field originates from Earth's outer core: molten, iron-rich and in vigorous motion 1800 miles below the surface. These churning metals act like a massive generator, called the geodynamo, creating electric currents that produce the magnetic field. As the core motion changes over time, due to complex geodynamic conditions within the core and at the boundary with the solid mantle up above, the magnetic field fluctuates in space and time too. These dynamical processes in the core ripple outward to the magnetic field surrounding the planet, generating the SAA and other features in the near-Earth environment -- including the tilt and drift of the magnetic poles, which are moving over time. These evolutions in the field, which happen on a similar time scale to the convection of metals in the outer core, provide scientists with new clues to help them unravel the core dynamics that drive the geodynamo. ""The magnetic field is actually a superposition of fields from many current sources,"" said Terry Sabaka, a geophysicist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. Regions outside of the solid Earth also contribute to the observed magnetic field. However, he said, the bulk of the field comes from the core. The forces in the core and the tilt of the magnetic axis together produce the anomaly, the area of weaker magnetism -- allowing charged particles trapped in Earth's magnetic field to dip closer to the surface. The Sun expels a constant outflow of particles and magnetic fields known as the solar wind and vast clouds of hot plasma and radiation called coronal mass ejections. When this solar material streams across space and strikes Earth's magnetosphere, the space occupied by Earth's magnetic field, it can become trapped and held in two donut-shaped belts around the planet called the Van Allen Belts. The belts restrain the particles to travel along Earth's magnetic field lines, continually bouncing back and forth from pole to pole. The innermost belt begins about 400 miles from the surface of Earth, which keeps its particle radiation a healthy distance from Earth and its orbiting satellites. However, when a particularly strong storm of particles from the Sun reaches Earth, the Van Allen belts can become highly energized and the magnetic field can be deformed, allowing the charged particles to penetrate the atmosphere. ""The observed SAA can be also interpreted as a consequence of weakening dominance of the dipole field in the region,"" said Weijia Kuang, a geophysicist and mathematician in Goddard's Geodesy and Geophysics Laboratory. ""More specifically, a localized field with reversed polarity grows strongly in the SAA region, thus making the field intensity very weak, weaker than that of the surrounding regions."" A pothole in space Although the South Atlantic Anomaly arises from processes inside Earth, it has effects that reach far beyond Earth's surface. The region can be hazardous for low-Earth orbit satellites that travel through it. If a satellite is hit by a high-energy proton, it can short-circuit and cause an event called single event upset or SEU. This can cause the satellite's function to glitch temporarily or can cause permanent damage if a key component is hit. In order to avoid losing instruments or an entire satellite, operators commonly shut down non-essential components as they pass through the SAA. Indeed, NASA's Ionospheric Connection Explorer regularly travels through the region and so the mission keeps constant tabs on the SAA's position. The International Space Station, which is in low-Earth orbit, also passes through the SAA. It is well protected, and astronauts are safe from harm while inside. However, the ISS has other passengers affected by the higher radiation levels: Instruments like the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation mission, or GEDI, collect data from various positions on the outside of the ISS. The SAA causes ""blips"" on GEDI's detectors and resets the instrument's power boards about once a month, said Bryan Blair, the mission's deputy principal investigator and instrument scientist, and a lidar instrument scientist at Goddard. ""These events cause no harm to GEDI,"" Blair said. ""The detector blips are rare compared to the number of laser shots -- about one blip in a million shots -- and the reset line event causes a couple of hours of lost data, but it only happens every month or so."" In addition to measuring the SAA's magnetic field strength, NASA scientists have also studied the particle radiation in the region with the Solar, Anomalous, and Magnetospheric Particle Explorer, or SAMPEX -- the first of NASA's Small Explorer missions, launched in 1992 and providing observations until 2012. One study, led by NASA heliophysicist Ashley Greeley as part of her doctoral thesis, used two decades of data from SAMPEX to show that the SAA is slowly but steadily drifting in a northwesterly direction. The results helped confirm models created from geomagnetic measurements and showed how the SAA's location changes as the geomagnetic field evolves. ""These particles are intimately associated with the magnetic field, which guides their motions,"" said Shri Kanekal, a researcher in the Heliospheric Physics Laboratory at NASA Goddard. ""Therefore, any knowledge of particles gives you information on the geomagnetic field as well."" Greeley's results, published in the journal Space Weather, were also able to provide a clear picture of the type and amount of particle radiation satellites receive when passing through the SAA, which emphasized the need for continuing monitoring in the region. The information Greeley and her collaborators garnered from SAMPEX's in-situ measurements has also been useful for satellite design. Engineers for the Low-Earth Orbit, or LEO, satellite used the results to design systems that would prevent a latch-up event from causing failure or loss of the spacecraft. Modeling a safer future for satellites In order to understand how the SAA is changing and to prepare for future threats to satellites and instruments, Sabaka, Kuang and their colleagues use observations and physics to contribute to global models of Earth's magnetic field. The team assesses the current state of the magnetic field using data from the European Space Agency's Swarm constellation, previous missions from agencies around the world, and ground measurements. Sabaka's team teases apart the observational data to separate out its source before passing it on to Kuang's team. They combine the sorted data from Sabaka's team with their core dynamics model to forecast geomagnetic secular variation (rapid changes in the magnetic field) into the future. The geodynamo models are unique in their ability to use core physics to create near-future forecasts, said Andrew Tangborn, a mathematician in Goddard's Planetary Geodynamics Laboratory. ""This is similar to how weather forecasts are produced, but we are working with much longer time scales,"" he said. ""This is the fundamental difference between what we do at Goddard and most other research groups modeling changes in Earth's magnetic field."" One such application that Sabaka and Kuang have contributed to is the International Geomagnetic Reference Field, or IGRF. Used for a variety of research from the core to the boundaries of the atmosphere, the IGRF is a collection of candidate models made by worldwide research teams that describe Earth's magnetic field and track how it changes in time. ""Even though the SAA is slow-moving, it is going through some change in morphology, so it's also important that we keep observing it by having continued missions,"" Sabaka said. ""Because that's what helps us make models and predictions."" The changing SAA provides researchers new opportunities to understand Earth's core, and how its dynamics influence other aspects of the Earth system, said Kuang. By tracking this slowly evolving ""dent"" in the magnetic field, researchers can better understand the way our planet is changing and help prepare for a safer future for satellites.",Researchers track slowly splitting 'dent' in Earth's magnetic field,4,0.8780519047861981
1718,"Like spirits passing between worlds, billions of invisible beings rise to meet the starlight, then descend into darkness at sunrise. Microscopic plankton's daily journey between the ocean's depths and surface holds the key to understanding crucial planetary processes, but has remained largely a mystery until now. A new Stanford-developed rotating microscope, outlined in a study published Aug. 17 in Nature Methods, offers for the first time a way to track and measure these enigmatic microorganisms' behaviors and molecular processes as they undertake on their daily vertical migrations. ""This is a completely new way of studying life in the ocean,"" said study first author Deepak Krishnamurthy, a mechanical engineering PhD student at Stanford. The innovation could provide a new window into the secret life of ocean organisms and ecosystems, said study senior author Manu Prakash, associate professor of bioengineering at Stanford. ""It opens scientific possibilities we had only dreamed of until now."" Oceanic mysteries On Earth, half of all the conversion of carbon to organic compounds occurs in the ocean, with plankton doing most of that work. The tiny creatures' outsized role in this process, known as carbon fixation, and other important planetary cycles has been hard to study in the ocean's vertically stratified landscape which involves vast depth and time scales. Conventional approaches to sampling plankton are focused on large populations of the microorganisms and have typically lacked the resolution to measure behaviors and processes of individual plankton over ecological scales. As a result, we know very little about microscale biological and molecular processes in the ocean, such as how plankton sense and regulate their depth or even how they can remain suspended in the water column despite having no appendages that aid in mobility. ""I could attach a tag to a whale and see where it goes, but as things get smaller and smaller it becomes extremely difficult to know and understand their native behavior,"" Prakash said. ""How do we get closer to the native behavior of a microscopic object, and give it the freedom that it deserves because the ocean is so large a space and extremely vertically oriented?"" To bridge the gap, Prakash and researchers in his lab developed a vertical tracking microscope based on what they call a ""hydrodynamic treadmill."" The idea involves a simple yet elegant insight: a circular geometry provides an infinite water column ring that can be used to simulate ocean depths. Organisms injected into this fluid-filled circular chamber move about freely as the device tracks them and rotates to accommodate their motion. A camera feeds full-resolution color images of the plankton and other microscopic marine critters into a computer for closed-loop feedback control. The device can also recreate depth characteristics in the ocean, such as light intensity, creating what the researchers call a ""virtual reality environment"" for single cells. The team has deployed the instrument for field testing at Stanford's Hopkins Marine Station in Monterey, in Puerto Rico and also on a research vessel off the coast of Hawaii. The innovative microscope has already revealed various microorganisms' behaviors previously unknown to science. For example, it exposed in minute detail how larvae of marine creatures from the Californian coast, such as the bat star, sea cucumber and Pacific sand dollar employ various methods to move through the sea, ranging from a steady hover to frequent changes in ciliary beat and swimming motion or blinks. This could allow scientists to better understand dispersal properties of these unique organisms in the open ocean. The device has also revealed the vertical swimming behaviors of single-celled organisms such as marine dinoflagellates, which could allow scientists to link these behaviors to ecological phenomena such as algal blooms. In Puerto Rico, Krishnamurthy and Prakash were shocked to observe a diatom, a microorganism with no swimming appendages, repeatedly change its own density to drop and rise in the water -- a puzzling behavior that still remains a mystery. ""It's as if someone told you a stone could float and then sink and then float again,"" Krishnamurthy said. Bringing the ocean to the lab Prakash credit the device's success to the interdisciplinary nature of his lab's team, which includes electrical, mechanical and optical engineers, as well as computer scientists, physicists, cell biologists, ecologists and biochemists. The team is working to extend the microscope's capabilities further by virtually mapping all aspects of the physical parameters that an organism experiences as it dives into depths of the ocean, including environmental and chemical cues and hydrostatic pressure. ""To truly understand biological processes at play in the ocean at smallest length scales, we are excited to both bring a piece of the ocean to the lab, and simultaneously bring a little piece of the lab to the ocean,"" said Prakash. Prakash is also a senior fellow at the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment; a member of Bio-X, the Maternal & Child Health Research Institute and the Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute; a faculty fellow at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute; and an investigator at the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub.

1719,"Northwestern University researchers have combined climate modeling with public health data to evaluate the impact of electric vehicles (EVs) on U.S. lives and the economy. A new study found that if EVs replaced 25% of combustion-engine cars currently on the road, the United States would save approximately $17 billion annually by avoiding damages from climate change and air pollution. In more aggressive scenarios -- replacing 75% of cars with EVs and increasing renewable energy generation -- savings could reach as much as $70 billion annually. ""Vehicle electrification in the United States could prevent hundreds to thousands of premature deaths annually while reducing carbon emissions by hundreds of millions of tons,"" said Daniel Peters, who led the study. ""This highlights the potential of co-beneficial solutions to climate change that not only curb greenhouse gas emissions but also reduce the health burden of harmful air pollution."" ""From an engineering and technological standpoint, people have been developing solutions to climate change for years,"" added Northwestern's Daniel Horton, senior author of the study. ""But we need to rigorously assess these solutions. This study presents a nuanced look at EVs and energy generation and found that EV adoption not only reduces greenhouse gases but saves lives."" The study was published online last week (August 13) in the journal GeoHealth. During this research, Peters was an undergraduate researcher in Horton's laboratory at Northwestern. He now works for the Environmental Defense Fund. Horton is an assistant professor of Earth and planetary sciences in Northwestern's Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences. To conduct the study, Horton, Peters and their team looked at vehicle fleet and emissions data from 2014. If 25% of U.S. drivers adopted EVs in 2014 -- and the power required to charge their batteries came from 2014's energy generation infrastructure -- then 250 million tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions would have been mitigated. Although the impact of carbon emissions on the climate is well documented, combustion engines also produce other harmful pollutants, such as particulate matter and the precursors to ground-level ozone. Such pollutants can trigger a variety of health problems, including asthma, emphysema, chronic bronchitis and ultimately premature death. After leaving tailpipes and smokestacks, pollutants interact with their environment, including background chemistry and meteorology. ""A good example is to look at nitrogen oxides (NOx), a group of chemicals produced by fossil-fuel combustion,"" Peters explained. ""NOx itself is damaging to respiratory health, but when it's exposed to sunlight and volatile organic compounds in the atmosphere, ozone and particulate matter can form."" To account for these interactions, the researchers used a chemistry-climate model developed at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory. Jordan Schnell, a postdoctoral fellow in Horton's lab, performed the model experiments that simultaneously simulate the atmosphere's weather and chemistry, including how emissions from combustion engines and power generation sources interact with each other and other emissions sources in their environments. With this model, the researchers simulated air pollutant changes across the lower 48 states, based on different levels of EV adoption and renewable energy generation. Then, they combined this information with publicly available county health data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). This combination enabled the research team to assess health consequences from the air quality changes caused by each electrification scenario. The research team assigned dollar values to the avoided climate and health damages that could be brought about by EV adoption by applying the social cost of carbon and value of statistical life metrics to their emission change results. These commonly used policy tools attach a price tag to long-term health, environmental and agricultural damages. ""The social cost of carbon and value of statistical life are much-studied and much-debated metrics,"" Horton said. ""But they are regularly used to make policy decisions. It helps put a tangible value on the consequences of emitting largely intangible gases into the public sphere that is our shared atmosphere.""","Widespread electric vehicle adoption would save billions of dollars, thousands of lives",4,0.8329743924973544
1720,"Like electronic devices, biological cells send and receive messages, but they communicate through very different mechanisms. Now, scientists report progress on tiny communication networks that overcome this language barrier, allowing electronics to eavesdrop on cells and alter their behavior -- and vice versa. These systems could enable applications including a wearable device that could diagnose and treat a bacterial infection or a capsule that could be swallowed to track blood sugar and make insulin when needed. The researchers will present their results today at the American Chemical Society (ACS) Fall 2020 Virtual Meeting & Expo. ""We want to expand electronic information processing to include biology,"" says principal investigator William E. Bentley, Ph.D. ""Our goal is to incorporate biological cells in the computational decision-making process."" The new technology Bentley's team developed relies on redox mediators, which move electrons around cells. These small molecules carry out cellular activities by accepting or giving up electrons through reduction or oxidation reactions. Because they can also exchange electrons with electrodes, thereby producing a current, redox mediators can bridge the gap between hardware and living tissue. In ongoing work, the team, which includes co-principal investigator Gregory F. Payne, Ph.D., is developing interfaces to enable this information exchange, opening the way for electronic control of cellular behavior, as well as cellular feedback that could operate electronics. ""In one project that we are reporting on at the meeting, we engineered cells to receive electronically generated information and transmit it as molecular cues,"" says Eric VanArsdale, a graduate student in Bentley's lab at the University of Maryland, who is presenting the latest results at the meeting. The cells were designed to detect and respond to hydrogen peroxide. When placed near a charged electrode that generated this redox mediator, the cells produced a corresponding amount of a quorum sensing molecule that bacteria use to signal to each other and modulate behavior by altering gene expression. In another recent project, the team engineered two types of cells to receive molecular information from the pathogenic bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa and convert it into an electronic signal for diagnostic and other applications. One group of cells produced the amino acid tyrosine, and another group made tyrosinase, which converts tyrosine into a molecule called L-DOPA. The cells were engineered so this redox mediator would be produced only if the bacteria released both a quorum sensing molecule and a toxin associated with a virulent stage of P. aeruginosa growth. The size of the resulting current generated by L-DOPA indicated the amount of bacteria and toxin present in a sample. If used in a blood test, the technique could reveal an infection and also gauge its severity. Because this information would be in electronic form, it could be wirelessly transmitted to a doctor's office and a patient's cell phone to inform them about the infection, Bentley says. ""Ultimately, we could engineer it so that a wearable device would be triggered to give the patient a therapeutic after an infection is detected."" The researchers envision eventually integrating the communication networks into autonomous systems in the body. For instance, a diabetes patient could swallow a capsule containing cells that monitor blood sugar. The device would store this blood sugar data and periodically send it to a cell phone, which would interpret the data and send back an electronic signal directing other cells in the capsule to make insulin as needed. As a step toward this goal, VanArsdale developed a biological analog of computer memory that uses the natural pigment melanin to store information and direct cellular signaling. In other work, Bentley's team and collaborators including Reza Ghodssi, Ph.D., recently designed a system to monitor conditions inside industrial bioreactors that hold thousands of gallons of cell culture for drug production. Currently, manufacturers track oxygen levels, which are vital to cells' productivity, with a single probe in the side of each vessel. That probe can't confirm conditions are uniform everywhere in the bioreactor, so the researchers developed ""smart marbles"" that will circulate throughout the vessel measuring oxygen. The marbles transmit data via Bluetooth to a cell phone that could adjust operating conditions. In the future, these smart marbles could serve as a communication interface to detect chemical signals within a bioreactor, send that information to a computer, and then transmit electronic signals to direct the behavior of engineered cells in the bioreactor. The team is working with instrument makers interested in commercializing the design, which could be adapted for environmental monitoring and other uses.",Bio-based communication networks could control cells in the body to treat conditions,4,0.15005669169826896
1721,"Spun by spiders and silkworms, silk has mystified human engineers who have yet to figure out how to artificially recreate this tough, fine fiber. But by combining silk, which is safe for use in the human body, with synthetic compounds, one research team is getting closer to developing new implantable composite materials with the best properties of both. Potential applications, which are still years away, could include structures that hold bone in place after surgery or replacements for the cartilage cushions in the knee. The researchers will present their results today at the American Chemical Society (ACS) Fall 2020 Virtual Meeting & Expo. ""Silk has great potential for use in biomedical applications,"" says Juan Guan, Ph.D., the project's principal investigator. ""Silk is versatile, and the human body tolerates it quite well, and can even degrade and absorb it."" Silk has a long history in medicine. Records of ancient doctors stitching up patients with fibers spun by silkworms date back nearly 2,000 years. And today, surgeons finish certain surgeries, such as those on the eye, with silk sutures. By combining silk and synthetic polymers, Guan and her colleagues at Beihang University are seeking to develop versatile new materials for use in medicine and, potentially, other fields as well. While other researchers have already developed composite materials with silk, they have typically worked with short fibers or the primary protein in silk. Guan, however, focuses on silk fabric woven from a long, single thread. Silkworms' cocoons can contain fibers nearly 5,000 feet long, and when used whole in fabric, such a fiber can more effectively distribute mechanical stress than a series of shorter, discrete ones, she says. In their studies, Guan's team uses silk from the common, domesticated silkworm Bombyx mori, as well as tougher, more stretchy fibers from the wild species Antheraea pernyi. The researchers combine this fabric with a polymer matrix, often an epoxy, which is used in adhesives. Together, the fabric and the polymer form a laminate -- similar to the durable surface covering found on some furniture -- which can then be cut into the shapes the researchers need. Guan and her colleagues say that the properties of these new materials could make them a better match for the tissues within the human body than what is being used today. For instance, they are collaborating with orthopedic doctors to devise structures resembling cages that temporarily hold vertebrae in place as they fuse after surgery, a task currently accomplished mostly using metal. The silk composites' hardness and stiffness is more compatible with bone, making them potentially more resilient yet more comfortable than metal structures, she says. There are challenges, however. The inside of the human body is moist, a potential problem because water can soften and weaken silk. In new experiments, Guan and her colleagues tested how silk-epoxy composite materials hold up when exposed to humidity or immersed in water. For use alongside bone, they must maintain a certain stiffness. The experiments showed that while this attribute decreased under wetter conditions, the composites remained stiff enough to function as implants, she says. While the epoxy attaches firmly to the silk fiber, it has a major drawback: The body can't break down the epoxy and absorb it, meaning it would not be suitable for implants intended to dissolve. So, Guan recently began working with biopolymers that, like silk, the body can break down and absorb. However, these composites have less internal cohesion than those that contain an epoxy. ""The key question is how to make the interface between the biopolymer and the silk fabric more robust,"" she says. The scientists are also looking to supplement silk with other types of fibers. In a recent study, they added carbon fibers into the mix. ""The notion of hybridizing silk with other fibers makes it possible to produce a rather nice spectrum of properties that you can optimize for a given application,"" says Robert O. Ritchie, Ph.D, an author of the carbon fiber study. Potential uses for these new structural materials, he says, could be anywhere: in the human body, or even in tennis rackets or on airplane engines.",Mixing silk with polymers could lead to better biomedical implants,4,0.0431069638402104
1722,"Imagine if every time you looked at a face, one side of the face always appeared distorted as if it were melting, resembling a painting by Salvador Dalí. This is the case for people who have a rare condition known as hemi-prosopometamophosia (hemi-PMO), which makes looking at faces discomforting. According to a new study published in Current Biology, some people with hemi-PMO see distortions to the same half of a person's face regardless of how the face is viewed. The results demonstrate that our visual system standardizes all the faces we perceive using the same process so they can be better compared to faces we have seen before. ""Every time we see a face, the brain adjusts our representation of that face so its size, viewpoint, and orientation is matched to faces stored in memory, just like computer face recognition systems such as those used by Facebook and Google,"" explains co-author Brad Duchaine, a professor of psychological and brain sciences and the principal investigator of the Social Perception Lab at Dartmouth College. ""By aligning the perceived face with faces stored in memory, it's much easier for us to determine whether the face is one we've seen before,"" he added. Hemi-PMO is a rare disorder that may occur after brain damage. When a person with this condition looks at a face, facial features on one side of the face appear distorted. The existence of hemi-PMO suggests the two halves of the face are processed separately. The condition usually dissipates over time, which makes it difficult to study. As a result, little is known about the condition or what it reveals about how human face processing normally works. The current study focused on a right-handed man in his early sixties (""Patient A.D."") with hemi-PMO whose symptoms have persisted for years. Like many with this condition, his distortions were caused by damage to a fiber bundle called the splenium that connects visual areas in the left hemisphere and right hemisphere of his brain. Five years ago while A.D. was watching television, he noticed that the right halves of people's faces looked like they had melted. Yet, the left sides of their faces looked normal. He looked in the mirror at his own face and noticed that the right side of his reflection was also distorted. In contrast, A.D. sees no distortions in other body parts or objects. The study involved two experiments. In the first, A.D. was presented with images of human faces and non-face images such as objects, houses and cars, and asked to report on distortions. For 17 of the 20 faces, he saw distortions. The distortions were always on the right side of the face and facial features usually appeared to drooped. For example, in one of the faces, A.D. reported that the right eye looked a lot bigger than the left eye while the right eyebrow, right side of the nose, and right side of the lips all hung down unnaturally. Two of the face photographs that did not elicit a distortion showed right profile views in which the right side of the face was not visible. Consistent with his daily experiences, A.D. did not see distortions in any of the non-face images. These results show that his condition affects brain processes specialized for faces. For the second part of the study, A.D. reported on distortions that he saw in 15 different faces that were presented in a variety of ways: in the left and right visual field, at different in-depth rotations, and at four picture plane rotations -- 0 degrees or upright, 90 degrees, 180 degrees or upside down, and 270 degrees. Regardless of how the faces were presented, A.D. continued to report that the distortions affected the same facial features. For example, even when a face was presented upside down, A.D. still saw the facial features distorted on the right side of the face even though the distortion now appeared on the left-hand side of the stimulus. The consistency of the location of A.D.'s distortion demonstrates that faces, regardless of viewpoint or orientation, are aligned to the same template similar to what computer face recognition systems do. In A.D.'s case, the output from that process is disrupted as it is passed from one brain hemisphere to the other due to his splenium lesion.","To perceive faces, your brain relies on a process similar to face recognition systems",4,0.286233409954492
1723,"Most of modern medicine has physical tests or objective techniques to define much of what ails us. Yet, there is currently no blood or genetic test, or impartial procedure that can definitively diagnose a mental illness, and certainly none to distinguish between different psychiatric disorders with similar symptoms. Experts at the University of Tokyo are combining machine learning with brain imaging tools to redefine the standard for diagnosing mental illnesses. ""Psychiatrists, including me, often talk about symptoms and behaviors with patients and their teachers, friends and parents. We only meet patients in the hospital or clinic, not out in their daily lives. We have to make medical conclusions using subjective, secondhand information,"" explained Dr. Shinsuke Koike, M.D., Ph.D., an associate professor at the University of Tokyo and a senior author of the study recently published in Translational Psychiatry. ""Frankly, we need objective measures,"" said Koike. Challenge of overlapping symptoms Other researchers have designed machine learning algorithms to distinguish between those with a mental health condition and nonpatients who volunteer as ""controls"" for such experiments. ""It's easy to tell who is a patient and who is a control, but it is not so easy to tell the difference between different types of patients,"" said Koike. The UTokyo research team says theirs is the first study to differentiate between multiple psychiatric diagnoses, including autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia. Although depicted very differently in popular culture, scientists have long suspected autism and schizophrenia are somehow linked. ""Autism spectrum disorder patients have a 10-times higher risk of schizophrenia than the general population. Social support is needed for autism, but generally the psychosis of schizophrenia requires medication, so distinguishing between the two conditions or knowing when they co-occur is very important,"" said Koike. Computer converts brain images into a world of numbers A multidisciplinary team of medical and machine learning experts trained their computer algorithm using MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) brain scans of 206 Japanese adults, a combination of patients already diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder or schizophrenia, individuals considered high risk for schizophrenia and those who experienced their first instance of psychosis, as well as neurotypical people with no mental health concerns. All of the volunteers with autism were men, but there was a roughly equal number of male and female volunteers in the other groups. Machine learning uses statistics to find patterns in large amounts of data. These programs find similarities within groups and differences between groups that occur too often to be easily dismissed as coincidence. This study used six different algorithms to distinguish between the different MRI images of the patient groups. The algorithm used in this study learned to associate different psychiatric diagnoses with variations in the thickness, surface area or volume of areas of the brain in MRI images. It is not yet known why any physical difference in the brain is often found with a specific mental health condition. Broadening the thin line between diagnoses After the training period, the algorithm was tested with brain scans from 43 additional patients. The machine's diagnosis matched the psychiatrists' assessments with high reliability and up to 85 percent accuracy. Importantly, the machine learning algorithm could distinguish between nonpatients, patients with autism spectrum disorder, and patients with either schizophrenia or schizophrenia risk factors. Machines help shape the future of psychiatry The research team notes that the success of distinguishing between the brains of nonpatients and individuals at risk for schizophrenia may reveal that the physical differences in the brain that cause schizophrenia are present even before symptoms arise and then remain consistent over time. The research team also noted that the thickness of the cerebral cortex, the top 1.5 to 5 centimeters of the brain, was the most useful feature for correctly distinguishing between individuals with autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia and typical individuals. This unravels an important aspect of the role thickness of the cortex plays in distinguishing between different psychiatric disorders and may direct future studies to understand the causes of mental illness. Although the research team trained their machine learning algorithm using brain scans from approximately 200 individuals, all of the data were collected between 2010 to 2013 on one MRI machine, which ensured the images were consistent. ""If you take a photo with an iPhone or Android camera phone, the images will be slightly different. MRI machines are also like this -- each MRI takes slightly different images, so when designing new machine learning protocols like ours, we use the same MRI machine and the exact same MRI procedure,"" said Koike. Now that their machine learning algorithm has proven its value, the researchers plan to begin using larger datasets and hopefully coordinate multisite studies to train the program to work regardless of the MRI differences.",Future mental health care may include diagnosis via brain scan and computer algorithm,4,0.3443232630067411
1724,"Hydrogenases can convert hydrogen just as efficiently as expensive platinum catalysts. In order to make them usable for biotechnological applications, researchers are deciphering how they work in detail. A team from Ruhr-Universität Bochum and the University of Oxford now reports in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) that the transfer of protons and electrons by the enzyme takes place spatially separated, but is nevertheless coupled and thus, a decisive factor for efficiency. The article was published online on 10 August 2020. Most efficient hydrogen producers The so called class of [FeFe]-hydrogenases, which are for example found in green algae, are nature's most efficient hydrogen producers. They can both produce and split hydrogen. The actual chemical reaction takes place at the active site buried deep inside the enzyme. ""The electrons and protons required for the reaction must therefore find an efficient way to get there,"" explains Dr. Oliver Lampret from the Photobiotechnology Research Group in Bochum, one of the authors of the paper. Electron transport takes place via an electric wire, so to speak, consisting of several iron-sulphur clusters. The protons are transported to the active centre via a proton transfer pathway consisting of five amino acids and one water molecule. ""Although it was known that there was a proton-coupled electron transfer mechanism, researchers had so far assumed that the coupling only takes place at the active centre itself,"" says Professor Thomas Happe, Head of the Photobiotechnology Research Group. Protein engineering makes coupling visible The team manipulated the hydrogenases in such a way that the proton transfer was significantly slower, but hydrogen could still be converted. Using dynamic electrochemistry, they showed that hydrogen conversion decreased significantly and more importantly, significant overpotentials were needed to catalyse the production or splitting of hydrogen. By manipulating the proton transfer pathway, the researchers had indirectly reduced the rate of electron transfer. ""As the two transfer routes are spatially separated, we assume that a cooperative long-range coupling of both processes is necessary for efficient catalysis,"" concludes Oliver Lampret. The findings should help to develop more efficient miniaturised hydrogenase catalysts in the future.

1725,"A study conducted by Associate Professor Alberto Salvo from the Department of Economics at the National University of Singapore (NUS) Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences revealed that households respond to ambient air pollution by increasing electricity consumption, which in turn increases the carbon emissions that are co-produced in supplying the electricity. The study, set in Singapore, revealed that better air quality will bring about climate co-benefits -- in reducing electricity generation via lower household demand, and thus mitigating carbon emissions. Assoc Prof Salvo said, ""Urban areas in developing Asian nations are home to an expanding base of energy consumers, with energy supply likely to remain carbon intensive for decades in the absence of major technological or regulatory shifts. Understanding what drives energy demand across the socioeconomic distribution of Singapore households can provide insight on the future energy demand of urban populations in the region's cities as incomes rise. This is important for policymakers when forecasting and influencing future emissions paths in the context of climate change."" The results of the study were published in the Journal of the Association of Environmental and Resource Economists in July. The link between air pollution and household energy demand The study examined utility meter readings of 130,000 households -- a 1-in-10 random sample of all households in Singapore -- from 2012 to 2015. The same household's energy consumption was examined over time and compared with concurrent PM2.5 measurements (fine particles less than 2.5 micrometres in diameter) from the air-monitoring network, which is the standard for measuring air pollution. The findings showed that overall electricity demand grew by 1.1 per cent when PM2.5 rose by 10 micrograms per cubic metre (?g/m³). The reasons were two-fold: (i) increased air pollution led to households staying indoors more to mitigate the pollution impact; and (ii) PM2.5 pollution led to the closing of windows, and running of air-conditioners and air purifiers more intensively either to reduce indoor particle levels or provide relief from indoor heat. Besides electricity, the study found that households exposed to air pollution consumed more natural gas. Another study by Assoc Prof Salvo that was published in 2018 found that households consumed more water from the grid when exposed to air pollution. In terms of research design, the study had to contend with the fact that air pollution is not only a driver of electricity demand but also a product of fossil-fuel based electricity generation. ""It was necessary to separate cause from effect. To do that, periodical land burning across Southeast Asia, which causes transboundary haze, was used as an instrument,"" Assoc Prof Salvo said. Delving deeper, the study found that PM2.5 had a larger percentage impact on electricity demand as household income and air conditioning access increase. It was observed that when PM2.5 increased by 10 ?g/m³, electricity consumption among condominium dwellers increased by 1.5 per cent, compared to a 0.75 per cent increase by households in one- to two-room apartments. This income differential was due to PM2.5 inducing higher-income households to turn on air-conditioners and air purifiers when at home. The 1.5 per cent increase in electricity consumption is equivalent to running the air-conditioning unit for another 10 hours per month. At the time of study, 14 per cent of one- and two-room apartments had air-conditioning, compared with 99 per cent of condominium apartments. To complement the observational evidence from utility meters, a review of product catalogues on air conditioners revealed that air-conditioner manufacturers promote indoor air quality as an additional product attribute to cooling. A 311-person survey on home energy behaviour also found that haze pollution induced sleeping with the windows closed, less dining out, and the increased use of the air conditioner and air purifier. Forecasting energy demand and mitigating climate change Forty per cent of the developing world's population live in the tropics, and PM2.5 pollution ranges between 20 and 200 ?g/m³. However, only 8 per cent of the tropics' three billion people currently have air conditioners, compared to 76 per cent in Singapore. Assoc Prof Salvo said, ""This study shows that households care about the quality of the air that they breathe, revealed through their spending on utilities, in particular, to power air-conditioners. Cleaner urban air will reduce energy demand, as households engage in less defensive behaviour, and this helps to mitigate carbon emissions."" He added, ""At the same time, lower-income households are less able to afford such defensive spending on utilities. This observed inequality in defensive behaviour may also exacerbate health inequalities, especially in developing countries. Overall, this research can contribute towards longer-term forecasting of energy demand as developing Asian countries face the twin issues of a rising urban middle class exposed to air pollution, and the need to cope with climate change."" Moving forward, Assoc Prof Salvo will continue to explore -- with a focus on Asia -- how households respond to environmental harms and what such responses reveal about their preferences for environmental quality.","Air pollution is a driver of residential electricity demand, study finds",4,0.4425217598693767
1726,"Many quantum materials have been nearly impossible to simulate mathematically because the computing time required is too long. Now engineers have demonstrated a way to considerably reduce the computing time. This could accelerate the development of materials for energy-efficient IT technologies of the future. Supercomputers around the world work around the clock on research problems. In principle, even novel materials can be simulated in computers in order to calculate their magnetic and thermal properties as well as their phase transitions. The gold standard for this kind of modelling is known as the quantum Monte Carlo method. Wave-Particle Dualism However, this method has an intrinsic problem: due to the physical wave-particle dualism of quantum systems, each particle in a solid-state compound not only possesses particle-like properties such as mass and momentum, but also wave-like properties such as phase. Interference causes the ""waves"" to be superposed on each other, so that they either amplify (add) or cancel (subtract) each other locally. This makes the calculations extremely complex. It is referred to the sign problem of the quantum Monte Carlo method. Minimisation of the problem ""The calculation of quantum material characteristics costs about one million hours of CPU on mainframe computers every day,"" says Prof. Jens Eisert, who heads the joint research group at Freie Universität Berlin and the HZB. ""This is a very considerable proportion of the total available computing time."" Together with his team, the theoretical physicist has now developed a mathematical procedure by which the computational cost of the sign problem can be greatly reduced. ""We show that solid-state systems can be viewed from very different perspectives. The sign problem plays a different role in these different perspectives. It is then a matter of dealing with the solid-state system in such a way that the sign problem is minimised,"" explains Dominik Hangleiter, first author of the study that has now been published in Science Advances. From simple spin systems to more complex ones For simple solid-state systems with spins, which form what are known as Heisenberg ladders, this approach has enabled the team to considerably reduce the computational time for the sign problem. However, the mathematical tool can also be applied to more complex spin systems and promises faster calculation of their properties. ""This provides us with a new method for accelerated development of materials with special spin properties,"" says Eisert. These types of materials could find application in future IT technologies for which data must be processed and stored with considerably less expenditure of energy.",Mathematical tool helps calculate properties of quantum materials more quickly,4,0.7934570478484626

Specifically, their research has revealed that improving quantum compilation design could help achieve computation speeds up to 45 times faster than currently demonstrated. The computer scientists created a family of benchmark quantum circuits with known optimal depths or sizes. In computer design, the smaller the circuit depth, the faster a computation can be completed. Smaller circuits also imply more computation can be packed into the existing quantum computer. Quantum computer designers could use these benchmarks to improve design tools that could then find the best circuit design.

""Now that we have revealed the large optimality gap, we are on the way to develop better quantum compilation tools, and we hope the entire quantum research community will as well."" Cong and graduate student Daniel (Bochen) Tan tested their benchmarks in four of the most used quantum compilation tools. A study detailing their research was published in IEEE Transactions on Computers, a peer-reviewed journal. Tan and Cong have made the benchmarks, named QUEKO, open source and available on the software repository GitHub. Quantum computers utilize quantum mechanics to perform a great deal of computations simultaneously, which has the potential to make them exponentially faster and more powerful than today's best supercomputers. But many issues need to be addressed before these devices can move out of the research lab. For example, due to the sensitive nature of how quantum circuits work, tiny environmental changes, such as small temperature fluctuations, can interfere with quantum computation. When that happens, the quantum circuits are called decoherent -- which is to say they have lost the information once encoded in them. ""If we can consistently halve the circuit depth by better layout synthesis, we effectively double the time it takes for a quantum device to become decoherent,"" Cong said. ""This compilation research could effectively extend that time, and it would be the equivalent to a huge advancement in experimental physics and electrical engineering,"" Cong added. ""So we expect these benchmarks to motivate both academia and the industry to develop better layout synthesis tools, which in turn will help drive advances in quantum computing."" Cong and his colleagues led a similar effort in the early 2000s to optimize integrated circuit design in classical computers. That research effectively pushed two generations of advances in computer processing speeds, using only optimized layout design, which shortened the distance between the transistors that comprise the circuit. This cost-efficient improvement was achieved without any other major investments in technological advances, such as physically shrinking the circuits themselves. ""Quantum processors in existence today are extremely limited by environmental interference, which puts severe restrictions on the length of computations that can be performed,"" said Mark Gyure, executive director of the UCLA Center for Quantum Science and Engineering, who was not involved in this study. ""That's why the recent research results from Professor Cong's group are so important because they have shown that most implementations of quantum circuits to date are likely extremely inefficient and more optimally compiled circuits could enable much longer algorithms to be executed. This could result in today's processors solving much more interesting problems than previously thought. That's an extremely important advance for the field and incredibly exciting.""

1728,"Nature's blueprint for the human limb is a carefully layered structure with stiff bone wrapped in layers of different soft tissue, like muscle and skin, all bound to each other perfectly. Achieving this kind of sophistication using synthetic materials to build biologically inspired robotic parts or multicomponent, complex machines has been an engineering challenge. By tweaking the chemistry of a single polymer, researchers at Texas A&M University and the U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command Army Research Laboratory have created a whole family of synthetic materials that range in texture from ultra-soft to extremely rigid. The researchers said their materials are 3D printable, self-healing, recyclable and they naturally adhere to each other in air or underwater. Their findings are detailed in the May issue of the journal Advanced Functional Materials. ""We have made an exciting group of materials whose properties can be fine-tuned to get either the softness of rubber or the strength of load-bearing plastics,"" said Dr. Svetlana Sukhishvili, professor in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering and a corresponding author on the study. ""Their other desirable characteristics, like 3D printability and the ability to self-heal within seconds, make them suited for not just more realistic prosthetics and soft robotics, but also ideal for broad military applications such as agile platforms for air vehicles and futuristic self-healing aircraft wings."" Synthetic polymers are made up of long strings of repeating molecular motifs, like beads on a chain. In elastomeric polymers, or elastomers, these long chains are lightly crosslinked, giving the materials a rubbery quality. However, these crosslinks can also be used to make the elastomers more rigid by increasing the number of crosslinks. Although previous studies have manipulated the density of crosslinks to make elastomers stiffer, the resulting change in mechanical strength was generally permanent. ""Crosslinks are like stitches in a piece of cloth, the more stitches you have, the stiffer the material gets and vice versa,"" said Sukhishvili. ""But instead of having these 'stitches' be permanent, we wanted to achieve dynamic and reversible crosslinking so that we can create materials that are recyclable."" So, the researchers focused their attention on the molecules involved in the crosslinking. First, they chose a parent polymer, called prepolymer, and then chemically studded these prepolymer chains with two types of small crosslinking molecules -- furan and maleimide. By increasing the number of these molecules in the prepolymer, they found that they could create materials stiffer. In this way, the hardest material they created was 1,000 times stronger than the softest. However, these crosslinks are also reversible. Furan and maleimide participate in a type of reversible chemical bonding. Put simply, in this reaction, furan and maleimide pairs can ""click"" and ""unclick"" depending on temperature. When the temperature is high enough, these molecules come apart from the polymer chains and the materials soften. At room temperature, the materials harden since the molecules quickly click back together, once again forming crosslinks. Thus, if there is any tear in these materials at ambient temperatures, the researchers showed that furan and maleimide automatically re-click, healing the gap within a few seconds. The researchers noted that the temperatures at which the crosslinkers dissociate or unclick from the prepolymer chains are relatively the same for different stiffness levels. This property is useful for 3D printing with these materials. Regardless of whether they are soft or hard, the materials can be melted at the same temperature and then used as printing ink. ""By modifying the hardware and processing parameters in a standard 3D printer, we were able to use our materials to print complex 3D objects layer by layer,"" said Dr. Frank Gardea, research engineer in the United States Army Research Laboratory and a corresponding author on the study. ""The unique advantage of our materials is that the layers that make up the 3D part can be of vastly different stiffness."" As the 3D part cools to room temperature, he added that the different layers join seamlessly, precluding the need for curing or any other chemical processing. Consequently, the 3D-printed parts can easily be melted using high heat and then recycled as printing ink. The researchers also noted that their materials are reprogrammable. In other words, after being set into one shape, they can be made to change into a different shape using just heat. In the future, the researchers plan to increase the functionality of their new materials by amplifying its multifaceted properties outlined in the current study. ""Right now, we can easily achieve around 80% self-healing at room temperature, but we would like to reach 100%. Also, we want to make our materials responsive to other stimuli other than temperature, like light,"" said Gardea. ""Further down the road, we'd like to explore introducing some low-level intelligence so that these materials know to autonomously adapt without needing a user to initiate the process.""

1729,"Oak Ridge National Laboratory researchers have developed artificial intelligence software for powder bed 3D printers that assesses the quality of parts in real time, without the need for expensive characterization equipment. The software, named Peregrine, supports the advanced manufacturing ""digital thread"" being developed at ORNL that collects and analyzes data through every step of the manufacturing process, from design to feedstock selection to the print build to material testing. ""Capturing that information creates a digital 'clone' for each part, providing a trove of data from the raw material to the operational component,"" said Vincent Paquit, who leads advanced manufacturing data analytics research as part of ORNL's Imaging, Signals and Machine Learning group. ""We then use that data to qualify the part and to inform future builds across multiple part geometries and with multiple materials, achieving new levels of automation and manufacturing quality assurance."" The digital thread supports the factory of the future in which custom parts are conceived using computer-aided design, or CAD, and then produced by self-correcting 3D printers via an advanced communications network, with less cost, time, energy and materials compared with conventional production. The concept requires a process control method to ensure that every part rolling off printers is ready to install in essential applications like cars, airplanes, and energy facilities. To devise a control method for surface-visible defects that would work on multiple printer models, ORNL researchers created a novel convolutional neural network -- a computer vision technique that mimics the human brain in quickly analyzing images captured from cameras installed on the printers. The Peregrine software uses a custom algorithm that processes pixel values of images, taking into account the composition of edges, lines, corners and textures. If Peregrine detects an anomaly that may affect the quality of the part, it automatically alerts operators so adjustments can be made. The software is well suited to powder bed printers. These printers distribute a fine layer of powder over a build plate, with the material then melted and fused using a laser or electron beam. Binder jetting systems rely on a liquid binding agent rather than heat to fuse powdered materials. The systems print layer by layer, guided by the CAD blueprint, and are popular for the production of metal parts. However, during the printing process, problems such as uneven distribution of the powder or binding agent, spatters, insufficient heat, and some porosities can result in defects at the surface of each layer. Some of those issues may happen in such a very short timeframe that they may go undetected by conventional techniques. ""One of the fundamental challenges for additive manufacturing is that you're caring about things that occur on length-scales of tens of microns and happening in microseconds, and caring about that for days or even weeks of build time,"" said ORNL's Luke Scime, principal investigator for Peregrine. ""Because a flaw can form at any one of those points at any one of those times, it becomes a challenge to understand the process and to qualify a part."" Peregrine is being tested on multiple printers at ORNL, including as part of the Transformational Challenge Reactor (TCR) Demonstration Program that is pursuing the world's first additively manufactured nuclear reactor. TCR is leveraging ORNL's rich history in nuclear science and engineering, materials science and advanced manufacturing to develop a microreactor with newer materials in less time at a lower cost, ensuring the future of this important carbon-free energy source. ""For TCR in particular, you could have a scenario in which the regulator will want detailed data on how a part was manufactured, and we can provide specs with the database built using Peregrine,"" Scime said. ""Establishing correlations between these signatures collected during manufacturing and performance during operation will be the most data-rich and informed process for qualifying critical nuclear reactor components,"" said Kurt Terrani, TCR program director. ""The fact that it may be accomplished during manufacturing to eliminate the long and costly conventional qualification process is the other obvious benefit."" ORNL researchers stress that by making the Peregrine software machine-agnostic -- able to be installed on any powder bed system -- printer manufacturers can save development time while offering an improved product to industry. Peregrine produces a common image database that can be transferred to each new machine to train new neural networks quickly, and it runs on a single high-powered laptop or desktop. Standard cameras were used in the research, ranging in most cases from 4 to 20 megapixels and installed so they produce images of the print bed at each layer. The software has been tested successfully on seven powder bed printers at ORNL so far, including electron beam melting, laser powder bed, and binder jetting, as detailed in the journal Additive Manufacturing. ""Anything we can do to help operators and designers know what works and what doesn't helps with the confidence that the part will be okay for use,"" Scime said. ""When you have a 3D map of every pixel where the network thinks there is an anomaly and what it thinks the problem is, it opens up a whole world of understanding of the build process."" As the monitoring system has evolved, Scime said researchers are able to combine the image data with data from other sources such as the printer's log files, the laser systems and operator notes, allowing parts to be uniquely identified and statistics from all parts tracked and evaluated. The AI software was developed at the Manufacturing Demonstration Facility at ORNL, a U.S. Department of Energy user facility that works closely with industry to develop, test and refine nearly every type of modern advanced manufacturing technology. ""There's no place else like the MDF where this machine-agnostic algorithm could have been developed, simply because we have so many machines and so many builds going on all the time in the course of our research,"" Scime said. ""Access to data is key. Here, we have the ability to place sensors easily and the technicians to make sure everything works and that we're getting our data. With the variety of scientific expertise available here, it's been easy to find experts to help with all the challenges involved."" In other process control work, MDF researchers are developing methods to monitor for defects on the subsurface of builds and to detect porosity that may form in deeper layers, including the use of photodiodes and high-speed cameras. ""We've been doing welding for hundreds of years, but additive has only been around for a couple of decades and we don't know what the problems look like in some cases,"" Scime said. ""Machine learning techniques allow us to collect and analyze a lot of data quickly. We can then identify those problems and gain the knowledge we need to better understand and prevent anomalies.""",AI software enables real-time 3D printing quality assessment,4,0.20236779789659987
1730,"A new design for light-emitting diodes (LEDs) developed by a team including scientists at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) may hold the key to overcoming a long-standing limitation in the light sources' efficiency. The concept, demonstrated with microscopic LEDs in the lab, achieves a dramatic increase in brightness as well as the ability to create laser light -- all characteristics that could make it valuable in a range of large-scale and miniaturized applications. The team, which also includes scientists from the University of Maryland, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center, detailed its work in a paper published today in the peer-reviewed journal Science Advances. Their device shows an increase in brightness of 100 to 1,000 times over conventional tiny, submicron-sized LED designs. ""It's a new architecture for making LEDs,"" said NIST's Babak Nikoobakht, who conceived the new design. ""We use the same materials as in conventional LEDs. The difference in ours is their shape."" LEDs have existed for decades, but the development of bright LEDs won a Nobel prize and ushered in a new era of lighting. However, even modern LEDs have a limitation that frustrates their designers. Up to a point, feeding an LED more electricity makes it shine more brightly, but soon the brightness drops off, making the LED highly inefficient. Called ""efficiency droop"" by the industry, the issue stands in the way of LEDs being used in a number of promising applications, from communications technology to killing viruses. While their novel LED design overcomes efficiency droop, the researchers did not initially set out to solve this problem. Their main goal was to create a microscopic LED for use in very small applications, such as the lab-on-a-chip technology that scientists at NIST and elsewhere are pursuing. The team experimented with a whole new design for the part of the LED that shines: Unlike the flat, planar design used in conventional LEDs, the researchers built a light source out of long, thin zinc oxide strands they refer to as fins. (Long and thin are relative terms: Each fin is only about 5 micrometers in length, stretching about a tenth of the way across an average human hair's breadth.) Their fin array looks like a tiny comb that can extend to areas as large as 1 centimeter or more. ""We saw an opportunity in fins, as I thought their elongated shape and large side facets might be able to receive more electrical current,"" Nikoobakht said. ""At first we just wanted to measure how much the new design could take. We started increasing the current and figured we'd drive it until it burned out, but it just kept getting brighter."" Their novel design shone brilliantly in wavelengths straddling the border between violet and ultraviolet, generating about 100 to 1,000 times as much power as typical tiny LEDs do. Nikoobakht characterizes the result as a significant fundamental discovery. ""A typical LED of less than a square micrometer in area shines with about 22 nanowatts of power, but this one can produce up to 20 microwatts,"" he said. ""It suggests the design can overcome efficiency droop in LEDs for making brighter light sources."" ""It's one of the most efficient solutions I have seen,"" said Grigory Simin, a professor of electrical engineering at the University of South Carolina who was not involved in the project. ""The community has been working for years to improve LED efficiency, and other approaches often have technical issues when applied to submicrometer wavelength LEDs. This approach does the job well."" The team made another surprising discovery as they increased the current. While the LED shone in a range of wavelengths at first, its comparatively broad emission eventually narrowed to two wavelengths of intense violet color. The explanation grew clear: Their tiny LED had become a tiny laser. ""Converting an LED into a laser takes a large effort. It usually requires coupling a LED to a resonance cavity that lets the light bounce around to make a laser,"" Nikoobakht said. ""It appears that the fin design can do the whole job on its own, without needing to add another cavity."" A tiny laser would be critical for chip-scale applications not only for chemical sensing, but also in next-generation hand-held communications products, high-definition displays and disinfection. ""It's got a lot of potential for being an important building block,"" Nikoobakht said. ""While this isn't the smallest laser people have made, it's a very bright one. The absence of efficiency droop could make it useful.""

1731,"If you want to enhance a locust to be used as a bomb-sniffing bug, there are a few technical challenges that need solving before sending it into the field. Is there some way to direct the locust -- to tell it where to go to do its sniffing? And because the locusts can't speak (yet), is there a way to read the brain of these cyborg bugs to know what they're smelling? For that matter, can locusts even smell explosives? Yes and yes to the first two questions. Previous research from Washington University in St. Louis has demonstrated both the ability to control the locusts and the ability to read their brains, so to speak, to discern what it is they are smelling. And now, thanks to new research from the McKelvey School of Engineering, the third question has been settled. The answer, again: 'yes.' In a pre-proof published online Aug. 6 in the journal Biosensors and Bioelectronics: X, researchers showed how they were able to hijack a locust's olfactory system to both detect and discriminate between different explosive scents -- all within a few hundred milliseconds of exposure. They were also able to optimize a previously developed biorobotic sensing system that could detect the locusts' firing neurons and convey that information in a way that told researchers about the smells the locusts were sensing. ""We didn't know if they'd be able to smell or pinpoint the explosives because they don't have any meaningful ecological significance,"" said Barani Raman, professor of biomedical engineering. ""It was possible that they didn't care about any of the cues that were meaningful to us in this particular case."" Previous work in Raman's lab led to the discovery that the locust olfactory system could be decoded as an 'or-of-ands' logical operation. This allowed researchers to determine what a locust was smelling in different contexts. With this knowledge, the researchers were able to look for similar patterns when they exposed locusts to vapors from TNT, DNT, RDX, PETN and ammonium nitrate -- a chemically diverse set of explosives. ""Most surprisingly,"" Raman said, ""we could clearly see the neurons responded differently to TNT and DNT, as well as these other explosive chemical vapors."" With that crucial piece of data, Raman said, ""We were ready to get to work. We were optimized."" Now they knew that the locusts could detect and discriminate between different explosives, but in order to seek out a bomb, a locust would have to know from which direction the odor emanated. Enter the ""odor box and locust mobile."" ""You know when you're close to the coffee shop, the coffee smell is stronger, and when you're farther away, you smell it less? That's what we were looking at,"" Raman said. The explosive vapors were injected via a hole in the box where the locust sat in a tiny vehicle. As the locust was driven around and sniffed different concentrations of vapors, researchers studied its odor-related brain activity. The signals in the bugs' brains reflected those differences in vapor concentration. The next step was to optimize the system for transmitting the locusts' brain activity. The team, which included Shantanu Chakrabartty, the Clifford W. Murphy Professor in the Preston M. Green Department of Electrical & Systems Engineering, and Srikanth Singamaneni, the Lilyan & E. Lisle Hughes Professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering & Materials Science, focused the breadth of their expertise on the tiny locust. In order to do the least harm to the locusts, and to keep them stable in order to accurately record their neural activity, the team came up with a new surgical procedure to attach electrodes that didn't hinder the locusts' movement. With their new instrumentation in place, the neuronal activity of a locust exposed to an explosive smell was resolved into a discernible odor-specific pattern within 500 milliseconds. ""Now we can implant the electrodes, seal the locust and transport them to mobile environments,"" Raman said. One day, that environment might be one in which Homeland Security is searching for explosives. The idea isn't as strange as it might first sound, Raman said. ""This is not that different from in the old days, when coal miners used canaries,"" he said. ""People use pigs for finding truffles. It's a similar approach -- using a biological organism -- this is just a bit more sophisticated.""

1732,"While many programs and initiatives have been implemented to address the prevalence of substance abuse among homeless youth in the United States, they don't always include data-driven insights about environmental and psychological factors that could contribute to an individual's likelihood of developing a substance use disorder. Now, an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm developed by researchers at the College of Information Sciences and Technology at Penn State could help predict susceptibility to substance use disorder among young homeless individuals, and suggest personalized rehabilitation programs for highly susceptible homeless youth. ""Proactive prevention of substance use disorder among homeless youth is much more desirable than reactive mitigation strategies such as medical treatments for the disorder and other related interventions,"" said Amulya Yadav, assistant professor of information sciences and technology and principal investigator on the project. ""Unfortunately, most previous attempts at proactive prevention have been ad-hoc in their implementation."" ""To assist policymakers in devising effective programs and policies in a principled manner, it would be beneficial to develop AI and machine learning solutions which can automatically uncover a comprehensive set of factors associated with substance use disorder among homeless youth,"" added Maryam Tabar, a doctoral student in informatics and lead author on the project paper that will be presented at the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) conference in late August. In that project, the research team built the model using a dataset collected from approximately 1,400 homeless youth, ages 18 to 26, in six U.S. states. The dataset was collected by the Research, Education and Advocacy Co-Lab for Youth Stability and Thriving (REALYST), which includes Anamika Barman-Adhikari, assistant professor of social work at the University of Denver and co-author of the paper. The researchers then identified environmental, psychological and behavioral factors associated with substance use disorder among them -- such as criminal history, victimization experiences and mental health characteristics. They found that adverse childhood experiences and physical street victimization were more strongly associated with substance use disorder than other types of victimization (such as sexual victimization) among homeless youth. Additionally, PTSD and depression were found to be more strongly associated with substance use disorder than other mental health disorders among this population, according to the researchers. Next, the researchers divided their dataset into six smaller datasets to analyze geographical differences. The team trained a separate model to predict substance abuse disorder among homeless youth in each of the six states -- which have varying environmental conditions, drug legalization policies and gang associations. The team observed several location-specific variations in the association level of some factors, according to Tabar. ""By looking at what the model has learned, we can effectively find out factors which may play a correlational role with people suffering from substance abuse disorder,"" said Yadav. ""And once we know these factors, we are much more accurately able to predict whether somebody suffers from substance use."" He added, ""So if a policy planner or interventionist were to develop programs that aim to reduce the prevalence of substance abuse disorder, this could provide useful guidelines."" Other authors on the KDD paper include Dongwon Lee, associate professor, and Stephanie Winkler, doctoral student, both in the Penn State College of Information Sciences and Technology; and Heesoo Park of Sungkyunkwan University. Yadav and Barman-Adhikari are collaborating on a similar project through which they have developed a software agent that designs personalized rehabilitation programs for homeless youth suffering from opioid addiction. Their simulation results show that the software agent -- called CORTA (Comprehensive Opioid Response Tool Driven by Artificial Intelligence) -- outperforms baselines by approximately 110% in minimizing the number of homeless youth suffering from opioid addiction. ""We wanted to understand what the causative issues are behind people developing opiate addiction,"" said Yadav. ""And then we wanted to assign these homeless youth to the appropriate rehabilitation program."" Yadav explained that data collected by more than 1,400 homeless youth in the U.S. was used to build AI models to predict the likelihood of opioid addiction among this population. After examining issues that could be the underlying cause of opioid addiction -- such as foster care history or exposure to street violence -- CORTA solves novel optimization formulations to assign personalized rehabilitation programs. ""For example, if a person developed an opioid addiction because they were isolated or didn't have a social circle, then perhaps as part of their rehabilitation program they should talk to a counselor,"" explained Yadav. ""On the other hand, if someone developed an addiction because they were depressed because they couldn't find a job or pay their bills, then a career counselor should be a part of the rehabilitation plan."" Yadav added, ""If you just treat the condition medically, once they go back into the real world, since the causative issue still remains, they're likely to relapse."" Yadav and Barman-Adhikari will present their paper on CORTA, ""Optimal and Non-Discriminative Rehabilitation Program Design for Opioid Addiction Among Homeless Youth,"" at the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence-Pacific Rim International Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI-PRICAI), which was to be held in July 2020 but is being rescheduled due to the novel coronavirus pandemic.

1733,"Swansea University researchers from the College of Engineering have captured the moments a fluid reacts like a solid through a new method of fluid observation under pressurised conditions. The research comes from the Complex Flow Lab, based within the Institute for Innovative Materials, Processing and Numerical Technologies (IMPACT). The lab studies the intricate flow patterns that often develop in granular materials, porous media, and complex fluids such as foams, gels and pastes. This latest study looks at fluids that have a solid-like response to stress, a phenomenon called Discontinuous Shear Thickening (DST). This is when liquid (in this case, a corn starch mixture) abruptly thickens and becomes solid when disturbed. The tests involved a new method of observation involving a high-speed camera with results offering an innovative approach to future engineering practices. Research author Dr Deren Ozturk, who recently completed his PhD in this area, comments: ""Our findings are of particular interest to the burgeoning DST field of research as it is a novel visual indication of DST behaviour that could be used to calibrate future theoretical models. The DST phenomenon is being researched for unique engineering applications such as soft body armour, ""smart"" speed bumps, and food production. The research team used regular kitchen corn starch mixed with water. This is then placed in a narrow cell; pressurised air is released into the corn starch-water fluid and forces its way through. How the air escapes is filmed using a high-speed camera to visualise invasion patterns -- which either present as fluid-like fingers or solid-like fractures depending on the concentration of corn starch and the pressure in the air."" Dr Ozturk continues: ""We used corn starch (as a model system for the wider class of shear thickening materials) as it is convenient, widely available and shows a dramatic shear thickening response. As this kind of invasion experiment (which we have a lot of experience with) had not been previously performed on a DST fluid, our main objective was to just try them in the hopes of seeing something interesting. Our main hypothesis was that the fluid would ""fracture"" like a solid if given enough stress. This would be a great thing to see since a fluid ought to exhibit wide finger patterns. We were, therefore, delighted to see a narrow fracturing response as this meant we had developed a new kind of experiment to probe the conditions for which DST is observed."" Co-author Dr Bjornar Sandnes, head of the Complex Flow Lab, comments: ""What is particularly interesting about the corn starch studied here is that friction can be turned on or off like a switch. When only gently disturbed, the grains repel each other and since they are not in contact there is no friction and the material flows like a liquid. Disturb it more forcefully however, and the grains are pushed into contact such that friction stops the grains freely sliding. The material then behaves more like a solid, and that is when we observe fracturing in our experiments."" The paper is published in Communications Physics. It is part of the project: Frictional flow patterns shaped by viscous and capillary forces (FriicFlow), funded by EPSRC -- a study examining how friction between grains carried by a fluid changes the flow behaviour of the fluid.

1734,"A special type of aurora, draped east-west across the night sky like a glowing pearl necklace, is helping scientists better understand the science of auroras and their powerful drivers out in space. Known as auroral beads, these lights often show up just before large auroral displays, which are caused by electrical storms in space called substorms. Previously, scientists weren't sure if auroral beads are somehow connected to other auroral displays as a phenomenon in space that precedes substorms, or if they are caused by disturbances closer to Earth's atmosphere. But powerful new computer models combined with observations from NASA's Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms -- THEMIS -- mission have provided the first strong evidence of the events in space that lead to the appearance of these beads, and demonstrated the important role they play in our near space environment. ""Now we know for certain that the formation of these beads is part of a process that precedes the triggering of a substorm in space,"" said Vassilis Angelopoulos, principal investigator of THEMIS at the University of California, Los Angeles. ""This is an important new piece of the puzzle."" By providing a broader picture than can be seen with the three THEMIS spacecraft or ground observations alone, the new models have shown that auroral beads are caused by turbulence in the plasma -- a fourth state of matter, made up of gaseous and highly conductive charged particles -- surrounding Earth. The results, recently published in the journals Geophysical Research Letters and Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics, will ultimately help scientists better understand the full range of swirling structures seen in the auroras. ""THEMIS observations have now revealed turbulences in space that cause flows seen lighting up the sky as of single pearls in the glowing auroral necklace,"" said Evgeny Panov, lead author on one of the new papers and THEMIS scientist at the Space Research Institute of the Austrian Academy of Sciences. ""These turbulences in space are initially caused by lighter and more agile electrons, moving with the weight of particles 2000 times heavier, and which theoretically may develop to full-scale auroral substorms."" Mysteries of Auroral Beads Formation Auroras are created when charged particles from the Sun are trapped in Earth's magnetic environment -- the magnetosphere -- and are funneled into Earth's upper atmosphere, where collisions cause hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen atoms and molecules to glow. By modelling the near-Earth environment on scales from tens of miles to 1.2 million miles, the THEMIS scientists were able to show the details of how auroral beads form. As streaming clouds of plasma belched by the Sun pass Earth, their interaction with the Earth's magnetic field creates buoyant bubbles of plasma behind Earth. Like a lava lamp, imbalances in the buoyancy between the bubbles and heavier plasma in the magnetosphere creates fingers of plasma 2,500 miles wide that stretch down towards Earth. Signatures of these fingers create the distinct bead-shaped structure in the aurora. ""There's been a realization that, all summed up, these relatively little transient events that happen around the magnetosphere are somehow important,"" said David Sibeck, THEMIS project scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. ""We have only recently gotten to the point where computing power is good enough to capture the basic physics in these systems."" Now that scientists understand the auroral beads precede substorms, they want to figure out how, why and when the beads might trigger full-blown substorm. At least in theory, the fingers may tangle magnetic field lines and cause an explosive event known as magnetic reconnection, which is well known to create full-scale substorms and auroras that fill the nightside sky. New Models Open New Doors Since its launch in 2007, THEMIS has been taking detailed measurements as it passes through the magnetosphere in order to understand the causes of the substorms that lead to auroras. In its prime mission, THEMIS was able to show that magnetic reconnection is a primary driver of substorms. The new results highlight the importance of structures and phenomenon on smaller scales -- those hundreds and thousands of miles across as compared to ones spanning millions of miles. ""In order to understand these features in the aurora, you really need to resolve both global and smaller, local scales. That's why it was so challenging up to now,"" said Slava Merkin, co-author on one of the new papers and scientist at NASA's Center for Geospace Storms headquartered at Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland. ""It requires very sophisticated algorithms and very big supercomputers."" The new computer simulations almost perfectly match THEMIS and ground observations. After the initial success of the new computer models, THEMIS scientists are eager to apply them to other unexplained auroral phenomena. Particularly in explaining small-scale structures, computer models are essential as they can help interpret what happens in between the spaces where the three THEMIS spacecraft pass. ""There's lots of very dynamic, very small-scale structures that people see in the auroras which are hard to connect to the larger picture in space since they happen very quickly and on very small scales,"" said Kareem Sorathia, lead author on one of the new papers and scientist at NASA's Center for Geospace Storms headquartered at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.

1735,"Drones that blow pollen-laden bubbles onto blossoms could someday help farmers pollinate their crops. Rather than relying on bees and other pollinating insects — which are dwindling worldwide as a result of climate change (SN: 7/9/15), pesticide use (SN: 10/5/17) and other factors — farmers can spray or swab pollen onto crops themselves. But machine-blown plumes can waste many grains of pollen, and manually brushing pollen onto plants is labor-intensive. Materials chemist Eijiro Miyako of the Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology in Nomi imagines outsourcing pollination to automatous drones that deliver pollen grains to individual flowers. His original idea involved a pollen-coated drone rubbing grains onto flowers, but that treatment damaged the blossoms (SN: 3/7/17). Then, while blowing bubbles with his son, Miyako realized that bubbles might be a gentler means of delivery. To that end, Miyako and his colleague Xi Yang, an environmental scientist also at JAIST, devised a pollen-containing solution that a drone toting a bubble gun could blow onto crops. To test the viability of their pollen-loaded bubbles, the researchers used this technique to pollinate by hand pear trees in an orchard. Those trees bore about as much fruit as trees pollinated using a traditional method of hand pollination, the researchers report online June 17 in iScience. Among various commercially available bubble solutions, Miyako and Yang found that pollen grains remained most healthy and viable in one made with lauramidopropyl betaine — a chemical used in cosmetics and personal care products. Using that solution as their base, the researchers added pollen-protecting ingredients, like calcium and potassium, along with a polymer to make the bubbles sturdy enough to withstand winds generated by drone propellers. The researchers blew pollen bubbles at flowers on three pear trees in an orchard. On average, 95 percent of the 50 pollinated blossoms on each tree formed fruits. That was comparable to another set of three similar trees pollinated by hand with a standard pollen brush. Only about 58 percent of flowers on three trees that relied on insects and wind to deliver pollen bore fruit. To test the feasibility of applying this bubble treatment with flying robots, Miyako and Yang armed a drone with a bubble gun and blew pollen bubbles at fake lilies while flying by at two meters per second. More than 90 percent of the lilies were hit with bubbles, but many more bubbles missed the blooms. Making drone pollination practical would require flying robots that can recognize flowers and deftly target specific blossoms, the researchers say. Not everyone is convinced that building robotic pollinators is a good idea. Simon Potts, a sustainable land management researcher at the University of Reading in England, sees this technology as a “piece of smart engineering being shoehorned to solve a problem which can be solved in … more effective and sustainable ways.” In 2018, Potts and colleagues published a study in Science of the Total Environment, arguing that protecting natural pollinators is a better way to safeguard plant pollination than building robotic bees. Insects, the researchers noted, are more adept pollinators than any machine and don’t disrupt existing ecosystems. Miyako and Yang say their bubble solution was biocompatible, but Potts worries that dousing flowers in human-made substances could dissuade insects from visiting those trees. Roboticist Yu Gu of West Virginia University in Morgantown, who designs robotic pollinators but was not involved in the new work, says that building robotic bees and supporting insect populations are not mutually exclusive. “We’re not hoping to take over for bees, or any other natural pollinator,” he says. “What we’re trying to do is complement them.” Where there is a shortage of winged workers to pollinate crops, farmers could one day use robots “as a Plan B,” he says. No pun intended.",Bubble-blowing drones may one day aid artificial pollination,4,0.28611141230202086
1736,"Scientists can’t yet rebuild someone with bionic body parts. They don’t have the technology. But a new artificial eye brings cyborgs one step closer to reality. This device, which mimics the human eye’s structure, is about as sensitive to light and has a faster reaction time than a real eyeball. It may not come with the telescopic or night vision capabilities that Steve Austin had in The Six Million Dollar Man television show, but this electronic eyepiece does have the potential for sharper vision than human eyes, researchers report in the May 21 Nature. “In the future, we can use this for better vision prostheses and humanoid robotics,” says engineer and materials scientist Zhiyong Fan of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. The human eye owes its wide field of view and high-resolution eyesight to the dome-shaped retina — an area at the back of the eyeball covered in light-detecting cells. Fan and colleagues used a curved aluminum oxide membrane, studded with nanosize sensors made of a light-sensitive material called a perovskite (SN: 7/26/17), to mimic that architecture in their synthetic eyeball. Wires attached to the artificial retina send readouts from those sensors to external circuitry for processing, just as nerve fibers relay signals from a real eyeball to the brain. The artificial eyeball registers changes in lighting faster than human eyes can — within about 30 to 40 milliseconds, rather than 40 to 150 milliseconds. The device can also see dim light about as well as the human eye. Although its 100-degree field of view isn’t as broad as the 150 degrees a human eye can take in, it’s better than the 70 degrees visible to ordinary flat imaging sensors. In theory, this synthetic eye could perceive a much higher resolution than the human eye, because the artificial retina contains about 460 million light sensors per square centimeter. A real retina has about 10 million light-detecting cells per square centimeter. But that would require separate readings from each sensor. In the current setup, each wire plugged into the synthetic retina is about one millimeter thick, so big that it touches many sensors at once. Only 100 such wires fit across the back of the retina, creating images that have 100 pixels. Eye spy The design for a new artificial eye (illustrated) is based on the structure of the human eye. At the back of the eyeball, a synthetic retina is embedded with nanoscale light sensors. Those sensors measure light that passes through the lens at the front of the eye. Wires attached to the back of the retina ferry signals from those sensors to external circuitry for processing, similar to the way nerve fibers connect the eyeball to the brain. To show that thinner wires could be connected to the artificial eyeball for higher resolution, Fan’s team used a magnetic field to attach a small array of metal needles, each 20 to 100 micrometers thick, to nanosensors on the synthetic retina one by one. “It’s like a surgical operation,” Fan says. The researchers’ current method of creating individual ultrasmall pixels is impractical, says Hongrui Jiang, an electrical engineer at the University of Wisconsin–Madison whose commentary on the study appears in the same issue of Nature. “For a few hundred nanowires, okay, fine, but how about millions?” Engineers will need a much more efficient way to manufacture vast arrays of tiny wires on the back of the artificial eyeball to give it superhuman sight, he says.",A new artificial eye mimics and may outperform human eyes,4,0.2521249095142477
1737,"A truly all-terrain rover on the moon or Mars may need to put a little wiggle in its walk. Wheeled rovers have trouble crossing the soft soil that covers large swaths of lunar and Martian terrain. NASA’s Spirit rover, for example, met its end after getting stuck in a sand trap on Mars in 2009 (SN: 11/12/09). But a new rover design could spare future robotic explorers that fate. The new rover model can move its four wheels up and down and sweep them back and forth. In lab experiments, a mini plastic version of the rover used combinations of wheel sweeping and spinning to trundle up hills of loose grains that would stop a simple wheeled bot in its tracks, researchers report May 13 in Science Robotics. Future rovers based on this design could scout out slopes of soft lunar soil near the moon’s poles for resources like water ice (SN: 12/16/19) or explore other similar areas. See how a new planetary rover design can navigate soft soils without getting stuck, like the Mars rover Spirit did in 2009. This rover has wheels that can lift up and down and sweep back and forth, giving the vehicle a range of motion that could help it trundle across loose soil on the moon or Mars. Physicist Daniel Goldman of Georgia Tech in Atlanta and colleagues tested the mini rover in a tilted bed of poppy seeds meant to roughly mimic lunar soil. Just spinning the rover’s wheels on even a shallow incline caused the vehicle to sink into the seeds and get stuck. But spinning the wheels and sweeping them back in a paddling motion allowed the rover to scoot forward — at least for shallow slopes. To reliably climb hills with sharper inclines, steeper than about 15 degrees from horizontal, the rover had to switch up its strategy. The vehicle spun its two front wheels to shove seeds ahead of it under its belly, effectively lowering the slope of the hill the rover had to climb. Meanwhile, the rover’s back wheels paddled side to side, kicking seeds from underneath the rover to behind it, allowing the vehicle to trudge uphill.",Wiggling wheels could keep future rovers trucking in loose lunar soil,4,0.42284405135468717
1738,"For about a week in 1960, radio astronomer Frank Drake thought he might have discovered aliens. He had pointed the National Radio Astronomy Observatory’s new 26-meter telescope at the star Epsilon Eridani on April 8 of that year, and within minutes, the instruments went wild. The telescope’s readout device, a chart recorder that used a pen to scratch out signatures of incoming signals on paper, scribbled erratically. A speaker connected to the telescope blared a train of strong pulses — just the kind of transmission expected from an intelligent sender. Drake was stunned. Could finding E.T. really be this easy? It wasn’t. When the telescope found the signal again several days later, a radio antenna pointed in different direction also picked up the noise. The signal wasn’t otherworldly at all; it was coming from an earthly source, like an airplane. Drake never picked up any interstellar broadcasts during his two months observing Epsilon Eridani and another sunlike star, Tau Ceti, with the radio telescope in West Virginia (SN: 4/30/60). But that first foray into the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, or SETI, sparked a growing field of efforts to scout out fellow intelligent creatures among the stars. And now, with recent discoveries in astronomy, new technologies and a flush of new money, SETI is in renaissance. In April 1960, radio astronomer Frank Drake used a 26-meter telescope at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in West Virginia (pictured) to observe two nearby, sunlike stars for alien radio broadcasts. The observing campaign, which he dubbed Project Ozma, was the world’s first modern search for extraterrestrial intelligence. “It’s really difficult to overstate how much the field has been transformed” in the last few years, says Andrew Siemion, director of the University of California, Berkeley’s SETI Research Center. Bigger and better telescopes are probing deeper into the night sky. Sophisticated computational tools are poring over massive datasets on increasing numbers of stars and at a wider variety of frequencies. Observatories around the world are performing regular observations as part of Breakthrough Listen — a $100 million effort funded by Israeli-Russian billionaires Yuri and Julia Milner to conduct the most comprehensive search for extraterrestrials yet (SN: 7/20/15). So far, SETI scientists have found nothing but radio silence. Still, they are undeterred. They’ve scoured only a tiny fraction of the places E.T. could be (SN: 9/30/18). And SETI’s collective observing power will make scientists 1,000 times more likely to find E.T. during this decade than they were in the 2010s, Siemion says. This is, he says, “a boom time for SETI.” Eyes on the sky For decades, the hunt for intelligent aliens languished on the fringes of the scientific establishment (SN: 1/28/19), viewed by many researchers as a “strange, boutiquey sort of thing that’s not really astronomy,” says Siemion, principal investigator for Breakthrough Listen. Short-lived U.S. federal funding for the field abruptly ended in 1993, after which “SETI went underground and became very insular.” But SETI’s profile is changing, as our understanding of the universe evolves. Back when Drake was making his observations, we hadn’t yet laid eyes on a planet around another star. Within just the last decade, we’ve discovered thousands of exoplanets, giving new credence to arguments that life beyond Earth is entirely possible (SN: 10/4/19). In February, Breakthrough Listen released the largest ever stockpile of SETI observations for members of the astronomical community to analyze. The dataset, collected by the Parkes radio telescope in Australia, the Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia and the Automated Planet Finder in California, included a survey of radio emissions from the disk of the Milky Way and the region around its core supermassive black hole. The behemoth 100-meter Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia is one of several observatories around the globe now contributing observations to Breakthrough Listen, the most comprehensive search for extraterrestrial life yet. “For finding very advanced civilizations, I think the galactic center is very exciting,” Siemion says. There, he speculates that some super tech-savvy aliens could have built an extremely powerful radio transmitter charged by the Milky Way’s supermassive black hole. To find alien civilizations working with more modest radio equipment comparable to our own, searchers look to nearby stars. That was the approach that Sofia Sheikh, an astronomer at Penn State, took in analyzing Breakthrough Listen observations of 20 of the sun’s stellar neighbors. All of those stars are in positions relative to Earth that would allow any aliens around those stars to see Earth orbiting in front of the sun — the same way that telescopes like TESS spot exoplanets (SN: 1/8/19). Those aliens might therefore be able detect Earth’s presence and target our planet with a message. Sheikh and colleagues came up empty in their search. “Reporting null results isn’t fun,” she says of her analysis, which was posted at arXiv.org on February 14 and submitted to the Astrophysical Journal. But it does tell other astronomers “this particular space has already been searched, go search somewhere else,” she says. Given the vast cosmic real estate where E.T. might be, checking out every little stellar neighborhood helps. New observatories joining the Breakthrough Listen cohort will start looking in a lot of other places in the next few years. The MeerKAT array in South Africa is gearing up to survey 1 million nearby stars. The Very Large Array in New Mexico, seen in the 1997 film Contact, is getting its first SETI instrument and will start looking for aliens in the background of its observations for other astronomy studies in 2021. Building better filters Getting more eyes on the sky is a key part of SETI. But while telescopes are heaping up a massive haystack of data, there’s still the task of searching for any needles buried within. And it could take picking through the same data more than once. New computer algorithms can always revisit old observations to search for blips that previous analyses missed. Often in radio astronomy, “the most interesting discoveries are not made on the first or the second or even the third analysis of the dataset,” Siemion says. For example, brief, brilliant flashes of radio waves from distant galaxies called fast radio bursts were first discovered in a reexamination of old data from the Parkes telescope (SN: 7/25/14). In SETI, the perennial challenge is devising techniques to better distinguish potential alien signals from radio interference by earthly technology. SETI scientists are usually seeking the same kind of tight, well-defined radio transmissions that human electronics produce. Such signals are easily distinguishable from radio waves emanating from natural sources, such as stars or galaxies, which tend to vary slowly over time or be smeared out across many frequencies. But that means scientists have to judge whether any promising signals they detect are coming from deep space or from a nearby a cell phone or satellite. One way of doing this is to point a telescope at a target, like a star, then somewhere else. Any radio signals that appear when the telescope is pointed in both directions are probably humanmade radio interference. Conventional computer algorithms detect changes between on-star and off-star observations simply by comparing the amount of energy detected in each observation. But if a faint alien transmission overlaps in the sky with earthly noise, a basic energy-detection algorithm may mistakenly discount everything it sees as humanmade noise. Some researchers hope artificial intelligence will be better than rigid energy-detection algorithms at detecting subtle changes between on- and off-star observations. While at the Berkeley SETI Research Center, applied machine learning researcher Yunfan Gerry Zhang taught an AI to recognize radio interference from human technology by showing it thousands of observations from the Green Bank Telescope. Using its learned sense of what earthly radio interference looked like, the AI could accurately pick out humanmade noise that was mixed into on-star observations. If such an algorithm were to detect radio signals from a star that didn’t qualify as humanmade noise, the AI could flag that star for researchers as a potential source of alien transmissions. Zhang’s team presented the AI at the 2018 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing as a tool for finding oddities in future SETI investigations. Looking for lasers Radio waves, the focus of mainstream SETI, are not the only means of sending interstellar messages. Aliens could also encode information in nanosecond laser pulses. Though lasers were first suggested as potential interstellar beacons in 1961, most SETI searches have followed Drake in looking for radio communications — partly because radio waves are low energy, and so possibly a more cost-effective way to package interstellar mail. But optical light could also be a practical interstellar beacon if focused into a narrow laser beam, argue proponents of this approach, called optical SETI or OSETI. Fast laser flashes would be would be detected as a bunch of photons hitting the telescope all at once, as opposed to the steady trickle of incoming photons from background starlight. As a result, for the nanosecond duration of the laser pulse, it could outshine surrounding stars. And no known astrophysical sources produce nanosecond optical blips. “Optical SETI is still in its infancy, or early toddler phase,” compared with radio SETI, says Shelley Wright, an astrophysicist at the University of California, San Diego. But if used in tandem with radio scans of the sky, OSETI efforts can expand the search into entirely different mode of communication. To take the search for alien laser signals to the next level, researchers have proposed building four dedicated PANOSETI observatories — two in the Northern Hemisphere, two in the south. The observatories’ collective field of view (projected onto the sky in this animation) would cover the entire observable night sky to keep a continual lookout for interstellar laser beacons. In July 2019, the VERITAS telescope array at the Whipple Observatory in Arizona joined Breakthrough Listen. This telescope quartet was built to watch for brief flashes of blue “Cherenkov” light generated by astrophysical gamma rays hitting Earth’s atmosphere. But its fast cameras are also well suited to looking for E.T.’s laser beams. The VERITAS Breakthrough Listen effort involves both new optical stellar observations and a review of old VERITAS data. Already, some of those analyses have garnered results, even if somewhat disappointing. Nine hours of observations taken from 2009 to 2015 of Tabby’s Star — once suspected of holding an alien megastructure in its orbit due to its bizarre periodic dimming (SN: 1/3/18) — found no alien laser beacons, the researchers reported in the Astrophysical Journal Letters in 2016. Wright and colleagues hope to dramatically expand OSETI with new facilities. While previous OSETI searches, including VERITAS, have targeted specific stars for only minutes at a time, Wright’s team has drawn up a blueprint for four dedicated SETI observatories to keep constant vigil for alien laser pulses across the entire observable sky. This observatory concept, dubbed PANOSETI, was described at the SPIE Astronomical Telescopes + Instrumentation meeting in Austin, Texas, in July 2018. Each observatory would be a dome covered in 88 lenses with optical and near-infrared detectors. One pair of observatories in the Northern Hemisphere would keep watch over the northern sky, while a second pair in the south would keep tabs on the southern sky. Two observatories in two different locations would have to keep watch over the same part of the sky to ensure that anything a single observatory detected wasn’t a glitch or an effect caused by local light pollution, Wright says — the same way a pair of far-flung LIGO detectors teamed up to detect cosmic ripples called gravitational waves (SN: 2/11/16). “Nobody would have believed LIGO without a secondary site,” she says. Double-checking potential detections would be absolutely crucial for a claim as extraordinary as receiving a greeting from E.T.",New search methods are ramping up the hunt for alien intelligence,4,0.24863964112543135
1739,"When it comes to identifying scents, a “neuromorphic” artificial intelligence beats other AI by more than a nose. The new AI learns to recognize smells more efficiently and reliably than other algorithms. And unlike other AI, this system can keep learning new aromas without forgetting others, researchers report online March 16 in Nature Machine Intelligence. The key to the program’s success is its neuromorphic structure, which resembles the neural circuitry in mammalian brains more than other AI designs. This kind of algorithm, which excels at detecting faint signals amidst background noise and continually learning on the job, could someday be used for air quality monitoring, toxic waste detection or medical diagnoses. The new AI is an artificial neural network, composed of many computing elements that mimic nerve cells to process scent information (SN: 5/2/19). The AI “sniffs” by taking in electrical voltage readouts from chemical sensors in a wind tunnel that were exposed to plumes of different scents, such as methane or ammonia. When the AI whiffs a new smell, that triggers a cascade of electrical activity among its nerve cells, or neurons, which the system remembers and can recognize in the future. Like the olfactory system in the mammal brain, some of the AI’s neurons are designed to react to chemical sensor inputs by emitting differently timed pulses. Other neurons learn to recognize patterns in those blips that make up the odor’s electrical signature. This brain-inspired setup primes the neuromorphic AI for learning new smells more than a traditional artificial neural network, which starts as a uniform web of identical, blank slate neurons. If a neuromorphic neural network is like a sports team whose players have assigned positions and know the rules of the game, an ordinary neural network is initially like a bunch of random newbies. As a result, the neuromorphic system is a quicker, nimbler study. Just as a sports team may need to watch a play only once to understand the strategy and implement it in new situations, the neuromorphic AI can sniff a single sample of a new odor to recognize the scent in the future, even amidst other unknown smells. In contrast, a bunch of beginners may need to watch a play many times to reenact the choreography — and still struggle to adapt it to future game-play scenarios. Likewise, a standard AI has to study a single scent sample many times, and still might not recognize it when the scent is mixed up with other odors. Thomas Cleland of Cornell University and Nabil Imam of Intel in San Francisco pitted their neuromorphic AI against a traditional neural network in a smell test of 10 odors. To train, the neuromorphic system sniffed a single sample of each odor. The traditional AI underwent hundreds of training trials to learn each odor. During the test, each AI sniffed samples in which a learned smell was only 20 to 80 percent of the overall scent — mimicking real-world conditions where target smells are often intermingled with other aromas. The neuromorphic AI identified the right smell 92 percent of the time. The standard AI achieved 52 percent accuracy. Priyadarshini Panda, a neuromorphic engineer at Yale University, is impressed by the neuromorphic AI’s keen sense of smell in muddled samples. The new AI’s one-and-done learning strategy is also more energy-efficient than traditional AI systems, which “tend to be very power hungry,” she says (SN: 9/26/18). Another perk of the neuromorphic setup is that the AI can keep learning new smells after its original training if new neurons are added to the network, similar to the way that new cells continually form in the brain. As new neurons are added to the AI, they can become attuned to new scents without disrupting the other neurons. It’s a different story for traditional AI, where the neural connections involved in recognizing a certain odor, or set of odors, are more broadly distributed across the network. Adding a new smell to the mix is liable to disturb those existing connections, so a typical AI struggles to learn new scents without forgetting others — unless it’s retrained from scratch, using both the original and new scent samples. To demonstrate this, Cleland and Imam trained their neuromorphic AI and a standard AI to specialize in recognizing toluene, which is used to make paints and fingernail polish. Then, the researchers tried to teach the neural networks to recognize acetone, an ingredient of nail polish remover. The neuromorphic AI simply added acetone to its scent-recognition repertoire, but the standard AI couldn’t learn acetone without forgetting the smell of toluene. These kinds of memory lapses are a major limitation of current AI (SN: 5/14/19). Continual learning seems to work well for the neuromorphic system when there are few scents involved, Panda says. “But what if you make it large-scale?” In the future, researchers could test whether this neuromorphic system can learn a much broader array of scents. But “this is a good start,” she says.",An AI that mimics how mammals smell recognizes scents better than other AI,4,0.03226300868343557
1740,"It has long been a mystery why pure math can reveal so much about the nature of the physical world. Antimatter was discovered in Paul Dirac’s equations before being detected in cosmic rays. Quarks appeared in symbols sketched out on a napkin by Murray Gell-Mann several years before they were confirmed experimentally. Einstein’s equations for gravity suggested the universe was expanding a decade before Edwin Hubble provided the proof. Einstein’s math also predicted gravitational waves a full century before behemoth apparatuses detected those waves (which were produced by collisions of black holes — also first inferred from Einstein’s math). Nobel laureate physicist Eugene Wigner alluded to math’s mysterious power as the “unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences.” Somehow, Wigner said, math devised to explain known phenomena contains clues to phenomena not yet experienced — the math gives more out than was put in. “The enormous usefulness of mathematics in the natural sciences is something bordering on the mysterious and … there is no rational explanation for it,” Wigner wrote in 1960. But maybe there’s a new clue to what that explanation might be. Perhaps math’s peculiar power to describe the physical world has something to do with the fact that the physical world also has something to say about mathematics. At least that’s a conceivable implication of a new paper that has startled the interrelated worlds of math, computer science and quantum physics. In an enormously complicated 165-page paper, computer scientist Zhengfeng Ji and colleagues present a result that penetrates to the heart of deep questions about math, computing and their connection to reality. It’s about a procedure for verifying the solutions to very complex mathematical propositions, even some that are believed to be impossible to solve. In essence, the new finding boils down to demonstrating a vast gulf between infinite and almost infinite, with huge implications for certain high-profile math problems. Seeing into that gulf, it turns out, requires the mysterious power of quantum physics. Everybody involved has long known that some math problems are too hard to solve (at least without unlimited time), but a proposed solution could be rather easily verified. Suppose someone claims to have the answer to such a very hard problem. Their proof is much too long to check line by line. Can you verify the answer merely by asking that person (the “prover”) some questions? Sometimes, yes. But for very complicated proofs, probably not. If there are two provers, though, both in possession of the proof, asking each of them some questions might allow you to verify that the proof is correct (at least with very high probability). There’s a catch, though — the provers must be kept separate, so they can’t communicate and therefore collude on how to answer your questions. (This approach is called MIP, for multiprover interactive proof.) Verifying a proof without actually seeing it is not that strange a concept. Many examples exist for how a prover can convince you that they know the answer to a problem without actually telling you the answer. A standard method for coding secret messages, for example, relies on using a very large number (perhaps hundreds of digits long) to encode the message. It can be decoded only by someone who knows the prime factors that, when multiplied together, produce the very large number. It’s impossible to figure out those prime numbers (within the lifetime of the universe) even with an army of supercomputers. So if someone can decode your message, they’ve proved to you that they know the primes, without needing to tell you what they are. Someday, though, calculating those primes might be feasible, with a future-generation quantum computer. Today’s quantum computers are relatively rudimentary, but in principle, an advanced model could crack codes by calculating the prime factors for enormously big numbers. That power stems, at least in part, from the weird phenomenon known as quantum entanglement. And it turns out that, similarly, quantum entanglement boosts the power of MIP provers. By sharing an infinite amount of quantum entanglement, MIP provers can verify vastly more complicated proofs than nonquantum MIP provers. It is obligatory to say that entanglement is what Einstein called “spooky action at a distance.” But it’s not action at a distance, and it just seems spooky. Quantum particles (say photons, particles of light) from a common origin (say, both spit out by a single atom) share a quantum connection that links the results of certain measurements made on the particles even if they are far apart. It may be mysterious, but it’s not magic. It’s physics. Say two provers share a supply of entangled photon pairs. They can convince a verifier that they have a valid proof for some problems. But for a large category of extremely complicated problems, this method works only if the supply of such entangled particles is infinite. A large amount of entanglement is not enough. It has to be literally unlimited. A huge but finite amount of entanglement can’t even approximate the power of an infinite amount of entanglement. As Emily Conover explains in her report for Science News, this discovery proves false a couple of widely believed mathematical conjectures. One, known as Tsirelson’s problem, specifically suggested that a sufficient amount of entanglement could approximate what you could do with an infinite amount. Tsirelson’s problem was mathematically equivalent to another open problem, known as Connes’ embedding conjecture, which has to do with the algebra of operators, the kinds of mathematical expressions that are used in quantum mechanics to represent quantities that can be observed.
Refuting the Connes conjecture, and showing that MIP plus entanglement could be used to verify immensely complicated proofs, stunned many in the mathematical community. (One expert, upon hearing the news, compared his feces to bricks.) But the new work isn’t likely to make any immediate impact in the everyday world. For one thing, all-knowing provers do not exist, and if they did they would probably have to be future super-AI quantum computers with unlimited computing capability (not to mention an unfathomable supply of energy). Nobody knows how to do that in even Star Trek’s century. Still, pursuit of this discovery quite possibly will turn up deeper implications for math, computer science and quantum physics. It probably won’t shed any light on controversies over the best way to interpret quantum mechanics, as computer science theorist Scott Aaronson notes in his blog about the new finding. But perhaps it could provide some sort of clues regarding the nature of infinity. That might be good for something, perhaps illuminating whether infinity plays a meaningful role in reality or is a mere mathematical idealization. On another level, the new work raises an interesting point about the relationship between math and the physical world. The existence of quantum entanglement, a (surprising) physical phenomenon, somehow allows mathematicians to solve problems that seem to be strictly mathematical. Wondering why physics helps out math might be just as entertaining as contemplating math’s unreasonable effectiveness in helping out physics. Maybe even one will someday explain the other.",How a quantum technique highlights math’s mysterious link to physics,4,0.2517671865594632
1741,"Amid a sweltering heat wave across the western United States, a remote spot in Death Valley, Calif., may have just earned the title of hottest place on Earth in nearly a century. On August 16, the Death Valley spot — appropriately named Furnace Creek, with a population of 24 — logged a temperature of 130° Fahrenheit (54.4° Celsius). If verified by the World Meteorological Organization, or WMO, that temperature will be the hottest recorded since 1931, and the third hottest since record keeping began. Furnace Creek also holds the record for hottest recorded temperature on Earth, logged in 1913 at 134° F (56.7° C). In second place is Kebili, Tunisia, with a logged temperature of 55.0° C (131° F) on July 7, 1931. The  verification process for such global records of weather extremes, which are archived at WMO, may take months, says archive chief Randall Cerveny, a meteorologist at Arizona State University in Tempe (SN: 7/1/20). Substantiating a record involves an international committee of atmospheric scientists poring over the original observations, the equipment used to make it and the calibration practices. But “based on available evidence, we are preliminarily accepting the observation,” Cerveny says. Some scientists have contested the 1913 observation. In 2016, an analysis posted online at Weather Underground suggested that the logged temperature was “essentially not possible” based on meteorological conditions, including that there was no evidence of a particularly intense heat wave from any other stations in the area at the time. For now, though, the record stands, because “no credible substantial evidence” supporting this claim has been submitted to WMO, Cerveny says. There is precedent for previous records being dismissed once disproven. In 2012, WMO determined that what was then thought to be the hottest recorded temperature, a 1912 observation of 57.8° C (136° F) in Libya, was not valid. That was supported by the discovery in 2010 of the original, mislogged observation sheet bearing five separate errors.","Death Valley hits 130° F, the hottest recorded temperature on Earth since 1931",4,0.19479874764208038
1742,"Heavy drinking is robbing Americans of decades of life. From 2011 to 2015, an average of 93,296 deaths annually could be tied to excessive alcohol use, or 255 deaths per day. Excessive drinking brought death early, typically 29 years sooner than would have been expected. All told, the United States saw 2.7 million years of potential life lost each year, researchers report in the July 31 Mortality and Morbidity Weekly Report. The researchers used a program developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that estimates annual deaths and years of potential life lost due to an individual’s own or another’s excessive drinking. The tool takes into account whether the cause of death is fully attributable to alcohol, such as alcoholic liver cirrhosis, or whether excessive drinking can partially contribute to a condition, such as breast cancer. Annually, about 51,000 of the deaths were from chronic conditions. The rest were sudden demises such as poisonings that involved another substance along with alcohol or alcohol-related car crashes. The CDC defines excessive alcohol use as binging — drinking five or more drinks at a time for men, four or more for women — or drinking heavily over the course of the week. Men qualify at 15 or more drinks per week; for women, it’s eight or more. The numbers of deaths and years of life extinguished due to excessive drinking have gone up since the last report. That assessment covered 2006 to 2010 and reported close to 88,000 deaths and 2.5 million lost years annually. Recommendations from the Community Preventive Services Task Force, made up of public health and prevention experts, to stem excessive drinking include raising taxes on alcohol and regulating the number of places that sell alcoholic beverages",Heavy drinking drove hundreds of thousands of Americans to early graves,8,0.3499241870435903
1743,"Sperm have long fooled scientists. Instead of swimming straight by twirling their tails like propellers, human sperm flick their tails lopsidedly and roll to balance out the off-center strokes. Over 300 years ago, microscopy pioneer Antonie van Leeuwenhoek described sperm tails swaying in a symmetric pattern, like “that of a snake or an eel.” The prevailing view that sperm tails move in a balanced way, however, doesn’t capture what actually happens in three dimensions, researchers report July 31 in Science Advances. High-speed 3-D microscopy of human sperm swimming freely in the lab revealed that the cells corkscrew as they move, consistent with previous studies. The sperm almost seemed to be drilling into the surrounding fluid, says Hermes Gadêlha, a mathematician at the University of Bristol in England. Contrary to what people have thought, sperm tails don’t beat symmetrically. High-speed 3-D microscopy and mathematical analyses reveal that the tails wiggle to only one side as the cells roll. The combination of movements keeps sperm swimming straight ahead. Using automated tracking of swimming sperm and mathematical analyses of position data, Gadêlha and colleagues broke sperm tail movement down into two components. Surprisingly, one was a wiggle to only one side of the cell. It’s like someone swimming using just one side of the body, Gadêlha says. By itself, such a lopsided stroke would lead to swimming in circles. But a second component of tail movement causes the sperm to rotate, balancing out the lopsided strokes. From above, the sperm tail looks like it is beating symmetrically, as has been described historically. But a more complex, 3-D movement keeps the sperm swimming straight ahead. The new 3-D measurements are a big step forward in understanding sperm movement, says Allan Pacey, a male fertility specialist at the University of Sheffield in England. Additional investigation is needed, though, to know if sperm move the same way in the female reproductive tract, where they must contend with fluid movement and narrow passages to reach the egg (SN: 2/13/19). Such research may inform diagnosis and treatment of human infertility, Pacey says.",Human sperm don’t swim the way that anyone had thought,8,0.45426475826238855
1744,"Not all air is created equal. While air quality has improved across the United States in recent decades, significant disparities persist in terms of who breathes the worst air. Communities exposed to the most air pollution in the 1980s — often poor and with high proportions of Black and Hispanic residents — are largely in the same position today, researchers report in the July 31 Science. Lots of different pollutants can clog the air, but scientists are especially interested in particulate matter less than 2.5 microns in diameter. Called PM2.5, the tiny particles are associated with myriad health problems, including cardiovascular disease, respiratory illness, diabetes and neurological problems (SN: 9/19/17). \ Marginalized communities, often closer to factories or major roadways than whiter, wealthier communities, bear the brunt of PM2.5 pollution. That exposure contributes to stark racial health inequities in the United States. “There hasn’t been clear documentation of how these disparities have evolved over time,” says Jonathan Colmer, an economist at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency only began measuring PM2.5 in 1999. Addressing current inequities requires an understanding of the past, Colmer says. He and colleagues estimated annual average PM2.5 levels for each square kilometer in the contiguous United States from 1981 to 2016 using published data derived from ground measurements, satellites and simulations of pollutant movement through space. The team then mapped those estimates onto about 65,000 census tracts to rank neighborhoods from most to least polluted annually, and noted how rankings changed over time. Whereas average PM2.5 concentrations decreased by 70 percent across the entire study area, the relative ranking of neighborhoods hardly budged. On average, whiter, more affluent neighborhoods were less polluted throughout the 36-year time frame. Disadvantaged neighborhoods with more Black or Hispanic people remained more polluted, despite experiencing a larger absolute drop in PM2.5 levels. “It’s really good news that air pollution is dropping for everyone,” says Anjum Hajat, an epidemiologist at the University of Washington in Seattle who wasn’t involved in the research. But even relatively low levels of pollution pose significant health risks, and the reductions might not translate to improved health for the hardest-hit communities. “To me, the take-home message is that inequity is very stubborn.” The study wasn’t designed to address why these inequities persist, though a move away from manufacturing or coal production was associated with air quality improvements in certain neighborhoods. More important, Hajat says, is power structure. “The communities that were the most marginalized and had the least political power in the 1980s are likely the same communities that continue to have the least power today.” White, wealthy communities have been able to prevent polluting facilities from being placed in their communities, she says, while marginalized communities often haven’t had this power. To see real change, “marginalized communities need to be included in discussions about their future,” she says, for instance through community members holding decision-making roles.",Many U.S. neighborhoods with the worst air 40 years ago remain the most polluted,8,0.8743122139751826
1745,"Drugs that release brakes on the immune system have helped thousands of people with cancers that were previously untreatable. Yet these therapies, known as checkpoint blockers (SN: 10/1/18), fail in many patients and work poorly for some cancers. That’s because the body’s defense system can stall in more than one way. Checkpoint blockers traditionally target a particular set of brakes: protein interactions that disarm the body’s T cells, allowing cancer to grow unchecked. But an additional brake may be at work as well — an immune cell population called myeloid-derived suppressor cells, or MDSCs. These cells reach unusually high levels in people with cancer. Now, experiments in mice suggest that immune checkpoint therapies could get a boost if paired with other drugs targeting MDSCs. Researchers reported their initial findings at the annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research, held virtually in late June.   MDSCs are a mix of immature cells from the same family as neutrophils and macrophages, which act as general first responders in the immune system. MDSCs caught scientists’ attention decades ago, but it wasn’t until the last several years that their importance in cancer came into focus. “Their normal function is to slow things down,” says William Carson III, a surgical oncologist at Ohio State University in Columbus. Disabling them, Carson thought, might allow the immune system to launch a speedier attack on cancer cells. In a 2016 study of people who received checkpoint blockers for advanced melanoma, patients with lower levels of MDSCs in their blood responded better to the immune therapy and lived longer. That made Carson and his colleagues wonder if getting rid of the suppressor cells could create an environment for checkpoint blockers to work better. And they knew a class of drugs that could potentially achieve this: Brd4 inhibitors.  In tumor cells, the protein Brd4 regulates the activity of various genes — including some that promote MDSCs. So perhaps a Brd4-inhibiting drug would give checkpoint blockers free rein to do their job. To test the idea, Andrew Stiff, a physician-researcher in Carson’s lab, conducted studies in mice with implanted breast tumors — a type of human cancer that responds poorly to checkpoint blockade. Among mice treated with the checkpoint blocker anti-PDL1, tumor growth slowed in three of 11 animals. Mice treated with a placebo drug or Brd4 inhibitor alone fared worse. A third group of animals received combination therapy, anti-PDL1 and a Brd4 inhibitor, which aimed to release the brakes on T cells and curb the suppressor cells at the same time. Tumors shrank in seven of 11 of those mice, Stiff reported June 24 at the AACR meeting. Treated mice had fewer MDSCs in circulation and at the tumor site. Other experiments suggested Brd4 inhibitors can influence MDSCs in several ways — including killing them directly or suppressing a molecule that drives their growth and expansion. The team got similar results with several different Brd4 inhibitors and in mice with breast, colon or lung tumors. Though preliminary and unpublished, the findings suggest that Brd4 inhibitors “can get rid of these immune suppressor cells that are an additional brake on the immune system, and allow immune stimulating drugs to work better,” says Carson. There are other ways to target those suppressor cells. Timothy Wang, a gastroenterologist at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, and his colleagues went after them using an anti-inflammatory peptide called trefoil factor 2, or TFF2. Previously, Wang and colleagues showed that some T cells release TFF2 to tone down inflammatory responses, and that giving mice TFF2 can boost the immune system and slow tumor growth.  In a new study, a team led by Wang and cancer biologist Woosook Kim chemically stimulated mice to form colorectal tumors. Some animals had genetic manipulations that led them to produce a lot of MDSCs and grow tumors quickly, the team reported June 22 at the virtual AACR meeting. Like human patients, these mice responded poorly to anti-PD1 immune therapy. However, combining TFF2 and anti-PD1 shrank tumors in all five animals with aggressive cancer. Synthesizing TFF2 for this pilot study was expensive, Wang says, so his team could test only a single dose on a small number of animals. “The fact that we could get any responses here, and that we showed some degree of synergy with anti-PD1, is very encouraging,” Wang says. Li Peng, chief scientific officer at Palleon Pharmaceuticals, a Boston-area company developing  cancer immunotherapies (SN: 3/21/17), notes that chemically induced tumor models like the mice Wang’s team used tend to mimic human cancer better than the implanted tumor models more commonly used for immune therapy studies. However, a drug’s effectiveness in mice has traditionally shown little correlation with its impact in human patients. For example, anti-PD1 and anti-PDL1 therapies only modestly slowed tumor growth in mice — yet today they’re “the cornerstone for immuno-oncology therapy in humans … and well-tolerated,” Peng says. Another case in point: STING agonists. These drugs, which activate a slew of host defense genes, worked like gangbusters in mice yet have floundered thus far in clinical trials. More than a thousand other trials are currently testing checkpoint blockers, alone or in combination with additional drugs and some, like one in people targeting advanced non-small cell lung cancer, are showing some promise. Yet the immune system is so sophisticated, with layers upon layers of brakes, that existing approaches may be “just scratching the surface,” says Peng.",These cells slow an immune response. Derailing them could help fight tumors,8,0.6595559706334061
1746,"It may feel odd to be thinking ahead to the next potential pandemic when the world is far from finished with the current one. But reports of a newly identified swine influenza virus that shows hints of being able to spread among humans have raised that specter — although public health officials say it’s not an imminent threat. That virus, identified in pigs in some parts of China, has characteristics similar to a strain that caused the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic (SN: 12/18/09), a new study finds. But just identifying such a flu virus circulating in pigs does not mean it poses an immediate threat to people. Rather it signals to researchers that they should monitor sick people for similar viruses. “It’s not an immediate threat where you’re seeing infections,” Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Md., said in a U.S. Senate hearing on June 30. “But it’s something we need to keep our eye on, just the way we did in 2009 with the emergence of the swine flu.” Influenza viruses bind to a protein called sialic acid to break into cells. Birds and people have different types of this protein in their upper airway, but pigs have both. That makes pigs not only susceptible to swine-specific flu strains but also to flu viruses from birds and humans. As a result, the animals often become influenza mixing pots. Once in pigs, bird, swine and human flu viruses can exchange genetic material — called reassortment — giving rise to new strains (SN: 2/12/10). If some of those new strains can infect people and make them sick, the virus might go on to cause larger outbreaks. Like the 2009 H1N1 virus, a newly identified pig virus, called G4 EA H1N1, or G4 for short, can attach to the type of sialic acid that lines a person’s respiratory tract, and it can also replicate in human cells grown in a dish, researchers report June 29 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Infected ferrets — an animal commonly used to study influenza because ferrets exhibit similar symptoms as people — can also get sick and pass the virus to other ferrets. The findings hint that the virus has the potential to cause disease and be transmitted among people. “It really points out the fact that we’ve got to keep watching influenza viruses,” says Marie Culhane, a swine veterinarian who studies influenza at the University of Minnesota in St. Paul and was not involved in the study. Here are four things to know about the G4 swine flu virus. The virus began circulating in pigs in 2013. That means the new virus isn’t really brand new. “ … This virus is very good at going pig to pig. And it’s also probably good at not causing very severe disease in the pigs, because if it was … people would want to do something about it.” Marie Culhane, swine veterinarian at the University of Minnesota Jinhua Liu, an influenza researcher at China Agricultural University in Beijing, and his colleagues analyzed more than 30,000 nasal swabs or lung samples from pigs across 10 provinces in northern and central China for influenza viruses over seven years, from 2011 to 2018. The G4 virus emerged in pigs in 2013 and in the following years, it became more prevalent. By 2016, it was the dominant form of influenza virus circulating in tested pigs. “That means that this virus is very good at going pig to pig,” Culhane says. “And it’s also probably good at not causing very severe disease in the pigs, because if it was … people would want to do something about it.” It’s unclear just how widely the virus has spread. So far, scientists have tested only a small portion of pigs in China. The virus has infected some people, but it’s unclear if they got sick. Ten percent of 338 people tested who worked with pigs had antibodies, or immune proteins that recognize the virus — a sign that they had recovered from a previous infection, Liu and colleagues found. Antibodies can stick around for years after an infection, so it’s not known when the workers were exposed the virus. It’s also unclear whether those people had symptoms while they were infected. It’s possible that the virus doesn’t cause severe disease, so the infections went unnoticed. If the workers did have symptoms, there’s also a chance that the signs of illness were indistinguishable from regular flu. There is a slight possibility that the test picked up immune proteins that recognize another flu virus, not G4. Looking for antibodies is like “looking for smoke,” Culhane says. “You see smoke, but you don’t know where the fire is.” Other flu antibodies that bind to closely related virus strains did not recognize the newer virus. That means that the part of the virus that the antibodies bind to has changed enough so that people don’t have protection from previous flu bouts and might not be immune if the virus began to spread. There’s no evidence the virus can easily spread among people. When monitoring different flu strains and determining pandemic risk, “what people watch for is human-to-human transmission,” Culhane says. If lots of people who have no connection to pigs or other infected animals were infected with the virus, that would be more concerning. The study found that only 4 percent of people in the general population had antibodies to G4 — and those with regular exposure to pigs were more likely to test positive. The paper also cites two cases of flu that were caused by a G4-like virus in people whose neighbors had pigs. But there’s no evidence that someone who worked with pigs then passed the virus to someone else. There’s no evidence of the virus in other places. The World Health Organization coordinates a Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System, which gathers data from member countries to monitor seasonal and pandemic flu. The United States has its own monitoring system in place within the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Right now, only pigs in China are known to carry the G4 flu strain. There’s no evidence that G4 or similar viruses are in other countries. For the United States, specifically, “there’s just no evidence of that, and we look at the data all the time,” Culhane says.",4 reasons not to worry about that ‘new’ swine flu in the news,8,0.6154822288636055
1747,"The second-largest Ebola virus outbreak ever has finally come to an end. Beginning in Congo in August 2018, the outbreak sickened 3,470 people (SN: 5/18/18). Nearly two-thirds of those patients, or 2,287, died. June 25 marks 42 days after the last patient linked to the outbreak went home from the hospital on May 14. That’s two full incubation periods for the virus. With no new cases, Congo health officials and the World Health Organization have officially declared the outbreak over. Lasting 22 months, this was Congo’s 10th fight against Ebola. Cases were concentrated in the North Kivu and Ituri Provinces, and health officials struggled against militant groups and misinformation to contain the virus. In contrast to past Ebola outbreaks, doctors had an effective vaccine in their arsenal that helped curb case numbers this time around (SN: 5/21/18). In 2019, that vaccine became the first, and still only, vaccine to win approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (SN: 12/20/19). Two new treatments also proved highly effective at keeping patients alive in clinical trials during the outbreak (SN: 8/12/19). (One of those treatments is made by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc., a major sponsor of the Society for Science & the Public, which publishes Science News.) To curb the spread of the deadly virus, local health workers traced 250,000 people who had come into contact with infected individuals, tested 220,000 samples and vaccinated 303,000 people, the WHO says. Congo “is now better, smarter and faster at responding to Ebola, and this is an enduring legacy which is supporting the response to COVID-19 and other outbreaks,” Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa, said June 25 in a statement.

1748,"Owning your health care is a key life skill for young people, like doing laundry, voting and making ramen — and it’s one you can start learning, even (or especially) while living under your parents’ roof. Adolescent medicine specialists want you to embrace your own medical care, and now might be the perfect time. Dr. Hina J. Talib, adolescent medicine inpatient service director at Children’s Hospital at Montefiore, identifies the pandemic as a “golden opportunity” for teenagers to practice self-care and self-advocacy skills. The National Alliance to Advance Adolescent Health offers advice and resources on a website, gottransition.org, including setting up a “Medical ID” app on your phone. Following are some of the foundational elements of transitioning to self-care. Get private, confidential time with your doctor Adolescent medicine specialists recommend starting at around age 13 or 14 — or even younger as needed. This alone time gives you a chance to share private mental-health concerns, high-risk behaviors, or personal issues related to sex, sexuality, gender and substances. Dr. Cora Breuner, a professor of pediatrics and adolescent medicine at Seattle Children’s Hospital and the University of Washington, uses this time not only for more revelatory and trusting conversations, but also so that young people can practice talking — and listening — to doctors, without their parents butting in. Do understand that, before you turn 18, the issue of confidentiality is tricky and varies by state. It tends to cover conversations about reproductive, sexual and mental health — but if the doctor determines anything to be life-threatening or dangerous (a big gray area), they can talk to your parents about it. If you have questions about what is and isn’t confidential, and what a minor can and can’t consent to in terms of birth control, vaccinations for sexually transmitted infections and other aspects of sexual or reproductive care, don’t hesitate to ask for clarification. Dr. Breuner also recommends a visit to the Guttmacher Institute website, which breaks down reproductive health consent issues by state. Even if a procedure or lab test is confidential, a charge for it may show up on a bill your parents receive, so ask about that too. And if you want to loop your parents in, but aren’t sure how, Dr. Ellen Rome, head of the Center for Adolescent Medicine at Cleveland Clinic Children’s Hospital, recommends asking your provider: “How do I have a healthy conversation about this with my parents?” And a Covid-era issue: If you’re doing a telehealth appointment from home, ask everyone in the house to respect your privacy before it starts (or, a tip from Dr. Talib, conduct it from the bathroom). Understand adult privacy and consent issues Once you turn 18, your health information is yours alone. If you’ve ever seen the acronym HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) on any forms you’ve filled out, that’s one of the things it refers to. If a parent wants to be part of the conversation, they must ask you; this is true even if they pay for your health insurance or health care. If you want to, you can sign a waiver allowing your doctor or health center to talk to them about your health. Make your own appointments, and cancel them if needed If your doctor’s office has a health care portal such as MyChart, you may be able to schedule an appointment online; otherwise, you’ll need to actually call (I know!) and have a calendar handy. (While you’re at it, put your doctor’s name and number in your phone.) If you’re having an urgent health crisis — mental or physical — say so and ask for advice; if it’s after hours, you’ll talk to an answering service who will have the doctor call you back to discuss next steps — going to the emergency room, for example. And a plea from Dr. Talib: “If my teen patients would actually cancel appointments, I would love that so much — they just don’t show up.” Plus, you can be charged for a missed appointment that you don’t cancel. Daunted? Don’t be! Call as if you’re making an appointment, then say, “Hi, this is [you]. I was supposed to see Dr. Healthperson on [date], but I need to cancel that appointment.” They’ll likely ask if you’d like to reschedule, and you can take it from there. If you have a cognitive, physical or developmental difference or disability, then your individualized education program — I.E.P. — or 504 plan may be a useful starting point for figuring out the accommodations you might need to become medically independent. Manage chronic conditions and prescriptions With some conditions, this can be a lot of work (one friend of ours took a gap year before college to learn to manage his diabetes independently), so transition gradually. Ask a parent to walk you through everything that’s been happening behind the scenes, such as the appointments or labs they routinely schedule, and any prescriptions they’ve been managing. Know what you take and why, how often you need to pick it up, if you have to call the pharmacy first, and if your doctor will need to call in a refill. Have a parent, doctor, or pharmacist teach you how to read the label on your medication: the number of refills left, the dosage, the possible side effects. And make sure to build in plenty of lead time; you don’t want to end up in the E.R. simply because you, say, forgot to pick up your inhaler. Any questions? Ask the pharmacist. Dr. Talib describes them as a “wonderful and underutilized resource for taking care of people.” Understand your health insurance Ask a parent to explain how co-payments (the amount you pay out of pocket) work for office visits, emergency care and prescription medications; get in the habit of saving receipts for any payments you make; learn how to get a referral to a specialist; look at a bill with your parents and start to learn what gets covered and why — and when and how to contest an erroneous charge. If you’re going to college, decide with your family whether to enroll in your college’s health plan or waive the coverage. And plan, far in advance, for the age of 26, when you’ll get bumped from your parents’ plan. Coronavirus and college If you’re going away to school this fall, have a family conversation about what would happen if you got sick, familiarize yourself with the location and hours of your health center, and memorize your parents’ telephone numbers in case you are ever separated from your phone. Bring along some supplies for self-care. Beyond masks and hand sanitizer, Dr. Rome recommends packing up a thermometer, Advil and Tylenol, and Benadryl (in case of an allergic reaction). And Dr. Breuner recommends regularly checking the website of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for updates on the virus because, as she says — and as you already know — “knowledge is power.” Remember that independence doesn’t mean you have to do everything on your own. As Dr. Talib puts it, “We’re not saying you need to have a parentectomy at age 18.” Always ask for help, company or advice when you need it. That’s what smart adults do.",How Young People Can Own Their Health Care (Even if They Still See a Pediatrician),8,0.3865334472758961
1749,"A growing number of people, stuck at home and tired of staring at their own haggard faces on Zoom, are finding a fix: face and eye lifts, chin and tummy tucks and more. At a time when many medical fields are reeling from lockdowns when lucrative electives work was postponed, cosmetic surgery procedures are surging, practitioners say, driven by unexpected demand from patients who have found the coronavirus pandemic a perfect moment for corporeal upgrades. “I have never done so many face-lifts in a summer as I’ve done this year,” said Dr. Diane Alexander, a plastic surgeon in Atlanta. She said she had performed 251 procedures through the end of July from May 18, when her clinic opened back up for elective surgery. “Pretty much every face-lift patient that comes in says: ‘I’ve been doing these Zoom calls and I don’t know what happened but I look terrible.’ ” “This is the weirdest world I live in,” Dr. Alexander added. “The world is shut down, we’re all worried about global crisis, the economy is completely crashing and people come in and still want to feel good about themselves.” One of her patients, a 55-year-old woman named Joanne who asked that her last name not be used because she feared seeming vain, said she considered getting work done on her face for years. But the pandemic finally made it possible because she could conceal the bruising and swelling during her recovery period. “Knowing everybody is staying in, wearing a face mask, not coming out due to social distancing, made it the spot-on right time,” she said. “Not one friend knows I’ve done it. Family members don’t know and my sister and mom don’t even know.” The trend is, in many ways, surprising in a tough economy. Cosmetic surgery generally isn’t covered by insurance, so procedures can cost as much as $25,000 for a full body makeover — tummy, breasts, face — and less for piecemeal work, like $3,300 for eyelid surgery and $10,000 for breast lift and enhancement. Patients say they’re diverting funds they might have spent on travel, concert, sports tickets, or other pleasures in their pre-pandemic lives. Since insurers generally don’t pay, it’s difficult to track the precise number of cosmetic procedures being done. Dr. Lynn Jeffers, president of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, said nationwide “demand is definitely busier than what we had expected,” though she added: “What we don’t know is if the pent-up demand is transitory, and will go back to normal, or will even dip.” Before Covid-19, invasive cosmetic procedures like face-lifts had been declining in favor of more minimal enhancements, like Botox injections, fillers and other skin-tighteners. Since 2000, the number of injectable procedures has risen by 878 percent, according to the plastic surgeons society, while the number of eyelid surgeries has fallen by 36 percent and face-lifts by 8 percent in that period. Colleen Nolan, executive director of the American Academy of Cosmetic Surgery, another professional organization, said she’d heard from surgeons around the country that patients were opting for more invasive procedures now than in the recent past. “They were going for fillers and Botox because they didn’t have any down time,” she said of patients. “Now they realize they can have the procedure and privately experience it.” The solitude of quarantine was precisely what motivated Patrice Solorzano, 62, who spent $20,000 on a procedure known in the business as a “mommy makeover” — a tummy tuck, and breast lift and enhancement. She underwent surgery on June 26, followed by a two-week recovery in her home outside Dayton, Ohio. By the second week, she said, “I was fine. I popped myself up, got to the workstation and went back online.” Ms. Solorzano, who oversees 160 people in 25 locations around the world as a military contractor working on account management for the Air Force, said the expense wasn’t a financial burden in part because she wasn’t spending as she otherwise might. “I definitely don’t spend it on gas,” she said. “We don’t go to the mall and don’t really go shopping.” She spent another $10,000 on a breast lift and enhancement for her daughter, Jena Solorzano, 24, who said she was heading off to law school and thought this moment was ideal to tackle a body-image issue that has nagged at her for years. She partly blamed social media for wanting the work done. “It doesn’t help that every single social media page has a gorgeous woman or a beautiful man on it,” she said, adding: “Covid-19 actually gave us the perfect opportunity to get a more drastic surgery.” The loneliness of quarantine has also motivated some people. A second patient of Dr. Alexander in Atlanta said that she got a face-lift not only because she had time to recover but also because she had come face-to-face during Covid-19 with a solitary life. “I have great girlfriends but they have husbands, and it does get lonely. I realized I really want to meet somebody,” said the woman, 57, who is divorced. She asked that her name not be used in a newspaper article because “it feels very vain to being going in and doing something cosmetically when so many people are struggling.” Some plastic surgeons said some patients tell them that they want their faces now to match newly in-shape bodies since they’ve had time, for instance, to take 10,000 steps each day. Other surgeons said that they’ve gotten a lot of interest from people who spent the early part of the pandemic sitting inside and snacking on junk food. Dr. Amy Alderman, another plastic surgeon in Atlanta, said that many of her patients have gained 10 to 20 pounds while shut in at home. “It’s a common theme,” she said. “I don’t know if that’s what’s driving them here. They’re saying: ‘As long as you’re doing my breasts, could you do a little lipo?’” Dr. Alderman said she’s been shocked that the industry, and her practice, hasn’t seen an economic backlash. She said she figured “patients would be a little hesitant spending between $6,000 and $25,000.” “But I can’t keep up with the demand,” she said. “I haven’t had an unfilled minute in the operating room. And I’m booked through September.”",Don’t Like What You See on Zoom? Get a Face-Lift and Join the Crowd,8,0.4260938982049727
1750,"Gum disease may increase your risk of colorectal cancer. A new study, published in Cancer Prevention Research, included 42,486 men and women participating in two large continuing health surveys. Over the past several decades, the participants had periodically reported information on health and diet, including reports of gingivitis and tooth loss. The researchers reviewed pathology reports from colonoscopies, documenting the incidence of two types of intestinal lesions that are precursors of colon cancer: serrated polyps and conventional adenomas. Removal of these lesions reduces colon cancer risk substantially. Compared with people with no history of periodontal disease, those who had gum disease had a 17 percent increased relative risk of having a serrated polyp and an 11 percent increased risk of a conventional adenoma. The scientists also found that the loss of four or more teeth was associated with a 20 percent increased risk for having a serrated polyp. The study controlled for smoking, body mass index, aspirin use and physical activity, among other known risks for colon cancer. “We don’t know exactly how much poor oral health increases the risk for colorectal cancer,” said the senior author, Mingyang Song, an assistant professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. “We need further studies to determine how the oral microbiome and the gut microbiome may interact to influence cancer risk.”",Gum Disease Tied to Colon Cancer Risk,8,0.24449510002146246
1751,"The period of my life when I assumed pregnancy could be planned ended only two years ago — but it feels like a distant memory. It’s almost laughable, considering the years I spent worrying about accidental pregnancies. Once I was ready, I thought I would be in control of when and how it would happen. My husband, Mike, and I were both on active duty in the Army, with access to free medical care and paid parental leave. We had served together in two overseas duty stations and planned to start our family when we returned to the United States. I didn’t know it at the time, but getting pregnant would soon consume all of our time and emotional bandwidth. Infertility can be a challenge for any family, but for active-duty service members, there is an additional set of obstacles, a bureaucratic process about which Mike and I would become experts. I was about to turn 34 and wanted to get pregnant as quickly as possible. I tracked my cycles to know when our chances of conception would be highest. Each month, an Amazon package of pregnancy tests and ovulation-prediction kits would arrive. I took my temperature with a basal thermometer that tracks the thermal shift that occurs after ovulation and is accurate to a hundredth of a degree. I peed on a stick every single day. About 90 percent of women under 35 who don’t actively prevent pregnancy are likely to conceive within a year of trying. Every month, I was convinced we had conceived, because I knew our timing was right. And every month I’d be disappointed. I started to wonder whether we should have started trying a year or two sooner, even though we weren’t really ready then. After seven months of tracking my cycles, I finally had a positive at-home pregnancy test. We were leaving for my brother-in-law’s wedding in a few weeks, so we thought we would use that trip to tell my husband’s family the good news, but the chance never came. I started cramping and bleeding heavily the night before we left and continued to miscarry on our trans-Atlantic flight in basic economy. When I got back, I went to the doctor, who refused to acknowledge that I had had a miscarriage because I never had a blood test to confirm the pregnancy. The devastation of seeing two pink lines on several home pregnancy tests — and then bleeding heavily two weeks later — seemed like enough evidence to me. After about 10 months, I lied and told my doctor we had been trying for a full year, the point at which we could get a referral to a reproductive endocrinologist in the military medical system. Something had to be wrong, I thought. And if it was, things were going to get a lot more complicated for us, biologically and financially. One of the first issues that service members struggling with infertility face is insurance coverage. Tricare, the health insurance provided to everyone in the active-duty military, pays for assisted-reproductive procedures if a loss in reproductive ability is a result of a service-connected injury. Otherwise, military members have to pay out of pocket. Caught up in larger debates about abortion, federal regulations are unfriendly to assisted-fertility techniques that create embryos but also risk destroying some in the process. Tricare will cover infertility assessment and costly testing, monitoring and medications, because those measures can be “combined with natural conception,” but in vitro fertilization (I.V.F.) is not considered “natural.” Intrauterine insemination (I.U.I.), the option that Mike and I chose, isn’t considered “natural” either, according to Tricare’s policies, and that implicit value judgment compounded the feelings of shame and sadness that I already felt from being unable to conceive. Mike and I decided to use intrauterine insemination to start because I.V.F. was too expensive for us. The out-of-pocket cost for I.V.F. at a military hospital averages around $5,000 for each attempt but can be as much as $10,000 if it includes freezing embryos (a real possibility for couples facing a deployment) or involves a donor (which same-sex couples can scarcely avoid). I.U.I. is a much less expensive procedure: it costs $173 at Walter Reed for each new cycle. Over 18 months, my husband and I spent around $1,000. Insurance coverage and out-of-pocket expenses are only the first barriers for service members dealing with infertility. Only six military medical treatment facilities in the country offer the full range of fertility procedures. If a service member and their spouse are not located near one of these facilities, they have to travel there using their vacation time or request temporary duty at that location. The service member must get permission from their command to transfer or take leave, which means involving their bosses in what is already a difficult and deeply personal process.  Assuming leave is granted, appointments are on a space-available basis and aren’t guaranteed. At Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Maryland, near the base where my husband and I were stationed, I.U.I. and monitoring for I.V.F. cycles are readily available and scheduled very early in the morning before the start of the workday. At other military clinics, I.V.F. cycles are offered only a few times a year, and the wait can be up to 12 months long. That doesn’t work for people posted at a particular duty station for a limited time. On top of the institutional barriers, infertility itself can be difficult to understand. My diagnosis was a mystery to my doctors. I had a battery of tests, requiring so much blood that I needed two appointments at the lab. I endured invasive and painful procedures. All that to come to a diagnosis of “unexplained infertility.” My lady parts were functioning, but they didn’t seem interested in producing a baby. I started to realize how much we still don’t know about women’s bodies, and it made me extremely frustrated. After my fallopian tubes were examined for any blockages — there were none — my husband and I were approved to proceed with intrauterine insemination. At this point, patients like me are given a round of oral medication to stimulate the ovaries, forcing the body to mature one or more ovarian follicles to increase the chances of conception. The side effects can range from bloating and irritability to abdominal pain and severe diarrhea. I experienced them all. Thirty-six hours before the insemination procedure, my husband would do the honors of injecting me with hormones in the buttock with a sturdy inch-and-a-half-long needle. “It’s OK, I’m a doctor,” he would say with confidence as he jabbed me. Technically true; he is a doctor of musical arts in saxophone performance. We had to arrive at Walter Reed by 7 a.m. to sign into the clinic on the day of each insemination. It was usually packed with other sad and infertile people, so Mike and I tried to get there 30 minutes early to be first on the list. We would sit there with all the other couples and awkwardly avoid eye contact. About an hour later, the nurse would start calling names for the male partners to give their samples. I always wondered if hearing the national anthem over the loudspeaker, a common practice on military installations for raising the flag and starting the day, hindered Mike’s process. We made a ritual of it. My husband would perform his sacred duty while I waited in the lobby, and then we would head to the hospital cafeteria. We would joke and speculate about the other couples over burnt coffee and powdered eggs, while the clinic prepared the sperm sample and removed the least promising swimmers. The idea behind I.U.I. is to insert the high-performing sperm directly into the uterus via catheter so the sperm and egg virtually have no barriers to their rendezvous. How could it not result in a pregnancy — it’s science, right? After each insemination, I would put on my uniform and go back to work like nothing happened. But my mind would be racing as I sat at my desk, wondering if we had just conceived our first child. What if I didn’t lay there on the table long enough, I would think. The fourth time, Mike came into the room with me. It seemed like a good opportunity for him to observe what a gynecological exam is really like. His eyes widened at the sight of the forceps. But really I wanted him there in case it worked. Then we could say we were both in the room when we finally conceived. We did this six times. Every month my period came was devastating. I had two more early miscarriages, while it seemed as if everyone I knew was becoming pregnant, and with the greatest of ease. Mike and I debated whether we should stop trying with I.U.I. and opt for the more expensive I.V.F. I was emotional and bloated all the time, barely able to make weight and maintain the Army’s fitness standards because some days I couldn’t get out of bed from months of fertility drugs. Whenever I stumbled on an internet troll suggesting that women use pregnancy to get out of a deployment, I would be sent into a blind rage. I tried my hardest to plan a pregnancy while on active duty, to be able to use the benefits I had earned, but it never happened. I left the Army in January. Shortly after, the first cases of the novel coronavirus were confirmed in the United States. The decision of whether to move forward with I.V.F. was made for us. Walter Reed paused most fertility treatments. I became mostly concerned with how to keep from getting sick and how the radio show I helped produce would continue if the station had to close. Pregnancy drifted further and further from my mind every day. The last day before our radio station went totally remote, I was rummaging through my medicine cabinet for a new tube of toothpaste when the bright pink wrapper of my last pregnancy test caught my eye. It was a reminder of our infertility, so I wanted it gone. But I also didn’t want to waste it, so I peed in a cup, dipped it in and hopped in the shower. Rushing around the bathroom to get ready, I glanced down at the test. It read “Yes” in all capital letters, and I gasped. This had to be a mistake, I thought. The whole bus ride to work I frantically Googled articles about false positives and convinced myself the results were not reliable. I went into the pharmacy next door to my office and bought a few more tests. During a break from broadcasting our show, I took them in the bathroom at work. They were all positive. I don’t really believe in miracles — but I’m struggling to come up with another explanation for how this happened, after our last doctor visit had given us less than 1 percent chance of conceiving without assisted reproductive technology. Nothing about this pregnancy happened the way we planned, and the pandemic has presented a lot of challenges like finding prenatal care and assessing the risk of seeing a doctor in person. My history of miscarriages has left me with an ever-present, low-level of anxiety and reminds me that this could all end at any moment.
But for now, we’re expecting our baby boy in November.

1752,"Living near an airport may increase the risk for preterm birth, a new study has found. Air pollution is usually measured in volumes of small particles of soot as small as 2.5 micrometers in diameter. But these researchers tracked ultrafine particles, bits of soot as small as 0.1 micrometers, in the exhaust from jet engines. These particles easily enter the lungs and pass into the bloodstream. Researchers used Environmental Protection Agency data to calculate levels of ultrafine particles within 15 kilometers of Los Angeles International Airport, and then used birth records to track 174,186 births from 2008 through 2016 in the same geographical area. Compared with women in the lowest one-quarter for exposure to ultrafine particles, those in the highest one-quarter were 14 percent more likely to give birth prematurely. The study, in Environmental Health Perspectives, controlled for a number of factors that affect the risk for preterm birth, including airport noise levels and pollution caused by road traffic. Still, there are many risks they could not control for, and this observational study does not prove cause and effect. The lead author, Beate Ritz, a professor of epidemiology at the University of California, Los Angeles, alluded to these additional risks in people who live near airports. “These are often immigrants, minorities, people of low socioeconomic status living in housing that does not protect them from air pollution,” she said. “Ultrafine particles may be the last straw for these pregnancies.”",Living Near an Airport May Raise Risks of Preterm Birth,8,0.8773606966711958
1753,"In the Before Times, mothers who were struggling to breastfeed didn’t have to look very far to get hands-on support. There were baby cafes and new-mom groups; visits from friends and family; and lactation consultants who made house calls. But during the pandemic, those resources and services have mostly shifted online. “Some of the mothers that we counsel will go to the library and sit in the parking lot so that they can have internet service while we’re doing the support groups,” said Kimarie Bugg, the chief executive of Reaching Our Sisters Everywhere, a nonprofit working to increase knowledge about the importance of breastfeeding in the Black community. But even mothers who do have internet service can find it awkward to receive support virtually. “It’s been very, very frustrating to not have somebody in person,” said Mikia Davis, 31, an actor and substitute teacher in Atlanta, who has mainly been getting assistance over the phone and online. Davis, who gave birth to her first child, a boy, in May, said her breastfeeding struggles started right away. “Nursing, it hurt so bad for me,” Davis said. “I would be sweating, I would be clenching my hands together. And I hated that I felt like that because I would hear all these moms say it’s a beautiful bonding experience and I was like, I didn’t get that.” Everyone kept telling her it wasn’t supposed to hurt, but she couldn’t figure out what was wrong. More than a month later, Davis discovered that her son had a slight tongue tie and an upper lip tie. A surgical procedure helped fix those problems, but the breastfeeding pain never fully went away and that left her feeling defeated. “As a first-time mom, I wish I had taken a breastfeeding class while I was pregnant,” Davis said. “I just thought it was something that was going to happen naturally, that I would know how to do.” “The whole infrastructure of how we support breastfeeding is being threatened,” said Laurence Grummer-Strawn, Ph.D., a former chief of the nutrition branch at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and who is now the head of the Food and Nutrition Actions in Health Systems Unit at the World Health Organization. Grummer-Strawn is concerned that the disruption of health care systems and the reduction in home visits and local support groups will have a negative effect on breastfeeding. Some parents are also afraid to go to local health clinics to get breastfeeding support, he added, and may even fear breastfeeding itself — though the latest research shows that there has not been any viable, infectious virus detected in breast milk so far. During the pandemic, “I’ve had women who don’t want to nurse because they feel they don’t have enough help and it’s scary for them,” said Freda Rosenfeld, a board-certified lactation consultant in Brooklyn. But even though many breastfeeding support systems can’t be in person right now, experts say it’s important that mothers continue to seek help if they need it. The benefits of breastfeeding have been well documented. And researchers have suggested that the presence of Covid-19 antibodies in the breast milk of previously infected mothers could provide babies protection against the virus. But what’s most important is to feed the baby by whatever means necessary, experts say. Some women who cannot exclusively breastfeed may need to rely on formula. Davis eventually found help through the free, online baby cafe run by Reaching Our Sisters Everywhere. The group video chat was helpful, she said, because she learned a new way for her baby to latch, but she still wished it could have been in person. Before participating in any online visits, Rosenfeld advises her clients to ask their partner, another family member or a friend to operate their phone or laptop camera, so that the mother doesn’t have to adjust the angle of the lens while also trying to hold the baby. Then Rosenfeld focuses on helping her clients feel comfortable. Normally, Rosenfeld would put on a glove, put her hand in the baby’s mouth and examine how strong the baby sucks. But now she asks her client’s helper to do this, and tells them how to make various adjustments until the suck feels stronger before putting the baby at the breast. During the call, she also shows her clients visual aides — a model breast, a doll, a receiving blanket and a pillow — so the mother can mimic her moves, Rosenfeld said. Ideally, breastfeeding education and preparation should start even earlier, experts said, before the baby is born. Serena Meyer, a nurse at a hospital in San Francisco and international board-certified lactation consultant, said she’s found, anecdotally, that some women are opting out of taking an online tutorial. “People don’t know how to access them online, they don’t want to pay for them, they don’t understand the value,” said Meyer, referring to the online offerings for prenatal education. With masks and face shields, in-person lactation consultants need “really good, expressive language” right now, she said, “because you’re all the way in your gear trying to explain how a baby is going to latch onto something and your mouth is covered. So it’s hard.” Caroll Taveras, who gave birth to her first child at home in Brooklyn in July, said she took an online childbirth class but hadn’t considered an online breastfeeding class, in part because she assumed breastfeeding would come naturally to her. Instead, she opted for an in-person visit with Rosenfeld, her lactation consultant, who is offering $250 office visits in lieu of house calls. “I’m not really an online person,” Taveras said. The American Academy of Pediatrics, or A.A.P., suggests that women exclusively breastfeed for the first six months, but according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention less than 50 percent of infants in the United States are exclusively breastfed through three months, and only a quarter are exclusively breastfed through six months. “What we’ve heard is that many hospitals are just routinely doing separation,” Grummer-Strawn said, referring to the practice of separating mothers from their newborns in the hospital, regardless of whether they had tested positive for the coronavirus — though he acknowledged that things might be getting better now that expert guidance in the United States has changed. Initially, the A.A.P. had advised temporary separation of newborns from their infected mothers and the C.D.C.’s earliest recommendations seemed somewhat vague, which made it tougher for some new mothers to start breastfeeding. “In clinical life, this led to some crazy situations, such as mother and infant being separated in the hospital for 48 hours, and then being escorted, isolated from each other, to the front door of the hospital and then placed in the same car to go home to a place where physical distancing was not possible,”said Alison Stuebe, M.D., the president of the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine and a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of North Carolina. But the A.A.P.’s latest guidance recommends that mothers with Covid-19 room with their newborns, which allows them to breastfeed, and take precautions to protect their babies from catching the virus. The new policy stemmed from data indicating that the likelihood of getting the virus was similar for infants who were separated from their mothers compared with those who roomed with mothers. Because of the pandemic, there are some areas, like New York City, where women have been discharged from the hospital faster than they ordinarily would have been after giving birth, potentially resulting in fewer visits with a hospital lactation consultant. “Moms are really struggling in the fourth trimester,” Dr. Stuebe said. She and her colleagues at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill offer breastfeeding guidance on their website, NewMomHealth, which they describe as a modern village that aims to change the way America treats new moms. Although some mothers have arrived home from the hospital without their usual “village” in place, there are others who say they have more support because of the lockdown. Erin Bestreich, 36, a speech pathologist who gave birth to identical twins in April, said her husband was able to stay home during the first few months after the babies were born, so he would help her breastfeed. Their nanny also stayed with them during the quarantine while Bestreich received breastfeeding support online. “They were both very, very supportive of my breastfeeding and I wouldn’t — and still could not — do it without them,” she said. “Also, I had nowhere to go, so it made it easier to focus on feeding.” Lori Feldman-Winter, M.D., the chairwoman of the A.A.P. section on breastfeeding and a pediatrician at Cooper University Health Care in Camden, N.J., said one way to keep the milk flowing is to try to make sure milk is drawn out either manually or by the baby in the first hour after delivery. But be prepared for different challenges that can emerge as the baby gets older. “Breastfeeding is an evolving skill,” she said, adding that continual support is crucial. For Dr. Feldman-Winter, online breastfeeding consultations are nothing new. For the past decade she has occasionally spoken to women from as far away as Ghana and Israel by video, teaching them how to reposition their babies until they learned how to do it themselves. “You can’t dance for the mom or the baby,” she said. “They need to learn how to dance together.”","With Less Breastfeeding Support, Mothers Are Turning to Online Help",8,0.9108289419011829
1754,"Mindfulness and other types of meditation are usually seen as simple stress-relievers – but they can sometimes leave people worse off. About one in 12 people who try meditation experience an unwanted negative effect, usually a worsening in depression or anxiety, or even the onset of these conditions for the first time, according to the first systematic review of the evidence. “For most people it works fine but it has undoubtedly been overhyped and it’s not universally benevolent,” says Miguel Farias at Coventry University in the UK, one of the researchers behind the work. There are many types of meditation, but one of the most popular is mindfulness, in which people pay attention to the present moment, focusing on either their own thoughts and feelings or external sensations. It is recommended by several National Health Service bodies in the UK as a way of reducing depression relapses in people who have experienced the condition several times. Enthusiasm for meditation may partly stem from a growing awareness of the side effects of antidepressant medicines and the difficulties some people report in stopping taking them. There have been some reports of people experiencing worse mental health after starting meditation but it is unclear how often this happens. Farias’s team combed through medical journals and found 55 relevant studies. Once the researchers had excluded those that had deliberately set out to find negative effects, they worked out the prevalence of people who experienced harms within each study and then calculated the average, adjusted for the study size, a common method in this kind of analysis. They found that about 8 per cent people who try meditation experience an unwanted effect. “People have experienced anything from an increase in anxiety up to panic attacks,” says Farias. They also found instances of psychosis or thoughts of suicide. The figure of 8 per cent may be an underestimate, as many studies of meditation record only serious negative effects or don’t record them at all, says Farias. Katie Sparks, a chartered psychologist and a member of the British Psychological Society, says the figure could have been pushed up by people trying out meditation because of undiagnosed anxiety or depression. “Meditation has been found to help people to relax and refocus and help them both mentally and physically,” she says. But sometimes when people are trying to still their thoughts, the mind can “rebel”, she says. “It’s like a backlash to the attempt to control the mind, and this results in an episode of anxiety or depression,” she says. This doesn’t mean people should stop trying the technique, she says, but instead should opt for guided meditation sessions, led by a teacher or an app with a recorded narration, which she believes is safer. “The current study could stop people participating in something which can be of benefit in the right context,” she says.",Mindfulness and meditation can worsen depression and anxiety,8,0.6049265015805567
1755,"A new method could help detect microplastics in human tissues and organs, allowing researchers to investigate the impact that environmental plastic pollution has on our health. Last year, Rolf Halden at Arizona State University and his colleagues discovered molecules from commonly used plastics, such as bisphenol A, in human liver and fat tissue samples. They have now investigated whether larger, microplastic particles might be detectable if they made their way into human tissues. The researchers took 47 human tissue samples from lungs, liver, spleen and kidneys, spiked them with various different microplastics and digested the mix with chemicals. They then tested whether they could detect and quantify microplastic fragments in the samples using established spectroscopic methods. They found that it was possible to identify dozens of types of plastic components, including polycarbonate, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polyethylene – in addition to bisphenol A. “We are literally surrounded by plastic throughout our daily lives. We are now positioned to better define plastic pollution in the human body,” says Halden. “Whether, where and to what extent plastic fragments accumulate in different human tissues and organs is the focus of still ongoing research.” Halden and his colleagues have also developed an online tool to enable researchers to standardise their measurements of microplastics in human tissues by converting information on plastic particle count into units of mass and surface area. Their research was presented at the American Chemical Society Fall 2020 virtual meeting today. “There is currently no ideal analytical method to quantify microplastic particles in human tissues,” says Dick Vethaak at the Deltares research centre in the Netherlands. Vethaak says that if the new method could be used to screen human tissues for the presence of microplastics, it will be important to make sure it can rule out contamination of samples, for instance with microplastics in the air. Stephanie Wright at Imperial College London says there is evidence from animal studies that microplastics can cause damage in the body. But it still isn’t clear whether microplastics could be making their way into human organs. Wright says the big question for future research will be whether microplastics have any impact on human health.",Simple technique could help find microplastics inside the human body,8,0.11383824229029638
1756,"For many years, the diagnosis of Alzheimer's has been based on the characterization of amyloid plaques and tau tangles in the brain, typically after a person dies. An inexpensive and widely available blood test for the presence of plaques and tangles would have a profound impact on Alzheimer's research and care. According to the new study, measurements of phospho-tau217 (p-tau217), one of the tau proteins found in tangles, could provide a relatively sensitive and accurate indicator of both plaques and tangles -- corresponding to the diagnosis of Alzheimer's -- in living people. ""The p-tau217 blood test has great promise in the diagnosis, early detection, and study of Alzheimer's,"" said Oskar Hansson, MD, PhD, Professor of Clinical Memory Research at Lund University, Sweden, who leads the Swedish BioFINDER Study and senior author on the study who spearheaded the international collaborative effort. ""While more work is needed to optimize the assay and test it in other people before it becomes available in the clinic, the blood test might become especially useful to improve the recognition, diagnosis, and care of people in the primary care setting."" Researchers evaluated a new p-tau217 blood test in 1,402 cognitively impaired and unimpaired research participants from well-known studies in Arizona, Sweden, and Colombia. The study, which was coordinated from Lund University in Sweden, included 81 Arizona participants in Banner Sun Health Research Institute's Brain Donation program who had clinical assessments and provided blood samples in their last years of life and then had neuropathological assessments after they died; 699 participants in the Swedish BioFINDER Study who had clinical, brain imaging, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and blood-based biomarker assessments; and 522 Colombian autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease (ADAD)-causing mutation carriers and non-carriers from the world's largest ADAD cohort. In the Arizona (Banner Sun Health Research Institute) Brain Donation Cohort, the plasma p-tau217 assay discriminated between Arizona Brain donors with and without the subsequent neuropathological diagnosis of ""intermediate or high likelihood Alzheimer's"" (i.e., characterized by plaques, as well as tangles that have at least spread to temporal lobe memory areas or beyond) with 89% accuracy; it distinguished between those with and without a diagnosis of ""high likelihood Alzheimer's"" with 98% accuracy; and higher ptau217 measurements were correlated with higher brain tangle counts only in those persons who also had amyloid plaques. In the Swedish BioFINDER Study, the assay discriminated between persons with the clinical diagnoses of Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases with 96% accuracy, similar to tau PET scans and CSF biomarkers and better than several other blood tests and MRI measurements; and it distinguished between those with and without an abnormal tau PET scan with 93% accuracy. In the Colombia Cohort, the assay began to distinguish between mutation carriers and non-carriers 20 years before their estimated age at the onset of mild cognitive impairment. In each of these analyses, p-tau217 (a major component of Alzheimer's disease-related tau tangles) performed better than p-tau181 (another component of tau tangles and a blood test recently found to have promise in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's) and several other studied blood tests. Other study leaders include Jeffrey Dage, PhD, from Eli Lilly and Company, who developed the p-tau217 assay, co-first authors Sebastian Palmqvist, MD, PhD, and Shorena Janelidz, PhD, from Lund University, and Eric Reiman, MD, Banner Alzheimer's Institute, who organized the analysis of Arizona and Colombian cohort data. In the last two years, researchers have made great progress in the development of amyloid blood tests, providing valuable information about one of the two cardinal features of Alzheimer's. While more work is needed before the test is ready for use in the clinic, a p-tau217 blood test has the potential to provide information about both plaques and tangles, corresponding to the diagnosis of Alzheimer's. It has the potential to advance the disease's research and care in other important ways. ""Blood tests like p-tau217 have the potential to revolutionize Alzheimer's research, treatment and prevention trials, and clinical care,"" said Eric Reiman, MD, Executive Director of Banner Alzheimer's Institute in Phoenix and a senior author on the study. ""While there's more work to do, I anticipate that their impact in both the research and clinical setting will become readily apparent within the next two years.""

The department was planning to nix some provisions of a 2016 rule that interpreted the Affordable Care Act's ban on sex discrimination to include discrimination on the basis of gender identity, saying it would enforce the ban ""according to the plain meaning of the word 'sex' as male or female and as determined by biology."" A number of LGBTQ groups had strongly criticized HHS' plan, saying it would allow health care providers to openly discriminate against transgender patients. Monday's decision came in response to a case brought in June by the Human Rights Campaign, which represented two transgender women of color who ""experienced discrimination based on their transgender status,"" according to the ruling. The group's president, Alphonso David, called the ruling a ""crucial early victory"" for the plaintiffs. ""We are pleased the Court recognized this irrational rule for what it is: discrimination, plain and simple. LGBTQ Americans deserve the health care that they need without fear of mistreatment, harassment, or humiliation,"" he said in a statement. Block leaned heavily on the Supreme Court's June ruling, which related to discrimination in the workplace and extended protection for LGBTQ workers but opened the door to other challenges to discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or transgender status. The department published the rule change in the Federal Register four days after the justices passed down the historic ruling. ""Had the agency correctly predicted the outcome in Bostock, it may well have taken a different path. Instead, it continued on the same path even after Bostock was decided. This satisfies the Court that the premise of the repeal was a disagreement with a concept of sex discrimination later embraced by the Supreme Court. Therefore, the repeal was contrary to law,"" he wrote. ""The Court reiterates the same practical concern it raised at oral argument: When the Supreme Court announces a major decision, it seems a sensible thing to pause and reflect on the decision's impact,"" the ruling read. ""Since HHS has been unwilling to take that path voluntarily, the Court now imposes it."" Lambda Legal, another LGBTQ group that sued this summer to block the rollback, also welcomed the court's decision on Monday.  ""LGBTQ people, particularly transgender people, have been under constant attack by the Trump administration,"" said Carl Charles, an attorney with the group. ""We applaud today's decision and look forward to continuing our fight against this rule that unlawfully targets and singles out LGBTQ people for discrimination during their most critical time of need, when seeking health care. Our communities deserve better."" The state of Washington had also sued in July to block the rollback, arguing in its suit that it violates patients' constitutional rights and the purpose of the ACA to increase access to health care and insurance, by ""allowing broad discrimination to interfere with important medical care.""",Federal judge blocks Trump administration's rollback of Obama-era transgender health care protections,8,0.7975345062955647
1758,"Of all the leafy greens, spinach is one of the most versatile. I whip it into smoothies, enjoy chilled spinach salads, steam and sauté fresh spinach, add it to stir frys, and even blend it into baked goods like brownies. Spinach also has many health benefits, and you can easily build it into your meals. Here are six perks of eating more of this powerfully protective plant, and simple ways to incorporate it into meals and snacks. Spinach is nutrient-rich Three cups of raw spinach provides just 20 calories, no fat, 2 grams of protein, and 3 grams of carbohydrate with 2 grams as fiber (so 1 gram of net carbs). Though it has so few calories, spinach is packed with nutrients. A three cup portion provides over 300% of the daily need for bone-supporting vitamin K. Spinach also provides over 160% of the daily goal for vitamin A, and about 40% for vitamin C, which both support immune function and promote healthy skin. Spinach also contains 45% of the daily need of folate, a B vitamin that helps form red blood cells and DNA. And spinach supplies 15% of the daily goal for both iron and magnesium, 10% for potassium, and 6% for calcium, along with smaller amounts of other B vitamins. Spinach is high in antioxidants In addition to its many vitamins and minerals, spinach provides antioxidants tied to anti-inflammation and disease protection. These include kaempferol, a flavonoid shown to reduce the risk of cancer, as well as slow its growth and spread. Another, called quercetin, has been linked to possible protective effects on memory as well as heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Spinach is a functional food In a study published in the journal Food & Function, researchers summarize the protective effects of spinach, based on the activity of its naturally occurring phytochemicals and bioactive compounds. They state that these spinach-derived substances can reduce oxidative stress, DNA damage, and disease. They're also able to positively influence the expression of genes involved in metabolism and inflammation. In addition, they trigger the release of satiety hormones, which can make you feel more full and satisfied. For these reasons, the researchers conclude that eating more spinach may help fend off heart disease, cancer, type 2 diabetes, and obesity. Spinach supports brain health The anti-inflammatory effects of spinach make it a key contender for protecting the brain, particularly with aging. In one study, researchers tracked the eating patterns and cognitive abilities of more than 950 older adults for about five years. They saw a significant decrease in the rate of cognitive decline among those who consumed larger amounts of green leafy vegetables. The data indicated that people who ate one to two servings of leafy greens daily had the same cognitive abilities of a person 11 years younger than those who consumed no leafy greens. Spinach may help manage blood pressure Spinach is a source of naturally occurring nitrates, compounds that open up blood vessels to improve blood flow and ease the workload on the heart. In one small study, published in The Journal of Nutrition, 11 men and seven women consumed four different nitrate-rich drinks, including a spinach beverage. Researchers found that blood nitrate levels increased after downing all four drinks. The spinach drink, in addition to those made from beetroot juice and rocket salad (another leafy green), also lowered blood pressure. Diastolic blood pressure remained lower five hours after ingesting the spinach and rocket drinks. (Diastolic is the lower number on the blood pressure reading, which indicates the amount of pressure in your arteries between beats.) Spinach protects eye health One of the antioxidants in spinach, called lutein, has been shown to reduce the risk of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), an eye disease that can blur the sharp, central vision required for activities like reading and driving. AMD is a leading cause of vision loss for people age 50 and older. There is currently no cure or treatment to reverse the condition, so prevention is key. In one Japanese study, researchers examined the eyes of 11 healthy nonsmokers who consumed 75 grams of frozen spinach containing 10 mg of lutein daily for two months. The intake of lutein-rich spinach increased blood lutein levels, and it also increased measures of macular pigment optical density (MPOD). That’s important, because macular pigment acts like internal sunglasses to protect the eyes, and low or decreased MPOD is a risk factor for AMD. This research indicates that spinach may help curb AMD risk. How cooking spinach affects its nutrients While I recommend incorporating spinach into both raw and cooked dishes, some research shows that not cooking the greens is the best way to preserve its lutein content. In a Swedish study, spinach was purchased at a supermarket and then cooked using various methods for up to 90 minutes. The longer the spinach was boiled, the lower the remaining lutein level. When fried at a high temperature, a large percentage of the lutein degraded within just two minutes. Scientists say the best way to consume spinach for maximum lutein intake may be in a smoothie combined with a healthful fat, such as avocado or almond butter. That’s because when spinach is chopped into small pieces, more lutein is released from the leaves, and fat increases the ability to absorb the antioxidant. Older research found that cooking also impacts the folate content of spinach; boiling slashed this B vitamin level by nearly half. Steaming, however, resulted in no significant loss of folate, even after four and a half minutes. A recent study looked at the effect of different cooking methods on the vitamin content in selected vegetables, included spinach. Researchers found that microwaving resulted in the lowest loss of vitamin K. Blanching significantly reduced the vitamin C content, which was best retained by steaming. Cooking also diminished the vitamin E levels in spinach, but increased the vitamin A content. This occurs when the plant walls soften, which helps to release and absorb the nutrient. Again, for the best results, mix up how you consume spinach—some raw, some cooked—but try not to overcook it. Simple ways to eat more spinach I recommend eating one cup (about the size of a tennis ball) of some type of leafy green every day. This can be as simple as placing a handful of spinach on a plate as a bed for whatever else you’re eating, so you get a few spinach leaves with each bite. For a quick and easy side dish, toss spinach with a simple vinaigrette made from whisking together extra virgin olive oil, balsamic vinegar, Dijon mustard, and dried Italian herb seasoning. Sauté spinach in extra virgin olive oil with sweet red bell peppers and crushed red pepper, or steam and toss the greens with jarred olive tapenade or dairy-free pesto. If you’re making a grain bowl, place a handful of spinach on the bottom and flip the portion sizes of the greens and grains to up your veggie intake. Blend spinach into anything from a fruit smoothie to pancakes to hummus, and add it to soups, veggie chili, tacos—nearly any dish. According to a 2019 report, Americans are eating less spinach now than in 2007. It’s time to reverse that trend!","6 Health Benefits of Spinach, According to a Nutritionist",8,0.8854660412439618
1759,"Last week, City Council approved an additional $1.3 million for the Integral Care-EMCOT program next fiscal year, increasing the budget for the Expanded Mobile Crisis Outreach Team by about 75 percent. With those extra dollars, Integral Care, the mental health authority for Travis County, plans to hire enough trained professionals to answer and respond to all mental health-related 911 calls that do not present an imminent threat to public safety. “With the funding we just voted on, we’re to the point where we think we can answer all of the diversion calls through the 911 call center,” Council Member Ann Kitchen said during Council’s Public Safety Committee meeting Monday afternoon. This fiscal year, Integral Care used city funds to put a mental health clinician on the 911 call center floor for the first time, with the job of connecting individuals with the most appropriate resource available. Over this year, Dawn Handley, chief operations officer of Integral Care, said clinicians have been able to address emergencies without involving law enforcement in 85.4 percent of the calls dispatched to a mental health professional. Next year, with $3.15 million for the diversion program, Handley said Integral Care will be able to provide 24/7 services to the call center for calls transferred over from the Austin Police Department or Austin-Travis County Emergency Medical Services Department. In most of those cases, Integral Care plans to connect individuals experiencing a mental health crisis with available facilities and resources without recourse to law enforcement. At the current level of need, Handley said the EMCOT program needs a budget of $6.2 million to have enough backup field clinicians to respond to multiple mental health calls at one time. With the $3.15 million, Handley said it’s possible Integral Care won’t be able to respond to some calls from police or paramedics. Even with the larger budget, the Austin Police Department will still be involved in many mental health cases, including when a crime has been committed, a weapon is present, someone is in need of medical assistance due to use of drugs or alcohol, someone is at risk of hurting themselves or someone else, or someone’s life or property are under threat. “The vast majority of calls we are excluding from transfer are those imminent risk calls where someone is hurting themselves or hurting someone else, and those we cannot transfer to a crisis counselor,” APD Lt. Kenneth Murphy said. Without legislative changes at the state level, police will also remain necessary for cases where an individual is at risk of harming themselves or others and requires involuntary psychiatric commitment. Unlike some states, Texas does not allow licensed mental health professionals or social workers to handle involuntary commitment cases. The city is also considering what can be done to address the root causes of mental health crises that lead to 911 calls. For example, 40 percent of individuals experiencing a mental health crisis are in need of housing services. By addressing those root issues while expanding diversion programs, Handley said research has found significant opportunities for savings in health care, law enforcement and jail time. “It costs much less to have an individual connected to a community-based service than it does in a more restrictive service, or in jail,” Handley said. Nuria Rivera-Vandermyde, deputy city manager, said the city was initiating a deep dive into mental health response services beginning Monday evening with the first of three weekly meetings with a city-community task force. At the end of three weeks, the task force plans to have a set of priorities and rough timeline for plans related to 911 emergency dispatch among other services. “We have asked our officers to do too many jobs,” Council Member Jimmy Flannigan said. “We have asked them to do things that have burdened the department in a way that is unsustainable and we’re not going to do that anymore.”",Integral Care set to address most mental health emergency calls without involving APD,8,0.5322688840613624
1760,"Two studies produce models to predict possible complications following hip and knee replacement surgery. Doctors at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine have developed two new ways to identify candidates who are at risk for complications following hip and knee replacement surgery. ""There is a need to better identify and predict post-operative complications so we can intervene and provide timely follow-up care,"" says Gwo-Chin Lee, MD, Assistant Professor of Orthopaedic Surgery and senior investigator for two studies. ""Total hip and knee replacements are very common, but they also can pose significant health risks to certain patients, especially older adults."" Complications Following Surgery. In one study, Dr. Lee's team studied the results of 1,012 patients who underwent total hip or knee replacement over a 10-month period. Of the 70 patients who developed serious complications, most had cardiopulmonary problems. Of those 70 patients, 11 suffered setbacks within 24 hours; 59, more than 24 hours later. If the 59 patients had undergone same-day or shortstay (overnight) surgery, they would have developed the complications at home and been placed at even greater risk. As a result of the findings, a scale was developed that will allow orthopaedic surgeons to determine if a patient is a candidate for same-day or short-stay procedures, or if that person should be admitted for traditional-duration surgery and recovery. Patients who have at least one risk factor, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, or cirrhosis, should not be considered for either outpatient or overnight-stay total knee or hip replacement. Admission to Critical or Intensive Care. In a second study, Dr. Lee and Dr. Maxwell Courtney studied the records of 738 patients who had undergone the same types of hip or knee replacement surgery. Those who had to be admitted to intensive care or critical care after the procedures had a history of COPD, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, or chronic kidney disease, or needed medications to raise blood pressure during the procedure, or they lost more than 1,000 milliliters of blood during surgery. Based on the findings, researchers developed the Penn Arthroplasty Risk Score (PARS) to predict which patients would require intensive or critical care after either surgery. The new model replaces an older one that covered fewer medical conditions, and none that involved intraoperative (during surgery) procedures. ""Under the previous model, one in four patients were preemptively admitted to ICU,"" says Dr. Lee. ""However, we found that only 22 percent of the patients ultimately required such stepped-up intervention. By incorporating certain factors into the model, such as significant blood loss and the need to raise the patient's blood pressure, we have refined the selection criteria for post-surgery admission to the ICU."" Lower Cost, More Available Beds. Use of the PARS tool will result in fewer patients being routinely admitted to intensive care and critical care units after joint replacement surgery, which will result in lower costs without compromising patient safety. It will also ensure that scarce critical care beds are available for those who need them most.",Identifying Joint Replacement Patients at Risk for Complications,8,0.9207674262789277
1761,"The man was out of his wheelchair and lay flat on his back just off San Francisco’s Market Street, waiting for the hypodermic needle to pierce his skin and that familiar euphoric feeling to wash over him. The old-timer, who appeared to be in his 60s, could not find a viable vein, so a 38-year-old man named Daniel Hogan helped him. Hogan, a longtime drug user originally from St. Louis, leaned over the older man, eyeing his neck as he readied a syringe loaded with the powerful synthetic opioid fentanyl. xaHogan called the man a “jellyfish,” because most of his veins had collapsed from years of intravenous drug use and he rarely bled when pricked. But the older guy still had his jugular vein, and for Hogan that would work just fine. Hogan’s hands were pink and swollen, bearing scars and scabs from years of daily drug use and the harshness of life on the streets. But those hands were skilled in the art of street phlebotomy. He slid the needle into the man’s neck and pushed the plunger. Hogan, who said he had taken fentanyl every day for the past two months, explained that he’d developed a tolerance for the drug, and the dose he gave himself would kill a less experienced user. So he gave the older man only a fraction of that amount. In case it was too much, Hogan was ready with a vial of naloxone, the overdose-reversal drug. Grim drug scenes like this play out every day on the streets surrounding San Francisco’s Civic Center—an area that spans the hard-luck sidewalks of the Tenderloin district and the transitional Mid-Market neighborhood, home to the tech titans Twitter and Uber. The area has become a beachhead for fentanyl, which has killed tens of thousands across the United States and is beginning to make itself felt in California. The drug, which can shut down breathing in less than a minute, became the leading cause of opioid deaths in the United States in 2016. More and more drug users are seeking it out, craving its powerful high. Some of those users say they feel a measure of security because many of their peers carry naloxone, which can quickly restore their breathing if they overdose. Data suggest that in San Francisco, drug users may be reversing as many overdoses as paramedics—or more. In both cases, the numbers have risen sharply in recent years. In 2018, San Francisco paramedics administered naloxone to 1,647 people, up from 980 two years earlier, according to numbers from the city’s emergency-response system. That compares with 1,658 naloxone-induced overdose reversals last year by laypeople, most of them drug users, according to self-reported data from the DOPE Project, a Bay Area overdose-prevention program run by the publicly funded Harm Reduction Coalition. That’s nearly double the 2016 figure. “People who use drugs are the primary witnesses to overdose,” says Eliza Wheeler, the national overdose-response strategist for the coalition. “So it would make sense that when they are equipped with naloxone, they are much more likely to reverse an overdose.” The widespread availability of naloxone has radically changed the culture of opioid use on the streets, Hogan said. “In the past, if you OD’d, man, it was like you were really rolling the dice.” Now, he said, people take naloxone for granted.  “I feel like as long as there is Narcan around, the opiates can’t kill you,” says Nick Orlick, 26, referring to one of the brand names for the overdose-reversal drug. As he huddled in the recess of a building along Mission Street, around the corner from high-rise luxury apartments, Orlick explained that he’d been revived with naloxone 15 times in recent years. Despite fentanyl’s growing presence in San Francisco and other parts of California, it has not hit the Golden State nearly as hard as the rest of the country. In 2017, 28,466 people across the United States died from overdoses involving synthetic opioids, which include fentanyl and related compounds, according to data from the Kaiser Family Foundation. California, which represents 12 percent of the country’s population, had 536 of those deaths—less than 2 percent of the total. (Kaiser Health News, which produces California Healthline, is an editorially independent program of the foundation.) However, use of fentanyl is likely to grow in San Francisco and Los Angeles, as people get accustomed to it and begin to prefer its more intense high, says Ricky Bluthenthal, a professor of preventive medicine at the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California, who researches injection drug use. In California, as in many other states west of the Mississippi, heroin is smuggled in the form of a gooey or hard black tar. This “black tar” heroin, “a well-known garbage drug,” is diluted with fillers, which induces some users to seek out the much more powerful effects of fentanyl, says Kristen Marshall, the manager of the DOPE Project. Fentanyl is dangerous not only because it is up to 50 times more potent than heroin, but also because people often take it unknowingly when their dealers mix it in with street drugs such as heroin. However, the black tar is difficult to mix with fentanyl, and that may help protect drug users who might otherwise ingest it unwittingly, experts say. But even if they overdose on fentanyl, it’s not necessarily a death sentence. The widespread practice by community organizations in San Francisco and Los Angeles of distributing naloxone to the drug-using population also helps explain California’s lower rate of deaths from fentanyl and other opioids, harm-reduction workers and researchers say. On the streets around San Francisco’s Civic Center, homeless drug users gather on sidewalks with their dogs, some huddling under blankets to smoke their white, powdered fentanyl through hollowed-out pens. Others inject it, often ducking into alcoves, alleys, or tents for a fleeting moment of privacy amid the bustle of government employees, tourists, and tech workers. Some of them overdose in plain sight. They employ various methods to reduce the overdose risk. Some, like Daniel Hogan, take methamphetamine or smoke crack between injections to keep themselves alert. Another technique is to delay the full dose by pushing the plunger only partway down. If gathered as a group, they often stagger their fentanyl use so one of them will be physically able to administer naloxone. One recent May afternoon near Market Street, a thin man in his early 40s who called himself Bud slid a needle into his arm and slowly pushed the plunger down, stopping every so often to gauge the effects of the fentanyl. “Hey, stop there. Pull it out,” said his friend Seth Carus, 55. Bud’s eyes were vacant and his mouth drooped — telltale signs the fentanyl had taken hold. Bud, wearing tight clothing and a blue beret, didn’t listen. He pushed the plunger all the way. Five minutes later, the color drained from his face, his eyes opened wide, his jaw locked, and his entire body went stiff as he lay on the sidewalk. Carus, living on the streets and a fentanyl user himself, sprang into action. He prepared a shot of naloxone and told a bystander to call 911. But before Carus could administer the overdose-reversal drug, Bud began to stir. Carus cradled him in his arms as the police arrived, followed quickly by the paramedics, who put Bud in an ambulance. Carus blamed himself as he bent over and cried. The fentanyl was his, and he had been trying to do Bud a favor by getting him high.   A while later, Bud emerged from the ambulance and embraced his friend. “You did the right thing, man,” he told Carus. “I did the shitty drug-addict thing. You said to stop, and I didn’t listen.”",Naloxone Has Made Overdosing Less Terrifying,8,0.9307728881764269
1762,"Our bodies run on predictable daily schedules. As morning approaches, our body temperature begins to rise, and our cortisol levels climb. Our heart rate and blood pressure spike upon awakening. By mid-morning, we tend to be at our most alert, while many components of athletic performance—including strength, coordination, and flexibility—peak in the afternoon. As darkness descends, the pineal gland dials up its release of melatonin; while we sleep, gastric-acid secretion surges. Similar 24-hour cycles, or circadian rhythms, govern nearly every cell, tissue, and organ in the human body, and almost all of its physiological functions. Hospitals, it turns out, have daily rhythms too, and they don’t always sync with our own. According to a recent Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences study, conducted before hospitals were handling surges in coronavirus cases, hospital clinicians prescribe medications in predictable patterns, dispensing the majority in the morning. This schedule—what the researchers call a “systemic bias in the timing of medicine”—may be convenient for clinicians, but it’s not necessarily best for patients or consistent with their biological clock. Hospitals run all day and night, and in theory medications could be doled out whenever they’re needed. “Our findings challenge this notion,” the study’s authors write, “and reveal a potential operational barrier to best clinical care.” For busy doctors, time is a scarce resource—and hospitals are generally designed to deliver care as quickly and efficiently as possible. But the human body keeps its own time, so optimal care may be less of a race than a chronologically choreographed dance. The research team, led by the pediatric otolaryngologist David Smith and the circadian biologist John Hogenesch, analyzed approximately 500,000 doses of a dozen drugs—including painkillers, antibiotics, and corticosteroids—given to inpatients at the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center from 2010 to 2017. The researchers found that the times at which drugs were ordered and administered weren’t uniformly distributed—instead, there were “distinct morning-time surges and overnight lulls.” (The researchers, who are based at the Cincinnati hospital, declined an interview request.) Roughly a third of all orders were submitted in the four-hour period from 8 a.m. to noon. And most of those were concentrated between 8 and 10:30 a.m., when clinicians were conducting their morning rounds. The finding makes sense, says Garret FitzGerald, who directs the Institute for Translational Medicine and Therapeutics at the University of Pennsylvania, and was not involved in the research. “Any of us that are physicians know that a lot of hospital behavior is driven by rounding times, and those rounding times are chosen for all sorts of reasons that don’t necessarily have any particular scientific basis,” he told me. That doesn’t make the synchrony between rounding and prescribing medically sound, however. Patients should get drugs when they need them, not just when it’s convenient for clinicians, and there’s no evidence to suggest that, say, infections or inflammation or pain are confined to the morning. (In fact, patient pain tends to worsen at night.) “A lot of the times the schedules that are in place have nothing to do with the biological requirements of the patient that may be driven by circadian rhythms,” says Michael Smolensky, a medical chronobiologist at the University of Texas at Austin. The flood of morning orders also seemed to create an operational bottleneck; the delay between when drugs were prescribed and when they were administered was longest for medications ordered in that 8-to-noon window, the researchers found. It’s not clear whether these delays affected patient outcomes, but it’s certainly conceivable that they could have. In addition to these potential problems, there's the fact that our bodies are not stable systems. Our own internal rhythms mean that time of day can influence how well a given drug works or how severe its side effects are. Many ailments wax and wane in predictable ways over the course of the day—cold and allergy symptoms tend to be worst in the morning, while heartburn often strikes overnight—as do blood flow, liver function, and other physiological processes that can affect drug metabolism. A compound that’s quickly eliminated from the body during the day can linger at night. “We know that giving drugs at different times of the day can often result in different blood levels of those drugs or different adverse effects,” FitzGerald said. Our responses to various drugs, he added, are “conditioned by the clock.” Many adults, for example, take a daily dose of aspirin to help stave off the blood clots that can cause heart attacks and strokes. These cardiovascular events are especially common in the early-morning hours, and some research suggests that aspirin is most likely to prevent them when taken before bed. The drug also seems to cause less damage to the lining of the stomach when ingested at night. “Treating at the wrong biological time may not get you the results you want,” Smolensky told me, “and it may potentially aggravate the medical condition even further.” Although these time-based effects have been documented for a wide variety of drugs, many medications “are taken without any thought about the concept of when,” Smolensky said. In fact, the Cincinnati researchers saw this play out at their hospital. Previous research has established that many blood-pressure medications are most effective when given at night. But at the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center, almost twice as many doses of hydralazine, a drug commonly used to treat high blood pressure, were given during the day as at night. The researchers found no obvious clinical rationale for this timing—as a whole, patients’ blood pressures did not seem to be spiking significantly higher during the hours when the drug was most commonly ordered. And when the drug was dispensed at night, it prompted a bigger drop in blood pressure than when it was taken in the morning. “Paradoxically, patients were more responsive to therapy during the window of time (nighttime) when relatively few orders were placed,” the researchers write. In an ideal world, clinicians’ prescribing behavior would be calibrated to when different drugs work best. Antipsychotics, for instance, may cause fewer metabolic problems when they’re administered in the morning. The point is that there’s no optimal time that holds for all drugs—and no medical reason to front-load all medications in the morning. Unfortunately, correcting for this bias won’t be easy. Hospital staffing schedules are carefully designed, and rounding typically happens at the same time each morning for a reason. But simply making clinicians aware of the problem could prompt them to be a bit more thoughtful about when they’re ordering certain drugs. Hospital staff certainly have their hands full at the moment, but in the wake of this crisis, as they recover and retool, it may also be worth considering more serious changes, such as asking nurses to round more frequently or instituting regular nighttime check-ins. “Perhaps,” FitzGerald said, “we should get a little bit more sophisticated about the way that we give drugs according to time.”",Our Bodies Process Medicines Best at Certain Times of Day,8,0.7547510775297261
1763,"Dear Dr. Hamblin, I’m an attorney and I’ve been working from home. Yesterday I had to visit several courthouses to pick up files. At the security checks at the entrance, they had some kind of infrared camera to check people’s temperature. At one courthouse, I came in through the employee garage and someone stopped me and put a thermometer to my forehead. I live in Miami, my car’s AC is broken, and I had been stuck in traffic and was soaked in sweat. Yet my temperature apparently was 97 degrees, and I was waved inside. Are these temperature checks just “security theater”? How effective are they? Megan Miami, Florida Yes, what you’re describing is theater. As logical as mass temperature checks may seem, the practice hasn’t clearly been shown to help contain the coronavirus. The practice is sort of like spraying down the sides of buildings, showering football players in hand sanitizer, or deep cleaning an office carpet. These things might make us feel safer, but they may not keep us safe if they actually cause us to let our guard down. Fever screens seem part of America’s ongoing failure to learn an abiding lesson of modern medicine: Screening tests often backfire. They have value only in specific contexts. Doctors have repeatedly seen this play out with lifesaving tests like mammograms, CT scans, and colonoscopies, which can lead to unnecessary biopsies and surgeries when overused. Body temperature is a vital sign that is monitored continually in hospitals, where it can be an invaluable window into how a patient is faring. But screening groups of people for the coronavirus is a different matter, and that is what’s happening now. Employers around the United States are attempting to order daily temperature checks to determine who is allowed to enter an office and do their job. As you noticed, access to courts may be based on this test. Fever screens have even been implicated in many plans to open schools: New York City’s Department of Education announced last week that kids would be randomly screened before being allowed to enter school buildings, despite the fact that kids with the virus rarely develop fevers. Temperature checks were first deployed in January amid China’s “throw everything at the wall and show the world we’ve got this locked down” attempt to stop the virus. News reports showed people being ordered out of their car at tollbooths to have infrared thermometer guns placed against their forehead. For a period in February, the Chinese government required some 11 million people to report temperatures to the government daily. By late February, though, researchers had begun reporting that the tactic wasn’t an effective screening tool for this new disease. Unlike Ebola and some other infectious diseases, this coronavirus is contagious before symptoms appear. Many infected people never develop any symptoms at all. While a fever is one of the most common symptoms for people who do get sick, it’s still far from universal among those infected. In June, a study at an Australian hospital found that a minority of patients admitted with the virus had a fever. The researchers concluded that “using fever as a screening tool for COVID-19 may provide a false sense of security.” But what’s the harm? In this moment, that’s a question we need to take seriously—with regard to tests, hygiene practices, or anything else we might be doing to try to stay safe. Anything with the potential to benefit our health also has the potential to undermine it. If people are reassured by a fever check and compromise on the basics—wearing a mask, distancing, hand-washing—they put themselves and others at risk. This test has no ability to reassure people, but a real ability to mislead. A useful test is both sensitive and specific. If you haven’t encountered these terms yet, they can seem esoteric, but we should all know them. A test is considered sensitive if it catches most (and ideally all) cases. A test is specific if it doesn’t misidentify too many cases—that is, if it doesn’t catch too many more than all. Temperature checks for coronavirus infections don’t seem to be sensitive or specific. An elevated body temperature can be caused by many factors other than COVID-19—or illness at all. Some people will see an elevation after exercise or during anxiety. When you’re sweating, your body is working to expel heat through the skin. I’m surprised you registered at 97 degrees. But I still couldn’t comfortably say you aren’t spreading the virus. Your temperature also may not have been 97 degrees. Infrared scanners are imperfect compared with measuring temperature under the tongue or in the rectum. When they’re pointed at your forehead, they’re pretty reliable. But when scanning a crowd, as some public-transit agencies and school districts have started to do, the accuracy fades. Such technology is well suited to detect the presence of humans, as in disasters or military scenarios, but subtle variations and mild fevers are likely to be lost in the crowd. Discerning those is especially difficult because, as you note, people’s normal body temperatures vary on their own. What may constitute an early elevation in one person could be a normal temperature for another. The irony that all of this is happening in a courthouse is probably not lost on you. The state collecting medical information about people raises all sorts of legal issues, only heightened now that the outcome of an inaccurate test could deny access to basic services like courts or schools. Because scanning people for a fever is typically considered a medical test, the act also typically requires consent. And consent or no, employers aren’t normally allowed to demand medical tests of employees. When the pandemic hit the U.S, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission developed emergency precautions that specifically allow employers to monitor employees’ body temperature. But not everyone agrees that this is sound legal policy. As the American Civil Liberties Union argued in response to fever screening in May, privacy is always valued relative to the value of the intervention. Some privacy may need to be sacrificed during a crisis, but we must be deliberate about how and where those compromises are made: for tests that will deliver actionable information proven to help protect the population. Temperature checks may be useful in specific circumstances, as opposed to mass fishing expeditions. But people who are found to have a fever are likely being told what they already know. When fevers do come on, people typically already feel ill. They’re likely to also have a cough, shortness of breath, or other symptoms. They should have had access to a proper test that would tell them if they had the virus. They should have been able to seek medical attention. They should have been able to isolate at home. The real spirit of mass temperature checks, as they’re currently being used, is punitive. If, amid the many false positives and false negatives, fever screening does successfully catch a few sick people who went out anyway, then this may be a symptom of a societal ill. Feverish people are not likely venturing out because they have a death wish or want to infect others; they’re likely doing it because they can’t afford to stay home, or they need to pick up their kids, or they don’t have sick leave. The solution to this isn’t to pour more resources into infrared cameras in an attempt to detect and detain these people. It’s to put those resources into taking care of them in the first place.",Paging Dr. Hamblin: Everyone Wants to Check My Temperature,8,0.3705445782039818
1764,"In the 1880s, a few short years after the telephone’s invention, futurists envisioned a modern doctor unrestricted by time and space. “That specialist would sit in a web of wires,” the Johns Hopkins medical historian Jeremy Greene told me, “and take the pulse of the nation.” At the time, and for decades after, medical practice remained circumscribed by geography. Black bag in tow, packed with every tool a physician would need, roaming doctors traveled by automobile or horseback and tended to the bedridden wherever they lay. But by the mid-20th century, clinicians stopped trekking from household to household. “The old-school home visit is just totally impractical,” Charles Owens, the director of Georgia Southern University’s Center for Public Health Practice and Research, told me. “It’s logistically kind of a train wreck.” Cars, public transportation, and sprawling hospital systems eventually converted home visits from a standard of care—40 percent of physician encounters in 1930—to a relic, just 1 percent by 1980. Patients, then and now, flocked to doctor’s offices. Today, telehealth has resurrected the house call more than a century after it fell out of favor. This newfangled iteration of a bygone practice is less intimate than having a doctor sitting at your bedside, but more personal than sitting on your doctor’s exam table. For some people, virtual home visits are about as uncomfortable as being poked and prodded in a hospital gown, but they allow doctors to once again observe quotidian details of their patients’ health that they might not otherwise glimpse. “The doctor’s office is a stressful place for everyone,” Mark Fendrick, a primary-care doctor with Michigan Medicine, told me. “There are some things we look for that are more artificial in a doctor’s office and more real-world at home.” Studies have shown, for example, that automated blood-pressure measurements taken when a patient is sitting alone in a quiet place are more accurate. People with white-coat hypertension regularly experience higher blood pressure in clinical settings as a result of anxiety or fear. At-home tests, Fendrick said, can better capture a person’s usual blood pressure. Along the same lines, some patients seem to perform better on telehealth cognitive tests for dementia, Julia Loewenthal, a geriatrician at Boston’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital, told me. In-office exams can be exhausting, nerve-racking ordeals that sap memory and attention; at home, patients are more relaxed and clearer-minded. “It reduces test anxiety,” Loewenthal said. A virtual house call can also improve the quality of treatments. Christina Dierkes, a 37-year-old from Columbus, Ohio, usually dreads the end of an intense therapy session. “You bare your soul to this person,” she told me, “and then you’re running into somebody in the elevator and sitting in the car crying and driving home.” Since March, she’s connected with her therapist over the phone, from safe within her pandemic cocoon. “I was at home, in my own space, in sweatpants. It made it easier to imagine I was talking to myself or someone I feel really safe with,” she said. This advantage is, to some degree, subjective. David Bober, a 51-year-old in Maryland, struggles to find a quiet spot at home where he won’t be overheard or interrupted during psychiatry sessions and is ready to return to in-person therapy. “I’d be happy to sit 12 feet away, on the other side of the room, wearing a mask,” he says. And having to verbalize bodily concerns to a doctor who can’t touch or examine a patient up close can be a source of discomfort. Jon Johns, a 54-year-old in eastern Ohio, had his annual physical—it went well—over videoconference in April. “But what if I was in pain or something was wrong?” he says. “I would be anxious about how well I was describing my symptoms.” Whatever might be missing from the patient’s descriptions, doctors can glean information through telemedicine that they wouldn’t otherwise have access to. And this might be the true magic of the virtual house call. The family doctor Carman Ciervo, for example, can’t check a pulse or administer a vaccine through a screen. But over video, Ciervo, a primary care physician for Jefferson Health, in Philadelphia, goes over the prescriptions in his patients’ medicine cabinet one by one. He gauges nutrition by peeking inside fridges. In summertime, Ciervo asks to see thermostats to make sure they’re on and functional. If a patient has mobility issues, he monitors the video’s background for railings or potential tripping hazards. “Just observing how they climb the stairs can give you a wealth of information,” Ciervo says. “These are all safety problems they might not be aware of, and that might not come up in an office visit.” Susan Kressly, a pediatrician in Pennsylvania, says her patients—who are often fidgety, anxious, and reserved in her office—are relaxed and outgoing when talking with her from their bedrooms. “When you move the playing field to the patient’s home base,” she told me, “some of that power imbalance and discomfort with the setting goes away.” The screen also opens a wider window into each child’s personality, Kressly said. Have they been riding the bike she sees in the background and playing with the dog who keeps running in and out of the frame? What’s on their bookshelf? Do they have a sibling to play with or a fort to hide away in? “All of a sudden, you’ve created a personal connection to them as human beings,” she said. “We get a glimpse inside the reality of where patients spend a lot of time—with COVID, a majority of the time.” However, as the Kansas City University medical historian Kirby Randolph points out, keeping one’s personal life private might be the point of going into a generic doctor’s office. “A lot of patients don’t want the doctor to see their home environment, because they’re self-conscious,” she told me. Domesticating medicine’s turf won’t cure the biases baked into its history—racism, classism, homophobia, sexism, sizeism, and ageism among them—that could color how a clinician interprets a patient’s surroundings.  During the era of traditional house calls, for example, some white physicians refused to enter Black households or treat Black patients, she said. Today, the rooms revealed on video conference broadcast the pay gap between clinician and client (whose income may be dwarfed by their doctor’s six-figure salary). For racial minorities, rural residents, and the elderly—who more often struggle with lower-quality or nonexistent home internet connections—that socioeconomic disparity might be further amplified by IT issues. Once connected, poorer patients, Randolph said, might worry they’ll be blamed for their health problems if a doctor sees an ashtray or junk food on the coffee table. “The very deep social determinants of health and illness seem so intractable that finding a technological solution that might short-circuit them is enormously appealing,” said Greene, the Johns Hopkins historian. “But technology can be liberating and oppressing.” Modern medicine has embraced the notion that a person’s well-being is shaped by intimate forces such as upbringing, social circles, and access to transportation and fresh groceries. And yet, most doctors are trained to practice in sanitized, corporate  environments and not in the home—“exposed to violence or viruses or the awkwardness of standing in somebody’s house,” Randolph said. The virtual house call may seem as revolutionary as the 19th-century vision of a modern physician, nested in wires, taking a patient’s pulse from miles away. It challenges the notion that medicine exists only in clinical settings, and offers doctors a view into the space where a person’s health exists as a lived experience. But even virtual medicine takes place somewhere, and that location still shapes the quality of care, for better or worse, from patient to patient. “The idea of meeting the person where they’re at,” Randolph said, “that’s not a preference for everyone.”",What a Doctor Learns From Watching You on Video Chat,8,0.45634193989908867
1765,"In a resettlement colony on the outskirts of Chennai, a sprawling industrial city on India’s Bay of Bengal, rows of beige tenements rise out of marshland in clusters, blocking out the sky in a uniform grid. Construction materials line the first floor of buildings, and bulldozers roll through the wide and dusty streets. Vijay Vasanth says he arrived here in early January on government-provided transport. His family and their belongings were left on the sidewalk in the middle of the settlement, named Perumbakkam. “When we came here, we had to be homeless,” Vasanth says. “They just lifted us and dropped us here. Now we have to stay.” Chennai is the capital of the state of Tamil Nadu. Vasanth says he grew up in the heart of the city, in a neighborhood called Sathyavani Muthu Nagar alongside the Cooum River. But in late 2019, officials evicted 500 families living there, Vasanth’s included, without initially informing residents why they were being evicted or where they were going. They were among the first batch of 2,092 families set to be evicted. “They started marking our houses by writing letters and numbers on the door,” says Vasanth. He asked why, and was told it was because his home was along the river. The markings on the door were to tell the families their house was set for demolition. Those families—like tens of thousands of families before them—were moved to settlement colonies like this one, miles from the city center and far from the sources of work and income that they once knew. When the families arrived, many of the apartments they eventually moved into lacked running water or electricity. “There was only one light—an emergency light on the veranda,” says Vasanth, who has struggled to find work. It is too expensive to travel the nearly 19 miles to central Chennai, where he once sold electronics. “For three months we struggled hard,” he says. “We were stir crazy.” It’s a familiar sentiment. Vasanth’s former neighborhood of Sathyavani Muthu Nagar is one of dozens of informal settlements in the process of being demolished by Chennai officials—part of a vast effort, they say, to restore the city’s heavily polluted and constricted waterways. The government’s first step, according to project documents, is what’s officially called “slum clearance,” or the removal of “encroachments.” Supporters of these restoration initiatives say they are sorely needed. Chennai’s rivers are plagued by rampant pollution and overdevelopment, leaving them uniquely vulnerable. Science suggests that both problems are only amplified by climate change and will continue to be so in coming years. The long-term goal, officials say, is the restoration of crucial riverbank wetlands that can act as buffers against both flood and drought. The neighborhood-clearance projects are carried out in coordination with various government organizations, including the Chennai Rivers Restoration Trust (CRRT), the state Public Works Department, and the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board (TNSCB). The problem, critics say, is that implementing these otherwise well-intentioned programs weighs heavily on—and has little regard for—the thousands of low-income inhabitants eking out already-difficult lives in dozens of informal communities along Chennai’s rivers. Indeed, under the new eco-restoration initiatives, it is not just the 2,092 families from Sathyavani Muthu Nagar—including Vasanth’s—whose lives will be impacted. Nearly 60,000 families are currently marked for eviction from the banks of Chennai’s rivers, according to the TNSCB, which handles the relocation of residents. The families are living in what the officials call “objectionable locations”: low-lying, flood-prone areas. Many have already been moved. But experts worry that at best, these environmental initiatives—while ostensibly for the common good—will continue to result in severe consequences for the city’s poor. At worst, they say, climate change and ecological restoration are being used as pretenses for evacuating the city’s slums so that new and equally imprudent infrastructure can be built. “Even without climate change, we are a city that has been built to drown itself,” says writer Nityanand Jayaraman, who works on environmental justice campaigns in Chennai. “We don’t need extreme weather events. Regular weather events are enough to finish us off.” Either way, what is officially referred to as “resettlement and rehabilitation” of families invariably results in them being sent, often against their will, to distant settlements that housing advocates call ghettos, or satellite slums. “Is this restoration?” asks Vanessa Peter, a researcher at the Information and Resource Center for the Deprived Urban Communities (IRCDUC), a Chennai-based information clearinghouse for the city’s poor. “Or is this just another way of convincing everybody that we should get rid of our slums?” In a video posted to YouTube in 2015, a crowd stands on a bridge spanning the Cooum River—one of three major rivers coursing through the city—watching the swollen water rush underneath. It laps against the bridge, threatening to rise up and over the wall onto the road. On either side of the waterway, rooftops are visible above the turbid, olive-green water. The structures are almost completely underwater. Another video, taken from a bridge near the neighborhood of Koyambedu, shows a similarly bleak reality: the Cooum flowing over more rooftops, with some houses completely washed away. Seen from overhead, the city’s vulnerability is staggering. Few areas lie above sea level; the rest is swallowed by water. This particular flood in 2015, deemed a once-in-a-hundred-years event, damaged or destroyed nearly 500,000 houses, killed at least 470 people, and, together with the rest of the season’s flooding, caused $3 billion in economic losses, according to official estimates. The flooding disproportionately impacted the city’s poor, who mostly lived in low-lying settlements along the river. Following that historic rainfall, a series of abnormally weak monsoons and a subsequent heat wave resulted in a severe drought that peaked in 2019 with the city’s main reservoirs running dry. Of course, cycles of flood and drought have been a feature of life on the Bay of Bengal for millennia. But with climate change pushing the bay ever further inland, studies suggest that water-proximate, pollution-clogged neighborhoods like Sathyavani Muthu Nagar are facing a future of continued inundation. On top of a swelling sea, the city will encounter an increase of extreme weather events as the northeast monsoons get stronger. But Chennai’s problems, critics say, are as much structural as meteorological. “People have the tendency to hide behind climate change,” says S. Janakarajan, president of the South Asia Consortium for Interdisciplinary Water Resources Studies and an expert on water management. Drought and flood, he says, are as much a result of Chennai’s rapid development as they are of extreme weather. Ecologically vital wetlands, estuaries, and rivers fell victim to decades of negligent land-use policy and an insatiable urban sprawl. Over the past 40 years, paved surfaces have expanded more than eight times over, according to a report by Care Earth, a nonprofit that does extensive restoration work throughout the city. These wetlands and waterways serve as systems for recharging the city’s aquifers, absorbing heavy rain and providing the city’s drinking water, so climate change will likely challenge the wisdom of those new developments. In the aftermath of the 2015 flood, a report published by the Citizen Consumer and Civic Action Group, a local consumer and environmental advocacy group, noted that the increased frequency of climate change–amplified events threatens to exacerbate already-pressing environmental problems. The report called for extensive mapping of the storage and carrying capacities of local bodies of water, which had degraded due to “incessant construction,” as well as “dumping of debris, and encroachments.” Yet when it comes to addressing issues like these, Jayaraman says, blame too often falls on informal settlements like Sathyavani Muthu Nagar. The elimination of Chennai’s riverside communities remains a primary focus of the post-2015 restoration push. Because these informal settlements are often built directly into the riverbank, many officials—as well as Chennai’s middle- and upper-class residents—believe they’re making the flooding worse, mainly by blocking drainage areas. And so ecological restoration of the Cooum has focused on “slum eviction as an achievable first step,” noted a 2010 analysis written by Karen Coelho, a scholar of urban ecology and associate professor at the Madras Institute of Development Studies, and urban planner and community advocate Nithya Raman. “This shortcut approach is openly announced,” the paper continued, “confidently addressing a growing urban middle-class constituency who hold slum-dwellers responsible for the state of the rivers, and regard their summary removal as the crux of eco-restoration.” As climate change increasingly lays bare the city’s complex ecological crisis, nearly all interventions seem to start with this familiar logic. “For some strange reason,” says Jayaraman, “they believe that the only encroachers in the city that are problematic are the poor.” Such thinking leaves some of the more complicated realities of citywide ecological restoration unaddressed, Jayaraman and others say. These include more harmful ecological disruptions, like the decimation of vital wetlands outside the city, or mega-projects like the port expansion being pursued by the multinational company Adani, which will affect thousands of acres of critical tidal wetlands north of Chennai, threatening local fishing towns. The eviction drive stems from a post-flood request from the chief minister of Tamil Nadu for massive investment in housing for the residents who were most affected. Yet despite a 2016 high court order that directed the local government to examine resettling riverside residents “near the area where they were originally relocated,” CRRT-driven evictions have increasingly sent these families to hastily built colonies on the city’s periphery. In a resettlement action plan prepared by the Tamil Nadu Housing and Habitat Development Project, with funding from the World Bank, the authors acknowledge the need for new housing—not just because of a housing shortage, but as a clear climate issue. The plan says CRRT’s work is expected to contribute positively in managing climate-induced extreme events. But CRRT, a wholly owned division of the Tamil Nadu government, has long been criticized for using ecological restoration as a mere pretext for allowing new development projects. In their 2010 article, Coelho and Raman described CRRT’s first project along the Adyar River, which evicted hundreds of huts and threatened thousands more with demolition. The aim was to create an eco-park and restore local flora and fauna, as well as the river’s ecological function. But the Tamil Nadu government had already permitted new office buildings, multistory luxury residential complexes, and five-star hotels on what was left of the estuary at the mouth of the river, irreversibly damaging the location’s fragile ecology. “These efforts,” Coelho and Raman wrote, “were already moot.” Further complicating matters, the relocation settlements are often built on wetlands themselves. The colony Kannagi Nagar, for one, filled in part of the essential Pallikaranai wetland to avoid flooding—but in the process blocked drainage of the Okkiyam Maduvu channel, an estuary so ecologically critical it has been dubbed the “aorta” of the marsh. CRRT’s scope is limited, says S. Vishwanathan, an official with the trust. Their main focus is restoring the allotted project areas. The trust, officials added in an email message, has not prioritized aesthetics or “allowed any real estate agency to pave for individual interest.” For decades, they say, they’ve felt caught between environmentalists, who want to restore function to the city’s heavily damaged waterways, and social advocates, who criticize the resulting displacement of residents as unnecessary, unjust, and anti-poor. “CRRT gets sandwiched between these two,” Vishwanathan says. Officials say they must walk the fine line of addressing flooding hazard and restoration, while meeting the needs of affected families. They also argue that they’re being more surgical in their removals than critics typically portray. “My focus is not to remove the entire slum,” says Vishwanathan. “We identified that part of the slum that lies within the river itself.” The resulting impact on families is addressed in an official “Resettlement & Rehabilitation Scheme” for affected families—people like Vasanth and his family—who are deemed vulnerable to flooding. Officials point to social and community-development programs, financial relief, and a provision of utilities and basic services. Acknowledging the difficulty of the distant displacement, Vishwanathan says the alternative would be worse if the families stayed along the river. “They lose everything every year” to flooding, he says, and they have no facilities. According to Vishwanathan, the resettlement colonies are a step up. Yet years of documentation and research by advocates have shown that the evictions have negative impacts on the residents’ livelihood. The issue—according to a World Bank report published in February—is that the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board, which is ultimately in charge of the resettlement and rehabilitation of families, “does not have a standardized environmental or social framework” for projects. Instead, “it implements ad-hoc measures” to suit each intervention. The COVID-19 pandemic further exposed these deficiencies, as enforced lockdowns have left residents struggling to survive in isolation. “While TNSCB is experienced in managing physical construction and delivering housing units, they do not have all the necessary expertise or experience in addressing key issues,” World Bank representatives wrote to Undark in an email. These issues include ensuring residents can secure an economic livelihood and live in environmentally sustainable, climate-resilient housing. They add that despite the grievances of evictees, removing families may still be necessary. While relocating families to nearby housing is always preferable, that often isn’t an option—and displacing families from the riverbank is necessary due to the area’s high risk and inhabitability. As of now, officials say, the TNSCB has indicated willingness to expand social and environmental reforms. In late June, the government of Tamil Nadu signed onto a $250 million project with the World Bank to “strengthen the state’s housing sector policies, institutions, and regulations.” It’s part of a two-pronged approach to shift the responsibility for the development of low-income housing away from the public sector and encourage more private-sector involvement. The program also indicates expanded environmental and social reforms to alleviate some of the current housing-development concerns. So far, advocates have criticized the Tamil Nadu government for lack of transparency, citing the lack of participation with the most impacted communities, like Vasanth’s. The policy draft was unavailable for community input, they say—and furthermore, no copy was available in Tamil, the local language. In the neighborhoods being razed, like Sathyavani Muthu Nagar, most residents were wage laborers, auto-rickshaw drivers, and domestic workers. Some families have had ties to the river area going back three or four generations. Now in the new settlements, many families are saddled with arduous, expensive, and often-impossible journeys to the city center in order to work. At such distances, many displaced residents are effectively locked out of the predominantly working-class, cash-based network that undergirds Chennai’s dense urban economy. Schools, public safety, and health-care services are also scarce and inadequate in these colonies, according to a 2019 report by the IRCDUC. Other public services are cost-prohibitive for most settlement residents, according to research by the Housing and Land Rights Network, a New Delhi–based human-rights organization. The concentration of poverty contributes to high crime rates, and despite government efforts, access to electricity, water, and affordable food is often unreliable. In December, the evictions in Sathyavani Muthu Nagar were temporarily halted amid widespread protest and civil disobedience. Two residents jumped into the putrid river to demand the government at least postpone the evictions until after their children completed exams. And even advocates for river restoration and better water resource management say that Chennai’s relentless displacement of poor and working families is unfair. The best-case scenario, they say, would be relocation to govern Having lived along the Cooum for years, Vasanth recalls the impact the 2015 floods had on his community. “People who live down by the river really struggled during the flooding,” he says. “Water entered all the houses.” Many families lost their dwellings completely. Vasanth’s home was located above the bank, however, and was spared any damage. When the TNSCB came to evict the first batch of 500 families, Vasanth’s included, he couldn’t understand why. “They didn’t give any reason, like flooding—they just told us it was dangerous to live near the river,” he recalls. Such life was dangerous for some, he says, but his family had been spared over years of cyclones and floods. For Vasanth, Sathyavani Muthu Nagar was more livable than Perumbakkam, the resettlement colony where he was delivered early this year. In his old neighborhood, everything was nearby: food, work, his community. Perumbakkam, he says, is too far removed, and if he traveled back into the heart of Chennai for work, most of his money would have to go to paying for bus tickets. “I miss everything,” Vasanth says. “Everything was near to us.” A 2017 report from the IRCDUC found that resettlement job programs were lacking and had little follow-through. Faced with overcrowded, mismanaged schools, students dropped out at high rates after being displaced; if they decided to keep their existing schools, the average daily commute would be between three and five hours. Parents were also hesitant to send students to school, citing poor educational quality and safety concerns, especially for girls. The tenements themselves are also barely livable at times. Residents have reported having to sleep outside the buildings until their apartments were finished being built; when they were, some had to still wait for electricity. If elevators don’t work, some residents must carry heavy water jugs up as much as eight stories, a near-impossible task for older or disabled residents. When Vasanth’s family arrived, they were originally assigned a seventh-story apartment. However, the elevator did not work, and his pregnant sister-in-law couldn’t make it up the stairs. The only other available apartment lacked water and electricity. The new community comes together to share resources, but, still, Vasanth says, it’s unbearable. “Right now, the situation is the same. It is very difficult. Five months they have not done anything. There are so many people struggling hard in our apartment.” He wishes they could have stayed in their home along the Cooum. “If they cleaned the river and gave a house in the same place, I would have been happy,” he says. “What is the point of them evicting us here? There is no electricity, there is no water.” According to data collected by the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board, more than 16,000 families have been relocated as a direct consequence of river restoration along the Cooum and Adyar rivers. Some 42,000 more are slated to follow from around Chennai. For now, however, evictions have halted as COVID-19 spreads throughout the city. Peter and Coelho have both worked to research these resettlements, which they see as a discriminatory intervention. In India, a caste system is implicit in social decisions. Most informal settlement residents are of lower caste backgrounds, says Peter. Coelho says that the World Bank has at least shifted support toward a more equitable relocation strategy by including project safeguards. But both researchers remain concerned that people sent to these settlements face unacceptable living conditions. Meanwhile, river restoration has become an initiative prioritized at the highest levels in India. Restoration activities are seen as a pathway to a modern, cleaned-up, 21st-century nation, and ecological interventions will almost certainly be necessary to adapt to a rapidly changing climate, with stronger floods, droughts, and heat waves. But Coelho suggests that so far these efforts have ignored, or given short shrift to, the most important questions. “The first order of business when we are talking about ecology,” she says, “should be ‘What are we going to do about fifty to sixty thousand people?’”",Sixty-Thousand Evictions in the Name of Environmentalism,8,0.35188407686271306
1766,"Peter Vig didn’t go into orthodontics looking to take on the entire field. When he entered the profession in 1963 as an academic, he optimistically saw orthodontics as a way to apply his knowledge to help patients. He would go on to receive his Ph.D. in facial morphology at the University of London, conduct research at a number of universities, and earn 18 grants from the National Institutes of Health. These feats propelled him, in the eyes of other orthodontists, to the status of research legend. But as Vig’s career took off, he became more disillusioned. The more time he spent entrenched in orthodontic research, the more he questioned what he had been taught in dental school: that orthodontic treatment was necessary for health. Over the years, Vig submitted letters to academic journals, bemoaning a lack of strong evidence for the health benefits of orthodontic treatment and questioning what he calls “the prevailing dogma” of orthodontics. He once testified as an expert witness in a lawsuit against a fellow orthodontist. At one point, the American Journal of Orthodontics, now the American Journal of Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics, for whom he was a reviewer, was set to reject Vig’s own paper because editors feared that the results—which questioned the efficacy of diagnosis and variability in treatment—reflected poorly on the orthodontic profession. In response, Vig threatened to write an article about the ethics of orthodontic journals. (When contacted by Undark, the editor in chief of the American Journal of Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics declined to comment.) Eventually, the editors agreed to publish the paper. But by that point, Vig had come to view the disagreement as yet another example of a lack of scientific integrity in orthodontics. “Shortly after that,” he said, “I quit.” Vig is now semi-retired. Much has changed in the field of orthodontics since the height of his career. But according to him, orthodontic organizations haven’t stopped making claims unfounded in research. Orthodontics is largely considered a medical specialty, not just a cosmetic one. From small clinics to the American Association of Orthodontists (AAO), advertisements promise to prevent a host of ills ranging from cavities to jaw pain. Today, the AAO advises parents that all children should have an orthodontic consultation by age 7 in order to identify potential problems and develop a treatment plan. According to the organization’s website, a lack of treatment can lead to “tooth decay, gum disease, broken front teeth, and loss of bone tissue that holds teeth in place.” Many orthodontic clinics also warn of persistent jaw pain and headaches. A small group of dentists and orthodontists from across the globe has looked carefully at the evidence underpinning these claims and found it lacking. Although some research suggests that orthodontic treatment improves oral health, individual studies often don’t control for variables like socioeconomic status. Further, when researchers analyze the results of multiple studies together, they don’t find evidence that orthodontic treatment decreases one’s likelihood of developing conditions such as gum disease and jaw pain. Since the 1940s, there has been a steady increase in the percentage of children who receive orthodontic treatment. From 2010 to 2012, 16.8 percent of U.S. children between 10 and 14 years of age visited an orthodontist. And the proportion who see an orthodontist at any point throughout their childhood is probably much greater. Based on past data, it’s likely that today around half of U.S. children receive orthodontic treatment, according to Philippe Hujoel, an oral-health epidemiologist at the University of Washington. Meanwhile, out-of-pocket spending on orthodontic treatments costs roughly $5.4 billion per year. Private insurance and Medicaid cover an additional $4.2 billion of that care, and some nonprofits cover treatments for families in need when Medicaid deems treatment medically unnecessary. The American Association of Orthodontists declined to comment to Undark. But many orthodontists stand by the association’s claims, and some have raised questions about the motives of some of the discipline’s critics—including Vig, who recently joined the clinical advisory board of, and will accept money from, a direct-to-consumer teeth-alignment company that is marketed as an alternative to traditional orthodontics. (Vig acknowledged his relationship with the company, but in an email noted that his academic work critiquing orthodontics precedes that relationship by decades.) Other experts, including Peter Greco, a clinical professor of orthodontics at the University of Pennsylvania and an associate editor of The American Journal of Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics, point out that orthodontic treatments are uniquely difficult to experimentally test, and so treatment decisions are often based on traditional knowledge and an orthodontist’s clinical experience, rather than on scientific evidence. “That’s pretty much where the predominance of information is,” Greco said. But, he added, the field is becoming more evidence-based as time goes on. Some orthodontists who question their field’s claims about oral health do continue to treat patients. As they see it, clear communication of evidence—or lack thereof—is key. “If you tell a layperson” that a child has “mandibular hypoplasia, or maxillary deficiency, or adenoidal facies—it sounds bad,” said Vig. Parents don’t necessarily know what they’re signing up for. “That,” he added, “is a problem.” Since antiquity, dentists from Egypt to Greece have sought the perfect bite. Mummies have been found buried in tombs with bands around their teeth. Even the Roman philosopher Pliny the Elder recommended that people file their teeth to bring them into proper alignment. By the early 18th century, French dentist Pierre Fauchard was strapping patients’ teeth to metal arches to wrangle crooked smiles into submission. Early in the 19th century, British dental surgeon Joseph Fox devoted four chapters of his book The Natural History and Diseases of the Human Teeth to the correction of crooked teeth and misaligned jaws. The end goal of those treatments, however, wasn’t preventing health problems but creating a more attractive profile, said Marc Ackerman, an orthodontist and medical ethicist in Boston. Norman Kingsley, considered one of the early fathers of orthodontics, was a classically trained sculptor. During his day job as a dentist in New York, he applied his understanding of facial symmetry to the patients’ faces, diagnosing what he called “irregularities” and “deformities.” It wasn’t until the turn of the 20th century that an American dentist named Edward Angle transformed dentistry’s obsession with straight teeth into the modern science of orthodontics. In his treatise “Treatment of Malocclusion of the Teeth,” Angle laid out the precise parameters of a perfect bite, down to the millimeter. He based this ideal on the relative positions of the upper and lower first molars, which he believed should fit cleanly into one another, the crest of the top tooth into the divet in the middle of the bottom tooth. Any bite deviating from this proposed ideal Angle deemed a “malocclusion”—Latin for “bad close.” “This was probably the cornerstone of the medicalization in orthodontics,” said Alexander Spassov, an orthodontist and researcher in Greifswald, Germany. Angle’s criteria gave orthodontists a measure that could supposedly identify which bites needed treatment and which didn’t. Still, the transformation of orthodontics into a medical specialty was gradual and is hard to trace to a specific moment in history, Spassov said; for example, although Angle helped establish the specialty by founding both the first orthodontic school and the American Society of Orthodontists (today the AAO), he made no mention of health benefits. Ackerman noted that it was only later, perhaps after World War II, that orthodontics began to be seen as a preventative treatment for various ills. More than 120 years after Angle waxed poetic about the “artistic harmony” of properly aligned teeth, his concept of an ideal bite is still the basis used to determine whether patients need orthodontic treatment. Orthodontists measure the overlap between patients’ jaws, the width of their palate, the crowding of their teeth. These measurements are compared to the ideal, then categorized by how they deviate in measurement. Class I malocclusions are the least severe; Class II and III the most. This process of systematically measuring teeth and pointing out the way they diverge from the ideal is essential to create demand, said Anette Wickström, a medical anthropologist at Linköping University in Sweden. “Sometimes we see the medical domain as something that is neutral, just fixing problems,” she said. “But at the same time, the medical domain is also enacting norms.” From measuring patients’ bites to communicating treatment goals, everyday orthodontic practices send a message that teeth should conform to a very narrow ideal—and anything less is abnormal. According to a 2015 survey published in the Journal of Clinical Pediatric Dentistry, 57 percent of families seek orthodontic care primarily to give their child straight teeth. The same study also found that nearly 85 percent of parents who opted for treatment for their children did so at least in part due to a dentist’s referral. Dentists don’t typically refer patients to the orthodontist to treat an existing medical condition. Instead, the assumption is that getting teeth straightened will prevent future ills, wrote Ackerman in an article for the Journal of Medical Ethics. For parents, this referral carries the implicit message that treatment is both “necessary and worthwhile” for their child’s health, wrote Bill Shaw, a professor of orthodontics and dentofacial development at the University of Manchester in the U.K., in an article published in the academic journal Seminars in Orthodontics. Shaw argued that a dentist’s referral to an orthodontist will initiate “a conveyor belt of entry into orthodontic treatment, with little or no reflection or discussion.” Similarly to Peter Vig, Alexander Spassov began his career under the assumption that orthodontic treatment improves oral health. When he was in dental school at the University of Greifswald, the evidence behind this assumption was never questioned. After completing his residency there, Spassov took a job as a clinical lecturer and researcher in the medical school. Immersed in an academic environment, he saw his colleagues in other disciplines spend each day combing through research literature. They were engaging in what’s widely known as evidence-based medicine. Developed about 30 years ago, this medical paradigm emphasizes the use of high-quality research in medical decision-making. (In recent years, some experts have moved away from the term, and there has been much disagreement about what it means.) Following the lead of his medical colleagues, Spassov delved into orthodontics research. When he found little to support the use of orthodontics as a preventative treatment for oral health, he was deeply troubled. In fact, he began to feel that the lack of evidence presented a “conflict with my professional and ethical principles.” While continuing to teach orthodontics, Spassov began talking with colleagues in the university’s history, bioethics, and philosophy departments, sharing his concerns about offering treatment with weak evidence. In 2014, they published an article on the subject, in a prestigious German medical ethics journal. They pointed out that according to some estimates, fewer than 5 percent of the population fit Angle’s criteria for ideal occlusion. (Others estimate this proportion could be as high as 25 to 50 percent.) They questioned the necessity of many procedures, arguing that treatment decisions are often based on incomplete information provided to the patient, with an overemphasis on questionable benefits. The article cited studies demonstrating that simply brushing and flossing had a greater impact on oral health than orthodontic treatment. Views like Spassov’s and Vig’s are outnumbered by orthodontists who say their treatments are medically useful. And as with Vig, some orthodontists suggested to Undark that Ackerman’s views are conflicted, given that he also has financial ties to a direct-to-consumer alternative to traditional orthodontics, which falls under the broader and controversial field of teledentistry. In an email, Ackerman insisted that his advocacy on these issues preceded his financial relationship to teledentistry by several years, with his earliest critiques of orthodontics dating as far back as 2004. Still, many orthodontists stand firm on the discipline’s medical benefits. “Dental health is definitely enhanced by orthodontic therapy, and I stand firm on that,” said Greco, who added that he has seen the positive effects of orthodontic treatment in his own practice. As long as orthodontists have received proper training and accreditation, Greco trusts them to make beneficial treatment decisions based on their knowledge and clinical experience. Greco supports evidence-based orthodontics in theory, but putting it into practice takes effort, he said. The gold standard for research on humans is the randomized controlled trial, an experiment in which one group gets a certain treatment—say, braces—and the other gets a placebo, a varied duration of the same treatment, or a different treatment. To eliminate bias, the groups are randomly assigned. At the end of the experiment, researchers compare the results for each group to see if the treatment really worked. According to Greco, these kinds of studies are uniquely difficult to conduct for orthodontic treatments. For one thing, it’s hard to gather a large enough pool of study subjects to generate meaningful results, and the variation among patients makes it hard to standardize the procedures. Together, these characteristics make it very difficult to conduct clinical trials where variables are controlled and treatment groups are randomly selected, Greco said. As a result, the majority of research simply compares people receiving orthodontic treatment and doesn’t control for other variables. Clinical experience is one component of evidence-based medicine, said Hujoel, but alone it’s not enough. Such experience shows that a patient can come into an orthodontic office with crooked teeth and walk out a few years later with a straight smile. But to assert that adjusting tooth positions has long-term health benefits? “That’s a huge claim to make without clinical trials,” Hujoel said. Some individual studies do suggest that people with crowded teeth are more likely to have dental problems. For example, a 2000 study found that patients with crowded teeth had more plaque and pathogenic bacteria. And a study published in 2017 found that among nearly 15,000 participants, people who hadn’t received orthodontic treatment were more likely to have a serious gum infection called periodontitis. But because neither study was randomized, it’s difficult to know if variables like socioeconomic class—a well-known factor in oral health—swayed the findings. Further, when looked at as a whole, the research paints a troubling picture. Scientists from the University of Washington School of Dentistry carefully selected 12 studies on orthodontics and dental health. The group’s research, published in 2008 in the Journal of the American Dental Association, found that the dental health of individuals who received orthodontic treatment actually worsened slightly over the long term. A more recent study published in the June 2020 issue of the American Journal of Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics analyzed seven studies on orthodontics and oral health. While that study didn’t find any evidence for worsened oral health, it came to a similar conclusion: The authors couldn’t find sufficient evidence in the scientific literature for the health benefits of orthodontic treatment. Treatments aside, it’s not even clear that malocclusion causes bad health outcomes. While some individual studies find risks associated with malocclusion—jaw pain, for example—analyses of the larger body of literature tend to come up short. The 2020 study published in the American Journal of Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics also analyzed 87 studies on the effects of malocclusion on oral health and didn’t find enough evidence to suggest that crooked teeth led to poor health outcomes. Of course, not everyone visits the orthodontist to prevent cavities. Many go because they hope straight teeth will improve their life, said Stephen Richmond, a professor of orthodontics at Cardiff University in Wales. And some evidence suggests that might be true—at least in children. In 2015, a team of orthodontists in the Netherlands analyzed the results of 40 studies and found that children with more crooked teeth tended to have a lower quality of life than those with straight teeth. However, the researchers didn’t take into account whether the studies controlled for socioeconomic status—a potentially powerful predictor of both quality of life and likelihood of receiving dental health care. According to some orthodontists, this lack of objective evidence of health benefits is cause for concern. After all, treatment places a financial burden on families and the health-care system, and it also poses some health risks. Even unlikely complications—from adverse reactions associated with surgical interventions to issues from the long-term effects of X-ray exposure—are bound to impact a small but measurable number of patients if enough people are treated, Hujoel said. And millions of kids receive orthodontic treatment each year. But others see things differently. “The cost-benefit [ratio] there is so low,” said Greco. “If you can readily correct a problem as a patient develops, you’d want to do that to give that patient every opportunity to develop normally—emotionally and mentally, physically.” The problem is not that individual orthodontists are intentionally misleading patients. The problem, Ackerman said, is cultural. Evidence just isn’t valued as highly in orthodontics as tradition and clinical experience. Although the American Dental Association Commission on Dental Accreditation requires an evidence-based curriculum, “It is largely paid lip service,” Ackerman wrote in an email. (The ADA did not respond to requests for comment.) Instead, his residency experience emphasized the classical practice of orthodontics. At one point during residency, Ackerman challenged his chair on a recommendation given to a patient. He still remembers the response he received: “Ackerman—Don’t confuse me with the facts, my mind is made up.” As a lecturer, Spassov was interested in incorporating a more critical discussion of evidence into his curriculum. However, he said that his colleagues dissuaded him. He says he was warned that incorporating evidence-based principles would confuse students. According to Spassov, it is easier and less confusing to just teach the same content each year. But that shouldn’t justify avoiding the topic entirely, he said. Diverging evidence is “at the core of science and research,” he wrote in an email to Undark. Orthodontists need to rethink how they communicate treatment needs with their patients, said Richmond. “Health professionals have to be careful what they say sometimes,” he said. “When they say, ‘You may have an issue,’ that gets stuck in your mind.” Ackerman agrees that patients deserve nuanced and accurate information. In 2007 and again in 2018, he challenged the American Association of Orthodontists about specific claims on its website: namely, that malocclusion can cause loss of teeth, speech impediment, and poor nutrition. When asked for evidence to support these assertions, the association dismissed the complaint with no real investigation, Ackerman said. Around a decade after his first complaint, it finally modified the website—and only slightly. Still, Vig said, it’s a step in the right direction. The website continues to list other risks of malocclusion without providing evidence. Fighting back against prevailing dogma with new evidence, said Vig, is wearying. In an ideal world, he said, those making a particular claim should carry the burden of proof. Instead, that burden currently falls on that minority of orthodontists willing to challenge the status quo—including Vig, Ackerman, and Spassov. Each time they publish a paper that risks painting the profession in a negative light, each time they demand evidence for a claim, they meet resistance, Vig said. “It makes us pariahs in our profession.”",Americans Are Spending Billions on Unnecessary Dental Treatments,8,0.39604985682742566
1767,"Warning signs of an ischemic stroke may be evident as early as seven days before an attack and require urgent treatment to prevent serious damage to the brain, according to a study of stroke patients published in the March 8, 2005 issue of Neurology, the scientific journal of the American Academy of Neurology. Eighty percent of strokes are ischemic, caused by the narrowing of the large or small arteries of the brain, or by clots that block blood flow to the brain. They are often preceded by a transient ischemic attack (TIA), a ""warning stroke"" or ""mini-stroke"" that shows symptoms similar to a stroke, typically lasts less than five minutes, and does not injure the brain. The study examined 2,416 people who had experienced an ischemic stroke. In 549 patients, TIAs were experienced prior to the ischemic stroke and in most cases occurred within the preceding seven days: 17 percent occurring on the day of the stroke, 9 percent on the previous day, and 43 percent at some point during the seven days prior to the stroke. ""We have known for some time that TIAs are often a precursor to a major stroke,"" said study author Peter M. Rothwell, MD, PhD, FRCP, of the Department of Clinical Neurology at Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford, England. ""What we haven't been able to determine is how urgently patients must be assessed following a TIA in order to receive the most effective preventive treatment. This study indicates that the timing of a TIA is critical, and the most effective treatments should be initiated within hours of a TIA in order to prevent a major attack."" Rothwell also noted that clinical guidelines should be amended accordingly. The study included two population-based studies (Oxford Vascular Study and Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project) as well as two randomized trials (UK-TIA Aspirin Trial and European Carotid Surgery Trial).",Stroke Warning Signs Often Occur Hours Or Days Before Attack,8,0.47131536536840735
1768,"Diets high in protein, particularly plant protein, are associated with a lower risk of death from any cause, finds an analysis of the latest evidence published by The BMJ today. The researchers say these findings ""support current dietary recommendations to increase consumption of plant proteins in the general population."" Diets high in protein, particularly protein from plants such as legumes (peas, beans and lentils), whole grains and nuts, have been linked to lower risks of developing diabetes, heart disease and stroke, while regular consumption of red meat and high intake of animal proteins have been linked to several health problems. But data on the association between different types of proteins and death are conflicting. So researchers based in Iran and the USA set out to measure the potential dose-response relation between intake of total, animal, and plant protein and the risk of death from all causes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. They reviewed the results of 32 studies that reported risk estimates for all cause, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality in adults aged 19 or older. All studies were thoroughly assessed for bias (problems in study design that can influence results). Mathematical models were then used to compare the effects of the highest versus lowest categories of protein intake, and analyses were done to evaluate the dose-response relations between protein intake and mortality. During a follow-up period of up to 32 years, 113,039 deaths (16,429 from cardiovascular disease and 22,303 from cancer) occurred among 715,128 participants. The results show that high intake of total protein was associated with a lower risk of all cause mortality compared with low intake. Intake of plant protein was associated with an 8% lower risk of all cause mortality and a 12% lower risk of cardiovascular disease mortality. Intake of animal protein was not significantly associated with risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer mortality. A dose-response analysis of data from 31 studies also showed that an additional 3% of energy from plant proteins a day was associated with a 5% lower risk of death from all causes. Possible reasons for the beneficial effects of plant proteins include their association with favourable changes in blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar levels, which might help to lower the risk of conditions such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes, say the researchers. They point to some limitations, such as differences in the way studies assessed diet and the possibility that some effects may have been due to unmeasured (confounding) factors. What's more, as most of the included studies were from Western nations, the findings may not be applicable to other countries. However, strengths include the large number of participants and deaths, providing a detailed insight into the association between intake of dietary protein and risk of mortality based on the current evidence, they write. ""These findings have important public health implications as intake of plant protein can be increased relatively easily by replacing animal protein and could have a large effect on longevity,"" say the researchers. While further studies are required, these findings ""strongly support the existing dietary recommendations to increase consumption of plant proteins in the general population,"" they conclude.","Diets high in protein, particularly plant protein, linked to lower risk of death",8,0.017110372858409884
1769,"Every doctor recommends regular aerobic exercise, since greater aerobic fitness is important for achieving better overall health. But Joslin Diabetes Center scientists now have discovered that some benefits of aerobic exercise may be dampened by higher-than-normal blood sugar levels, a condition known as hyperglycemia. These diminished gains are seen in mouse models and humans with chronic hyperglycemia that is in the ""prediabetes"" range, says Sarah Lessard, PhD, a Joslin assistant investigator in the section of Clinical, Behavioral and Outcomes Research and senior author on a paper in Nature Metabolism that presents the work. The study also showed that this maladaptive trait is independent of obesity and insulin levels in the blood. Clinical studies have demonstrated that people with diabetes or chronically high levels of blood sugar struggle to improve their aerobic exercise capacity compared to people with normal blood sugar levels. ""The idea behind this study was to see if we induce high blood sugar in mice, will we impair their ability to improve their aerobic fitness?"" says Lessard, who is an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. The study also aimed to uncover the mechanisms that may lead to low fitness levels in people with hyperglycemia. Her team used two mouse models that reflect the two major causes of hyperglycemia in humans. One group of mice consumed a Western diet, high in sugar and saturated fat, which caused some weight gain in addition to hyperglycemia. The other group was modified to produce less insulin, which caused similar increases in blood sugar as the Western diet, even though the mice ate a diet lower in sugar and fat, and maintained normal body weight. Both groups were subjected to a training protocol in which they ran in wheels in their cages to boost their aerobic fitness. In both hyperglycemic groups, animals ran around 500 kilometers over the course of the study but, on average, failed to improve their aerobic exercise capacity compared to mice with lower blood sugar levels, Lessard says. Looking in more detail at skeletal muscle in these mice, she and her colleagues saw that the muscle was not adapting to the aerobic challenge as muscle normally would. Muscle tissue can remodel itself, which is one reason why exercise becomes easier when we do it regularly, Lessard says. Over time, aerobic exercise such as running or swimming can alter muscle fibers to become more efficient at using oxygen during exercise. ""We also grow new blood vessels to allow more oxygen to be delivered to the muscle, which helps to increase our aerobic fitness levels,"" she says. The scientists propose that high levels of blood sugar may prevent muscle remodeling in part by modifying the ""extracellular matrix"" proteins in the space between the muscle cells, where blood vessels are formed. Earlier work by Lessard's lab had demonstrated that a biological pathway known as the ""JNK"" signaling pathway can act as a kind of molecular switch to tell muscle cells to adapt to either aerobic or strength training. The scientists found that these JNK pathway signals were getting crossed in the hyperglycemic mice, by activating pathways associated with strength training, even though the mice were performing aerobic exercise. ""As a result, the muscles of hyperglycemic animals have bigger fibers and fewer blood vessels, which is more typical of strength training, rather than aerobic training,"" Lessard says. Following up on these animal findings in clinical tests with young adult volunteers, the Joslin scientists found that those who had higher blood sugar levels in response to ingesting glucose, a condition known as impaired glucose tolerance, showed the lowest aerobic exercise capacity. ""Looking at how their muscles responded to a single bout of typical aerobic exercise, we also saw that those with the lowest glucose tolerance had the highest activation of the JNK signaling pathway, which blocks aerobic adaptations,"" she says. ""The good news is, although our mouse models of hyperglycemia failed to improve aerobic fitness with training, they still achieved other important health benefits from the exercise including decreased fat mass and improved glucose metabolism,"" Lessard says. ""So, regular aerobic exercise is still a key recommendation for maintaining health in people with or without hyperglycemia."" It is important to note that people with hyperglycemia also can benefit from other forms of exercise, such as strength training, which is recommended for maintaining health, she says. Overall, the study suggests several approaches that might help people with chronic hyperglycemia eventually overcome the obstacles to building aerobic capacity. One is to adopt a diet designed to keep blood sugar levels low. Another is to take existing diabetes drugs designed to keep blood sugar levels in normal ranges. ""We often think of diet and exercise as separate ways to improve our health,"" Lessard says. ""But our work shows that there is more interaction between these two lifestyle factors than what was previously known, and suggests that we may want to consider them together in order to maximize the health benefits of aerobic exercise.""

1770,"Researchers have investigated the function of a complex mesh of muscle fibers that line the inner surface of the heart. The study, published in the journal Nature, sheds light on questions asked by Leonardo da Vinci 500 years ago, and shows how the shape of these muscles impacts heart performance and heart failure. In humans, the heart is the first functional organ to develop and starts beating spontaneously only four weeks after conception. Early in development, the heart grows an intricate network of muscle fibers -- called trabeculae -- that form geometric patterns on the heart's inner surface. These are thought to help oxygenate the developing heart, but their function in adults has remained an unsolved puzzle since the 16th century. ""Our work significantly advanced our understanding of the importance of myocardial trabeculae,"" explains Hannah Meyer, a Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Fellow. ""Perhaps even more importantly, we also showed the value of a truly multidisciplinary team of researchers. Only the combination of genetics, clinical research, and bioengineering led us to discover the unexpected role of myocardial trabeculae in the function of the adult heart."" To understand the roles and development of trabeculae, an international team of researchers used artificial intelligence to analyse 25,000 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the heart, along with associated heart morphology and genetic data. The study reveals how trabeculae work and develop, and how their shape can influence heart disease. UK Biobank has made the study data openly available. Leonardo da Vinci was the first to sketch trabeculae and their snowflake-like fractal patterns in the 16th century. He speculated that they warm the blood as it flows through the heart, but their true importance has not been recognized until now. ""Our findings answer very old questions in basic human biology. As large-scale genetic analyses and artificial intelligence progress, we're rebooting our understanding of physiology to an unprecedented scale,"" says Ewan Birney, deputy director general of EMBL. The research suggests that the rough surface of the heart ventricles allows blood to flow more efficiently during each heartbeat, just like the dimples on a golf ball reduce air resistance and help the ball travel further. The study also highlights six regions in human DNA that affect how the fractal patterns in these muscle fibers develop. Intriguingly, the researchers found that two of these regions also regulate branching of nerve cells, suggesting a similar mechanism may be at work in the developing brain. The researchers discovered that the shape of trabeculae affects the performance of the heart, suggesting a potential link to heart disease. To confirm this, they analyzed genetic data from 50,000 patients and found that different fractal patterns in these muscle fibers affected the risk of developing heart failure. Nearly five million Americans suffer from congestive heart failure. Further research on trabeculae may help scientists better understand how common heart diseases develop and explore new approaches to treatment. ""Leonardo da Vinci sketched these intricate muscles inside the heart 500 years ago, and it's only now that we're beginning to understand how important they are to human health. This work offers an exciting new direction for research into heart failure,"" says Declan O'Regan, clinical scientist and consultant radiologist at the MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences.
